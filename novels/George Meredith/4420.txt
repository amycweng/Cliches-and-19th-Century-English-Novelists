this english generation knows them and at a season verging upon may the ladies of brookfield arabella cornelia and adela pole daughters of a flourishing cityoflondon merchant had been told of a singular thing that in the neighbouring firwood a voice was to be heard by night so wonderfully sweet and richly toned that it required their strong sense to correct strange imaginings concerning it adela was herself the chief witness to its unearthly sweetness and her testimony was confirmed by edward buxley whose ear had likewise taken in the notes though not on the same night as the pair publicly proved by dates both declared that the voice belonged to an operasinger or a spirit the ladies of brookfield declining the alternative perceived that this was a surprise furnished for their amusement by the latest celebrity of their circle mr pericles their fathers business ally and fellowspeculator mr pericles the greek the man who held millions of money as dust compared to a human voice fortified by this exquisite supposition their strong sense at once dismissed with scorn the idea of anything unearthly however divine being heard at night in the nineteenth century within sixteen miles of london city they agreed that mr pericles had hired some charming cantatrice to draw them into the woods and delightfully bewilder them it was to be expected of his princely nature they said the tinleys of bloxholme worshipped him for his wealth the ladies of brookfield assured their friends that the fact of his being a moneymaker was redeemed in their sight by his devotion to music music was now the art in the ascendant at brookfield the ladies for it is as well to know at once that they were not of that poor order of women who yield their admiration to a thing for its abstract virtue onlythe ladies were scaling society by the help of the arts to this laudable end sacrifices were now made to euterpe to assist them as mere daughters of a merchant they were compelled to make their house not simply attractive but enticing and seeing that they liked music it seemed a very agreeable device the tinleys of bloxholme still kept to dancing and had effectually driven away mr pericles from their gatherings for mr pericles said if that they will go so i will be amused he presented a toplike triangular appearance for one staggering second the tinleys did not go so at all and consequently they lost the satirical man and were called the balletdancers by adela which thorny scoff her sisters permitted to pass about for a single day and no more the tinleys were their match at epithets and any low contention of this kind obscured for them the social summit they hoped to attain the dream whereof was their prime nourishment that the tinleys really were their match they acknowledged upon the admission of the despicable nature of the game the tinleys had winged a dreadful shaft at them not in itself to be dreaded but that it struck a weak point it was a common shot that exploded a magazine and for a time it quite upset their social policy causing them to act like simple young ladies who feel things and resent them the ladies of brookfield had let it be known that in their privacy together they were pole polar and north pole pole polar and north pole were designations of the three shades of distance which they could convey in a bow a form of salute they cherished as peculiarly their own being a method they had invented to rebuke the intrusiveness of the outer world and hold away all strangers until approved worthy even friends had occasionally to submit to it in a softened form arabella the eldest and adela the youngest alternated pole and polar but north pole was shared by cornelia with none she was the fairest of the three a noblybuilt person her eyes not vacant of tenderness when she put off her armour in her warpanoply before unhappy strangers she was a britomart they bowed to an iceberg which replied to them with the freezing indifference of the floating colossus when the winter sun despatches a feeble greeting messengerbeam from his miserable arctic wallet the simile must be accepted in its might for no lesser one will express the scornfulness toward men displayed by this strikingly wellfavoured formal lady whose heart of hearts demanded for her as spouse a lord a philosopher and a christian in one and he must be a member of parliament hence her isolated air now when the ladies of brookfield heard that their pole polar and north pole the splendid image of themselves had been transformed by the tinleys and defiled by them to pole polony and maypole they should have laughed contemptuously but the terrible nerve of ridicule quivered in witness against them and was not to be stilled they could not understand why so coarse a thing should affect them it stuck in their flesh it gave them the idea that they saw their features hideous but real in a magnifying mirror there was therefore a feud between the tinleys and the poles and when mr pericles entirely gave up the former the latter rewarded him by spreading abroad every possible kind interpretation of his atrocious bad manners he was a greek of parisian gilding whose parisian hat flew off at a moments notice and whose savage snarl was heard at the slightest vexation his talk of renowned primedonne by their christian names and the way that he would catalogue emperors statesmen and noblemen known to him with familiar indifference as things below the musical art gave a distinguishing tone to brookfield from which his french accentuation of our tongue did not detract mr pericles grimaced bitterly at any claim to excellence being set up for the mysterious voice in the woods tapping one forefinger on the uplifted point of the other he observed that to sing abroad in the night air of an english spring month was conclusive of imbecility and that no imbecile sang at all because to sing involved the highest accomplishment of which the human spirit could boast did the ladies see he asked they thought they saw that he carried on a deception admirably in return they inquired whether he would come with them and hunt the voice saying that they would catch it for him i shall catch a cold for myself said mr pericles from the elevation of a shrug feeling that he was doomed to go forth he acted reluctance so well that the ladies affected a pretty imperiousness and when at last he consented to join the party they thanked him with a nicely simulated warmth believing that they had pleased him thoroughly their brother wilfrid was at brookfield six months earlier he had returned from india an invalided cornet of light cavalry with a reputation for military dash and the prospect of a medal then he was their heroic brother he was now their guard they love him tenderly and admired him when it was necessary but they had exhausted their own sensations concerning his deeds of arms and fancied that he had served their purpose and besides valour is not an intellectual quality they said they were ladies so aspiring these daughters of the merchant samuel bolton pole that if napoleon had been their brother their imaginations would have overtopped him after his six months inaction in the tuileries they would by that time have made a steppingstone of the emperor mounting was the title given to this proceeding they went on perpetually mounting it is still a good way from the head of the tallest of men to the stars so they had their work before them but as they observed they were young to be brief they were very ambitious damsels aiming at they knew not exactly what save that it was something so wide that it had not a name and so high in the air that no one could see it they knew assuredly that their circle did not please them so therefore they were constantly extending and refining it extending it perhaps for the purpose of refining it their susceptibilities demanded that they should escape from a city circle having no mother they ruled their fathers house and him and were at least commanders of whatsoever forces they could summon for the task it may be seen that they were sentimentalists that is to say they supposed that they enjoyed exclusive possession of the nice feelings and exclusively comprehended the fine shades whereof more will be said but in the meantime it will explain their propensity to mount it will account for their irritation at the material obstructions surrounding them and possibly the philosopher will now have his eye on the source of that extraordinary sense of superiority to mankind which was the crown of their complacent brows eclipsed as they may be in the gross appreciation of the world by other people who excel in this and that accomplishment persons that nourish nice feelings and are intimate with the fine shades carry their own test of intrinsic value nor let the philosopher venture hastily to despise them as pipers to dilettante life such persons come to us in the order of civilization in their way they help to civilize us sentimentalists are a perfectly natural growth of a fat soil wealthy communities must engender them if with attentive minds we mark the origin of classes we shall discern that the nice feelings and the fine shades play a principal part in our human development and social history i dare not say that civilized man is to be studied with the eye of a naturalist but my vulgar meaning might almost be twisted to convey that our sentimentalists are a variety owing their existence to a certain prolonged term of comfortable feeding the pig it will be retorted passes likewise through this training he does but in him it is not combined with an indigestion of high german romances here is so notable a difference that he cannot possibly be said to be of the family and i maintain it against him who have nevertheless listened attentively to the eulogies pronounced by the vendors of prize bacon after thus stating to you the vast pretensions of the ladies of brookfield it would be unfair to sketch their portraits nothing but comedy bordering on burlesque could issue from the contrast though they graced a drawingroom or a pew and had properly elegant habits and taste in dress and were all fair to the sight moreover adela had not long quitted school outwardly they were not unlike other young ladies with wits alert they were at the commencement of their labours on this night of the expedition when they were fated to meet something greatly confusing them chapter ii half of a rosy mounting full moon was on the verge of the east as the ladies with attendant cavaliers passed humming softly through the gardengates arabella had by right of birth made claim to mr pericles not without an unwontedly fretful remonstrance from cornelia who said my dear you must allow that i have some talent for drawing men out and arabella replied certainly dear you have and i think i have some too the gentle altercation lasted halfanhour but they got no farther than this mr pericles was either hopeless of protecting himself from such shrewd assailants or indifferent to their attacks for all his defensive measures were against the cold he was muffled in a superbly mounted bearskin which came up so closely about his ears that arabella had to repeat to him all her questions and as it were force a way for her voice through the hide this was provoking since it not only stemmed the natural flow of conversation but prevented her imagination from decorating the reminiscence of it subsequently which was her profound secret pleasure besides letting in the outer world upon her take it as an axiom when you utter a sentimentalism that more than one pair of ears makes a cynical critic a sentimentalism requires secresy i can enjoy it and shall treat it respectfully if you will confide it to me alone but i and my friends must laugh at it outright does there not seem a soul in the moonlight for instance arabella after a rapturous glance at the rosy orb put it to mr pericles in subdued impressive tones she had to repeat her phrase mr pericles then echoing with provoking monotony of tone solwhereupon soul was reiterated somewhat sharply and mr pericles peering over the collar of the bear with half an eye continued the sentence in the manner of one sent thereby farther from its meaning ze moonlight despairing and exasperated arabella commenced afresh i said there seems a soul in it and mr pericles assented bluntly in ze lightwhich sounded so little satisfactory that arabella explained i mean the aspect and having said three times distinctly what she meant in answer to a terrific glare from the unsubmerged whites of the eyes of mr pericles this was his comment almost roared forth sol you say sowholein ze moonlightluna hein ze aspect is of solyez and mr pericles sank into his bear again while wilfrid pole who was swinging his long cavalry legs to rearward shouted and mr sumner a rising young barrister walking beside cornelia smiled a smile of extreme rigidity arabella was punished for claiming rights of birth she heard the murmuring course of the dialogue between cornelia and mr sumner sufficiently clear to tell her it was not fictitious and was well sustained while her heart was kept thirsting for the key to it in advance were adela and edward buxley who was only a rich aldermans only son but had the virtue of an extraordinary power of drawing caricatures and was therefore useful in exaggerating the features of disagreeable people and showing how odious they were besides endearing pleasant ones exhibiting how comic they could be gossips averred that before mr pole had been worried by his daughters into giving that mighty sum for brookfield arabella had accepted edward as her suitor but for some reason or other he had apparently fallen from his high estate to tell the truth arabella conceived that he had simply obeyed her wishes while he knew he was naughtily following his own and adela without introspection at all was making her virgin effort at the caricaturing of our sex in his person an art for which she promised well out of the long black shadows of the solitary trees of the park and through low yellow moonlight they passed suddenly into the muffed ways of the wood mr pericles was ineffably provoking he had come for gallantrys sake and was not to be rallied and would echo every question in a roar and there was no drawing of the man out at all he knocked against branches and tripped over stumps and ejaculated with energy but though he gave no heed or help to his fair associate she thought not the worse of him so heroic can women be toward any creature that will permit himself to be clothed by a mystery at times the party hung still fancying the voice aloft and then after listening to the unrelieved stillness they laughed and trod the stiff dry ferns and soft mosses once more at last they came to a decided halt when the proposition to return caused adela to come up to mr pericles and say to him now you must confess you have prohibited her from singing tonight so that we may continue to be mystified i call this quite shameful of you and even as mr pericles was protesting that he was the most mystified of the company his neck lengthened and his head went round and his ear was turned to the sky while he breathed an elaborate ah and sure enough that was the voice of the woods cleaving the night air not distant a sleepy fire of early moonlight hung through the dusky firbranches the voice had the woods to itself and seemed to fill them and soar over them it was so full and rich so light and sweet and now to add to the marvel they heard a harp accompaniment the strings being faintly touched but with firm fingers a womans voice on that could be no dispute tell me what opens heaven more flamingly to heart and mind than the voice of a woman pouring clear accordant notes to the blue night sky that grows light blue to the moon there was no flourish in her singing all the notes were firm and rounded and sovereignly distinct she seemed to have caught the ear of night and sang confident of her charm it was a grand old italian air requiring severity of tone and power now into great mournful hollows the voice sank steadfastly one soft sweep of the strings succeeded a deep final note and the hearers breathed freely stradella said the greek folding his arms the ladies were too deeply impressed to pursue their play with him real emotions at once set aside the semicredence they had given to their own suggestions hush she will sing again whispered adela it is the most delicious contralto murmurs of objection to the voice being characterized at all by any technical word or even for a human quality were heard let me find zis woman cried the prose enthusiast mr pericles imperiously with his bearskin thrown back on his shoulders and forth they stepped following him in the middle of the wood there was a sandy mound rising half the height of the lesser firs bounded by a greengrown vallum where once an old woman hopelessly a witch had squatted and defied the authorities to make her budge nor could they accomplish the task before her witchsoul had taken wing in the form of a black nightbird often to be heard jarring above the spot lank dry weeds and nettles and great lumps of green and gray moss now stood on the poor old creatures place of habitation and the moon slanting through the firclumps was scattered on the blossoms of twisted orchardtrees gone wild again amid this desolation a dwarfed pine whose roots were partially bared as they grasped the broken bank that was its perch threw far out a cedarlike hand in the shadow of it sat the fair singer a musing touch of her harpstrings drew the intruders to the charmed circle though they could discern nothing save the glimmer of the instrument and one set of fingers caressing it how she viewed their rather impertinent advance toward her till they had ranged in a halfcircle nearer and nearer could not be guessed she did not seem abashed in any way for having preluded she threw herself into another song the charm was now more human though scarcely less powerful this was a different song from the last it was not the sculptured music of the old school but had the richness and fulness of passionate blood that marks the modern italian where there is much dallying with beauty in the thick of sweet anguish here at a certain passage of the song she gathered herself up and pitched a nervous note so shrewdly triumphing that as her voice sank to rest her hearers could not restrain a deep murmur of admiration then came an awkward moment the ladies did not wish to go and they were not justified in stopping they were anxious to speak and they could not choose the word to utter mr pericles relieved them by moving forward and doffing his hat at the same time begging excuse for the rudeness they were guilty of the fair singer answered with the quickness that showed a girl oh stay do stay if i please you a singular form of speech it was thought by the ladies she added i feel that i sing better when i have people to listen to me you find it more sympathetic do you not remarked cornelia i dont know responded the unknown with a very honest smile i like it she was evidently uneducated a professional whispered adela to arabella she wanted little invitation to exhibit her skill at all events for at a word the clear bold but finely nervous voice was pealing to a brisker measure that would have been joyous but for one fall it had coming unexpectedly without harshness and winding up the song in a ringing melancholy after a few bars had been sung mr pericles was seen tapping his forehead perplexedly the moment it ended he cried out in a tone of vexed apology for strange ignorance but i know not it it is italianyes i swear it is italian butwho then it is superbe but i know not it it is mine said the young person your music miss i mean i composed it permit me to say brava the ladies instantly petitioned to have it sung to them again and whether or not they thought more of it or less now that the authorship was known to them they were louder in their applause which seemed to make the little person very happy you are sure it pleases you she exclaimed they were very sure it pleased them somehow the ladies were growing gracious toward her from having previously felt too humble it may be she was girlish in her manner and not imposing in her figure she would be a sweet mystery to talk about they thought but she had ceased to be quite the same mystery to them i would go on singing to you she said i could sing all night long but my people at the farm will not keep supper for me when its late and i shall have to go hungry to bed if i wait have you far to go ventured adela only to wilsons farm about ten minutes walk through the wood she answered unhesitatingly arabella wished to know whether she came frequently to this lovely spot when it does not rain every evening was the reply you feel that the place inspires you said cornelia i am obliged to come she explained the good old dame at the farm is ill and she says that music all day is enough for her and i must come here or i should get no chance of playing at all at night but surely you feel an inspiration in the place do you not cornelia persisted she looked at this lady as if she had got a hard word given her to crack and muttered i feel it quite warm here and i do begin to love the place the stately cornelia fell back a step the moon was now a silver ball on the edge of the circle of grey blue above the ring of firs and by the light falling on the strange little person as she stood out of the shadow to muffle up her harp it could be seen that she was simply clad and that her bonnet was not of the newest fashion the sisters remarked a bootlace hanging loose the peculiar black lustre of her hair and thickness of her long black eyebrows struck them likewise her harp being now comfortably mantled cornet wilfrid pole who had been watching her and balancing repeatedly on his forward foot made a stride and really could not allow her to carry it herself and begged her permission that he might assist her its very heavy you know he added too heavy for me she said favouring him with a thankful smile i have some one who does that where is jim she called for jim and from the back of the sandy hillock where he had been reclining a broadshouldered rustic came lurching round to them now take my harp if you please and be as careful as possible of branches and dont stumble she uttered this as if she were giving jim his evening lesson and then with a sudden cry she laughed out oh but i havent played you your tune and you must have your tune forthwith she stript the harp half bare and throwing a propitiatory bright glance at her audience on the other side of her she commenced thrumming a kind of giles scroggins native british beerbegotten air while jim smeared his mouth and grinned as one who sees his love dragged into public view and is not the man to be ashamed of her though he hopes you will hardly put him to the trial this is his favourite tune that he taught me she emphasized to the company i play to him every night for a finish and then he takes care not to knock my poor harp to pieces and tumble about the gentlemen were amused by the giles scroggins air which she had delivered with a sufficient sense of its lumping fun and legforleg jollity and they laughed and applauded but the ladies were silent after the performance until the moment came to thank her for the entertainment she had afforded them and then they broke into gentle smiles and trusted they might have the pleasure of hearing her another night oh just as often and as much as you like she said and first held her hand to arabella next to cornelia and then to adela she seemed to be hesitating before the gentlemen and when wilfrid raised his hat she was put to some confusion and bowed rather awkwardly and retired good night miss called mr pericles good night sir she answered from a little distance and they could see that she was there emboldened to drop a proper curtsey in accompaniment then the ladies stood together and talked of her not with absolute enthusiasm for was it not divine said adela and cornelia asked her if she meant the last piece and oh gracious not that adela exclaimed and then it was discovered how their common observation had fastened on the bootlace and this vagrant article became the key to certain speculations on her condition and character i wish id had a dozen bouquets thats all cried wilfrid she deserved them has she sentiment for what she sings or is it only faculty cornelia put it to mr sumner that gentleman faintly defended the stranger for the intrusion of the bumpkin tune she did it so well he said i complain that she did it too well uttered cornelia whose use of emphasis customarily implied that the argument remained with her talking in this manner and leisurely marching homeward they were startled to hear mr pericles who had wrapped himself impenetrably in the bear burst from his cogitation suddenly to cry out in his harshest foreign accent yeaz and thereupon he threw open the folds and laid out a forefinger and delivered himself i am made my mind i send her abroad to ze academie for one two tree year she shall be instructed as was not before zen a noise at la scala noparis nolondon she shall astonish london fairstyez if i take a theatre yez if i buy a newspaper yez if i pay feeftysossand pound his singular outlandish vehemence and the sweeping grandeur of a determination that lightly assumed the corruptibility of our press sent a smile circling among the ladies and gentlemen the youth who had wished to throw the fair unknown a dozen bouquets caught himself frowning at this brilliant prospect for her which was to give him his opportunity chapter iii the next morning there were many tralas and tumteturns over the family breakfasttable a constant humming and crying i have it and after two or three bars baffled pauses and confusion of mind mr pericles was almost abusive at the impotent efforts of the sisters to revive in his memory that particular delicious melody the composition of the fair singer herself at last he grew so impatient as to arrest their opening notes and even to interrupt their unmusical consultations with no it is no use it is no use no no i say but instantly he would plunge his forehead into the palm of his hand and rub it red and work his eyebrows frightfully until tender humanity led the sisters to resume adelas im sure it began low downtum cornelias the keynote i am positive was b flatta and arabellas putting of these two assertions together and promise to combine them at the piano when breakfast was at an end though it was sunday morning were exasperating to the exquisite lover of music mr pericles was really suffering torments do you know what it is to pursue the sylph and touch her flying skirts think you have caught her and are sure of herthat she is yours the rapturous evanescent darling when some wellmeaning earthly wretch interposes and trips you and off she flies and leaves you floundering a lovely melody nearly grasped and lost in this fashion tries the temper apollo chasing daphne could have been barely polite to the woodnymphs in his path and mr pericles was rude to the daughters of his host smoothing his clean square chin and thick moustache hastily with outspread thumb and fingers he implored them to spare his nerves smiling rigidly he trusted they would be merciful to a sensitive ear mr polewho as an englishman could not understand anyone being so serious in the pursuit of a tunelaughed and asked questions and almost drove mr pericles mad on a sudden the greeks sallow visage lightened it is to you it is to you he cried stretching his finger at wilfrid the young officer having apparently waited till he had finished with his knife and fork was leaning his cheek on his fist looking at nobody and quietly humming a part of the air mr pericles complimented and thanked him but you have ear for music extraordinaire he said adela patted her brother fondly remarkingyes when his feelings are concerned will you repeat zat asked the greek totori hein i lose it totoru bah i lose it toritoruri ro it is no use i lose it neither his persuasions nor his sneer because it is sunday perhaps would induce wilfrid to be guilty of another attempt the ladies tried sisterly cajoleries on him fruitlessly until mr pole seeing the desperation of his guest said why not have her up here toon and all some weekday sunday birds wont suit us you know weve got a piano for her thats good enough for the first of em if money means anything the ladies murmured meekly yes papa i shall find her for you while you go to your charch said mr pericles and here wilfrid was seized with a yawn and rose and asked his eldest sister if she meant to attend the service that morning undoubtedly she answered and mr pole took it up thats our discipline my boy must set an example do our duty all the house goes to worship in the country why in ze country queried mr pericles becausecornelia came to the rescue of her sire but her impetuosity was either unsupported by a reason or she stooped to fit one to the comprehension of the interrogator oh becausedo you know we have very select music at our church we have a highlypaid organist added arabella recently elected said adela ah mon dieu mr pericles ejaculated some music sound well at afarmellow you say i prefer your charch music mellow wont you come cried wilfrid with wonderful briskness no mellow for me the greeks grinders flashed and wilfrid turned off from him sulkily he saw in fancy the robbergreek prowling about wilsons farm setting snares for the marvellous nightbird and it was with more than his customary inattention to his sisters refined conversation that he formed part of their male escort to the place of worship mr pericles met the churchgoers on their return in one of the green bowery lanes leading up to brookfield cold as he was to english scenes and sentiments his alien ideas were not unimpressed by the picture of those daintilyclad young women demurely stepping homeward while the air held a revel of skylarks and the scented hedgeways quickened with sunshine you have missed a treat arabella greeted him a sermon said he the ladies would not tell him until his complacent cynicism at the notion of his having missed a sermon spurred them to reveal that the organ had been handled in a masterly manner and that the voluntary played at the close of the service was most exquisite even papa was in raptures very good indeed said mr pole im no judge but you might listen to that sort of playing after dinner mr pericles seemed to think that was scarcely a critical period but he merely grimaced and inquired did you see ze player oh no they are hidden arabella explained to him behind a curtain but what shouted the impetuous greek have you no curiosity a woman and zen you saw not her no remarked cornelia in the same aggravating singsong voice of utter indifference we dont know whether it was not a man our usual organist is a man i believe the eyes of the greek whitened savagely and he relapsed into frigid politeness wilfrid was not present to point their apprehensions he had loitered behind but when he joined them in the house subsequently he was cheerful and had a look of triumph about him which made his sisters say so you have been with the copleys and he allowed them to suppose it if they pleased the copleys being young ladies of position in the neighbourhood of much higher standing than the tinleys who though very wealthy could not have given their brother such an air the sisters imagined at lunch wilfrid remarked carelessly by the way i met that little girl we saw last night the singer where asked his sisters with one voice coming out of church she goes to church then this exclamation showed the heathen they took her to be why she played the organ said wilfrid and how does she look by day how does she dress oh very jolly little woman dresses quiet enough she played the organ it was she then an organist is there anything approaching to gentility in her appearance ireally im no judge said wilfrid you had better ask laura tinley she was talking to her when i went up the sisters exchanged looks presently they stood together in consultation then they spoke with their aunt mrs lupin and went to their papa the rapacity of those tinleys for anything extraordinary was known to them but they would not have conceived that their own discovery their own treasure could have been caught up so quickly if the tinleys got possession of her the defection of mr pericles might be counted on and the display of a phenomenon would be lost to them they decided to go down to wilsons farm that very day and forestall their rivals by having her up to brookfield the idea of doing this had been in a corner of their minds all the morning it seemed now the most sensible plan in the world it was patronage in its right sense and they might be of great service to her by giving a proper elevation and tone to her genius while she might amuse them and their guests and be let off in fact as a firework for the nonce among the queenly cases of women who are designing to become the heads of a circle if i may use the term an accurate admeasurement of reciprocal advantages can scarcely be expected to rank but the knowledge that an act depending upon us for execution is capable of benefiting both sides will make the proceeding appear so unselfish that its wisdom is overlooked as well as its motives the sisters felt they were the patronesses of the little obscure genius whom they longed for to illumine their household before they knew her name cornet wilfrid pole must have chuckled mightily to see them depart on their mission these ladies who managed everybody had themselves been very cleverly managed it is doubtful whether the scheme to surprise and delight mr pericles would have actuated the step they took but for the dread of seeing the rapacious tinleys snatch up their lawful prey the tinleys were known to be quite capable of doing so they had on a particular occasion made transparent overtures to a celebrity belonging to the poles whom they had first met at brookfield could never have hoped to have seen had they not met him at brookfield and girls who behaved in this way would do anything the resolution was taken to steal a march on them nor did it seem at all odd to people naturally so hospitable as the denizens of brookfield that the stranger of yesterday should be the guest of today kindness of heart combined with a great scheme in the brain easily put aside conventional rules but we dont know her name they said when they had taken the advice of the gentlemen on what they had already decided to do all excepting mr pericles for whom the surprise was in store bellonimiss belloni said wilfrid are you sure how do you know she told laura tinley within five minutes of the receipt of this intelligence the ladies were on their way to wilsons farm chapter iv the circle which the ladies of brookfield were designing to establish just now was of this receiptcelebrities london residents and county notables all in their severally due proportions were to meet mix and revolve the celebrities to shine the metropolitans to act as satellites the county ignoramuses to feel flattered in knowing that all stood forth for their amusement they being the butts of the quickwitted metropolitans whom they despised while the sons of renown were encouraged to be conscious of their magnanimous superiority over both sets for whose entertainment they were ticketed this is a pudding indeed and the contemplation of the skill and energy required to get together and compound such a brookfield pudding wellnigh leads one to think the work that is done out of doors a very inferior business and as it were mere gathering of fuel for the fire inside it was known in the neighbourhood that the ladies were preparing one and moreover that they had a new kind of plum in other words that they intended to exhibit a prodigy of genius who would flow upon the world from brookfield to announce her with the invitations rejecting the idea of a surprise in the assembly had been necessary because there was no other way of securing lady gosstre who led the society of the district the great lady gave her promise to attend though as she said to arabella you must know i abominate musical parties and think them the most absurd of entertainments possible but if you have anything to show thats another matter two or three chosen friends were invited down beforehand to inspect the strange girl and say what they thought of her for the ladies themselves were perplexed they had found her to be commonplace a creature without ideas and with a decided appetite so when tracy runningbrook who had also been a plum in his day and was still a poet said that she was exquisitely comic they were induced to take the humorous view of the inexplicable side in the character of miss belloni and tried to laugh at her eccentricities seeing that mr pericles approved of her voice as a singer and tracy runningbrook let pass her behaviour as a girl they conceived that on the whole they were safe in sounding a trumpet loudly these gentlemen were connoisseurs each in his walk concerning her position and parentage nothing was known she had met adelas delicatelysearching touches in that direction with a marked reserve it was impossible to ask her pointblank after probing her with a dozen suggestions for the ingenuousness of an indifferent inquiry could not then be assumed so that adela was constantly baked and felt that she must some day be excessively fond with her which was annoying the girl lit up at any sign of affection a kind look gave summer depths to her dark eyes otherwise she maintained a simple discretion and walked in her own path content to look quietly pleased on everybody as one who had plenty to think of and a voice in her ear apparently she was not to be taught to understand limits which must be explained as a sort of magnetic submissiveness to the variations of polar caprice so that she should move about with ease be cheerful friendly and at a signal affectionate still not failing to recognize the particular nooks where the family chalk had traced a line as the day of exhibition approached adela thought she would give her a lesson in limits she ventured to bestow a small caress on the girl after a compliment thinking that the compliment would be a check but the compliment was passed and the caress instantly replied to with two arms and a tender mouth at which adela took fright and was glad to slip away at last the pudding flowed into the bag emilia was posted by the ladies in a corner of the room receiving her assurance that she was not hungry they felt satisfied that she wanted nothing wilfrid came up to her to console her for her loneliness until mr pericles had stationed himself at the back of her chair and then wilfrid nodded languidly and attended to his graver duties who would have imagined that she had hurt him but she certainly looked with greater animation on mr pericles and when tracy runningbrook sat down by her a perfect little carol of chatter sprang up between them these two presented such a noticeable contrast side by side that the ladies had to send a message to separate them she was perhaps a little the taller of the two with smoothed hair that had the gloss of black briony leaves and eyes like burning brands in a cave while tracys hair was red as blown flame with eyes of a greygreen hue that may be seen glistening over wet sunset people who knew him asked who is she and it was not in the design of the ladies to have her noted just yet lady gosstres exclamation on entering the room was presently heard well and wheres our extraordinary genius pray let me see her immediately thereat laura tinley with gross illbreeding rushed up to arabella who was receiving her ladyship and touching her arm as if privileges were permitted her cried im dying to see her has she come arabella embraced the offensive girl in a hostesss smile and talked flowingly to the great lady laura tinley was punished by being requested to lead off with a favourite song in a buzz she acceded quite aware of the honour intended and sat at the piano taming as much as possible her pantomime of one that would be audible lady gosstre scanned the room while adela following her ladyships eyeglass named the guests you get together a quaint set of men said lady gosstre women was on adelas tongues tip she had really thought well of her men her heart sank in the country she began yes yes went my lady these were the lessons that made the ladies of brookfield put a check upon youths tendency to feel delightful satisfaction with its immediate work and speedily conceive a discontented suspicion of anything whatsoever that served them two other sacrifices were offered at the piano after laura tinley poor victims of ambition they arranged their dresses smiled at the leaves and deliberately gave utterance to the dreadful nonsense of the laureates of our drawingrooms mr pericles and emilia exchanged scientific glances during the performance she was merciless to indifferent music wilfrid saw the glances pass so now when emilia was beckoned to the piano she passed by wilfrid and had a cold look in return for beaming eyes according to directions emilia sang a simple neapolitan air the singer was unknown and was generally taken for another sacrifice come thats rather pretty lady gosstre hailed the close it is of ze peoplesuch as zat assented mr pericles adela heard my lady ask for the singers name she made her way to her sisters adela was ordinarily the promoter cornelia the sifter and arabella the director of schemes in this management the ladies had a moment for counsel over a musicbook for arabella was about to do duty at the piano during a pause mr pole lifting his white waistcoat with the effort sent a word abroad loudly and heartily regardless of its guardian aspirate like a boldfaced hoyden flying from her chaperon they had dreaded it they loved their father but declined to think his grammar parental hushing together they agreed that it had been a false move to invite lady gosstre who did not care a bit for music until the success of their genius was assured by persons who did to suppose that she would recognize a genius failing a special introduction was absurd the ladies could turn upon aristocracy too when it suited them arabella had now to go through a quartett the fever of illluck had seized the violin he would not tune then his string broke and while he was arranging it the footman came up to arabella misfortunes we know are the most united family on earth the news brought to her was that a lady of the name of mrs chump was below holding her features rigidly bound not to betray perturbation arabella confided the fact to cornelia who with a similar mental and muscular compression said instantly manoeuvre her adela remarked if you tell her the company is grand she will come and her irish once heard here will destroy us the very name of chump mrs chump was the wealthy irish widow of an alderman whose unaccountable bad taste in going to ireland for a wife yet filled the ladies with astonishment she pretended to be in difficulties with her lawyers for which reason she strove to be perpetually in consultation with her old flame and present trustee mr pole the ladies had fought against her in london and since their installation at brookfield they had announced to their father that she was not to be endured there mr pole had plaintively attempted to dilate on the virtues of martha chump in her place said the ladies and illustrated to him that amid a nosegay of flowers there was no fit room for an exuberant vegetable the old man had sighed and seemed to surrender one thing was certain mrs chump had never been seen at brookfield she never shall be save by the servants said the ladies emilia not unmarked of mr pericles had gone over to wilfrid once or twice to ask him if haply he disapproved of anything she had done mr pericles shrugged and went ah as who should say this must be stopped adela now came to her and caught her hand showering sweet whispers on her and bidding her go to her harp and do her best we love you we all love you was her parting instigation the quartett was abandoned arabella had departed with a firm countenance to combat mrs chump emilia sat by her harp the saloon was critically still so still that adela fancied she heard a faint irish protest from the parlour wilfrid was perhaps the most critical auditor present for he doubted whether she could renew that singular charm of her singing in the pale lighted woods the first smooth contralto notes took him captive he scarcely believed that this could be the raw girl whom his sisters delicately pitied a murmur of plaudits the low thunder of gathering acclamation went round lady gosstre looked a satisfied this will do wilfrid saw emilias eyes appeal hopefully to mr pericles the connoisseur shrugged a pain lodged visibly on her black eyebrows she gripped her harp and her eyelids appeared to quiver as she took the notes again and still singing she turned her head to him the eyes of mr pericles were white as if upraised to intercede for her with the powers of harmony her voice grew unnerved on a sudden she excited herself to pitch and give volume to that note which had been the enchantment of the night in the woods it quavered one might have thought her caught by the throat emilia gazed at no one now she rose without a word or an apology keeping her eyes down fiasco cruelly cried mr pericles that was better to her than the silly kindness of the people who deemed it well to encourage her with applause emilia could not bear the clapping of hands and fled chapter v the night was warm under a slowlyfloating moon full of compassion for the poor girl who had moved him if she had failed in winning the assembly wilfrid stepped into the garden where he expected to find her and to be the first to pet and console her threading the scented shrubs he came upon a turn in one of the alleys from which point he had a view of her figure as she stood near a portugal laurel on the lawn mr pericles was by her side wilfrids intention was to join them a loud sob from emilia checked his foot you are cruel he heard her say if it is good i tell it you if it is bad abominable i tell it you juste ze same responded mr pericles the others did not think it very bad ah bah mr pericles cut her short had they been talking of matters secret and too sweet wilfrid would have retired like a man of honour as it was he continued to listen the tears of his poor little friend moreover seemed to hold him there in the hope that he might afford some help yes i do not care for the others she resumed you praised me the night i first saw you it is perhaps zat you can sing to z moon returned mr pericles but what a singer she must sing in a house tonight it is warm tomorrow it is cold if you sing through a cold what noise do we hear it is a nose not a voice it is a trompet emilia with a whimpering firmness replied you said i am lazy i am not not lazy mr pericles assented do i care for praise from people who do not understand music it is not true i only like to please them be a streetorgan mr pericles retorted i must like to see them pleased when i sing said emilia desperately and you like ze clap of ze hands yez it is quite natural yess you are a good child it is clear but look you are a voice uncultivated sauvage you go wrong i hear you and dese claps of zese noodels send you into squeaks and shrills and false false away you go it is a gallop ze wrong way here mr pericles attempted the most horrible reproduction of emilias failure she cried out as if she had been bitten what am i to do she asked sadly not now mr pericles answered you live in londonat where must i tell you certainly you must tell me but i am not going there i mean not yet you are going to sing to z moon through z nose yez for how long these ladies have asked me to stay with them they make me so happy when i leave themthen emilia sighed and zen quoth mr pericles then while my money lasts i shall stay in the country how much money how much money have i emilia frankly and accurately summed up the condition of her treasury four pounds and nineteen shillings hom it is spent and you go to your father again yes to ze old belloni my father no cried mr pericles upon emilias melancholy utterance he bent to her ear and rapidly spoke in an undertone what seemed to be a vivid sketch of a new course of fortune for her emilia gave one joyful outcry and now wilfrid retreated questioning within himself whether he should have remained so long but as he argued if he was convinced that the rascally greek fellow meant mischief to her was he not bound to employ every stratagem to be her safeguard the influence of mr pericles already exercised over her was immense and mysterious within ten minutes she was singing triumphantly indoors wilfrid could hear that her voice was firm and assured she was singing the song of the woods he found to his surprise that his heart dropped under some burden as if he had no longer force to sustain it byandby some of the members of the company issued forth carriages were heard on the gravel and young men in couples preparing to light the ensign of happy release from the ladies or of indemnification for their absence if you please strolled about the grounds did you see that little passage between laura tinley and bella pole said one and forthwith mimicked them laura commencingwe must have her over to us i fear we have preengaged heroh but you dear will do us the favour to come too i fear dear our immediate engagements will preclude the possibilitysurely dear miss pole we may hope that you have not abandoned usthat my dear miss tinley is out of the questionmay we not name a dayif it depends upon us frankly we cannot bid you do so the other joined him in laughter adding frankly s capital what absurd creatures women are how the deuce did you manage to remember it all my sister was at my elbow she repeated it word for word pon my honour women are wonderful creatures the two young men continued their remarks with a sense of perfect consistency lady gosstre as she was being conducted to her carriage had pronounced aloud that emilia was decidedly worth hearing shes better worth knowing said tracy runningbrook i see you are all bent on spoiling her if you were to sit and talk with her you would perceive that shes meant for more than to make a machine of her throat what a throat it is she has the most comical notion of things i fancy im looking at the budding of my own brain shes a born artist but im afraid everybodys conspiring to ruin her surely said adela we shall not do that if we encourage her in her art he means another kind of art said lady gosstre the term artist applied to our sex signifies frenchwoman with him he does not allow us to be anything but women as artists then we are largely privileged i assure you are we placed under a professor to learn the art adela inquired pleased with the subject under such high patronage each new experience is your accomplished professor said tracy one ill call cleopatra a professor shes but an illustrious example imp you are corrupt with which my lady tapped farewell on his shoulder leaning from the carriage window she said i suppose i shall see you at richford merthyr powys is coming this week and that reminds me he would be the man to appreciate your born artist bring her to me we will have a dinner i will despatch a formal invitation tomorrow the seasons bad out of town for getting decent people to meet you i will do my best she bowed to adela and tracy mr pole who had hovered around the unfamiliar dialogue to attend the great lady to the door here came in for a recognition and bowed obsequiously to the back of the carriage arabella did not tell her sisters what weapons she had employed to effect the rout of mrs chump she gravely remarked that the woman had consented to go and her sisters thanked her they were mystified by lauras nonrecognition of emilia and only suspected wilfrid so faintly that they were able to think they did not suspect him at all on the whole the evening had been a success it justified the ladies in repeating a wellknown brookfield phrase we may be wrong in many things but never in our judgement of the merits of any given person in the case of tracy runningbrook they had furnished a signal instance of their discernment him they had met at the house of a friend of the tinleys a colonels wife distantly connected with great houses the tinleys laughed at his flaming head and him but the ladies of brookfield had ears and eyes for a certain tone and style about him before they learnt that he was of the blood of dukes and would be a famous poet when this was mentioned after his departure they had made him theirs and the tinleys had no chance through tracy they achieved their introduction to lady gosstre and now they were to dine with her they did not say that this was through emilia in fact they felt a little that they had this evening been a sort of background to their prodigy which was not in the design having observed she sang deliciously they dismissed her and referred to dresses gaucheries of members of the company pretensions here and there lady gosstres walk the way to shuffle men and women how to start themes for them to converse upon and so forth not juno and her court surveying our mortal requirements in divine independence of fatigue could have been more considerate for the shortcomings of humanity and while they were legislating this and that for others they still accepted hints for their own improvement as those who have perfection in view may do lady gosstres carriage of her shoulders and general manner were admitted to be worthy of study and did you notice when laura tinley interrupted her conversation with tracy runningbrook how quietly she replied to the fact and nothing else so that laura had not another wordand did you observe her deference to papa as hostand did you not see on more than one occasion with what consummate ease she would turn a current of dialogue when it had gone far enough they had all noticed seen and observed they agreed that there was a quality beyond art beyond genius beyond any special cleverness and that was the great social quality of taking as by nature without assumption a queenly position in a circle and making harmony of all the instruments to be found in it high praise of lady gosstre ensued the ladies of brookfield allowed themselves to bow to her with the greater humility owing to the secret sense they nursed of overtopping her still in that ineffable something which they alone possessed a casket little people will be wise in not hurrying our father time to open for them if they would continue to enjoy the jewel they suppose it to contain finally these energetic young ladies said their prayers by the morning twitter of the birds and went to their beds less from a desire for rest than because custom demanded it three days later emilia was a resident in the house receiving lessons in demeanour from cornelia and in horsemanship from wilfrid she expressed no gratitude for kindnesses or wonder at the change in her fortune save that pleasure sat like an inextinguishable light on her face a splendid new harp arrived one day ticketed for miss emilia belloni he does not know i have a second christian name was her first remark after an examination of the instrument he quoth adela may it not have been a ladys gift emilia clearly thought not and to whom do you ascribe it who sent it to me mr pericles of course she touched the strings immediately and sighed are you discontented with the tone child asked adela no iill guess what it cost surely the ladies had reason to think her commonplace she explained herself better to wilfrid when he returned to brookfield after a short absence showing the harp see what mr pericles thinks me worth she said not more than that was his gallant rejoinder does it suit you yes in every way this was all she said about it in the morning after breakfast she sat at harp or piano and then ran out to gather wild flowers and learn the names of trees and birds on almost all occasions wilfrid was her companion he laughed at the little sisterly revelations the ladies confided concerning her too heartily for them to have any fear that she was other than a toy to him few women are aware with how much ease sentimental men can laugh outwardly at what is internal torment they had apprised him of their wish to know what her origin was and of her peculiar reserve on that topic whereat he assured them that she would have no secrets from him his conduct of affairs was so open that none could have supposed the gallant cornet entangled in a maze of sentiment for veritably this girl was the last sort of girl to please his fancy and he saw not a little of fair ladies by virtue of his heroic antecedents he was himself well seen of them the gallant cornet adored delicacy and a gilded refinement the female flower could not be too exquisitely cultivated to satisfy him and here he was running after a little unformed girl who had no care to conceal the fact that she was an animal nor any notion of the necessity for doing so he had good reason to laugh when his sisters talked of her it was not a pleasant note which came from the gallant cornet then but in the meadows or kindly conducting emilias horse he yielded pretty music emilia wore arabellas ridinghabit adelas hat and cornelias gloves politic as the ladies of brookfield were they were full of natural kindness and wilfrid albeit a diplomatist was not yet mature enough to control and guide a very sentimental heart there was an element of dim imagination in all the family and it was this that consciously elevated them over the world in prospect and made them unconsciously subject to what i must call the spell of the poetic power wilfrid in his soul wished that emilia should date from the day she had entered brookfield but at times it seemed to him that a knowledge of her antecedents might relieve him from his ridiculous perplexity of feeling besides though her voice struck emotion she herself was unimpressionable cold by nature he said looking at the unkindled fire she shook hands like a boy if her fingers were touched and retained they continued to be fingers for as long as you pleased murmurs and whispers passed by her like the breeze she appeared also to have no enthusiasm for her art so that not even there could wilfrid find common ground italy however he discovered to be the subject that made her light up of italy he would speak frequently and with much simulated fervour mr pericles is going to take me there said emilia he told me to keep it secret i have no secrets from my friends i am to learn in the academy at milan would you not rather let me take you not quite she shook her head no because you do not understand music as he does and are you as rich i cost a great deal of money even for eating alone but you will be glad when you hear me when i come back do you hear that nightingale it must be a nightingale she listened what things he makes us feel bending her head she walked on silently wilfrid he knew not why had got a sudden hunger for all the days of her life he caught her hand and drawing her to a garden seat said come now tell me all about yourself before i knew you do you mind ill tell you anything you want to hear said emilia he enjoined her to begin from the beginning everything about myself she asked everything i have your permission to smoke emilia smiled i wish i had some italian cigars to give you my father sometimes has plenty given to him wilfrid did not contemplate his havannah with less favour now said emilia taking a last sniff of the flowers before surrendering her nostril to the invading smoke she looked at the scene fronting her under a blue sky with slow flocks of clouds how i like this she exclaimed i almost forget that i long for italy here beyond a plot of flowers a goldgreen meadow dipped to a ridge of gorse bordered by dark firs and the tips of greenest larches chapter vi my father is one of the most wonderful men in the whole world wilfrid lifted an eyelid he is one of the firstviolins at the italian opera the gallant cornets critical appreciation of this impressive announcement was expressed in a spiral ebullition of smoke from his mouth he is such a proud man and i dont wonder at that he has reason to be proud again wilfrid lifted an eyelid and there is no knowing but that ideas of a connection with foreign counts cardinals and princes passed hopefully through him would you believe that he is really the own nephew of andronizetti deuce he is said wilfrid in a mist which one the composer wilfrid emitted more smoke who composedhow i love himthat lovely la la la la and the tede tada tedio that pleases you out of il maladetto and i am descended from him let me hope i shall not be unworthy of him you will never tell it till people think as much of me or nearly my father says i shall never be so great because i am half english its not my fault my mother was english but i feel that i am much more italian than english how i long for italylike a thing underground my father did something against the austrians when he was a young man would not i have done it i am sure i wouldi dont know what whenever i think of italy night or day pantpant goes my heart the name of italy is my nightingale i feel that somebody lives that i love and is illtreated shamefully crying out to me for help my father had to run away to save his life he was fifteen days lying in the ricefields to escape from the soldierswhich makes me hate a white coat there was my father and at night he used to steal out to one of the villages where was a good true womanso they are most in italy she gave him food maizebread and wine sometimes meat sometimes a bottle of good wine when my father thinks of it he cries if there is gin smelling near him at last my father had to stop there day and night then that good womans daughter came to him to keep him from starving she risked being stripped naked and beaten with rods to keep my father from starving when my father speaks of sandra now it makes my mothershe does not like it i am named after her emilia alessandra belloni sandra is short for it she did not know why i was christened that and will never call me anything but emilia though my father says sandra always my father never speaks of that dear sandra herself except when he is tipsy once i used to wish him to be tipsy for then i used to sit at my piano while he talked and i made all his words go into music one night i did it so well my father jumped right up from his chair shouting italia and he caught his wig off his head and threw it into the fire and rushed out into the street quite bald and people thought him mad it was the beginning of all our misfortunes my father was taken and locked up in a place as a tipsy man that he has never forgiven the english for it has made me and my mother miserable ever since my mother is sure it is all since that night do you know i remember though i was so young that i felt the musicoh like a devil in my bosom perhaps it was and it passed out of me into him do you think it was wilfrid answered well no i shouldnt think you had anything to do with the devil indeed he was beginning to think her one of the smallest of frocked female essences i lost my piano through it she went on i could not practise i was the most miserable creature in all the world till i fell in love with my harp my father would not play to get money he sat in his chair and only spoke to ask about mealtime and we had no money for food except by selling everything we had then my piano went so then i said to my mother i will advertize to give lessons as other people do and make money for us all myself so we paid money for a brassplate and our landladys kind son put it up on the door for nothing and we waited for pupils to come i used to pray to the virgin that she would blessedly send me pupils for my poor mothers complaints were so shrill and out of tune its impossible to tell you what i suffered but byandby my father saw the brassplate he fell into one of his dreadful passions we had to buy him another wig his passions were so expensive my mother used to say there goes our poor dinner out of the window but well he went to get employment now he can always when he pleases for such a touch on the violin as my father has you never heard you feel yourself from top to toe when my father plays i feel as if i breathed music like air one day came news from italy all in the newspaper of my fathers friends and old companions shot and murdered by the austrians he read it in the evening after we had a quiet day i thought he did not mind it much for he read it out to us quite quietly and then he made me sit on his knee and read it out i cried with rage and he called to me sandra peace and began walking up and down the room while my mother got the bread and cheese and spread it on the table for we were beginning to be richer i saw my father take out his violin he put it on the cloth and looked at it then he took it up and laid his chin on it like a man full of love and drew the bow across just once he whirled away the bow and knocked down our candle and in the darkness i heard something snap and break with a hollow sound when i could see he had broken it the neck from the bodythe dear old violin i could cry still ii was too late to save it i saw it broken and the empty belly and the loose strings it was murdering a spiritthat was my father sat in a corner one whole week moping like such an old man i was nearly dead with my mothers voice byandby we were all silent for there was nothing to eat so i said to my mother i will earn money my mother cried i proposed to take a lodging for myself all by myself go there in the morning and return at night and give lessons and get money for them my landladys good son gave me the brassplate again emilia alessandra belloni i was glad to see my name i got two pupils very quickly one an old lady and one a young one the old ladyi mean she was not greywanted a gentleman to marry her and the landlady told mei mean my pupilit makes me laughasked him what he thought of her voice for i had been singing i earned a great deal of money two pounds ten shillings a week i could afford to pay for lessons myself i thought what an expense i had to pay ten shillings for one lesson some have to pay twenty but i would pay it to learn from the best mastersand i had to make my father and mother live on potatoes and myself too of course if you buy potatoes carefully they are extremely cheap things to live upon and make you forget your hunger more than anything else i suppose added emilia you have never lived upon potatoes entirely oh no wilfrid gave a quiet negative but i was pining to learn and was obliged to keep them low i could pitch any notes and i was clear but i was always ornamenting and what i want is to be an accurate singer my musicmaster was a germannot an austrianoh noim sure he was not at least i dont think so for i liked him he was harsh with me but sometimes he did stretch his fingers on my head and turn it round and say words that i pretended not to think of though they sent me home burning i began to compose and this gentleman tore up the whole sheet in a rage when i showed it him but he gave me a dinner and left off charging me ten shillingsonly seven and then fiveand he gave me more time than he gave others he also did something which i dont know yet whether i can thank him for he made me know the music of the great german i used to listen i could not believe such music could come from a german he followed me about telling me i was his slave for some time i could not sleep i laughed at myself for composing he was not an austrian but when he was alive he lived in vienna the capital of austria he ate austrian bread and why god gave him such a soul of music i never can thinkwell byandby my father wanted to know what i did in the day and why they never had anything but potatoes for dinner my mother came to me and i told her to say i took walks my father said i was an idle girl and like my motherwho was a slave to work people are often unjust so my father said he would watch me i had to cross the park to give a lesson to a lady who had a husband and she wanted to sing to him to keep him at home in the evening i used to pray he might not have much ear for music one day a gentleman came behind me in the park he showed me a handkerchief and asked me if it was mine i felt for my own and found it in my pocket he was certain i had dropped it he looked in the corners for the name i told him my nameemilia alessandra belloni he found afg there it was a beautiful cambric handkerchief white and smooth i told him it must be a gentlemans as it was so large but he said he had picked it up close by me and he could not take it and i must and i was obliged to keep it though i would much rather not near the end of the park he left me at this point wilfrid roused up you met him the next day near the same place he remarked she turned to him with astonishment on her features how did you know that how could you know sort of thing that generally happens said wilfrid yes he was there emilia slowly pursued controlling her inclination to question further he had forgotten about the handkerchief for when i saw him i fancied he might have found the owner we talked together he told me he was in the army and i spoke of my fathers playing and my singing he was so fond of music that i promised him he should hear us both he used to examine my hand and said they were sensitive fingers for playing i knew that he had great hopes of me he said he would give me a box at the opera now and then i was mad with joy and so delighted to have made a friend i had never before made a rich friend i sang to him in the park his eyes looked beautiful with pleasure i know i enchanted him how old were you then inquired wilfrid sixteen i can sing better now i know but i had voice then and he felt that i had i forgot where we were till people stood round us and he hurried me away from them and said i must sing to him in some quiet place i promised to and he promised he would have dinner for me at richmond hill in the country and he would bring friends to hear me go on said wilfrid rather sharply she sighed i only saw him once after that it was such a miserable day it rained it was saturday i did not expect to find him in the rain but there he stood exactly where he had given me the handkerchief he smiled kindly as i came up i dislike gloomy people his face was always fresh and nice his moustache reminded me of italy i used to think of him under a great warm sky with olives and vinetrees and mulberries like my father used to speak of i could have flung my arms about his neck did you the cornet gave a strangled note oh no said emilia seriously but i told him how happy the thought of going into the country made me and that it was almost like going to italy he told me he would take me to italy if i liked i could have knelt at his feet unfortunately his friends could not come still i was to go and dine and float on the water plucking flowers i determined to fancy myself in venice which is the place my husband must take me to when i am married to him i will give him my whole body and soul for his love when i am there here the cornet was capable of articulate music for a moment but it resolved itself into well well yes go on i took his arm this time it gave me my first timid feeling that i remember and he laughed at me and drove it quite away telling me his name augustus frederick what was it augustus frederickit began with g something o me have i really forgotten christian names are always easier to remember a captain he wasa riding one just like you i think you are all kind extremely muttered the ironical cornet afgthose are the initials on the handkerchief they are cried emilia it must have been his own handkerchief you have achieved the discovery quoth wilfrid he dropped it there overnight and found it just as you were passing in the morning that must be impossible said emilia and dismissed the subject forthwith in a feminine power of resolve to be blind to it i am afraid she took up her narrative my father is sometimes really almost mad he does such things i had walked under this gentlemans umbrella to the bridge between the park and the gardens with the sheep and beautiful flowers in beds in an instant my father came up right in our faces he caught hold of my left hand i thought he wanted to shake it for he imitates english ways at times even with us at home and shakes our hands when he comes in but he swung me round he stood looking angrily at this gentleman and cried yes yes to every word he spoke the gentleman bowed to me and asked me to take his umbrella but i was afraid to and my father came to meoh madonna think of what he did i saw that his pockets were very big he snatched out potatoes and began throwing them as hard as he could throw them at the gentleman and struck him with some of them he threw nine large potatoes i begged him to think of our dinner but he cried yes it is our dinner we give to your head vagabond in his english i could not help running up to the gentleman to beg for his pardon he told me not to cry and put some potatoes he had been picking up all into my hand they were muddy but he wiped them first and he said it was not the first time he had stood fire and then said goodbye and i slipped the potatoes into my pocket immediately thankful that they were not wasted my father pulled me away roughly from the laughing and staring people on the bridge but i knew the potatoes were only bruised even three potatoes will prevent you from starving they were very fine ones for i always took care to buy them good when i reached home wilfrid had risen and was yawning with a desperate grimace he bade her continue and pitched back heavily into his seat when i reached home and could be alone with my mother she told me my father had been out watching me the day before and that he had filled his pockets that morning she thought he was going to walk out in the country and get people on the road to cook them for him that is what he has done when he was miserableto make himself quite miserable i think for he loves streets best guess my surprise my mother was making my head ache with her complaints when as i drew out the potatoes to show her we had some food there was a purse at the bottom of my pocketa beautiful green purse o that kind gentleman he must have put it in my hand with the potatoes that my father flung at him how i have cried to think that i may never sing to him my best to please him my mother and i opened the purse eagerly it had ten pounds in paper money and five sovereigns and silveri think four shillings we determined to keep it a secret and then we thought of the best way of spending it and decided not to spend it all but to keep some for when we wanted it dreadfully and for a lesson or two for me now and then and a musicscore and perhaps a good violin for my father and new strings for him and me and meat dinners now and then and perhaps a day in the country for that was always one of my dreams as i watched the clouds flying over london they seemed to be always coming from happy places and going to happy places never stopping where i was i cannot be sorrowful long you know that song of mine that you like so muchmy own composing it was a song about that kind gentleman i got words to suit it as well as i could from a penny paper but they dont mean anything that i mean and they are only words she did not appear to hear the gallant cornets denial that he cared particularly for that song what i meant wasthat gentleman speaksi have fought for italy i am an english hero and have fought for italy because of an italian child but now i am wounded and a prisoner when you shoot me cruel austrians i shall hear her voice and think of nothing else so you cannot hurt me emilia turned spitefully on herself at this close how i spoil it my words are always stupid when i feelwell now my mother and i were quite peaceful and my father was better fed one night he brought home a jew gentleman beautifully dressed with diamonds all over him he sparkled like the christmas cakes in pastrycooks windows i sang to him and he made quite a noise about me but the man made me so uncomfortable touching my shoulders and i could not bear his hands even when he was praising me i sang to him till the landlady made me leave off because of the other lodgers who wanted to sleep he came every evening and then said i should sing at a concert it turned out to be a publichouse and my father would not let me go but i was sorry for in public the man could not touch me as he did it damped the voice i should like to know where that fellow lives cried the cornet i dont know im sure she said he lends money do you want any i heard your sisters say something one day you can always have all that i have you know a quick spirit of pity and honest kindness went through wilfrids veins and threatened to play the woman with his eyes for a moment he took her hand and pressed it she put her lips to his fingers once she continued when the jew gentleman had left i spoke to my father of his way with me and then my father took me on his knee and the things he told me of what that man felt for me made my mother come and tear me away to bed i was obliged to submit to the jew gentleman patting and touching me always he used to crush my dreams afterwards i know my voice was going my father was so eager for me to please him i did my best but i felt dull and used to sit and shake my head at my harp crying or else i felt like an angry animal and could have torn the strings think how astonished i was when my mother came to me to say my father had money in his pocketsone pound seventeen shillings she counted and he had not been playing then he brought home a new violin and he said to me i shall go i shall play i am orphee and dinners shall rise i was glad and kissed him and he said this is sandras gift to me showing the violin i only knew what that meant two days afterwards is a girl not seventeen fit to be married with this abrupt and singular question she had taken an indignant figure and her eyes were fiery so that wilfrid thought her much fitter than a minute before married she exclaimed my mother told me about that you do not belong to yourself you are tied down you are a slave a drudge mustnt dream mustnt think i hate it byandby i suppose it will happen not yet and yet that man offered to take me to italy it was the jew gentleman he said i should make money if he took me and grow as rich as princesses he brought a friend to hear me another jew gentleman and he was delighted and he met me near our door the very next morning and offered me a ring with blue stones and he proposed to marry me also and take me to italy if i would give up his friend and choose him instead this man did not touch me and do you know for some time i really thought i almost very nearly mightif it had not been for his face it was impossible to go to italyyes to go to heaven through that face of his that face of his was just like the pictures of dancing men with animals hairy legs and hoofs in an old thick poetry book belonging to my mother just fancy a nose that seemed to be pecking at great fat red lips he met me and pressed me to go continually till all of a sudden up came the first jew gentleman and he cried out quite loud in the street that he was being robbed by the other and they stood and made a noise in the street and i ran away but then i heard that my father had borrowed money from the one who came first and that his violin came from that man and my father told me the violin would be taken from him and he would have to go to prison if i did not marry that man i went and cried in my mothers arms i shall never forget her kindness for though she could never see anybody crying without crying herself she did not and was quiet as a mouse because she knew how her voice hurt me theres a large printshop in one of the great streets of london with coloured views of italy i used to go there once and stand there for i dont know how long looking at them and trying to get those jew gentlemen call them jewstheyre not gentlemen interposed wilfrid jews she obeyed the dictate out of my mind when i saw the views of italy they danced and grinned up and down the pictures oh horrible there was no singing for me then my music died at last that oldish lady gave up her lessons and said to me you little rogue you will do what i do some day for she was going to be married to that young man who thought her voice so much improved and she paid me three pounds and gave me one pound more and some ribbons and gloves i went at once to my mother and made her give me five pounds out of the gentlemans purse i took my harp and musicscores i did not know where i was going but only that i could not stop my mother cried but she helped to pack my things if she disobeys me i act my father and tower over her and frown and make her mild she was such a poor good slave to me that day but i trusted her no farther than the door there i kissed her full of love and reached the railway they asked me where i was going and named places to me i did not know one i shut my eyes and prayed to be directed and chose hillford in the train i was full of music in a moment there i met farmer wilson of the farm near uswhere your sisters found me and he was kind and asked me about myself and i mentioned lodgings and that i longed for woods and meadows just as we were getting out of the train he said i was to come with him and i did very gladly then i met you and i am here all because i prayed to be directedi do think that emilia clasped her hands and looked pensively at the horizon sky with a face of calm gratefulness the cornet was on his legs so he said and you never saw anything more of that fellow you kissed in the park kissedthat gentleman returned emilia i have not kissed him he did not want it men kiss us when we are happy and we kiss them when they are unhappy wilfrid was perhaps incompetent to test the truth of this profound aphoristic remark delivered with the simplicity of natural conviction the narrative had to his thinking quite released from him his temporary subjection to this little ladys sway all that he felt for her personally now was pity it speaks something for the strength of the sentiment with which he had first conceived her that it was not pelted to death and turned to infinite disgust by her potatoes for sentiment is a dainty delicate thing incapable of bearing much revengeful too when it is outraged bruised and disfigured it stood up still and fought against them they were very fine ones as emilia said and they hit him hard however he pitied her and that protected him like a shield he told his sisters a tale of his own concerning the strange damsel humorously enough to make them see that he enjoyed her presence as that of no common oddity chapter vii while emilia was giving wilfrid her history in the garden the ladies of brookfield were holding consultation over a matter which was well calculated to perplex and irritate them excessively mr pole had received a curious short epistle from mrs chump informing him of the atrocious treatment she had met with at the hands of his daughter and instead of reviewing the orthography incoherence and deliberate vulgarity of the said piece of writing with the contempt it deserved he had taken the unwonted course of telling arabella that she had done a thing she must necessarily repent of or in any case make apology for an eastern queen thus addressed by her minister of the treasury could not have felt greater indignation arabella had never seen her father show such perturbation of mind he spoke violently and imperiously the apology was ordered to be despatched by that nights post after having been submitted to his inspection mr pole had uttered mysterious phrases you dont know what youve been doingyou think the shipll go on sailing without wind youll drive the horse till he drops and such like together with mutterings the words were of no import whatsoever to the ladies they were writings on the wall untranslateable but as when the earth quakes our noble edifices totter their palace of the fine shades and the nice feelings groaned and creaked and for a moment they thought where are we very soon they concluded that the speech arabella had heard was due to their darling papas defective education in the council of three with reference to the letter of apology to mrs chump adela proposed if it pleased arabella to fight the battle of the republic she was young and wished both to fight and to lead as arabella knew she was checked it must be left to me said arabella of course you resist dear cornelia carelessly questioned assuredly i do better humiliation better anything better marriage than to submit in such a case cried adela for so united were the ladies of brookfield and so bent on their grand hazy object that they looked upon married life unfavourably and they had besides an idea that wedlock until late in life the age of thirty say was the burial alive of woman intellectual toward midday the ladies put on their garden hats and went into the grounds together for no particular purpose near the west copse they beheld mr pole with wilfrid and emilia talking to a strange gentleman assuming a proper dignity they advanced when to their horror emilia ran up to them crying this is mr purcell barrett the gentleman who plays the organ at church i met him in the woods before i knew you i played for him the other sunday and i want you to know him she had hold of arabellas hand and was drawing her on there was no opportunity for retreat wilfrid looked as if he had already swallowed the dose almost precipitated into the arms of the ladies mr barrett bowed he was a tolerably youthful man as decently attired as old black cloth could help him to be a sharp inspection satisfied the ladies that his hat and boots were inoffensive whereupon they gave him the three shades of distance tempered so as not to wound his susceptible poverty the superlative polar degree appeared to invigorate mr barrett he devoted his remarks mainly to cornelia and cheerfully received her frozen monosyllables in exchange the ladies talked of organs and art emilia and opera he knew this and that great organ and all the operas but he amazed the ladies by talking as if he knew great people likewise this brought out mr pole who since he had purchased brookfield had been extinguished by them and had not once thoroughly enjoyed his moneys worth a courtly poor man was a real pleasure to him giving a semicircular sweep of his arm here you see my little estate sir he said youve seen plenty bigger in germany and england too we cant get more than this handful in our tight little island unless born to it of course well we must be grateful that all our nobility dont go to the dogs we must preserve our great names i speak against my own interest he lifted adelas chin on his forefinger she kept her eyes demurely downward and then gazed at her sisters with gravity these ladies took a view of mr barrett his features wore an admirable expression of simple interest well sir suppose you dine with us today mr pole bounced out neighbours should be neighbourly this abrupt invitation was decorously accepted plain dinner you know nothing like what you get at the tables of those erzhogs as you call em over in germany simple fare sound wine at all events it wont hurt you youll come mr barrett bowed murmuring thanks this was the very man mr pole wanted to have at his board occasionally one who had known great people and would be thankful for a dinner he could depreciate himself as a mere wealthy british merchant imposingly before such a man his daughters had completely cut him off from his cronies and the sense of restriction and compression and that his own house was fast becoming alien territory to him made him pounce upon the gentlemanly organist his daughters wondered why he should in the presence of this stranger exaggerate his peculiar style of speech but the worthy merchants consciousness of his identity was vanishing under the iron social rule of the ladies his perishing individuality prompted the inexplicable invitation and the form of it after mr barrett had departed the ladies ventured to remonstrate with their papa he at once replied by asking whether the letter to mrs chump had been written and hearing that it had not he desired that arabella should go into the house and compose it straightway the ladies coloured to adelas astonishment she found that arabella had turned joining her she said dearest what a moment you have lost we could have stood firm continually changing the theme from chump to barrett barrett to chump till papas head would have twirled he would have begun to think mr barrett the irish widow and mrs chump the organist arabella rejoined your wit misleads you darling i know what i am about i decline a wordy contest to approach to a quarrel or say dispute with ones parent apropos of such a person is something worse than evil policy dont you think so strongly did the sisters admire this delicate way of masking a piece of rank cowardice that they forgave her the craven feeling was common to them all which made it still more difficult to forgive her of course we resist said cornelia undoubtedly we retire and retire adela remarked we waste the royal forces but dear me that makes us insurgents she laughed being slightly frivolous her elders had the proper sentimental worship of youth and its supposed quality of innocence and caressed her at the ringing of the second dinnerbell mr pole ran to the foot of the stairs and shouted for arabella who returned no answer and was late in her appearance at table grace concluded mr pole said letter gone i wanted to see it you know it was as well not papa arabella replied mr pole shook his head seriously the ladies were thankful for the presence of mr barrett and lo this man was in perfect evening uniform he looked as gentlemanly a visitor as one might wish to see there was no trace of the poor organist poverty seemed rather a goldedge to his tailcoat than a rebuke to it just as contrariwise great wealth is to the imagination really set off by a careless costume one need not explain how the mind acts in such cases the fact as i have put it is indisputable and let the young men of our generation mark the present chapter that they may know the virtue residing in a tailcoat and cling to it whether buffeted by the waves or burnt out by the fire of evil angry fortune his tailcoat safe the youthful briton is always ready for any change in the mind of the moody goddess and it is an almost certain thing that presuming her to have a damsel of condition in view for him as a compensation for the slaps he has received he must lose her he cannot enter a mutual path with her if he shall have failed to retain this article of a black tail his social passport i mean of course that he retain respect for the article in question respect for it firmly seated in his mind the tail may be said to be always handy it is fortunes uniform in britain the candlestick if i may dare to say so to the candle nor need any young islander despair of getting to himself her best gifts while he has her uniform at command as glossy as may be the ladies of brookfield were really stormed by mr barretts elegant tail when the first glass of wine nodded over mr pole continued the discourse of the morning with allusions to french cooks and his cook their sympathies were taken captive by mr barretts tact the door to their sympathies having been opened to him as it were by his attire they could not guess what necessity urged mr pole to assert his lockedup self so vehemently but it certainly made the stranger shine with a beautiful mild lustre their spirits partly succumbed to him by a process too lengthened to explain here indeed i dare do no more than hint at these mysteries of feminine emotion i beg you to believe that when we are dealing with that wonder the human heart female the part played by a tailcoat and a composed demeanour is not insignificant no doubt the ladies of brookfield would have rebutted the idea of a tailcoat influencing them in any way as monstrous but why was it when mr pole again harped on his cook in almost similar words that they were drawn to meet the eyes of the stranger on whom they printed one of the most fabulously faint fleeting looks imaginable with a proportionately big meaning for him that might read it it must have been that this uniform of a tail had laid a basis of equality for the hour otherwise they never would have done so nor would he have enjoyed the chance of showing them that he could respond to the remotest mystic indications with a muffled adroitness equal to their own and so encouraged them to commence a language leading to intimacy with a rapidity that may well appear magical to the uninitiated in short the man really had the language of the very elect of polite society if you are not versed in this alphabet of mute intelligence you are in the ranks with waiters and linendrapers and are as far as ladies are concerned tailcoated to no purpose mr poles fresh allusion to his cook i hope you dont think i keep a man no no not in the country wouldnt do plays the deuce you know my opinion is mrs mallows as clever as any mancook going id back her and mr barretts speech she is an excellent person delivered briefly with no obtrusion of weariness confirmed the triumph of the latter a triumph all the greater that he seemed unconscious of it they leaped at one bound to the conclusion that there was a romance attached to him do not be startled an attested tailcoat clearly out of its element must contain a story that story must be interesting until its secret is divulged the subtle essence of it spreads an aureole around the tail the ladies declared in their subsequent midnight conference that mr barrett was fit for any society they had visions of a great family reduced of a proud son choosing to earn his bread honourably and humbly by turning an exquisite taste to account many visions of him they had and were pleased patronage of those beneath much more than the courting of those above them delighted the ladies of brookfield they allowed emilia to give mr barrett invitations and he became a frequent visitor always neat pathetically wellbrushed and a pleasanter pet than emilia because he never shocked their niceties he was an excellent talker and was very soon engaged in regular contests with the argumentative cornelia their political views were not always the same as cornelia sometimes had read the paper before he arrived happily on questions of religion they coincided theories of education occupied them mainly in these contests mr barrett did not fail to acknowledge his errors when convicted and his acknowledgment was hearty and ample she had many clear triumphs still he could be positive a very great charm in him women cannot repose on a man who is not positive nor have they much gratification in confounding him wouldst thou man amorously inclining attract to thee superior women be positive be stupidly positive rather than dubious at all face fearful questions with a vizor of brass array thyself in dogmas show thy decisive judgement on the side of established power or thy enthusiasm in the rebel ranks if it must be so but be firm waver not if women could tolerate waverings and weakness and did not rush to the adoration of decision of mind we should not behold them turning contemptuously from philosophers in their agony to find refuge in the arms of smirking orthodoxy i do not say that mr barrett ventured to play the intelligent cornelia like a fish but such a fish was best secured by the method he adopted that of giving her signal victory in trifles while on vital matters he held his own very pleasant evenings now passed at brookfield which were not at all disturbed by the wonder expressed from time to time by mr pole that he had not heard from martha meaning mrs chump you have emilia the ladies said this being equivalent to she is one of that sort and mr pole understood it so and fastened emilia in one arm with now a kiss my dear and then a toon emilia readily gave both as often as he heard instances of her want of ladylike training he would say keep her here well better her mr barrett assisted the ladies to see that there was more in emilia than even mr pericles had perceived her story had become partially known to them and with two friendly dependents of the household one a gentleman and the other a genius they felt that they had really attained a certain eminence which is a thing to be felt only when we have something under our feet flying about with a desperate grip on the extreme skirts of aristocracy the ladies knew to be the elevation of dependency not true eminence and though they admired the kite they by no means wished to form a part of its tail they had brains a circle was what they wanted and they had not to learn that this is to be found or made only in the liberallyeducated class into the atmosphere of which they pressed like dungeoned plants the parasite completes the animal and a dependent assures us of our position the ladies of brookfield therefore let emilia cling to them remarking that it seemed to be their papas settled wish that she should reside among them for a time consequently if the indulgence had ever to be regretted they would not be to blame in their hearts they were aware that it was emilia who had obtained for them their first invitation to lady gosstres gratitude was not a part of their policy but when it assisted a recognition of material facts they did not repress it and if they said we can succeed in polishing her and toning her she may have something to thank us for in the event of her ultimately making a name that event being of course necessary for the development of so proper a sentiment thus the rides with wilfrid continued and the sweet quiet evenings when she sang chapter viii the windows of brookfield were thrown open to the air of may and bees wandered into the rooms gold spots of sunshine danced along the floors the gardenwalks were dazzling and the ladies went from flowerbed to flowerbed in broad garden hats that were as an occasional light glance flung at a windowpane assured adela becoming sunshine had burst on them suddenly and there was no hat to be found for emilia so wilfrid placed his goldlaced foragingcap on her head and the ladies after a moments misgiving allowed her to wear it and turned to observe her now and then there was never pertness in emilias look which on the contrary was singularly large and calm when it reposed perhaps her dramatic instinct prompted her halfjaunty manner of leaning against the sunny corner of the house where the chinese honeysuckle climbed she was talking to wilfrid her laughter seemed careless and easy and in keeping with the southern litheness of her attitude to suit the cap its all to suit the cap said adela the keen of eye yet critical as was this lady she acknowledged that it was no mere acting effort to suit the cap the philosopher i would keep him back if i could bids us mark that the crown and flower of the nervous system the head is necessarily sensitive and to that degree that whatsoever we place on it does for a certain period change and shape us of course the instant we call up the forces of the brain much of the impression departs but what remains is powerful and finenerved woman is especially subject to it a girl may put on her brothers boots and they will not affect her spirit strongly but as soon as she puts on her brothers hat she gives him a manly nod the same philosopher who fathers his dulness on me asserts that the modern vice or fastness trotting on the epicene border he has it is bred by apparently harmless practices of this description he offers to turn the current of a republicans brain by resting a coronet on his forehead for just five seconds howsoever these things be it was true that emilias feet presently crossed and she was soon to be seen with her right elbow doubled against her head as she leaned to the wall and the little left fist stuck at her belt and i maintain that she had no sense at all of acting spanish prince disguised as page nor had she an idea that she was making her friend wilfrids heart perform to her lightest words and actions like any trained milkwhite steed in a circus sunlight as well as wilfrids braided cap had some magical influence on her he assured her that she looked a charming boy and she said do i just lifting her chin a gardener was shaving the lawn please spare those daisies cried emilia why do you cut away daisies the gardener objected that he really must make the lawn smooth emilia called to adela who came and hearing the case said now this is nice of you i like you to love daisies and wish to protect them they disfigure a lawn you know and adela stooped and picked one and called it a pet name and dropped it she returned to her sisters in the conservatory and meeting mr barren at the door made the incident a topic you know how greatly our emilia rejoices us when she shows sentiment and our thirst is to direct her to appreciate nature in its humility as well as its grandeur one expects her to have all poetical feelings said mr barrett while they walked forth to the lawn sloping to the tufted park grass cornelia said you have read mr runningbrooks story yes but the man had not brought it back and her name was in it written with her own hand are you of my opinion in the matter in the matter of the style i am and i am not your condemnation may be correct in itself but you say he coins words and he certainly forces the phrase here and there i must admit the point to be considered is whether friction demands a perfectly smooth surface undoubtedly a scientific work does and a philosophical treatise should when we ask for facts simply we feel the intrusion of a style of fiction it is part in the one case the classical robe in the other any mediaeval phantasy of clothing yes true said cornelia hesitating over her argument well i must conclude that i am not imaginative on the contrary permit me to say that you are but your imagination is unpractised and asks to be fed with a spoon we english are more imaginative than most nations then why is it not manifested we are still fighting against the puritan element in literature as elsewhere your old bugbear mr barrett and more than this our language is not rich in subtleties for prose a writer who is not servile and has insight must coin from his own mint in poetry we are rich enough but in prose also we owe everything to the licence our poets have taken in the teeth of critics shall i give you examples it is not necessary our simplest prose style is nearer to poetry with us for this reason that the poets have made it read french poetry with the first couplet the sails are full and you have left the shores of prose far behind mr runningbrook coins words and risks expressions because an imaginative englishman pen in hand is the cadet and vagabond of the familyan exploring adventurer whereas to a frenchman it all comes inherited like a well filled purse the audacity of the french mind and the french habit of quick social intercourse have made them nationally far richer in language let me add individually as much poorer read their stereotyped descriptions they all say the same things they have one big gallic trumpet wonderfully eloquent we feel that but the person does not speak and now you will be surprised to learn that notwithstanding what i have said i should still side with mr runningbrooks fair critic rather than with him the reason is that the necessity to write as he does is so great that a strong barriera chevauxdefrise of pen pointsmust be raised against every newly minted word and hazardous coiner or we shall be inundated if he can leap the barrier he and his goods must be admitted so it has been with our greatest so it must be with the rest of them or we shall have a transatlantic literature by no means desirable i think yet see when a piece of transatlantic slang happens to be tellingly truesomething coined from an absolute experience from a fight with the elementswe cannot resist it it invades us in the same way poetic rashness of the right quality enriches the language i would make it prove its quality cornelia walked on gravely his excuse for dilating on the theme prompted her to say you give me new views while all her reflections sounded from the depths and yet the man who talks thus is a hired organplayer this recurring thought more than the cogency of the new views kept her from combating certain fallacies in them which had struck her why do you not write yourself mr barrett i have not the habit the habit i have not heard the call should it not come from within and how are we to know it if it calls to you loudly then i know it to be vanity but the wish to make a name is not vanity the wish to conceal a name may exist cornelia took one of those little sly glances at his features which print them on the brain the melancholy of his words threw a somber hue about him and she began to think with mournfulness of those firm thin lips fronting misfortune those sunken blue eyes under its shadow they walked up to mr pole who was standing with wilfrid and emilia on the lawn giving ear to a noise in the distance a big drum sounded on the confines of the brookfield estate soon it was seen entering the precincts at one of the principal gates followed by trombone and horn and fife in the rear trooped a regiment of sundaygarmented villagers with a rambling tail of looseminded boys and girls blue and yellow ribands dangled from broad beaver hats and there were rosettes of the trueblue mingled with yellow at buttonholes and there was fun on the line of march jokes plumped deep into the ribs and were answered with intelligent vivacity in the shape of hearty thwacks delivered wherever a surface was favourable a mode of repartee worthy of general adoption inasmuch as it can be passed on and so with certainty made to strike your neighbour as forcibly as yourself of which felicity of propagation verbal wit cannot always boast in the line of procession the hat of a member of the corps shot sheer into the sky from the compressed energy of his brain for he and all his comrades vociferously denied having cast it up and no other solution was possible this mysterious incident may tell you that beer was thus early in the morning abroad in fact it was the procession day of a provincial clubfeast or celebration of the nuptials of beef and beer whereof later you shall behold the illustrious offspring all the brookfield household were now upon the lawn awaiting the attack mr pole would have liked to impound the impouring host drum and all for the audacity of the trespass and then to have fed them liberally as a return for the compliment aware that he was being treated to the honours of a great man of the neighbourhood he determined to take it cheerfully come no laughing he said directing a glance at the maids who were ranged behind their mistresses hem we must look pleased we mustnt mind their music if they mean well emilia whose face was dismally screwed up at the nervesearching discord said why do they try to play anything but a drum in the country in the country mr pole emphasized we put up with this kind of thing in the country different in town but weasay nothing in the country we must encourage respect for the gentry in the country one of the penalties of a country life not much harm in it new duties in the country he continued to speak to himself in proportion as he grew aware of the unnecessary nervous agitation into which the drum was throwing him he assumed an air of repose and said to wilfrid read the paper today and to arabella quiet family dinner i suppose yes sir he remarked to mr barrett as if resuming an old conversation i dare say youve seen better marching in foreign parts rightleft rightleft ha ha and not so bad not so bad i call it with their rightleft rightleft ha ha youve seen better no need to tell me that but in england we look to the meaning of things were a practical people whats more were volunteers volunteers in everything we cant make a regiment of ploughmen march like clockwork in a minute and we dont want to but give me the choice ill back a body of volunteers any day i would rather be backed by them sir said mr barrett very good i mean that honest intelligent industry backing rank and wealth that makes a nation strong look at england mr barrett observed him stand out largely as if filled by the spirit of the big drum that instrument now gave a final flourish and bang whereat sound as if knocked on the head died languishingly and behold a spokesman was seen in relief upon a background of grins that were oddly intermixed with countenances of extraordinary solemnity the same commenced his propitiatory remarks by assuring the proprietor of brookfield that he the spokesman and every man present knew they had taken a liberty in coming upon squire poles grounds without leave or warning they knew likewise that squire pole excused them chorus of shouts from the divining brethren right glad they were to have such a gentleman as squire pole among them and if nobody gave him a welcome last year that was not the fault of the yellowandblues eh my boys groans and cheers right sure was spokesman that squire pole was the friend of the poor man and liked nothing better than to see him enjoy his holiday as why shouldnt he enjoy his holiday now and then and have a bit of relaxation as well as other men acquiescent token on the part of the new dignitary squire pole spokesman was hereby encouraged to put it boldly whether a man was not a man all the world over for a that was sung out by some rare bookworm to rearward but no scot being present no frenzy followed the quotation it was announced that the club had come to do homage to squire pole and ladies the junction club of ipley and hillford what did junction mean junction meant harmony harmonious they were to be sure so they joined to good purpose mr barrett sought emilias eyes smilingly but she was intent on the proceedings a cry of bundle o sticks tom breeks dont let slip bout bundle o sticks pulled spokesman up short he turned hurriedly to say all right and inflated his chest to do justice to the illustration of the faggots of aesop but mr tom breeks had either taken in too much air or the ale that had hitherto successfully prompted him was antipathetic to the nice delicacy of an apologue for now his arm began to work and his forehead had to be mopped and he lashed the words union and harmony right and left until coming on a sentence that sounded in his ears like the close of his speech he stared ahead with a dim idea that he had missed a point bundle o sticks lustily shouted revived his apprehension but the sole effect was to make him look on the ground and lift his hat on the point of a perplexed finger he could not conceive how the bundle of sticks was to be brought in now or what to say concerning them union and harmonywhat more could be said mr tom breeks tried a remonstrance with his backers he declared to them that he had finished and had brought in the bundle they replied that they had not heard it that the bundle was the foundationsentiment of the club the first toast after the crown and that he must go on until the bundle had been brought in hereat the unhappy man faced squire pole again it was too abject a position for an englishman to endure tom breeks cast his hat to earth im dashed if i can bring in the bundle there was no telling how conduct like this might have been received by the yellowandblues if mr barrett had not spoken you mean everything when you say union and youre quite right not to be tautological you cant give such a blow with your fingers as you can with your fists can you up went a score of fists weve the fists weve the fists was shouted cornelia smiling on mr barrett asked him why he had confused the poor people with the long word tautological i threw it as a bone said he i think you will observe that they are already quieter they are reflecting on what it signifies and will byandby quarrel as to the spelling of it at any rate it occupies them cornelia laughed inwardly and marked with pain that his own humour gave him no merriment at the subsiding of the echoes that coupled squire pole and the junction club together squire pole replied he wished them well he was glad to see them and sorry he had not ale enough on the premises to regale every man of them clubs were great institutions one fist was stronger than a thousand fingersas my friend here said just now hereat the eyelids of cornelia shed another queenly smile on the happy originator of the remark squire pole then descended to business he named the amount of his donation at this practical sign of his support heaven heard the gratitude of the good fellows the drum awoke from its torpor and summoned its brethren of the band to give their various versions of the national anthem cant they be stopped emilia murmured clenching her little hands the patriotic melody delivered in sturdy democratic fashion had to be endured it died hard but did come to an end piecemeal tom breeks then retired from the front and became a unit once more there were flourishes that indicated a termination of the proceedings when another fellow was propelled in advance and he shuffling and ducking his head to the cries of out wi it jim and wheres your stomach came still further forward and showed a most obsequious grin why its jim exclaimed emilia on whom jims eyes were fastened stepping nearer she said do you want to speak to me jim had this to say which divested of his petition for pardon on the strength of his perfect knowledge that he took a liberty was that the young lady had promised while staying at wilsons farm that she would sing to the clubfellows on the night of their feast i towld em theyd have a rare treat miss mumbled jim and theyre all right mad for t that they bebaint ye boys that they were with not a few of the gesticulations of madness too emilia said i promised i would sing to them i remember it quite well of course i will keep my promise a tumult of acclamation welcomed her words and jim looked immensely delighted she was informed by several voices that they were the yellowandblues and not the blues that she must not go to the wrong set and that their booth was on ipley common and that they the junction club only would honour her rightly for the honour she was going to do them all of which emilia said she would bear in mind jim then retired hastily having done something that stout morning ale would alone have qualified him to perform the drum in the noble belief that it was leading announced the return march and with three cheers for squire pole and a crowning one for the ladies away trooped the procession chapter ix hardly had the last sound of the drum passed out of hearing when the elastic thunder of a fresh one claimed attention the truth being that the junction club of ipley and hillford whose colours were yellow and blue was a seceder from the oldestablished hillford club on which it had this day shamefully stolen a march by parading everywhere in the place of it and disputing not only its pasturegrounds but its identity there is no instrument the sound of which proclaims such a vast internal satisfaction as the drum i know not whether it be that the sense we have of the corpulency of this instrument predisposes us to imagine it supremely content as when an alderman is heard snoring the world is assured that it listens to the voice of its own exceeding gratulation a light heart in a fat body ravishes not only the world but the philosopher if monotonous the one note of the drum is very correct like the speaking of great nature what it means is implied by the measure when the drum beats to the measure of a common human pulsation it has a conquering power inspiring us neither to dance nor to trail the members but to march as life does regularly and in hearty good order and with a not exhaustive jollity it is a sacred instrument now the drum which is heard to play in this cheerful fashion while at the same time we know that discomfiture is cruelly harrying it that its inmost feelings are wounded and that worse is in store for it affects the contemplative mind with an inexpressibly grotesque commiseration do but listen to this one which is the joint corporate voice of the men of hillford outgeneraled plundered turned to ridicule it thumps with unabated briskness here indeed might sentimentalism shed a fertile tear anticipating that it will eventually be hung up among our national symbols i proceed the drum of hillford entered the brookfield grounds as ipley had done and with a similar body of decorated clubmen sounding along until it faced the astonished proprietor who held up his hand and requested to know the purpose of the visit one sentence of explanation sufficed what cried mr pole do you think you can milk a cow twice in ten minutes several of the hillford men acknowledged that it would be rather sharp work their case was stated whereupon mr pole told them that he had just been milked and regretted it but requested them to see that he could not possibly be equal to any second proceeding of the sort on their turning to consult together he advised them to bear it with fortitude all right sir they said and a voice from the ranks informed him that their word was jolly then a signal was given and these indomitable fellows cheered the lord of brookfield as lustily as if they had accomplished the feat of milking him twice in an hour their lively hurrahs set him blinking in extreme discomposure of spirit and he was fumbling at his pocket when the drum a little precipitately thumped the ranks fell into order and the departure was led by the tune of the king of the cannibal islands a tune that is certain to create a chorus on the march on this occasion the line oh didnt you know you were done sir became general at the winding up of the tune boys with their elders frisked as they chimed it casting an emphasis of infinite relish on the declaration done as if they delighted in applying it to mr pole though at their own expense soon a verse grew up we marchd and calld on mister pole who hadnt a penny upon his soul for ipley came and took the whole and didnt you know you were done sir i need not point out to the sagacious that hillford and not mr pole had been done but this was the genius of the men who transferred the opprobrium to him nevertheless though their manner of welcoming misfortune was such i knowing that there was not a deadlier animal than a done briton have shudders for ipley we relinquished the stream of an epic in turning away from these mighty drums mr pole stood questioning all who surrounded him what could i do i couldnt subscribe to both they dont expect that of a lord and im a commoner if these fellows quarrel and split are we to suffer for it they cant agree and want us to pay double fines this is how they serve us mr barrett rather at a loss to account for his excitement said that it must be admitted they had borne the trick played upon them with remarkable good humour yes but mr pole fumed i dont they put me in the wrong between them they make me uncomfortable ive a good mind to withdraw my subscription to those rascals who came first and have nothing to do with any of them then you see down i go for a niggardly fellow thats the reputation i get nothing of this in london you make your money pay your rates and nobody bothers a man you should have done as our darling here did papa said adela you should have hinted something that might be construed a promise or not as we please to read it if i promise i perform returned mr pole our hillford people have cause for complaint mr barrett observed and to emilia you will hardly favour one party more than another will you i am for that poor man jim said emilia he carried my harp evening after evening and would not even take sixpence for the trouble are you really going to sing there didnt you hear i promised tonight yes certainly do you know what it is you have promised to sing adela glided to her sisters near at hand and these ladies presently hemmed emilia in they had a method of treating matters they did not countenance as if nature had never conceived them and such were the monstrous issue of diseased imaginations it was hard for emilia to hear that what she designed to do was utterly out of the question and not to be for one moment thought of she reiterated with the same interpreting stress that she had given her promise do you know i praised you for putting them off so cleverly said adela in tones of gentle reproach that bewildered emilia must we remind you then that you are bound by a previous promise cornelia made a counterdemonstration with the word have you not promised to dine with us at lady gosstres tonight oh of course i shall keep that replied emilia i intend to i will sing there and then i will go and sing to those poor people who never hear anything but dreadful musicnot music at all but something that seems to tear your flesh never mind our flesh said adela pettishly melodiously remonstrating the next instant i really thought you could not be in earnest but said arabella can you find pleasure in wasting your voice and really great capabilities on such people emilia caught her upthis poor man but he loves music he really knows the good from the bad he never looks proud but when i sing to him the situation was one that cornelia particularly enjoyed here was a low form of intellect to be instructed as to the precise meaning of a word the nature of a pledge there can be no harm that i see in your singing to this man she commenced you can bid him come to one of the outhouses here if you desire and sing to him in the evening after his labour will be the fit time but as your friends we cannot permit you to demean yourself by going from our house to a public booth where vulgar men are smoking and drinking beer i wonder you have the courage to contemplate such an act you have pledged your word but if you had pledged your word child to swing upon that tree suspended by your arms for an hour could you keep it i think not and to recognize an impossibility economizes time and is one of the virtues of a clear understanding it is incompatible that you should dine with lady gosstre and then run away to a drinking booth society will never tolerate one who is familiar with boors if you are to succeed in life as we your friends can conscientiously say that we most earnestly hope and trust you will do you must be on good terms with society you must you pledge your word to a piece of folly emancipate yourself from it as quickly as possible do you see this is foolish it therefore cannot be decide as a sensible creature at the close of this harangue cornelia who had stooped slightly to deliver it regained her stately posture beautified in mr barretts sight by the flush which an unwonted exercise in speech had thrown upon her cheeks emilia stood blinking like one sensible of having been chidden in a strange tongue does it offend youmy going she faltered offendour concern is entirely for you observed cornelia the explanation drew out a happy sparkle from emilias eyes she seized her hand kissed it and cried i do thank you i know i promised but indeed i am quite pleased to go mr barrett swung hurriedly round and walked some paces away with his head downward the ladies remained in a tolerant attitude for a minute or so silent they then wheeled with one accord and emilia was left to herself chapter x richford was an easy drive from brookfield through lanes of elm and white hawthorn the ladies never acted so well as when they were in the presence of a fact which they acknowledged but did not recognize albeit constrained to admit that this was the first occasion of their ever being on their way to the dinnertable of a person of quality they could refuse to look the admission in the face a peculiar lightness of heart beset them for brooding ambition is richer in that first realizing step it takes insignificant though it seem than in any subsequent achievement i fear to say that the hearts of the ladies boiled because visages so sedate and voices so monotonously indifferent would witness decidedly against me the common avoidance of any allusion to richford testified to the direction of their thoughts and the absence of a sign of exultation may be accepted as a proof of the magnitude of that happiness of which they might not exhibit a feature the effort to repress it must have cost them horrible pain adela the youngest of the three transferred her inward joy to the cottage children whose staring faces from garden porch and gate flashed by the carriage windows how delighted they look she exclaimed more than once and informed her sisters that a country life was surely the next thing to paradise those children do look so happy thus did the weak one cunningly relieve herself arabella occupied her mind by giving emilia leading hints for conduct in the great house on the whole though there is no harm in your praising particular dishes as you do at home it is better in society to say nothing on those subjects until your opinion is asked and when you speak it should be as one who passes the subject by appreciate flavours but no dwelling on them the degrees of an expression of approbation naturally enough vary with age did my instinct prompt me to the discussion of these themes i should be allowed greater licence than you and here arabella was unable to resist a little bit of the indulgence adela had taken you are sure to pass a most agreeable evening and one that you will remember north pole sat high above such petty consolation seldom speaking save just to show that her ideas ranged at liberty and could be spontaneously sympathetic on selected topics their ceremonious entrance to the stateroom of richford accomplished the ladies received the greeting of the affable hostess quietly perturbed but not enough so to disorder their artistic contemplation of her open actions choice of phrase and byplay without communication or prearrangement each knew that the other would not let slip the opportunity and after the first five minutes of languid general converse they were mentally at work comparing notes with one anothers imaginary conversations while they said yes and indeed and i think so and appeared to belong to the world about them merthyr i do you the honour to hand this young lady to your charge said lady gosstre putting on equal terms with emilia a gentleman of perhaps fiveandthirty years who reminded her of mr barrett but was unclouded by that look of firm sadness which characterized the poor organist mr powys was a travelled welsh squire lady gosstres best talker on whom as brookfield learnt to see she could perfectly rely to preserve the child from any little drawingroom sins or dinnertable misadventures this gentleman had made sacrifices for the cause of italy in money and it was said in blood he knew the country and loved the people brookfield remarked that there was just a foreign tinge in his manner and that his smile though social to a degree unknown to the run of english faces did not give him all to you and at a second glance seemed plainly to say that he reserved much adela fell to the lot of a hussarcaptain a celebrated beauty not too foolish she thought it proper to punish him for his good looks till propitiated by his good temper nobody at brookfield could remember afterwards who took arabella down to dinner she declaring that she had forgotten her sisters not unwilling to see insignificance banished to annihilation said that it must have been nobody in person and that he was a very useful guest when ladies were engaged cornelia had a different lot she leaned on the right arm of the member for hillford the statistical debate sir twickenham pryme who had twice before as he ventured to remind her enjoyed the honour of conversing if not of dining with her nay more he revived their topics and i have come round to your way of thinking as regards hustings addresses he said in nine cases out of tenat least nineteentwentieths of the house will furnish instancesone can only as you justly observed appeal to the comprehension of the mob by pledging oneself either to their appetites or passions and it is better plainly to state the case and put it to them in figures whether the baronet knew what he was saying is one matter he knew what he meant wilfrid was cavalier to lady charlotte chillingworth of stornley about ten miles distant from hillford ninth daughter of a nobleman who passed current as the poor marquis he having been ruined when almost a boy in paris by the late illustrious lord dartford her sisters had married captains in the army and navy lawyers and parsons impartially lady charlotte was nineandtwenty years of age with clear and telling stoneblue eyes firm but not unsweet lips slightly hollowed cheeks and a jaw that certainly tended to be square her colour was healthy walking or standing her figure was firmly poised her chief attraction was a belltoned laugh fresh as a meadow spring she had met wilfrid once in the huntingfield so they soon had common ground to run on mr powys made emilia happy by talking to her of italy in the intervals of table anecdotes why did you leave it she said i found i had more shadows than the one allotted me by nature and as i was accustomed to a black one and not half a dozen white i was fairly frightened out of the country you mean austrians i do do you hate them not at all then how can you love the italians they themselves have taught me to do both to love them and not to hate their enemies your italians are the least vindictive of all races of men merthyr merthyr went lady gosstre lady charlotte murmuring aloud and in the third chapter of the book of paradox you will find these words we afford a practical example and forgive them do we not mr powys smiled at emilia she looked round her and reddened a little so long as you do not write that christian word with the point of a stiletto said lady charlotte you are not mad about the italians wilfrid addressed her not mad about anything i hope if i am to choose i prefer the austrians a very gentlemanly set of men at least so i find them always capital horsemen i will explain to you how it must be said mr powys to emilia an artistic people cannot hate long hotly for the time but the oppression gone and even in the dream of its going they are too human to be revengeful do we understand such very deep things said lady gosstre who was near enough to hear clearly yes for if i ask her whether she can hate when her mind is given to music she knows that she cannot she can love yet i think i have heard some italian operatic spitfires and of some said lady charlotte what opinion do you pronounce in this controversy cornelia made appeal to sir twickenham there are multitudes of cases he began and took up another end of his statement it has been computed that fiveandtwenty murders per month to a populationto a population of ninety thousand souls is a fair reckoning in a southern latitude then we must allow for the latitude i think so and also for the space into which the ninety thousand souls are packed quoth tracy runningbrook well well went sir twickenham the knife is the law to an italian of the south said mr powys he distrusts any other because he never gets it where law is established or tolerably secure the knife is not used duels are rare there is too much bonhomie for the point of honour i should like to believe that all men are as just to their mistresses lady charlotte sighed mockearnestly presently emilia touched the arm of mr powys she looked agitated i want to be told the name of that gentleman his eyes were led to rest on the handsome hussarcaptain do you know him but his name do me the favour to look at me captain gambier it is captain gambiers face was resolutely kept in profile to her i hear a rumour said lady gosstre to arabella that you think of bidding for the besworth estate are you tired of brookfield not tired but brookfield is modern and i confess that besworth has won my heart i shall congratulate myself on having you nearer neighbours have you many or any rivals there is some talk of the tinleys wishing to purchase it i cannot see why what people are they asked lady charlotte do they hunt oh dear no they are to society what dissenters are to religion i cant describe them otherwise they pass before me in that description said lady gosstre besworths an excellent centre for hunting lady charlotte remarked to wilfrid ive always had an affection for that place the house is on gravel the river has trout theres a splendid sweep of grass for the horses to exercise i think there must be sixteen spare beds at all events i know that number can be made up so that if youre too poor to live much in london you can always have your set about you the eyes of the fair economist sparkled as she dwelt on these particular advantages of besworth richford boasted a show of flowers that might tempt its guests to parade the grounds on balmy evenings wilfrid kept by the side of lady charlotte she did not win his taste a bit had she been younger less decided in tone and without a title it is very possible that she would have offended his native secret and dominating fastidiousness as much as did emilia then what made him subject at all to her influence as he felt himself beginning to be she supplied a deficiency in the youth he was growing and uncertain she was set and decisive in his soul he adored the extreme refinement of woman even up to the thin edge of inanity which neighbours what the philosopher could tell him if he would and would if it were permitted to him nothing was too white too saintly or too misty for his conception of abstract woman but the practical wants of our nature guide us best conversation with lady charlotte seemed to strengthen and ripen him he blushed with pleasure when she said i remember reading your name in the account of that last cavalry charge on the dewan you slew a chief i think that was creditable for they are swordmen cavalry in europe cant win much honournot individual honour i mean i suppose being part of a victorious machine is exhilarating i confess i should not think much of wearing that sort of feather its right to do ones duty comforting to trample down opposition and agreeable to shed blood but when you have matched yourself man to man and beatenwhy then i dub you knight wilfrid bowed halflaughing in a luxurious abandonment to his sensations possibly because of their rule over him then the change in him was so instant from flattered delight to vexed perplexity rounding one of the rhododendron banks just as he lifted his head from that acknowledgment of the ladys commendation he had sight of emilia with her hand in the hand of captain gambier what could it mean what right had he to hold her hand even if he knew her what right the words between emilia and captain gambier were few why did i not look at you during dinner said he was it not better to wait till we could meet then you will walk with me and talk to me all the evening no but i will try and come down here next week and meet you again are you going tonight yes tonight tonight before it strikes a quarter to ten i am going to leave here alone if you would come with me i want a companion i know they will not hurt me but i dont like being alone i have given my promise to sing to some poor people my friends say i must not go i must go i cant break a promise to poor people and you have never heard me really sing my best come with me and i will captain gambier required certain explanations he saw that a companion and protection would be needed by his curious little friend and as she was resolved not to break her word he engaged to take her in the carriage that was to drive him to the station you make me give up an appointment in town he said ah but you will hear me sing returned emilia we will drive to brookfield and get my harp and then to ipley common i am to be sure you will be ready with the carriage at just a quarter to ten the captain gave her his assurance and they separated he to seek out adela she to wander about the calmest of conspirators against the serenity of a household meeting wilfrid and lady charlotte emilia was asked by him who it was she had quitted so abruptly that is the gentleman i told you of now i know his name it is captain gambier she was allowed to pass on what is this she says lady charlotte asked it appearssomething about a meeting somewhere accidentally in the park in london i think i really dont know she had forgotten his name lady charlotte spurred him with an interrogative yes she wanted to remember his name thats all he was kind to her but after all remonstrated lady charlotte thats only a characteristic of young men is it not no special distinction you are all kind to girls to women to anything captain gambier and adela crossed their path he spoke a passing word lady charlotte returned no answer and was silent to her companion for some minutes then she said if you feel any responsibility about this little person take my advice and dont let her have appointments and meetings theyre bad in any case and for a girl who has no brotherhas she nowell then you should make the best provision you can against the cowardice of men most men are cowards emilia sang in the drawingroom brookfield knew perfectly why she looked indifferent to the plaudits and was not dissatisfied at hearing lady gosstre say that she was a little below the mark the kindly lady brought emilia between herself and mr powys saying i dont intend to let you be the star of the evening and outshine us all after which conversation commenced and brookfield had reason to admire her ladyships practised play upon the social instrument surely the grandest of all the chords being men and women consider what an accomplishment this is albeit brookfield knew itself a student at richford adela was of too impatient a wit to refrain from little ventures toward independence if not rivalry what we do she uttered distinctively once or twice among other things she spoke of our discovery to attest her declaration that to wakeful eyes neither hillford nor any other place on earth was dull cornelia flushed at hearing the name of mr barrett pronounced publicly by her sister an organist an accomplished man lady gosstre repeated adelas words well i suppose it is possible but it rather upsets ones notions does it not yes but agreeably said adela with boldness and related how he had been introduced and hinted that he was going to be patronized the man cannot maintain himself on the income that sort of office brings him lady gosstre observed oh no said adela i fancy he does it simply for some sort of occupation one cannot help imagining a disguise personally i confess to an objection to gentlemen in disguise said lady gosstre barrettdo you know the man she addressed mr powys there used to be good quartett evenings given by the barretts of bursey he said sir justinian barrett married a miss purcell who subsequently preferred the musical accomplishments of a foreign professor of the art purcell barrett is his name said adela our emilia brought him to us where is she but where can she be adela rose she pressed my hand just now said lady gosstre she was here when captain gambler quitted the room arabella remarked good heaven the exclamation came from adela oh lady gosstre i fear to tell you what i think she has done the scene of the rival clubs was hurriedly related together with the preposterous pledge given by emilia that she would sing at the ipley booth among those dreadful men they will treat her respectfully said mr powys worship her i should imagine merthyr said lady gosstre for all that she had better be away beer is not a respectful spirit i trust you will pardon her arabella pleaded everything that explanations of the impropriety of such a thing could do we have done we thought that at last we had convinced her she is quite untamed mr powys now asked where this place was that she had hurried to the unhappy ladies of brookfield quick as they were to read every sign surrounding them were for the moment too completely thrown off their balance by emilias extraordinary exhibition of will to see that no reflex of her shameful and hideous proceeding had really fallen upon them their exclamations were increasing until adela who had been the noisiest suddenly adopted lady gosstres tone if she has gone i suppose she must be simply fetched away do you see what has happened lady charlotte murmured to wilfrid between a phrase he stumbled over a little piece of gallantry excellent but say those things in frenchyour darkeyed maid has eloped she left the room five minutes after captain gambier wilfrid sprang to his feet looking eagerly to the corners of the room pardon me he said and moved up to lady gosstre on the way he questioned himself why his heart should be beating at such a pace standing at her ladyships feet he could scarcely speak yes wilfrid go after her said adela divining his object by all means go added lady gosstre now she is there you may as well let her keep her promise and then hurry her home they will saddle you a horse down below if you care to have one wilfrid thanked her ladyship and declined the horse he was soon walking rapidly under a rough sky in the direction of ipley with no firm thought that he would find emilia there chapter xi at halfpast nine of the clock on the evening of this memorable day a body of fiveandtwenty stout young fellows prizewinners wrestlers boxers and topers of the hillford club set forth on a march to ipley common now a foreigner hearing of their destination and the provocation they had endured would have supposed that they were bent upon deeds of vengeance and it requires knowledge of our countrymen to take it as a fact that the idea and aim of the expedition were simply to furnish the offending ipley boys a little music such were the idea and the aim hillford had nothing to do with consequences no more than our england is responsible when she sails out among the empires and hemispheres saying buy and sell and they clamour to be eaten up entire foreigners pertinaciously misunderstand us they have the barbarous habit of judging by results let us know ourselves better it is melancholy to contemplate the intrigues and vile designs and vengeances of other nations and still more so after we have written so many pages of intelligible history to see them attributed to us will it never be perceived that we do not sow the thing that happens the source of the flooding stream which drinks up those rich acres of low flat land is not more innocent than we if as does seem possible we are in a sort of alliance with destiny we have signed no compact and accomplish our work as solidly and merrily as a woodhatchet in the hands of the woodman this arrangement to give ipley a little music was projected as a return for the favours of the morning nor have i in my time heard anything comparable to it in charity of sentiment when i consider the detestable outrage hillford suffered under the parading of the drum the trombone a horn two whistles and a fife in front of hillford booth caught the fancy of the clubmen who roared out parting adjurations that the music was not to be spared and that tom breeks was a musical fellow with a fine empty pate if any one of the instruments should fail perchance they were to give ipley plenty of music for ipley wanted to be taught harmony harmony was ipleys weak point gie em said one jolly ruddy hillford man gie em whack fol lol and he smacked himself and set toward an invisible partner nor as recent renowned historians have proved are observations of this nature beneath the dignity of chronicle they vindicate as they localize the sincerity of hillford really to be an islander full of ale is to be the kindest creature on or off two legs for that very reason it may be his wrath at bad blood is so easily aroused in our hot moods we would desire things like unto ourselves and object violently to whatsoever is unlike and also we desire that the benefits we shed be appreciated if ipley understands neither our music nor our intent haply we must hold a performance on the impenetrable sconce of ipley at the hour named the expedition with many a promise that the music should be sweet departed hilariously will burdock the lefthanded cricketer and hardhitter being leader with peter bartholomew potboy john girling millers man and ned thewk gardeners assistant for lieutenants on the march silence was proclaimed and partially enforced after two fights against authority near the sign of king williams head general burdock called a halt and betrayed irresolution with reference to the route to be adopted but as none of his troop could at all share such a condition of mind in the neighbourhood of an inn he was permitted to debate peacefully with his lieutenants while the rest burst through the doors and hailed the landlord a proceeding he was quickly induced to imitate thus when the tail shows strongest decision of purpose the head must follow an accurate oinometer or method of determining what shall be the condition of the spirit of man according to the degrees of wine or beer in him were surely of priceless service to us for now must we to be certain of our sanity and dignity abstain which is to clip impoverish imprison the soul or else taking wings of wine we go aloft over capes and islands and seas but are even as balloons that cannot make for any line and are at the mercy of the windswithout a choice save to come down by virtue of a collapse could we say to ourselves in the great style this is the point where desire to embrace humanity is merged in vindictiveness toward individuals where radiant sweet temper culminates in tremendous wrath where the treasures of anticipation waxing riotous arouse the memory of wrongs in plain words could we know positively and from the hand of science when we have had enough we should stop there is not a doubt that we should stop it is so true we should stop that i am ready to say ladies have no right to call us horrid names and complain of us till they have helped us to some such trustworthy scientific instrument as this which i have called for in its absence i am persuaded that the true natural oinometer is the hat were the hat always worn during potation were ladies when they retire to place it on our heads or better still chaplets of flowers then like the wise ancients we should be able to tell to a nicety how far we had advanced in our dithyramb to the theme of fuddle and muddle unhappily the hat does not forewarn it is simply indicative i believe nevertheless that science might set to work upon it forthwith and found a system when you mark men drinking who wear their hats and those hats are seen gradually beginning to hang on the backs of their heads as from pegs in the fashion of a fez the bald projection of forehead looks jolly and frank distrust that sign the mayfly of the soul is then about to be gobbled up by the chub of the passions a hat worn fezfashion is a dangerous hat a hat on the brows shows a man who can take more but thinks he will go home instead and does so peaceably that is his determination he may look like macduff but he is a lamb the vinous reverses the nonvinous passionate expression of the hat if i am discredited i appeal to history which tells us that the hats of the hillford fiveandtwenty were all exceedingly hindwardset when the march was resumed it followed that peter bartholomew potboy made irritable objections to that old joke which finished his name as though it were a cat calling and the offence being repeated he dealt an impartial swing of his stick at divers heads and told them to take that which they assured him they had done by sending him flying into a hedge peter being reprimanded by his commanding officer acknowledged a hot desire to try his mettle and the latter responsible person had to be restrained from granting the wish he cherished by john girling whom he threw for his trouble and as burdock was the soundest hitter numbers cried out against girling revolting him with a sense of overwhelming injustice that could be appeased only by his prostrating two stout lads and squaring against a third who came up from a crossroad this one knocked him down with the gentleness of a fist that knows how beer should be treated and then sang out in the voice of wilfrid pole which is the nearest way to ipley you fellows come along with us sir and well show you said burdock are you going there well thats pretty clear hillford men are you weve left the women behind im in a hurry so good night and so are we in a hurry sir but youre a gentleman and we want to give them chaps at ipley a little surprise dye see in the way of a dollop o music and if you wont go givin em warning you may trot and that roadll take you all right said wilfrid now fairly divided between his jealousy of gambier and anxiety for emilia could her artist nature of which he had heard perplexing talk excuse her and make her heart absolutely guiltless what he called innocent in trusting herself to any mans honour i regret to say that the dainty adorers of the sex are even thus grossly suspicious of all women when their sentiment is ever so triflingly offended lights on ipley common were seen from a rise of the hilly road the moon was climbing through drifts of torn black cloud hastening his pace for a double reason now wilfrid had the booth within hearing listened a moment and then stood fast his unconscious gasp of the words thank god there she is might have betrayed him to another she was sitting near one end of the booth singing as wilfrid had never yet heard her sing her dark eyes flashing behind her stood captain gambier keeping guard with all the composure of a gentlemanusher at a royal presentation along the tables men and women were ranged facing her openmouthed some of them but for the most part wearing a predetermined expression of applausive judgement as who should say queer but good they gave emilia their faces which was all she wanted and silence save for an intermingling soft snore here and there the elfin trumpet of silence to tell truth certain heads had bowed low to the majesty of beer and were down on the table between sprawling doubled arms no essay on the power of beer could exhibit it more convincingly than the happy indifference with which they received admonishing blows from quartpots salutes from hot pipebowls pricks from pipeends on nose and cheek and pate as if to vindicate for their beloved beverage a right to rank with that old classic drink wherewith the fairest of women vanquished human ills the majority however had been snatched out of this bliss by the intrusion of their wives who sat beside them like consciences in petticoats and it must be said that emilia was in favour with the married men for one reason because she gave these broadribboned ladies a good excuse for allowing their lords to stop where they were so comfortable a continuallyextending five minutes longer yet though the words were foreign and the style of the song and the singer were strange many of the older fellows eyes twinkled and their mouths pursed with a kind of halfprotesting pleasure all were reverent to the compliment paid them by emilias presence the general expression was much like that seen when the popular ear is given to the national anthem wilfrid hung at the opening of the booth a cynical spectator for what on earth made her throw such energy and glory of music into a song before fellows like these he laughed dolorously she hasnt a particle of any sense of ridicule he said to himself forthwith her voice took hold of him and led him as heroes of old were led unwillingly into enchanted woods if she had been singing things holy a hymn a hallelujah in this company it struck him that somehow it would have seemed appropriate not objectionable at any rate not ridiculous dr watts would have put a girdle about her but a song of romance sung in this atmosphere of pipes and beer and boozy heads chagrined wilfrid in proportion as the softer half of him began to succumb to the deliciousness of her voice emilia may have had some warning sense that admiration is only one ingredient of homage that to make it fast and true affection must be won now poor people yokels clods cannot love what is incomprehensible to them an idol must have their attributes a king must show his face now and then a song must appeal to their intelligence to subdue them quite this as we know is not the case in the higher circles emilia may have divined it possibly from the very great respect with which her finale was greeted vigorous as the brayvos were they sounded abashed they lacked abandonment in fact it was gratitude that applauded and not enthusiasm hillford dont hear stuff like that do em which was the main verbal encomium passed may be taken testificatorily as to this point dame dame cried emilia finding her way quickly to one of the more decentlybonneted women am i not glad to see you here did i please you and you dear farmer wilson i caught sight of you just as i was finishing i remember the song you like and i want to sing it i know the tune but the words the words what are the words humming wont do ah now quoth farmer wilson pointing out the end of his pipe thats what theyll swallow down thats the song to make em kick sing that miss furrin songs s all right enough but ale it is my tipple and england is my nation lets have something plain and flat on the surface miss dame wilson jogged her husbands arm to make him remember that talking was his dangerous pastime and sent abroad a petition for a songbook and after a space a very doggyeared book resembling a poodle of that genus was handed to her then uprose a shout for this song and that but emilia fixed upon the one she had in view and walked back to her harp with her head bent perusing it attentively all the way there she gave the book to captain gambier and begged him to hold it open before her with a passing light of eyes likely to be rather disturbing to a jealous spectator the captain seized the book without wincing and displayed a remarkable equanimity of countenance as he held it out according to direction no sooner had emilia struck a prelude of the wellknown air than the interior of the booth was transfigured legs began to move elbows jerked upward fingers fillipped the whole body of them were ready to duck and bow dance and do her bidding she had fairly caught their hearts for besides the pleasure they had in their own familiar tune it was wonderful to them that emilia should know what they knew this was the marvel this the inspiration she smiled to see how true she had struck and seemed to swim on the pleasure she excited once as her voice dropped she looked up at captain gambier so very archly with the curving line of her bare throat that wilfrid was dragged down from his cynical observatory and made to feel as a common man among them all at the thrumthrum on the harpstrings which wound up the song frenzied shouts were raised for a repetition emilia was perfectly willing to gratify them captain gambier appeared to be remonstrating with her but she put up her joined hands mockpetitioningly and he with great affability held out the book anew wilfrid was thinking of moving to her to take her forcibly away when she recommenced at the same instantbut who knowing that a house of glass is about to be shattered can refrain from admiring its glitter in the beamsipley crooned a ready accompaniment the sleepers had been awakened the women and the men were alive halfdancing halfchorusing here a baby was tossed and there an old fellows elbow worked mutely expressive of the rollicking gaiety within him the whole length of the booth was in a pleasing simmer ready to overboil with shouts humane and cheerful while emilia pitched her note and led archly and quite one with them all and yet in a way that critical wilfrid could not object to so plainly did she sing to give happiness i cannot delay but i request you that are here privileged to soar aloft with the muse to fix your minds upon one point in this flight let not the heat and dust of the ensuing fray divert your attention from the magnanimity of beer it will be vindicated in the end but be worthy of your seat beside the muse who alone of us all can take one view of the inevitable two that perplex mortal judgements for if ipley had jumped jovially up and met the hillford alarum with laughterhow then why then i maintain that the magnanimity of beer would have blazed effulgent on the spot there would have been louder laughter and fraternal greetings as it was the fire on the altar of wisdom was again kindled by folly and the steps to the altar were broken heads after the antique fashion in dismay ipley started the members of the club stared emilia faltered in horror a moment her voice swam stemming the execrable concert but it was overwhelmed wilfrid pressed forward to her they could hear nothing but the din the booth raged like an insurgent menagerie outside it sounded of brazen beasts and beasts that whistled beasts that boomed a whirlwind huddled them and at last a cry weve got a visit from hillford told a tale at once the stoutest hearts pressed to the opening my harp emilia made her voice reach wilfrids ear unprovided with weapons ipley parleyed hillford howled in reply the trombone brayed an interminable note that would have driven to madness quiescent cats by steaming kettles and quick like the springing pulse of battle the drum thumped and thumped blood could not hear it and keep from boiling the booth shook violently wilfrid and gambier threw over halfadozen chairs forms and tables to make a barrier for the protection of the women come wilfrid said to emilia leave the harp i will get you another come no no she cried in her nervous fright for gods sake come he reiterated she stamping her foot as to emphasize no no no but i will buy you another harp he made audible to her through the hubbub this one she gasped with her hand on it what will he think if he finds that i forsook it wilfrid knew her to allude to the unknown person who had given it to her therethere said he i sent it and i can get you another so come be good and come it was you emilia looked at him she seemed to have no senses for the uproar about her but now the outer barricade was broken through and the rout pressed on the second line tom breeks the orator and jim transformed from a lurching yokel to a lithe dog of battle kept the retreat of ipley challenging any two of hillford to settle the dispute captain gambier attempted an authoritative parley in the midst of which a hillford man made a long arm and struck emilias harp till the strings jarred loose and horrid the noise would have been enough to irritate wilfrid beyond endurance when he saw the fellow continuing to strike the harpframe while emilia clutched it in a feeble defence against her bosom he caught a thick stick from a neighbouring hand and knocked that hillford man so clean to earth that hillford murmured at the blow wilfrid then joined the front array halfadozen hits like that apiece sir nodded tom breeks there goes another jim shouted not quite my lad interposed ned thewk though peter bartholomew was reeling in confirmation his blow at jim missed but came sharply in the swing on wilfrids cheekbone maddened at the immediate vision of that feature swollen purple even as a plum with an assiduous fly on it certifying to ripenesssays the philosopher we are never up to the mark of any position if we are in a position beneath our own mark and it is true that no hero in conflict should think of his face but wilfrid was all the while protesting wrathfully against the folly of his having set foot in such a placemaddened i say wilfrid a keen swordman cleared a space john girling fell to him ned thewk fell to him and the sconce of will burdock rang a rascally absurd business said gambier letting his stick do the part of a damnatory verb on one of the enemy while he added the drunken vagabonds all the hillford party were now in the booth ipley meantime was not sleeping farmer wilson and a set of the ipley men whom age had sagaciously instructed to prefer stratagem to force had slipped outside and were labouring as busily as their comrades within stooping to the tentpegs sending emissaries to the tentpoles drunk roared will burdock did you happen to say drunk and looking all the while at gambier he with infernal cunning swung at wilfrids fated cheekbone the latter rushed furiously into the press of them and there was a charge from ipley and a lock from which wilfrid extricated himself to hurry off emilia he perceived that bad blood was boiling up forward cried will burdock and hillford in turn made a tide as they came on in numbers too great for ipley to stand against an obscuration fell over all the fight paused then a sensation as of some fellows smoothing their polls and their cheeks and leaning on their shoulders with obtrusive affection inspirited them to lash about indiscriminately whoops and yells arose then peals of laughter homage to the cleverness of ipley was paid in hurrahs the moment hillford understood the stratagem by which its men of valour were lamed and imprisoned the truth was that the booth was down on them and they were struggling entangled in an enormous bag of canvas wilfrid drew emilia from under the drooping folds of the tent he was allowed on inspection of features to pass the men of hillford were captured one by one like wild geese as with difficulty they emerged roaring rolling with laughter all yea to such an extent did they laugh that they can scarce be said to have done less than make the joke of the foe their own and this proves the great and amazing magnanimity of beer chapter xii a pillar of dim silver rain fronted the moon on the hills emilia walked hurriedly with her head bent like a penitent now and then peeping up and breathing to the keen scent of the tender ferns wilfrid still grasped her hand and led her across the common away from the rout when the uproar behind them had sunk he said youll get your feet wet im sorry you should have to walk how did you come here she answered i forget you must have come here in some conveyance did you walk again she answered i forget a little querulously perhaps wilfully well he persisted you must have got your harp to this place by some means or other yes my harp a sob checked her voice wilfrid tried to soothe her never mind the harp its easily replaced not that one she moaned we will get you another i shall never love any but that perhaps we may hear good news of it tomorrow no for i felt it die in my hands the third blow was the one that killed it its broken wilfrid could not reproach her and he had not any desire to preach so as no idea of having done amiss in coming to the booth to sing illumined her and she yet knew that she was in some way guilty she accused herself of disregard for that dear harp while it was brilliant and serviceable now i remember what poor music i made of it i touched it with cold fingers the sound was thin as if it had no heart tickticki fancy i touched it with a dead mans fingernails she crossed her wrists tight at the clasp of her waist and letting her chin fall on her throat shook her body fretfully much as a pettish little girl might do wilfrid grimaced ticktick was not a pathetic elegy in his ears the only thing is not to think about it said he its only an instrument after all its the second one ive seen killed like a living creature replied emilia they walked on silently till wilfrid remarked that he wondered where gambier was she gave no heed to the name the little quiet footing and the bowed head by his side moved him to entreat her not to be unhappy her voice had another tone when she answered that she was not unhappy no tears at all wilfrid stooped to get a close view of her face i thought i saw one if its about the harp lookyou shall go into that cottage where the light is sit there and wait for me and i will bring you what remains of it i dare say we can have it mended emilia lifted her eyes i am not crying for the harp if you go back i must go with you thats out of the question you must never be found in that sort of place again let us leave the harp she murmured you cannot go without me let me sit here for a minute sit with me she pointed to a place beside herself on the fork of a dry log under flowering hawthorn a pale shadowy blue centre of light among the clouds told where the moon was rain had ceased and the refreshed earth smelt all of flowers as if each breeze going by held a nosegay to their nostrils wilfrid was sensible of a sudden marked change in her his blood was quicker than his brain in feeling it her voice now even in common speaking had that vibrating richness which in her singing swept his nerves if you cry there must be a cause you know he said for the sake of keeping the conversation in a safe channel how brave you are was emilias sedate exclamation in reply her cheeks glowed as if she had just uttered a great confession but while the colour mounted to her eyes they kept their affectionate intentness upon him without a quiver of the lids do you think me a coward she relieved him by asking sharply like one whom the thought had turned into a darker path i am not i hung my head while you were fighting because what could i do i would not have left you girls can only say i will perish with him but wilfrid tried to laugh there was no necessity for that sort of devotion what are you thinking of it was half in goodhumour all through part of their fun clearly emilias conception of the recent fray was unchangeable and the place for girls is at home thats certain he added i should always like to be where her voice flowed on with singular gravity to that stop wilfrids hand travelled mechanically to his pricking cheekbone was it possible that a lovescene was coming on as a pendant to that monstrously ridiculous affair of halfanhour back to know that she had sufficient sensibility was gratifying and flattering that it aimed at him she was really a darling little woman only too absurd had she been on the point of saying that she would always like to be where he wilfrid was an odd touch of curiosity peculiar to the languid emotions made him ask her this and to her soft yes he continued briskly and in the style of condescending fellowship of course were not going to part i wonder said emilia there she sat evidently sounding right through the future with her young brain to hear what destiny might have to say the i wonder rang sweetly in his head it was as delicate a way of confessing i love you with all my soul as could be imagined extremely refined young ladies could hardly have improved upon it saving with the angelic shades of sentiment familiar to them convinced that he had now heard enough for his vanity wilfrid returned emphatically to the tone of the worlds highroad by the way he said you mustnt have any exaggerated idea of this nights work remember also i have to share the honours with captain gambier i did not see him said emilia are you not cold he asked for a diversion though he had one of her hands she gave him the other he could not quit them abruptly nor could he hold both without being drawn to her what is it you say wilfrid whispered men kiss us when we are happy is that right and are you happy she lifted a clear full face to which he bent his mouth over the flowering hawthorn the moon stood like a windblown white rose of the heavens the kiss was given and taken strange to tell it was he who drew away from it almost bashfully and with new feelings quite unaware that he played the feminine part wilfrid alluded to her flight from richford with the instinct to sting his heart by a revival of his jealous sensations previously experienced and so taste the luxury of present satisfaction why did you run away from me he said semireproachfully i promised would you not break a promise to stay with me now i would you promised captain gambier no those poor people you are sorry that you went no she was happy you have lost your harp by it said wilfrid what do you think of me for not guessingnot knowing who sent it she returned i feel guilty of something all those days that i touched it not thinking of you wicked filthy little creature that i was i despise ungrateful girls i detest anything that has to do with gratitude wilfrid appended pray give me none why did you go away with captain gambier i was very fond of him she replied unhesitatingly but speaking as it were with numbed lips i wanted to tell him to thank him and hold his hand i told him of my promise he spoke to me a moment in the garden you know he said he was leaving to go to london early and would wait for me in the carriage then we might talk he did not wish to talk to me in the garden and you went with him in the carriage and told him you were so grateful yes but men do not like us to be grateful so he said he would do all sorts of things on condition that you were not grateful he saidyes i forget i do forget how can i tell what he said emilia added piteously i feel as if i had been emptied out of a sack wilfrid was pierced with laughter and then the plainspoken simile gave him a chilling sensation while he was rising to the jealous pitch did he talk about taking you to italy put your head into the sack and think yes she answered blandly an affirmative that caused him some astonishment for he had struck at once to the farthest end of his suspicions he feels as i do about the italian schools said emilia he wishes me to owe my learning to him he says it will make him happy and i thought so too she threw in a then wilfrid looked moodily into the opposite hedge did he name the day for your going he asked presently little anticipating another yes but it came and her rather faltering manner showed her to be conscious too that the word was getting to be a black one to him did you say you would go i did question and answer crossed like two rapiers wilfrid jumped up the smell of this trees detestable he said glancing at the shadowing hawthorn emilia rose quietly plucked a flower off the tree and put it in her bosom their way was down a green lane and across long meadowpaths dim in the moonlight a nightingale was heard on this side and on that overhead they had a great space of sky with broken cloud full of the glory of the moon the meadows dipped to a brook slenderly spanned by a plank then there was an ascent through a cornfield to a copse rounding this they had sight of brookfield but while they were yet at the brook wilfrid said when is it youre going to italy in return he had an eager look so that he was halfashamed to add with captain gambier i mean he was suffering and by being brutal he expected to draw balm on himself nor was he deceived emilia just then gave him her hand to be led over and answered as she neared him i am never to leave you you never shall wilfrid caught her in his arms quite conquered by her proud of her he reflected with a loving rapture that her manner at that moment was equal to any ladys and the phantom of her with her hand out and her frank look and trustful footing while she spoke those words kept on advancing to him all the way to brookfield at the same time that the sober reality murmured at his elbow love with his accustomed cunning managed thus to lift her out of the mire and array her in his golden dress to idealize her as we say reconciled for the hour were the contesting instincts in the nature of this youth the adoration of feminine refinement and the susceptibility to sensuous impressions but emilia walked with a hero the dream of all her days one generous and gentle as well as brave who had fought for her had thought of her tenderly was with her now having raised her to his level with a touch how much might they not accomplish together he with sword she with harp through shadowy alleys in the clouds emilia saw the bright italian plains opening out to her the cities of marble such as her imagination had fashioned them porticos of stately palaces and towers and statues white among cypresses and farther minutelyradiant in the vista as a shining star venice of the sea fancy made the flying minutes hours now they marched with the regiments of italy under the folds of her free banner now she sang to the victorious army waving the banner over them and now she floated in a gondola and turning to him the dear home of her heart yet pale with the bleeding of his wound for italy said softly in the tone that had power with him only let me please you when where what with came the blunt response from england with electric speed and emilia fell from the clouds i meant my singing i thought of how i sang to you oh happy time she exclaimed to cut through the mist of vision in her mind to me down at the booth muttered wilfrid perplexed oh no i mean just now and languid with the burden of so full a heart she did not attempt to explain herself further though he said invitingly i thought i heard you humming then he was seized with a desire to have the force of her spirit upon him for brookfield was in view and with the sight of brookfield the natural fascination waxed a shade fainter and he feared it might be going this he was happily as ignorant as any other youth of the working of his machinery prompted him to bid her sing before they parted emilia checked her steps at once to do as he desired her throat filled but the voice quavered down again like a fainting creature sick unto death she made another effort and ended with a sorrowful look at his narrowlywatching eyes i cant she said and in fear of his anger took his hand to beg forgiveness while her eyelids drooped wilfrid locked her fingers in a strong pressure and walked on silent as a man who has faced one of the veiled mysteries of life it struck a full human blow on his heart dragging him out of his sentimental pastures precipitately he felt her fainting voice to be the intensest lovecry that could be uttered the sound of it coursed through his blood striking a rare illumination of sparks in his not commonly brilliant brain in truth that little episode showed an image of nature weak with the burden of new love i do not charge the young cavalry officer with the power of perceiving images he saw no more than that she could not sing because of what was in her heart toward him but such a physical revelation was a divine loveconfession coming involuntarily from one whose lips had not formed the name of love and wilfrid felt it so deeply that the exquisite flattery was almost lost in a certain awed sense of his being in the presence of an absolute fact a thing real though it was much talked about and visible though it did not wear a hat or a petticoat it searched him thoroughly enough to keep him from any further pledges in that direction propitious as the moment was while the moon slipped over banks of marble into fields of blue and all the midnight promised silence they passed quickly through the laurel shrubs and round the lawn lights were in the sleepless ladies bedroom windows do i love her thought wilfrid as he was about to pull at the bell and the thought that he should feel pain at being separated from her for halfadozen hours persuaded him that he did the selfrestraint which withheld him from protesting that he did confirmed it tomorrow morning he whispered i shall be down by daylight answered emilia you are in the shadei cannot see you said he the door opened as emilia was moving out of the line of shadow chapter xiii on the morrow wilfrid was gone no one had seen him go emilia while she touched the keys of a muted piano softly in the morning quiet of the house had heard the frontdoor close at that hour one attributes every noise to the servants she played on and waited patiently till the housemaid expelled her into the dewy air the report from his bedchamber telling the ladies of his absence added that he had taken linen for a lengthened journey this curious retreat of my hero belongs to the order of things that are done none know why a curtain which drops conveniently upon either the bewilderment of the showman or the infirmities of the puppet i must own though i need not be told what odium frowns on such a pretension to excess of cleverness that i do know why i know why and unfortunately for me i have to tell what i know if i do not tell this narrative is so constituted that there will be no moral to it one who studies man in puppets in which purpose lies the chief value of this amusing species must think that we are degenerating rapidly the puppet hero for instance is a changed being we know what he was but now he takes shelter in his wits his organs affect his destiny careless of the fact that the heros achievement is to conquer nature he seems rather to boast of his subservience to her still up to this day the fixture of a nose upon the puppetheros frontispiece has not been attempted some one does it at last when the alternative came no nose to the hero no moral to the tale could there be hesitation and i would warn our sentimentalists to admit the nose among the features proper to heroes otherwise the race will become extinct there is already an amount of dropping of the curtain that is positively wearisome even to extremely refined persons in order to save him from apparent misconduct he will have to go altogether unless we boldly figure him as other men manifestly the moment his career as a fairy prince was at end he was on the high road to a nose the beneficent power that discriminated for him having vanished utterly he was like a bankrupt gentleman obliged to do all the work for himself this is nothing more than the tendency of the generations downward from the ideal the springs that moved wilfrid upon the present occasion were simple we will strip him of his heroic trappings for one fleeting instant and show them jumping briskly from a restless bed his first act was to address his features to the lookingglass and he saw surely the most glorious sight for a hero of the knightly age that could possibly have been offered the battle of the previous night was written there in one eloquent big lump which would have passed him current as hero from end to end of the land in the great days of old these are the teatable days his preference was for the visage of wilfrid pole which he saw not at the aspect of the fearful mask this young man stared and then cursed and then by an odd transition he was reminded as by the force of a sudden gust that emilias hair was redolent of pipesmoke his remark was i cant be seen in this state his thought a dim reminiscence of poetical readings ambrosial locks indeed a sad irony which told that much goldleaf had peeled away from her image in his heart wilfrid was a gallant fellow with good stuff in him but he was young ponder on that pregnant word for you are about to see him grow he was less a coxcomb than shamefaced and sentimental and one may have these qualities and be a coxcomb to boot and yet be a gallant fellow one may also be a gallant fellow and harsh exacting doubledealing and i know not what besides in youth the question asked by nature is has he the heart to take and keep an impression for if he has circumstances will force him on and carve the figure of a brave man out of that mass of contradictions in return for such benefits he pays forfeit commonly of the dearest of the things prized by him in this terrestrial life whereat albeit created man by her he reproaches nature and the sculptor circumstance forgetting that to make him man is their sole duty and that what betrayed him was the difficulty thrown in their way by his quondam selfthe pleasant boonfellow he forgets in fact that he was formerly led by his nose and sacrificed his deeper feeling to a low disgust when the youth is called upon to look up he can adore devoutly and ardently but when it is his chance to look down on a fair head he is if not worse a sentimental despot wilfrid was young and under the dominion of his senses which can be if the sentimentalists will believe me as tyrannous and misleading when superrefined as when ultrabestial he made a good stout effort to resist the pipesmoke emilias voice her growing beauty her simplicity her peculiar charms of feature were all conjured up to combat the dismal images suggested by that fatal draggingdown smell it was vain horrible pipesmoke pervaded the memory of her it seemed to his offended dainty fancy that he could never dissociate her from smokingbooths and abominably bad tobacco and let us add for this was part of the secret that it never could dwell on her without the companionship of a hideous disfigured countenance claiming to be wilfrid pole he shuddered to think that he had virtually almost engaged himself to this girl or had he was his honour bound distance appeared to answer the question favourably there was safety in being distant from her she possessed an incomprehensible attractiveness she was at once powerful and pitiable so that while he feared her and was running from her spell he said from time to time poor little thing and deeply hoped she would not be unhappy a showman once a novice in his art or ambitious beyond the mark after a successful exhibition of his dolls handed them to the company with the observation satisfy yourselves ladies and gentlemen the latter having satisfied themselves that the capacity of the lower limbs was extraordinary returned them disenchanted that showman did ill but i am not imitating him i do not wait till after the performance when it is too late to revive illusion to avoid having to drop the curtain i choose to explain an act on which the story hinges while it is advancing which is in truth an impulse of character instead of his being more of a puppet this hero is less wooden than he was certainly i am much more in awe of him chapter xiv mr pole was one of those men whose characters are read off at a glance he was neat insignificant and nervously cheerful with the eyes of a bird that let you into no interior his friends knew him thoroughly his daughters were never in doubt about him at the period of the purchase of brookfield he had been excitable and feverish but that was ascribed to the projected change in his habits and the stern necessity for an occasional family intercommunication on the subject of money he had a remarkable shyness of this theme and reversed its general treatment for he would pay but would not talk of it if it had to be discussed with the ladies he puffed and blinked and looked so much like a culprit that though they rather admired him for what seemed to them the germ of a sense delicate above his condition they would have said of any man they had not known so perfectly that he had painful reasons for wishing to avoid it now that they spoke to him of besworth assuring him that they were serious in their desire to change their residence the fit of shyness was manifested first in outrageous praise of brookfield which was speedily and inexplicably followed by a sort of implied assent to the proposition to depart from it for besworth displayed numerous advantages over brookfield and to contest one was to plunge headlong into the money question he ventured to ask his daughters what good they expected from the change they replied that it was simply this that one might live fifty years at brookfield and not get such a circle as in two might be established at besworth they were restricted they had gathering friends and no means of bringing them together and the beauty of the site of besworth made them enthusiastic well but said mr pole what does it lead to is there nothing to come after he explained youre girls you know you wont always stop with me you may do just as well at brookfield for yourselves as over there the ladies blushed demurely you forecast very kindly for us papa said cornelia our object is entirely different i wish i could see it he returned but you do see papa you do see interposed adela that a select life is preferable to that higgledypiggledy citysquare existence so many poor creatures are condemned to select said mr pole thinking that he had hit upon a weakness in their argument how can it be select when you want to go to a place where you may have a crowd about you selection can only be made from a crowd remarked arabella with terrible placidity it is where we see few that we are at the mercy of kind fortune for our acquaintances dont you see papa that the difference between the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie is that the former choose their sets and the latter are obliged to take what comes to them said adela this was the first domestic discussion upon besworth the visit to richford had produced the usual effect on the ladies who were now looking to other heights from that level the ladies said we have only to press it with papa and we shall quit this place but at the second discussion they found that they had not advanced the only change was in the emphasis that their father added to the interrogations already uttered what does it lead to whats to come after i see your object but am i to go into a new house for the sake of getting you out of it and then be left there alone its against your interests too never mind how leave that to a business man if your brother had proposed itbut hes too reasonable the ladies upon this hint wrote to wilfrid to obtain his concurrence and assistance he laughed when he read the simple sentence we hope you will not fancy that we have any peculiar personal interest in view and replied to them that he was sure they had none that he looked upon besworth with favour and i may inform you he pursued that your taste is heartily applauded by lady charlotte chillingworth she bids me tell you the letter was dated from stornley the estate of the marquis lady charlottes father her ladyships brother was a member of wilfrids club he calls besworth the most habitable place in the county and promises to be there as many months out of the twelve as you like to have him i agree with him that stornley cant hold a candle to it there are three residences in england that might be preferred to it and of those two are ducal the letter was a piece of that easy diplomacy which comes from habit the of those two are ducal was masterly it affected the imagination of brookfield which two and could besworth be brought to rival them ultimately it might be the neighbourhood to london too gave it noble advantages rapid relays of guests and a metropolitan reputation for country attractions would distinguish besworth above most english houses a house where all the chief celebrities might be encountered a house under suave feminine rule a house a home to a chosen set and a refreshing fountain to a widening circle we have a dispute they wrote playfully to wilfrid a dispute we wish you or lady charlotte to settle i arabella know nothing of trout i cornelia know nothing of riverbeds i adela know nothing of engineering but we are persuaded the latter that the river running for a mile through besworth grounds may be deepened we are persuaded the intermediate that the attempt will damage the channel we are persuaded the first that all the fish will go in reply wilfrid appeared to have taken them in earnest i rode over yesterday with lady charlotte he said we think something might be done without at all endangering the fish or spoiling the channel at all events the idea of making the mile of broad water serviceable for boats is too good to give up in a hurry how about the dininghall i told lady charlotte you were sure to insist upon a balcony for musicians she laughed you will like her when you know her thus the ladies of brookfield were led on to be more serious concerning besworth than they had thought of being and began to feel that their honour was pledged to purchase this surpassing family seat in a household where every want is supplied and money as a topic utterly banished it is not surprising that they should have had imperial views adela was wilfrids favoured correspondent she described to him gaily the struggle with their papa but if you care for besworth you may calculate on itor is it only for our sakes as i sometimes thinkbesworth is won nothing but the cost of the place to be considered you know could withhold it from us and of that papa has not uttered a syllable though he conjures up every possible objection to a change of abode and will not perhaps poor dear cannot see what we intend doing in the world now you know that rich men invariably make the question of the cost their first and loudest outcry i know that to be the case they call it their blood papa seems indifferent to this part of the affair he does not even allude to it still we do not progress it is just possible that the tinleys have an eye on beautiful besworth their own place is bad enough but good enough for them give them besworth and they will sit upon the neighbourhood we shall be invaded by everything that is mean and low and a great chance will be gone for us i think i may say for the county the country our advice is that you write to papa one of your cleverest letters we know darling what you can do with the pen as well as the sword write word that you have written wilfrids reply stated that he considered it unadviseable that he should add his voice to the request for the present the ladies submitted to this quietly until they heard from their father one evening at dinner that he had seen wilfrid in the city he doesnt waste his time like some young people i know said mr pole with a wink papa is it possible cried adela everythings possible my dear lady charlotte there is a lady charlotte who would be lady charlotte still whatever occurred mr pole laughed no no you get nothing out of me all i say is be practical the sun isnt always shining he appeared to be elated with some secret good news have you been over to besworth the last two or three days he asked the ladies smiled radiantly acknowledging wilfrids wonderful persuasive powers in their hearts no papa we have not been said adela we are always anxious to go as i think you know the merchant chirped over his glass well well theres a way straight over a gate ha ha his gaiety would have been perplexing but for the allusion to lady charlotte the sisters in their unfailing midnight consultation persuaded one another that wilfrid had become engaged to that lady they wrote forthwith fine shades to him on the subject his answer was boeotian and all about besworth press it now he said if you really want it the iron is hot and above all things let me beg you not to be inconsiderate to the squire when he and i are doing all we can for you i mean we are bound to consider him if there should happen to be anything he wishes us to do what could the word inconsiderate imply the ladies were unable to summon an idea to solve it they were sure that no daughters could be more perfectly considerate and ready to sacrifice everything to their father in the end they deputed the volunteering adela to sit with him in the library and put the question of besworth decisively in the name of all they meantime who had a contempt for sleep waited aloft to hold debate over the result of the interview an hour after midnight adela came to them looking pale and uncertain her curls seeming to drip and her blue eyes wandering about the room as if she had seen a thing that kept her in a quiver between belief and doubt the two ladies drew near to her expressing no verbal impatience from which the habit of government and great views naturally saved them but singularly curious adelas first exclamation i wish i had not gone alarmed them has any change come to papa breathed arabella cornelia smiled do you not know him too well an acute glance from adela made her ask whether besworth was to be surrendered oh no my dear we may have besworth then surely but there are conditions said arabella yes wilfrids enigma is explained bella that woman has seen papa what woman mrs chump she has our permission to see him in town if that is any consolation to her she has told him continued adela that no explanation or whatever it may be was received by her certainly not if it was not sent papa and adelas voice trembled papa will not think of besworthnot a word of ituntiluntil we consent to welcome that woman here as our guest cornelia was the first to break the silence that followed this astounding intelligence then she said besworth is not to be thought of you told him so adelas head drooped oh she cried what shall we do we shall be a laughingstock to the neighbourhood the house will have to be locked up we shall live like hermits worried by a demon her brogue do you remember it it is not simply irish its irish steeped in brine its pickled irish she feigned the bursting into tears of real vexation you speak said cornelia contemptuously as if we had very humbly bowed our heads to the infection papa making terms with us murmured arabella pray repeat his words adela tossed her curls i will as well as i can i began by speaking of besworth cheerfully saying that if he really had no strong affection for brookfield that would make him regret quitting it we saw innumerable advantages in the change of residence proposed predilectionnot affectionthat was what i said he replied that besworth was a large place and i pointed out that therein lay one of its principal merits i expected what would come he alluded to the possibility of our changing our condition you know that idea haunts him i told him our opinion of the folly of the thing i noticed that he grew red in the face and i said that of course marriage was a thing ordained but that we objected to being submerged in matrimony until we knew who and what we were i confess he did not make a bad reply of its kind youre like a youngster playing truant that he may gain knowledge what do you think of it a smart piece of cityspeech was arabellas remark cornelia placidly observing vulgarity never contains more than a minimum of the truth i said adela went on think as you will papa we know we are right he looked really angry he said that we have the absurdest ideasyou tell me to repeat his wordsof any girls that ever existed and then he put a question listen i give it without comment i dare say you all object to widows marrying again i kept myself quiet marrying again papa if they marry once they might as well marry a dozen times it was the best way to irritate him i did not intend it that is all i can say he jumped from his chair rubbed his hair and almost ran up and down the library floor telling me that i prevaricated you object to a widow marrying at allthats my question he cried out loud of course i contained my voice all the more distinctly papa when i had spoken i could scarcely help laughing he went like a pony that is being broken in crying i dont know how many times why whats your reason you may suppose darlings that i decline to enter upon explanation if a person is dense upon a matter of pure sentiment there is no ground between us he has simply a sense wanting what has all this to do with besworth i asked a great deal more than you fancy was his answer he seemed to speak every word at me in capital letters then as if a little ashamed he sat down and reached out his hand to mine and i saw his eyes were moist i drew my chair nearer to him now whether i did right or wrong in this i do not know i leave it entirely to your judgement if you consider how i was placed you will at all events excuse me what i did wasyou know the very farthest suspicion one has of an extreme possibility one does not mind mentioning i said papa if it should so happen that money is the objection to besworth we will not trouble you at this i can only say that he behaved like an insane person he denounced me as wilfully insulting him that i might avoid one subject and what on earth can that be interposed arabella you may well ask could a genie have guessed that mrs chump was at the bottom of it all the conclusion of the dreadful discussion is this that papa offers to take the purchase of besworth into his consideration if we as i said before will receive mrs chump as our honoured guest i am bound to say poor dear old man he spoke kindly as he always does and kissed me and offered to give me anything i might want i came from him stupefied i have hardly got my senses about me yet the ladies caressed her with grave looks but neither of them showed a perturbation of spirit like that which distressed adela wilfrids meaning is now explained said cornelia he is in league with papa or has given in his adhesion to papas demands at least he is another example of the constant tendency in men to be what they call practical at the expense of honour and sincerity i hope not said arabella in any case that need not depress you so seriously darling she addressed adela do you not see adela cried in response what are you both blind to the real significance of papas words i could not have believed it or am i this time too acute i pray to heaven it may be so both ladies desired her to be explicit arabella eagerly cornelia with distrust the question of a widow marrying what is this woman whom papa wishes to force on us as our guest why should he do that why should he evince anxiety with regard to our opinion of the decency of widows contemplating reunion remember previous words and hints when we lived in the city this at least you may spare us said cornelia ruffling offended adela smiled in tenderness for her beauty but it is important if we are following a track dear think over it no cried arabella it cannot be true we might easily have guessed this if we ever dreamed of impossibilities in such cases when appearances lean in one direction set principles in the opposite balance added cornelia what adela apprehends may seem to impend but we know that papa is incapable of doing it to know that shuts the gates of suspicion she has allowed herself to be troubled by a ghastly nightmare adela believed in her own judgement too completely not to be sure that her sisters were perhaps unknowingly disguising a slowness of perception they were ashamed of by thus partially accusing her of giddiness she bit her lip very well if you have no fears whatever you need not abandon the idea of besworth i abandon nothing said arabella if i have to make a choice i take that which is least objectionable i am chagrined most at the idea that wilfrid has been treacherous practical cornelia suggested you are not speaking of one of our sex questions were then put to adela whether mr pole had spoken in the manner of one who was prompted whether he hesitated as he spoke whether in short wilfrid was seen behind his tongue adela resolved that wilfrid should have one protectress you are entirely mistaken in ascribing treachery to him she said it is papa that is changed you may suppose it to be without any reason if you please i would tell you to study him for yourselves only i am convinced that these special private interviews are anything but good policy and are strictly to be avoided unless of course as in the present instance we have something directly to do toward dawn the ladies had decreed that it was policy to be quite passive and provoke no word of mrs chump by making any allusion to besworth and by fencing with the mention of the place as they rarely failed to carry out any plan deliberately conceived by them mr pole was astonished to find that besworth was altogether dropped after certain scattered attempts to bring them upon besworth he shrugged and resigned himself but without looking happy indeed he looked so dismal that the ladies began to think he had a great longing for besworth and yet he did not go there or even praise it to the discredit of brookfield they were perplexed let me ask you how it is said cornelia to mr barrett that a person whom we knowwhose actions and motives are as plain to us as though discerned through a glass should at times produce a completer mystification than any other creature or have you not observed it i have had better opportunities of observing it than most people mr barren replied with one of his saddest amused smiles i have come to the conclusion that the person we know best is the one whom we never understand you answer me with a paradox is it not the natural attendant on an assumption what assumption that you know a person thoroughly may we not do you when you acknowledge this complete mystification yes cornelia smiled when she had said it and no mr barrett with his eyes on her laughed softly which is paradox at the fountainhead but when we say we know any one we mean commonly that we are accustomed to his ways and habits of mind or that we can reckon on the predominant influence of his appetites sometimes we can tell which impulse is likely to be the most active and which principle the least restraining the only knowledge to be trusted is a grounded or scientific study of the springs that move him side by side with his method of moving the springs if you fail to do this you have two classes under your eyes you have sane and madman and it will seem to you that the ranks of the latter are constantly being swollen in an extraordinary manner the customary impression as we get older is that our friends are the maddest people in the world you see we have grown accustomed to them and now if they bewilder us our judgement in selfdefence is compelled to set them down lunatic cornelia bowed her stately head with gentle approving laughter they must go or they despatch us thither she said while her fair face dimpled into serenity the remark was of a lower nature than an intellectual discussion ordinarily drew from her but could mr barrett have read in her heart he might have seen that his words were beginning to rob that organ of its native sobriety so that when he spoke a cogent phrase she was silenced and became aware of a strange exultation in her blood that obscured grave thought cornelia attributed this display of mental weakness altogether to mr barretts mental force the interposition of a fresh agency was undreamt of by the lady meanwhile it was evident that mr pole was a victim to one of his fevers of shyness he would thrum on the table frowning and then as he met the look of one of the ladies try to disguise the thought in his head with a forced laugh occasionally he would turn toward them as if he had just caught a lost idea that was peculiarly precious the ladies drawing up to attend to the communication had a most trivial matter imparted to them and away he went several times he said to them you dont make friends as you ought and their repudiation of the charge made him repeat you dont make friendshome friends the house can be as full as we care to have it papa yes acquaintances all very well but i mean friendsrich friends we will think of it papa said adela when we want money it isnt that he murmured adela had written to wilfrid a full account of her interview with her father wilfrids reply was laconic if you cannot stand a week of the brogue give up besworth by all means he made no further allusion to the place they engaged an operabox for the purpose of holding a consultation with him in town he wrote evasively but did not appear and the ladies with emilia between them listened to every footfall by the boxdoor and were too much preoccupied to marvel that emilia was just as inattentive to the music as they were when the curtain dropped they noticed her dejection what ails you they asked let us go out of london tonight she whispered and it was difficult to persuade her that she would see brookfield again remember said adela it is you that run away from us not we from you soft chidings of this description were the only reproaches for her naughty conduct she seemed contrite very still and timid since that night of adventure the ladies were glad to observe it seeing that it lent her an air of refinement and proved her sensible to correction at last mr pole broke the silence he had returned from business humming and rubbing his hands like one newly primed with a suggestion that was the key of a knotty problem observant adela said have you seen wilfrid papa saw him in the morning mr pole replied carelessly mr barrett was at the table by the way what do you think of our law of primogeniture mr pole addressed him he replied with the usual allusion to a basis of aristocracy well its the english system said mr pole thats always in its favour at starting im englishman enough to think that there ought to be an entail of every decent bit of property eh it was observed that mr barrett reddened as he said i certainly think that a young man should not be subject to his fathers caprice fathers caprice that isnt common but if youre founding a family you must entail we agree sir from my point of view and from yours knits the family bond dont you think i mean makes the trunk of the tree firm it makes the girls poor though mr barrett saw that he had some confused legal ideas in his head and that possibly there were personal considerations in the background so he let the subject pass when the guest had departed mr pole grew demonstrative in his paternal caresses he folded adela in one arm and framed her chin in his fingers marks of affection dear to her before she had outgrown them so he said youve given up besworth have you at the name arabella and cornelia drew nearer to his chair given up besworth papa it is not we who have given it up said adela yes you have and quite right too you say whats the use of it for thats a sort of thing that always goes to the son you suppose papa that we indulge in ulterior calculations came from cornelia well you see my loveno i dont suppose it at all but to buy a place and split it up after two or three yearsi dare say they wouldnt insure me for more thats nonsense and it seems unfair to you as you must think darling papa we are not selfish it rejoiced adela to exclaim his face expressed a transparent simplemindedness that won the confidence of the ladies and awakened their ideal of generosity i know what you mean papa said arabella but we love besworth and if we may enjoy the place for the time that we are all together i shall think it sufficient i do not look beyond her sisters echoed the sentiment and sincerely they were as little sordid as creatures could be if deeply questioned it would have been found that their notion of the position providence had placed them in in other words their fathers unmentioned wealth permitted them to be as lavish as they pleased mr pole had endowed them with a temperament similar to his own and he had educated it in feminine earth it flourished wonderfully shy as himself their shyness took other forms and developed with warm youth not only did it shut them up from others which is the first effect of this disease but it tyrannized over them internally so that there were subjects they had no power to bring their minds to consider money was in the list the besworth question as at present considered involved the money question all of them felt that father and children it is not surprising therefore that they hurried over it as speedily as they could and by a most comical exhibition of implied comprehension of meanings and motives of course were only in the opening stage of the business said mr pole theres nothing decided you know lots of things got to be considered you mean what you say do you very well and you want me to think of it so i will and look my dears you know that here his voice grew husky as was the case with it when touching a shy topic even beneath the veil but they were above suspicion you know thatathat we must all give way a little to the other now and then nothing like being kind pray have no fear papa dear rang the clear voice of arabella well then youre all for besworth even though it isnt exactly for your own interest all right the ladies kissed him well each stretch a point he continued we shall get on better if we do much youre a little hard on people whore not up to the mark theres an end to that even your old father will like you better these last remarks were unintelligible to the withdrawing ladies on the morning that followed mr pole expressed a hope that his daughters intended to give him a good dinner that day and he winked humorously and kindly by which they understood him to be addressing a sort of propitiation to them for the respect he paid to his appetite papa said adela i myself will speak to cook she added with a smile thrown to her sisters without looking at them i dare say she will know who i am mr pole went down to his winecellar and was there busy with bottles till the carriage came for him a bason was fetched that he might wash off the dust and cobwebs in the passage having rubbed his hands briskly with soap he dipped his head likewise in an oblivious fit and then turning round to the ladies said what have i forgotten looking woebegone with his dripping vacant face oh ah i remember now and he chuckled gladly he had just for one moment forgotten that he was acting and a pang of apprehension had caught him when the water covered his face to the effect that he must forfeit the natural artistic sequence of speech and conduct which disguised him so perfectly away he drove nodding and waving his hand dear simple innocent old man was the pitiful thought in the bosoms of the ladies and if it was accompanied by the mute exclamation how singular that we should descend from him it would not have been for the first time they passed one of their delightful quiet days in which they paved the future with gold and if i may use so bold a figure lifted parasols against the great sun that was to shine on them now they listened to emilia and now strolled in the garden conversed on the social skill of lady gosstre who was nevertheless narrow in her range and on the capacities of mansions on the secret of mixing people in society and what to do with the women a terrible problem this latter one not terrible to hostesses at a mere rout or drum or at a dance pure and simple but terrible when you want good talk to circulate for then they are not as a body amused and when they are not amused you know they are not inclined to be harmless and in this state they are vipers and where is society then and yet you cannot do without themwhich is the revolting mystery i need not say that i am not responsible for these critical remarks such tenderness to the sex comes only from its sisters so went a day rich in fair dreams to the ladies and at the hour of their fathers return they walked across the parvenu park in a state of enthusiasm for besworth that threw some portion of its decorative light on the donor of besworth when his carriage was heard on the road they stood fast and greeted his appearance with a display of pockethandkerchiefs in the breeze a proceeding that should have astonished him being novel but seemed not to do so for it was immediately responded to by the vigorous waving of a pair of pockethandkerchiefs from the carriagewindow the ladies smiled at this piece of simplicity which prompted him to use both his hands as if one would not have been enough complacently they continued waving then adela looked at her sisters cornelias hand dropped and arabella the last to wave was the first to exclaim that must be a womans arm the carriage stopped at the gate and it was one in the dress of a woman at least and of the compass of a big woman who descended by the aid of mr pole safely alighted she waved her pockethandkerchief afresh the ladies of brookfield did not speak to one another nor did they move their eyes from the object approaching a simultaneous furtive extinction of three pockethandkerchiefs might have been noticed there was no further sign given chapter xv a letter from brookfield apprised wilfrid that mr pole had brought mrs chump to the place as a visitor and that she was now in the house formal as a circular the idea of it appeared to be that the bare fact would tell him enough and inspire him with proper designs no reply being sent a second letter arrived formal too but pointing out his duty to succour his afflicted family and furnishing a few tragic particulars thus he learnt that while mr pole was advancing toward the three grouped ladies on the day of mrs chumps arrival he called arabella by name and arabella went forward alone and was engaged in conversation by mrs chump mr pole left them to make his way to adela and cornelia now mind i expect you to keep to your agreement he said gradually they were led on to perceive that this simpleminded man had understood their recent talk of besworth to signify a consent to the stipulation he had previously mentioned to adela perfect simplicity is as deceiving as the depth of cunning adela despairingly wrote much to wilfrids amusement a third letter followed it was of another tenor and ran thus in adelas handwriting my darling wilfrid we have always known that some peculiar assistance would never be wanting in our extremityaid or comfort or whatever you please to call it at all events something to show we are not neglected that old notion of ours must be true i shall say nothing of our sufferings in the house they continue yesterday papa came from town looking important he had up some of his best wine for dinner all through the service his eyes were sparkling on cornelia i spare you a family picture while there is this huge blot on it naughty brother but listen your place is here for many reasons as you will be quick enough to see after dinner papa took cornelia into the library alone and they were together for ten minutes she came out very pale she had been proposed for by sir twickenham pryme our member for the borough i have always been sure that cornelia was born for parliament and he will be lucky if he wins her we know not yet of course what her decision will be the incident is chiefly remarkable to us as a relief to what i need not recount to you but i wish to say one thing dear wilfrid you are gazetted to a lieutenancy and we congratulate you but what i have to say is apparently much more trifling and it is thatwill you take it to heartit would do arabella and myself infinite good if we saw a little more of our brother and just a little less of a very gentlemanly organplayer phenomenon who talks so exceedingly well he is a very pleasant man and appreciates our ideas and so forth but it is our duty to love our brother best and think of him foremost and we wish him to come and remind us of our duty at our cornelias request with our concurrence papa is silent in the house as to the purport of the communication made by sir tp by the way are you at all conscious of a soundlike absurdity in a christian name of three syllables preceding a surname of one sir twickenham pryme cornelias pronunciation of the name first gave me the feeling the twickenham seems to perform a sort of educated monkey kind of ridiculously decorous pirouette and entrechat before the pryme i think that cornelia feels it also you seem to fancy elastic limbs bending to the measure of a solemn churchorgan sir timothy but sir timothy does not jump with the same grave agility as sir twickenham if she rejects him it will be half attributable to this my own brother i expect no confidences but a whisper warns me that you have not been to stornley twice without experiencing the truth of our old discovery that the poles are magnetic why should we conceal it from ourselves if it be so i think it a folly and fraught with danger for people not to know their characteristics if they attract they should keep in a circle where they will have no reason to revolt at or say repent of what they attract my argumentative sister does not coincide if she did she would lose her argument adieu such is my dulness i doubt whether i have made my meaning clear your thrice affectionate adela pslady gosstre has just taken emilia to richford for a week papa starts for bidport tomorrow this short and rather blunt exercise in fine shades was read impatiently by wilfrid why doesnt she write plain to the sense he asked with the usual injustice of men who demand a statement of facts forgetting how few there are to feed the post and that indication and suggestion are the only language for the multitude of facts unborn and possible twilight best shows to the eye what may be i suppose i must go down there he said to himself keeping a meditative watch on the postscript as if it possessed the capability of slipping away and deceiving him does she mean that cornelia sees too much of this man barrett or what does she mean and now he saw meanings in the simple passages and none at all in the intricate ones and the doublemeanings were monsters that ate one another up till nothing remained of them in the end however he made a wrathful guess and came to a resolution which brought him to the door of the house next day at noon he took some pains in noting the exact spot where he had last seen emilia half in moonlight and then dismissed her image peremptorily the house was apparently empty gainsford the footman gave information that he thought the ladies were upstairs but did not volunteer to send a maid to them he stood in deferential footmans attitude with the aspect of a dog who would laugh if he could but being a footman out of his natural element cannot heres a specimen of the new plan of treating servants thought wilfrid turning away to act a farce for their benefit that fellow will explode when he gets downstairs i see how it is this woman chump is making them behave like schoolgirls he conceived the idea sharply and forthwith without any preparation he was ready to treat these highaspiring ladies like schoolgirls nor was there a lack of justification for when they came down to his shouts in the passage they hushed and held a finger aloft and looked altogether so unlike what they aimed at being that wilfrids sense of mastery became almost contempt i know perfectly what you have to tell me he said mrs chump is here you have quarrelled with her and she has shut her door and you have shut yours its quite intelligible and full of dignity i really cant smother my voice in consequence he laughed with unnecessary abandonment the sensitive young women wanted no other schooling to recover themselves in a moment they were seen leaning back and contemplating him amusedly as if he had been the comic spectacle and were laughing for a wager there are few things so sour as the swallowing of ones own forced laugh wilfrid got it down and commenced a lecture to fill the awkward pause his sisters maintained the operastall posture of languid attention contesting his phrases simply with their eyebrows and smiling he was no match for them while they chose to be silent and indeed if the business of life were conducted in dumb show women would beat men hollow they posture admirably in dumb show they are equally good for attack and defence but this is not the case in speech so when arabella explained that their hope was to see mrs chump go that day owing to the rigorous exclusion of all amusement and the outer world from the house wilfrid regained his superior footing and made his lecture tell in the middle of it there rang a cry from the doorway that astonished even him it was so powerfully irish the lady you have called down is here said arabellas cold glance in answer to his they sat with folded hands while wilfrid turned to mrs chump who advanced a shock of blue satin to the eye crying on a jump is ut mr wilfrud its i maam wilfrid bowed and the censorious ladies could not deny that his style was good if his object was to be familiar and if that was his object he was paid for it a great thick kiss was planted on his cheek with the motto harm to them that thinks ut wilfrid bore the salute like a man who presumes that he is flattered and its you said mrs chump i was just off im packed and bonnutted and ready for a start becas my dear where theres none but women i dont think it natural to stop youre splendid how a little fella like pole could go and be father to such a mighty big son with your bit of moustache and your blue eyes are they blue or a bit of grey in em mrs chump peered closely theyre killn let their colour be anyhow and i that knew ye when ye were no bigger than my garter oh sir dont talk of ut ill be thinkin of my coffin yere glad to see me say yes do very glad quoth wilfrid upon your honour now upon my honour my dears mrs chump turned to the ladies ill stop and just thank your brother fort though you cant help being garls reduced once more to demonstrate like schoolgirls by this woman the ladies rose together and were retiring when mrs chump swung round and caught arabellas hand see heer she motioned to wilfrid arabella made a bitter effort to disengage herself see now its jealsy of me mr wilfrud becas im a widde and just an abomnation to garls poor darlins and twenty shindies per dime weve been havin and me such a placable body if yell onnly let m explode im all powder avery bit and might ha been christened saltpetre if born a boy she hasnt so much as a shot to kill a goose says chump poor fella but he went anyway i must kiss somebody when i talk of m mr wilfrud ill take the girls and entitle myself to you arabella was the first victim her remonstrance was inarticulate cornelias madam was smothered adela behaved better being more consciously under wilfrids eye she prepared her pockethandkerchief received the salute and deliberately effaced it there said mrs chump duty to begin with and now for you mr wilfrud the ladies escaped their misery could not be conveyed to the mind the woman was like a demon come among them they felt chiefly degraded not by her vulgarity but by their inability to cope with it and by the consequent sickening sense of animal inefficiencythe block that was put to all imaginative delight in the golden hazy future they figured for themselves and which was their wine of life an intellectual adversary they could have combated this huge brogueburring engine quite overwhelmed them wilfrids worse than shameful behaviour was a common rallyingpoint and yet so absolutely critical were they by nature their blame of him was held mentally in restraint by the superior ease of his manner as contrasted with their own lamentably silly awkwardness highly civilized natures do sometimes and keen wits must always feel dissatisfied when they are not on the laughing side their dread of laughter is an instinctive respect for it dinner brought them all together again wilfrid took his fathers seat facing his aunt lupin and increased the distress of his sisters by his observance of every duty of a host to the dreadful intruder whom he thus established among them he was incomprehensible his visit to stornley had wrought in him a total change he used to like being petted and would regard everything as right that his sisters did before he went there and was a languid longlegged indifferent cavalier representing men to them things made to be managed snubbed admired but always virtually subservient and in the background now without perceptible gradation his superiority was suddenly manifest so that irritated and apprehensive as they were they could not by the aid of any of their intricate mental machinery look down on him they tried to they tried hard to think him despicable as well as treacherous his style was too good when he informed mrs chump that he had hired a yacht for the season and added after enlarging on the merits of the vessel i am under your orders his sisters were as creatures cut in twainone half abominating his conduct the other approving his style the bow the smile were perfect the ladies had to make an effort to recover their condemnatory judgement oh cried mrs chump and if youve got a yacht mr wilfrud wont ye have a great parcel o the arrstocracy on board you may spy a title by the aid of a telescope said wilfrid and im to come i am are you not elected captain oh if yeve got lords and real ladies on board ill come be sure of ut ill be as sick as a cat i will but ill come if its the rroon of my stomach id say to chump oh if yed only been born a lord or would just get yourself struck a knight on one o your shouldersoh chump id say it wouldnt be necessary to be rememberin always the words of the cerrmony about lovin and honourin and obeyin of a little whistle of a fella like you poor lad he couldnt stop for his luck did ye ask me to take wine mr wilfrud ill be cryin else as a widde should ye know frequent administrations of wine arrested the tears of mrs chump until it is possible that the fulness of many a checked flow caused her to redden and talk slightly at random at the first mention of their fathers name the ladies went out from the room it was foolish for they might have watched the effect of certain vinous innuendoes addressed to wilfrids apprehensiveness but they were weakened and humbled and everything they did was foolish from the fact that they offended their keen critical taste moreover they were targets to the shaft that wounds more fatally than all no ridicule knocks the strength out of us so thoroughly as our own whether or not he guessed their condition favourable for his plans wilfrid did not give them time to call back their scattered powers at the hour of eleven he sent for arabella to come to him in the library the council upstairs permitted arabella to go on the understanding that she was prepared for hostilities and ready to tear the mask from wilfrids face he commenced without a shadow of circumlocution and in a matteroffact way as if all respect for the peculiar genius of the house of pole had vanished i sent for you to talk a word or two about this woman who i see troubles you a little im sorry shes in the house indeed said arabella im sorry shes in the house not for my sake but for yours since the proximity does not seem to i neednt explain it comes of your eternal consultations you are the eldest why not act according to your judgement which is generally sound you listen to adela young as she is or a look of cornelias leads you the result is the sort of scene i saw this afternoon i confess it has changed my opinion of you it has i grieve to say it this woman is your fathers guest you cant hurt her so much as you hurt him if you misbehave to her you cant openly object to her and not cast a slur upon him there is the whole case he has insisted and you must submit you should have fought the battle before she came she is here owing to a miserable misconception said arabella ah she is here however that is the essential as your old governess madame timpan would have said nor can a protest against coarseness be sweepingly interpreted as a piece of unfilial behaviour said arabella she is coarse wilfrid nodded his head there are some forms of coarseness which dowagers would call it coarseness to notice not if you find it locked up in the house with younot if you suffer under a constant repulsion pray do not use these phrases to me wilfrid an accusation of coarseness cannot touch us no certainly assented wilfrid and you have a right to protest i disapprove the form of your protest nothing more a schoolgirlsbut you complain of the use of comparisons i complain wilfrid of your want of sympathy that for two or three weeks you must hear a brogue at your elbow the poor creature is not so bad she is goodhearted its hard that you should have to bear with her for that time and receive nothing better than besworth as your reward very seeing that we endure the evil and decline the sop with it how we have renounced besworth have you and did this renunciation make you all sit on the edge of your chairs this afternoon as if edward buxley had arranged you you give up besworth im afraid its too late oh wilfrid can you be ignorant that something more is involved in the purchase of besworth arabella gazed at him with distressful eagerness as one who believes in the lingering of a vestige of candour do you mean that my father may wish to give this woman his name said wilfrid coolly you have sense enough to know that if you make his home disagreeable you are taking the right method to drive him into such a course ha i dont think its to be feared unless you pursue these consultations and let me say for my part we have gone too far about besworth and cant recede i have given out everywhere that the place is ours i did so almost at your instigation besworth was nothing to me till you cried it up and now i wont detain you i know i can rely on your sense if you will rely on it good night bella as she was going a faint spark of courage revived arabellas wits seeing that she was now ready to speak he opened the door wide and she kissed him and went forth feeling driven but while arabella was attempting to give a definite version of the interview to her sisters a message came requesting adela to descend the ladies did not allow her to depart until two or three ingenuous exclamations from her made them share her curiosity ah wilfrid caught her hand as she came in no i dont intend to let it go you may be a fine lady but youre a rogue you know and a charming one as i hear a friend of mine has been saying shall i call him out shall i fight him with pistols or swords and leave him bleeding on the ground because he thinks you a pretty rogue adela struggled against the blandishment of this old familiar style of conversepart fun part flatterydismissed since the great idea had governed brookfield please tell me what you called me down for dear to give you a lesson in sitting on chairs adela or the puritan sister thus you sit on the extremest edge and your eyes peruse the ceiling and oh will you ever forget that perfectly ridiculous scene adela cried in anguish she was led by easy stages to talk of besworth understand said wilfrid that i am indifferent about it the idea sprang from youi mean from my pretty sister adela who is president of the council of three i hold that young woman responsible for all that they do am i wrong oh very well you suggested besworth at all events andif we quarrel i shall cut off one of your curls we never will quarrel my darling quoth adela softly unless she added wilfrid kissed her forehead unless what well then you must tell me who it is that talks of me in that objectionable manner i do not like it shall i convey that intimation i choose to ask simply that i may defend myself i choose to keep him buried then simply to save his life adela made a mouth and wilfrid went on by the way i want you to know lady charlotte you will take to one another she likes you alreadysays you want dash but on that point there may be two opinions if dash said adela quite beguiled that is dashwhat does it mean but if lady charlotte means by dasham i really wanting in it i should define it the quality of being openly natural without vulgarity and surely then you two differ a little and must meet and settle your dispute you dont differ about besworth or didnt i never saw a woman so much in love with a place as she is a place emphasized adela dont be too arch i comprehend she wont take me minus besworth you may be sure did you wilfridbut you did notoffer yourself as owner of besworth wilfrid kept his eyes slanting on the floor now i see why you should still wish it continued adela perhaps you dont know the reason which makes it impossible or i would saybacchus it must be compassed you remember your old schoolboy oath which you taught me we used to swear always by bacchus adela laughed and blushed like one who petitions pardon for this her utmost sin that is not regretted as it should be mrs chump again isnt it said wilfrid pole would be a preferable name if she has the ambition it elevates her and it would be rather amusing to see the dear old boy in love adela gave her underlip a distressful bite why do you wilfridwhy treat such matters with levity levity i am the last to treat ninety thousand pounds with levity has she so much adela glanced at him she will be snapped up by some poor nobleman if i take her down to the yacht one of lady charlottes brothers or uncles will bite to a certainty it would be an excellent idea to take her cried adela excellent and ill do it if you like could you bear the reflex of the woman dont you know that i am not in the habit of sitting on the extreme edge adela started breathing piteously wilfrid dear you want something of mewhat is it simply that you should behave civilly to your fathers guest i had a fear dear but i think too well of you to entertain it for a moment if civility is to win besworth for you there is my hand be civilthats all said wilfrid pressing the hand given these consultations of yours and acting in concertone tongue for three womenare a sort of missish unripe nonsense that one sees only in bourgeoise girlseh give it up lady charlotte hit on it at a glance and i my chameleon brother will return her the compliment some day adela said to herself as she hurried back to her sisters bearing a message for cornelia this lady required strong persuasion a word from adela he will think you have some good reason to deny him a private interview sent her straight to the stairs wilfrid was walking up and down with his arms folded and his brows bent cornelia stood in the doorway you desire to speak to me wilfrid and in private i didnt wish to congratulate you publicly thats all i know its rather against your taste well shut the door and sit down if you dont mind yes i congratulate you with all my heart he said placing a chair for cornelia may i ask wherefore you dont think marriage a matter for congratulation sometimes as the case may be well its not marriage yet i congratulate you on your offer i thank you you accept it of course i reject it certainly after this preliminary passage wilfrid remained silent long enough for cornelia to feel uneasy i want you to congratulate me also he recommenced we poor fellows dont have offers you know to be frank i think lady charlotte chillingworth will have me ifshes awfully fond of besworth and i need not tell you that as she has position in the world i ought to show something in return when you wrote about besworth i knew it was as good as decided i told her so andwell i fancy theres that sort of understanding between us she will have me when you know how the poorer members of the aristocracy are situated her fathers a peer and has a little influence he might push me but she is one of a large family she has nothing i am certain you will not judge of her as common people might she does me a particular honour is she not much older than you wilfrid said cornelia or in other words he added is she not a very mercenary person that i did not even imply honestly was it not in your head now you put it so plainly i do say it strikes me disagreeably i have heard of nothing like it do you think it unreasonable that i should marry into a noble family that is assuredly not my meaning nevertheless you are on the whole in favour of beggarly alliances no wilfrid why do you reject this offer that has been made to you cornelia flushed and trembled the traitorous feint had thrown her off her guard she said faltering would you have me marry one i do not love well well he drew back you are going to do your best to stop the purchase of besworth no i am quiescent though i tell you how deeply it concerns me wilfrid my own brother cornelia flung herself before him catching his hand i wish you to be loved first of all think of the horror of a loveless marriage however gilded does a woman make stipulations ere she gives her hand does not love seek to give to bestow i wish you to marry well but chiefly that you should be loved wilfrid pressed her head in both his hands i never saw you look so handsome he said youve got back your old trick of blushing too why do you tremble by the way you seem to have been learning a great deal about that business lately what business love a river of blood overflowed her fair cheeks how long has this been his voice came to her there was no escape she was at his knees and must look up or confess guilt this come my dearest girl wilfrid soothed her i can help you and will if youll take advice ive always known your heart was generous and tender under that ice you wear so well how long has this been going on wilfrid you want plain speech she wanted that still less well call it this he said i have heard of it guessed it and now see it how far have you pledged yourself in this how far wilfrid held silent finding that her echo was not accepted as an answer she moaned his name lovingly it touched his heart where a great susceptibility to passion lay as if the ghost of emilia were about him he kissed his sisters hand and could not go on with his cruel interrogations his next question was dew of relief to her has your emilia been quite happy of late oh quite dear very and sings with more fire shes cheerful she does not romp her eyes are full and bright shes satisfied with everything here how could she be otherwise yes yes you werent severe on her for that escapadei mean when she ran away from lady gosstres we scarcely alluded to the subject or permitted her to or permitted her to wilfrid echoed with a grimace and shes cheerful now quite i mean she doesnt mope why should she cornelia had been too hardpressed to have suspicion the questions were an immense relief wilfrid mused gloomily cornelia spoke further of emilia and her delight in the visits of mr powys who spent hours with her like a man fascinated she flowed on little aware that she was fast restoring to wilfrid all his judicial severity he said at last i suppose theres no engagement existing engagement you have not what they call plighted your troth to the man cornelia struggled for evasion she recognized the fruitlessness of the effort and abandoning it stood up i am engaged to no one well i should hope not said wilfrid an engagement might be broken not by me it might is all that i say a romantic sentiment is tougher now i have been straightforward with you will you be with me i shall not hurt the man or wound his feelings he paused but it was to find that no admission of the truth save what oozed out in absence of speech was to be expected she seemed after the fashion of women to have got accustomed to the new atmosphere into which he had dragged her without any conception of a forward movement i see i must explain to you how we are situated said wilfrid we are in a serious plight you should be civil to this woman for several reasonsfor your fathers sake and your own she is very rich oh wilfrid well i find money well thought of everywhere has your late school been good for you this woman i repeat is rich and we want money oh not the ordinary notion of wanting money but the more we have the more power we have our position depends on it yes if we can be tempted to think so flashed cornelia our position depends on it if you posture and are poor you provoke ridicule and to think of scorning money is a piece of folly no girls of condition are guilty of now you know i am fond of you so ill tell you this you have a chance dont miss it something unpleasant is threatening but you may escape it it would be madness to throw such a chance away and it is your duty to take advantage of it what is there plainer you are engaged to no one cornelia came timidly close to him pray be explicit wellthis offer yes but whatthere is something to escape from wilfrid deliberately replied there is no doubt of the paters intentions with regard to mrs chump he means he means to marry her and you wilfrid well of course he cuts me out therethere forgive me but what can i do do you conspirewilfrid is it possibleare you an accomplice in the degradation of our house cornelia had regained her courage perforce of wrath wilfrids singular grey eyes shot an odd look at her he is to be excused for not perceiving the grandeur of the structure menaced for it was invisible to all the world though a real fabric if mrs chump were poor i should think the pater demented he said as it is well as it is theres grist to the mill wind to the organ you must be aware and he leaned over to her with his most suspicious gentleness of tone you are aware that all organs must be fed but you will make a terrible mistake if you suppose for a moment that the human organ requires the same sort of feeding as the one in hillford church goodnight said cornelia closing her lips as if for good wilfrid pressed her hand as she was going the springs of kindness in his heart caused him to say forgive me if i seemed rough yes dear wilfrid even brutality rather than your exultation over the wreck of what was noble in you with which phrase cornelia swept from the room chapter xvi seen wilfrid was mr poles first cheery call to his daughters on his return an answer on that head did not seem to be required by him for he went on ah the boys improved that place over there stornley does him as much good as the army did as to setting him up you know common sense and a ready way of speaking and thinking he sees a thing now well martha what do youeh whats your opinion mrs chump was addressed pole she said fanning her cheek with vehement languor dont ask me my hearts gone to the young fella in pursuance of a determination to which the ladies of brookfield had come adela following her sprightly fancy now gave the lead in affability toward mrs chump has the conqueror run away with it to bury it she laughed och wont he know what it is to be a widde cried mrs chump a widdes heart takes aim and flies straight as a bullet and the hearts o you garls theyre like whiffs o tobacca curlin and wrigglin and not knowin where theyre goin marry em pole marry em mrs chump gesticulated with two dangling hands theyre nice garls but lord they naver see a man and theyre stuputly contented and want to remain garls and dont ye see it was naver meant to be says i to mr wilfrud and he agreed with me ye might say nice sour grapes as well as nice garls if the creatures think o stoppin where they are and what they are its horrud and upon my honour my heart aches for m mr pole threw an uneasy sideglance of inquisition at his daughters to mark how they bore this unaccustomed language and haply intercede between the unworthy woman and their judgement of her but the ladies merely smiled placidly triumphant in its endurance the smile said we decline even to feel such a martyrdom as this well you know martha i he said ino father could wisheh if you could manage to persuade them not to be so fond of me they must think of their future of course they wont always have a homea father a father i mean god grant they may never wanteh the dinner boh lets in to dinner maam he bowed an arm to mrs chump who took it with a scared look at him why if ye havent got a tear in your eye pole nonsense nonsense quoth he bowing another arm to adela papa im not to be winked at said she accepting convoy and there was some laughter all about nothing as they went in to dinner the ladies were studiously forbearing in their treatment of mrs chump women are wonderfully quick scholars under ridicule though it halfkills them wilfrids theory had impressed the superior grace of civility upon their minds and now that they practised it they were pleased with the contrast they presented not the less were they maturing a serious resolve the suspicion that their father had secret vile designs in relation to mrs chump they kept in the background it was enough for them that she was to be a visitor and would thus destroy the great circle they had projected to accept her in the circle they felt was out of the question wilfrids plainspeaking broke up the airbubble which they had so carefully blown and in which they had embarked all their young hopes they had as much as given one another a pledge that their home likewise should be broken up are you not almost too severe a student mr barrett happened to say to cornelia the day after wilfrid had worried her do i show the signs she replied by no means but last night was it not your light that was not extinguished till morning we soon have morning now said cornelia and her face was pale as the first hour of the dawn are you not a late footfarer i may ask in return mere restlessness i have no appetite for study i took the liberty to cross the park from the wood and saw youat least i guessed it your light and then i met your brother yes you met him mr barrett gestured an affirmative and hedid he speak he nodded he was in some haste but then you did not go to bed at all that night it is almost my turn to be lecturer if i might expect to be listened to do you not knowor am i constitutionally different from others mr barrett resumed i cant be alone in feeling that there are certain times and periods when what i would like to call poisonous influences are abroad that touch my fate in the days to come i know i am helpless i can only wander up and down that sounds like a creed of fatalism it is not a creed it is a matter of nerves a creed has its kismet the nerves are wild horses it is something to be fought against said cornelia admonishingly is it something to be distrusted i should say yes then i was wrong he stooped eagerly in his temperate way to catch sight of her answering face cornelias quick cheeks took fire she fenced with a question of two and stood in a tremble marvelling at his intuition for possibly at that moment when he stood watching her windowlight ah poor heart she was halfpledging her word to her sisters in a whirl of wrath at wilfrid herself and the world that she would take the lead in breaking up brookfield an event occurred that hurried them on they received a visit from their mothers brother john pierson a colonel of uhlans in the imperialroyal service he had rarely been in communication with them his visit was unexpected his leave of absence from his quarters in italy was not longer than a month and he was on his way to ireland to settle family business but he called as he said to make acquaintance with his nieces the ladies soon discovered in spite of his foreigncut chin and pronounced military habit of speech and bearing that he was at heart fervidly british his age was about fifty a man of great force of shoulder and potent length of arm courteous and wellbred in manner he was altogether what is called a model of a cavalry officer colonel pierson paid very little attention to his brotherinlaw but the ladies were evidently much to his taste and when he kissed cornelias hand his eyes grew soft as at a recollection you are what your mother once promised to be he said to her he gave that mothers portrait taking it solemnly from his breastpocket and attentively contemplating it before it left his hands the ladies pressed him for a thousand details of their mamas youthful life they found it a strange consolation to talk of her and image her like cornelia the foreign halo about the colonel had an effect on them that was almost like what nobility produces and by degrees they heated their minds to conceive that they were consenting to an outrage on that mothers memory in countenancing mrs chumps transparent ambition to take her place as they did by staying in the house with the woman the colonels few expressive glances at mrs chump and mrs chumps behaviour before the colonel touched them with intense distaste for their present surly aspect of life civilized little people are moved to fulfil their destinies and to write their histories as much by distaste as by appetite this fresh sentimental emotion which led them to glorify their mothers image in their hearts heightened and gave an acid edge to their distaste for the think they saw nor was it wonderful that cornelia said to be so like that mother should think herself bound to accept the office of taking the initiative in a practical protest against the desecration of the name her mother had borne at times i see that sentiment approaches too near the holy of earthly holies for us to laugh at it it has too much truth in it to be denouncednay if we are not alert and quick of wit we shall be deceived by it and wonder in the end as the fool does why heaven struck that final blow concluding that it was but another whimsy of the gods the ladies prayed to their mother they were indeed suffering vile torture ethereal eyes might pardon the unconscious jugglery which made their hearts cry out to her that the step they were about to take was to save her children from seeming to acquiesce in a dishonour to her memory some such words adelas tongue did not shrink from and as it is a common habit for us to give to the objects we mentally address just as much brain as is wanted for the occasion she is not to be held singular colonel pierson promised to stay a week on his return from ireland will that person be here he designated mrs chump who among other things had reproached him for fighting with foreign steel and wearing any uniform but the red the ladies and colonel pierson were soon of one mind in relation to mrs chump certain salient quiet remarks dropped by him were cherished after his departure they were halfwilling to think that he had been directed to come to them bearer of a message from a heavenly world to urge them to action they had need of a spiritual exaltation to relieve them from the palpable depression caused by the weight of mrs chump they encouraged one another with exclamations on the oddness of a visit from their mothers brother at such a time of tribulation indecision and general darkness mrs chump remained on the field when adela begged her papa to tell her how long the lady was to stay he replied eh by the way i havent asked her and retreated from this almost too obvious piece of simplicity with i want you to know her i want you to like herwant you to get to understand her wont talk about her going just yet if they could have seen a limit to that wholesale slaughter of the nice feelings they might have summoned patience to avoid the desperate step to immediate relief but they saw none their fathers quaint kindness and wilfrids treachery had fixed her there perhaps for good the choice was to let london come and see them dragged through the mire by the monstrous woman or to seek new homes london they contended could not further be put off and would come especially now that the season was dying after all their parting from one another was the bitterest thing to bear and as each seemed content to endure it for the good of all and as properly considered they did not bury their ambition by separating they said farewell to the young delicious dawn of it by means of fine shades it was understood that brookfield was to be abandoned not one direct word was uttered there were expressions of regret that the village children of ipley would miss the supervizing eyes that had watched over themperchance at any rate would lose them all went on in the household as before and would have continued so but that they had a chief among them this was adela pole who found her powers with the occasion adela thought decisively people never move unless they are pushed and when you have got them to move ever so little then propel but by no means expect that a movement on their part means progression without propulsion nothing results adela saw what cornelia meant to do it was not to fly to sir twickenham but to dismiss mr barrett arabella consented to write to edward buxley but would not speak of old days and barely alluded to a misunderstanding though if she loved one man this was he adela was disengaged she had moreover to do penance for a wrong committed and just as children will pinch themselves pleased up to the verge of unendurable pain so do sentimentalists find a keen relish in performing secret penance for selfaccused offences thus they become righteous to their own hearts and evade as they hope the public scourge the wrong committed was translated out of fine shades that she had made love to her sisters lover in the original tongueshe had innocently played with the sacred fire of a strange affection a child in the templeour penitent child took a keen pinching pleasure in dictating words for arabella to employ toward edward and then recurring to her interview with wilfrid it struck her suppose that after all money yes mammon has acted hymen before now nothing else explained mrs chump so she thought in one clear glimpse inveterate sentimental habit smeared the picture with two exclamationsimpossible and papa i desire it to be credited that these simple interjections absolutely obscured her judgement little people think either what they are made to think or what they choose to think and the education of girls is to make them believe that facts are their enemiesa naughty spying race upon whom the dogs of pudeur are to be loosed if they surprise them without note of warning adela silenced her suspicion easily enough but this did not prevent her taking a measure to satisfy it petting her papa one evening she suddenly asked him for ninety pounds ninety said mr pole taking a sharp breath he was as composed as possible is that too much papa darling not if you want itnot if you want it of course not you seemed astonished the sum its an odd sum for a girl to want ten twenty fiftya hundred but you never hear of ninety never unless its to pay a debt and i have all the bills or your aunt has them well papa if it excites you i will do without it it is for a charity chiefly mr pole fumbled in his pocket muttering no money herechequebook in town ill give it you he said aloud tomorrow morningmorrow morning early that will do papa and adela relieved him immediately by shooting far away from the topic the ladies retired early to their hall of council in the bedchamber of arabella and some time after midnight cornelia went to her room but she could not sleep she affected in her restlessness to think that her spirits required an intellectual sedative so she went down to the library for a book where she skimmed manya fashion that may be recommended for assisting us to a sense of sovereign superiority to authors and also of serene contempt for all mental difficulties fortified in this way cornelia took a plutarch and an encyclopaedia under her arm to return to her room but one volume fell and as she stooped to recover it her candle shared its fate she had to find her way back in the dark on the landing of the stairs she fancied that she heard a step and a breath the lady was of unshaken nerves she moved on steadily her hand stretched out a little before her what it touched was long in travelling to her brain but when her paralyzed heart beat again she knew that her hand clasped another hand her nervous horror calmed as the feeling came to her of the palpable weakness of the hand who are you she asked some hoarse answer struck her ear she asked again making her voice distincter the hand now returned her pressure with force she could feel that the person whoever it was stood collecting strength to speak then the words came what do you mean by imitating that womans brogue papa said cornelia why do you talk irish in the dark there goodnight ive just come up from the library my candle dropped i shouldnt have been frightened but you talked with such a twang but i have just come from the library myself said cornelia i mean from the diningroom her father corrected himself hastily i cant sit in the library shall have it alteredfull of draughts dont you think so my dear goodnight whats this in your arm books ah you study i can get a light for myself the dialogue was sustained in the hardwhispered tones prescribed by darkness cornelia kissed her fathers forehead and they parted at breakfast in the morning it was the habit of all the ladies to assemble partly to countenance the decency of matinprayers and also to give the head of the household their dutiful society till business called him away adela in earlier days had maintained that early rising was not fashionable but she soon grasped the idea that a great rivalry with fashion in minor matters where the support of the satirist might be counted on was the proper policy of brookfield mrs chump was given to be extremely fashionable in her hours and began her brookfield career by coming downstairs at ten and eleven oclock when she found a desolate table well stocked indeed but without any of the exuberant smiles of nourishment which a morning repast should wear you are a protestant maam are you not adela mildly questioned after informing her that she missed family prayer by her late descent mrs chump assured her that she was a firm protestant and liked to see faces at the breakfasttable the poor woman was reduced to submit to the rigour of the hour coming down flustered and endeavouring to look devout while many uncertainties as to the condition of the hooks of her attire distracted her mind and fingers on one occasion gainsford the footman had been seen with his eye on her and while mr pole read of sacred things at a pace composed of slow march and amble this unhappy man was heard struggling to keep under and extinguish a devil of laughter by which his human weakness was shaken he retired from the room with the speed of a voyager about to pay tribute on high seas mr pole cast a pregnant look at the servants row as he closed the book but the expression of his daughters faces positively signified that no remark was to be made and he contained himself later the ladies told him that gainsford had done no worse than any uneducated man would have been guilty of doing mrs chump had it appeared a mothers feeling for one flat curl on her rugged forehead which was often fondly caressed by her for the sake of ascertaining its fixity doubts of the precision of outline and general welfare of this curl apparently caused her to straighten her back and furtively raise her head with an easy upward motion as of a cork alighted in water above the level of the lookingglass on her left handan action she repeated with a solemn aspect four times at which point gainsford gave way the ladies accorded him every extenuation for the offence they themselves but for the heroism of exalted natures must have succumbed to the gross temptation it is difficult dear papa to bring ones mind to religious thoughts in her company even when she is quiescent they said thus by the prettiest exercise of charity that can be conceived they pleaded for the man gainsford while they struck a blow at mrs chump and in performing one of the virtues laid down by religion proved their enemy to be hostile to its influences mrs chump was this morning very late the office of morning reader was new to mr pole who had undertaken it when first squire of brookfield at the dictate of the ladies his daughters so that waiting with the book before him and his audience expectant he lacked composure spoke irritably in an underbreath of that woman and asked twice whether she was coming or not at last the clump of her feet was heard approaching mr pole commenced reading the instant she opened the door she stood there with a face like a petrified irish outcry an imploring sound of pole pole issued from her then she caught up one hand to her mouth and rolled her head in evident anguish at the necessitated silence a convulsion passed along the row of maids two of whom dipped to their aprons but the ladies gazed with a sad consciousness of wicked glee at the disgust she was exciting in the bosom of their father will you shut the door mr pole sternly addressed mrs chump at the conclusion of the first prayer pole ye know that money ye gave me in notes i must speak pole shut the door mrs chump let go the doorhandle with a moan the door was closed by gainsford now one of the gravest of footmen a chair was placed for her and she sat down desperately watching the reader for the fall of his voice the period was singularly protracted the ladies turned to one another to question with an eyelid why it was that extra allowance was given that morning mr pole was in a third prayer stumbling on and picking himself up apparently unaware that he had passed the limit this continued until the series of ejaculations which accompanied him waxed hotterlittle muffled shrieks of ohdeeroh lardwhen will he stop oh mercy och and me burrstin to speakoh whatll i do i cant keep t inpole yere killn meoh deer ill be sayin somethin to vex the prophets presently pole if it was a race that he ran with mrs chump mr pole was beaten he came to a sudden stop mrs chump had become too deeply absorbed in her impatience to notice the change in his tone and when he said now then to breakfast quick she was pursuing her lamentable interjections at sight of the servants trooping forth she jumped up and ran to the door ye dont gopole theyre all here and ive been robbed i have avery note i had from ye pole all gone and my purse left behind like the skin of a thing lord forbid i accuse annybody but when i get up my first rush is to feel in my pocket and ask emif ye didnt keep me so poor pole theyd know im a generous woman but i cannt bear to be robbed and pinmoney s for spendin annybodyll tell you that and i ask ye t examine em pole for last night i counted my notes wantin change and i thought of a salmon i bought on the banks of the suir to make a present to chump which was our onnly visit to waterford together for he naver went t ireland before or afterdyin as he did and its not his ingrattude with his talk of a severrn salmonto the deuce with m that makes me softpoor fellai didnt mean to the deucebut since hes gone his widdes just unfit to bargain for a salmon at all and averybody robs her and shes kept poor and hatuddye heer pole ive lost my money my money and i will speak and ye shannt interrupt me during the delivery of this charge against the household mr pole had several times waved to the servants to begone but as they had always the option to misunderstand authoritative gestures they preferred remaining and possibly he perceived that they might claim to do so under accusation how can you bring this charge against the inmates of my houseeh i guarantee the honesty of all who serve me martha you must be mad madmoney why you never have money you waste it if you do not money pole oh and why becas ye keep me low o purpose till i cringe like a slut o the scullery and cry out for halfpence but oh that seventyfive pounds in notes mr pole shook his head as one who deals with a gross delusion i remember nothing about it not about mrs chump dropped her chin ye dont remember the givin of me just that sum of seventyfive in eight notes pole eh i daresay i have given you the amount one time or other now lets be quiet about it yesterday mornin pole and the night i go to bed i count my money and says i ill not lock ut up for ill onnly be unlockin again tomorrow and doin a thing and undoin uts a sign of a brain thats addledlike yours pole if ye say ye didnt go to give me the notes mr pole frowned at her sagaciously must change your diet martha my dite and whats my dite to do with my money who went into mrs chumps bedchamber this morning asked mr pole generally a pretty little housemaid replied with an indignant flush that she was the person mrs chump acknowledged to being awake when the shutters were opened and agreed that it was not possible her pockets could have been rifled then so you see martha youre talking nonsense said mr pole do you know the numbers of those notes the numbers at the sides ye mean pole ay the numbers at the sides if you like the and so on the oh i cant remember such a lot as that if ever i leave off repeatin it there you see youre not fit to have money in your possession martha everybody who has banknotes looks at the numbers you have a trick of fancying all sorts of sums in your pocket and when you dont find them there of course theyre lost now lets have some breakfast arabella told the maids to go out mr pole turned to the breakfasttable rubbing his hands seeing herself and her case abandoned mrs chump gave a deplorable shout yere crool and young women that look on at a fellowwomans misry oh how can ye do ut but soft hearts can be the hardest and all my seventyfive gone gone and no law out of annybody and no frightenin of em off from doin the like another time oh i will i will have my money tush come to breakfast martha said mr pole you shall have money if you want it you have only to ask now will you promise to be quiet and ill give you this moneythe amount youve been dreaming about last night ill fetch it now let us have no scenes dry your eyes mr pole went to his private room and returned just as mrs chump had got upon a succession of quieter sobs with each one of which she addressed a pathetic roll of her eyes to the utterly unsympathetic ladies respectively there martha theres exactly the sum for youfree gift say thank you and eat a good breakfast to show your gratitude mind you take this money on condition that you let the servants know you made a mistake mrs chump sighed heavily crumpling the notes that the crisp sweet sound might solace her for the hard condition and dont dream any morenot about money i mean said mr pole oh if i dream like that ill be living double mrs chump put her hand to the notes and called him kind and pitied him for being the loser the sight of a fresh sum in her possession intoxicated her it was but feebly that she regretted the loss to her samuel bolton pole your memorys worth more than that she said as she filled her purse with the notes anyhow now i can treat somebody and she threw a wink of promise at adela adelas eyes took refuge with her papa who leaned over to her and said you wont mind waiting till you see me again shes taken all i had adela nodded blankly and the next moment with an angry glance toward mrs chump papa said she if you wish to see servants in the house on your return you must yourself speak to them and tell them that we their master and mistresses do not regard them as thieves out of this there came a quarrel as furious as the ladies would permit it to be for mrs chump though willing to condone the offence for the sum she had received stuck infamy upon the whole list of them the celtic nature murmured cornelia and the ladies maintained that their servants should be respected at any cost you maam said arabella with a clear look peculiar to her when vindictiveyou may have a stain on your character and you are not ruined by it but these poor creatures ye dare to compar me contrast you maam its just as impdent i say our servants maam oh to the deuce with your maam i hate the word its like fittin a cap on me ye want to make one a turbaned dowger ye malicious young woman those are personages that are i believe accepted in society so the contest raged mrs chump being run clean through the soul twenty times without touching the consciousness of that sensitive essence mr pole appeared to take the part of his daughters and byandby mrs chump having failed to arouse mrs lupins involuntary laugh which always consoled her in such cases huffed out of the room then mr pole in an abruptly serious way bashfully entreated the ladies to be civil to martha who had the best heart in the world it sounded as if he were going to say more after a pause he added emphatically do and went he was many days absent nor did he speak to adela of the money she had asked for when he returned adela had not the courage to allude to it chapter xvii emilia sat in her old place under the dwarf pine mr powys had brought her back to brookfield where she heard that wilfrid had been seen and now her heart was in contest with an inexplicable puzzle he was here and did not come to me since that night when they had walked home from ipley green she had not suffered a moment of longing her senses had lain as under a charm with heart at anchor and a mind free to work no one could have guessed that any human spell was on the girl wherever he is he thinks of me i find him everywhere he is safe for i pray for him and have my arms about him he will come so she waited as some grey lake lies full and smooth awaiting the star below the twilight if she let her thoughts run on to the hour of their meeting she had to shut her eyes and press at her heart but as yet she was not out of tune for daily life and she could imagine how that hour was to be strewn with new songs and hushed surprises and thus he would look and thus my hero breathed emilia shuddering a little but now she was perplexed now that he had come and gone she began to hunger bitterly for the sight of his face and that which had hitherto nourished her grew a sickly phantom of delight she wondered how she had forced herself to be patient and what it was that she had found pleasure in none of the ladies were at home when emilia returned she went out to the woods and sat shadowed by the long bent branch watching mechanically the slow rounding and yellowing of the beam of sunlight over the thick floor of moss up against the firstems the chaffinch and the linnet flitted off the grey orchard twigs singing from new stations and the bee seemed to come questioning the silence of the woods and droning disappointed away the first excess of any sad feeling is half voluntary emilia could not help smiling when she lifted her head out of a musing fit to find that she had composed part of a minuet for the languid dancing motes in the shaft of golden light at her feet can i remember it she thought and forgot the incident with the effort down at her right hand bordering a water stood a sallow a dead tree channelled inside with the brown trail of a goatmoth looking in this direction she saw cornelia advancing to the tree when the lady had reached it she drew a little book from her bosom kissed it and dropped it in the hollow this done she passed among the firs emilia had perceived that she was agitated and with that strange instinct of hearts beginning to stir which makes them divine at once where they will come upon the secret of their own sensations she ran down to the tree and peered on tiptoe at the embedded volume on a blank page stood pencilled this is the last fruit of the tree come not to gather more there was no meaning for her in that sentimental chord but she must have got some glimpse of a meaning for now as in an agony her lips fashioned the words if i forget his face i may as well die and she wandered on striving more and more vainly to call up his features thedoes he think of me andwhat am i to himsuch timorous little featherplay of feminine emotion she knew nothing of in her heart was the strong flood of a passion she met edward buxley and freshfield sumner at a crosspath on their way to brookfield and then adela joined the party which soon embraced mr barrett and subsequently cornelia all moved on in a humming leisure chattering by fits mr sumner was delicately prepared to encounter mrs chump whom said adela edward himself finds it impossible to caricature and she affected to laugh at the woman happy the pencil that can reproduce mr barrett exclaimed and meeting his smile cornelia said do you know my feeling is and i cannot at all account for it that if she were a catholic she would not seem so gross some of the poetry of that religion would descend upon her possibly returned mr barrett do you mean freshfield said quickly that she would stand a fair chance of being sainted out of this arose some polite fencing between the two freshfield might have argued to advantage in a court of law but he was no match on such topics and before such an audience for a refined sentimentalist more than once he betrayed a disposition to take refuge in his class he being son to one of the puisne judges cornelia speedily punished him and to any correction from her he bowed his head adela was this day gifted with an extraordinary insight emilia alone of the party was as a blot to her but the others she saw through as if they had been walking transparencies she divined that edward and freshfield had both come in concert upon amorous businessthat it was freshfields object to help edward to a private interview with her and in return edward was to perform the same service for him with cornelia so that mr barrett was shockingly in the way of both and the perplexity of these stupid fellowswho would insist upon wondering why the man barrett and the girl emilia musicians both both as it were vagrants did not walk together and talk of quavers and minimswas extremely comic passing the withered tree mr barrett deserved thanks from freshfield if he did not obtain them for he lingered surrendering his place and then adela knew that the weight of edward buxleys remonstrative wrath had fallen on silent emilia to whom she clung fondly i have had a letter edward murmured in the voice that propitiates secresy a letter she cried loud and off flew the man like a rabbit into his hole the mask of him remaining emilia presently found mr barrett at her elbow his hand clasped the book cornelia had placed in the tree it is hers said emilia he opened it and pointed to his initials she looked in his face are you very ill adela turned round from edwards neighbouring head who is ill cornelia brought freshfield to a stop ill before them all book in hand mr barrett had to give assurance that he was hearty and to appear to think that his words were accepted in spite of blanched jowl and reddened underlid cornelia threw him one glance his eyes closed under it adela found it necessary to address some such comforting exclamation as goodness gracious to her observant spirit in the parkpath leading to the wood arabella was seen as they came out the young branches that fringed the firs she hurried up i have been looking for you papa has arrived with sir twickenham pryme who dines with us adela unhesitatingly struck a blow lady pryme we make place for you and she crossed to cornelia cornelia kept her eyes fixed on adelas mouth as one looks at a place whence a venomous reptile has darted out her eyelids shut and she stood a white sculpture of pain pitiable to see emilia took her hand encouraging the tightening fingers with a responsive pressure the group shuffled awkwardly together though adela did her best she was very angry with mr barrett for wearing that absurdly pale aspect she was even angry with his miserable bankrupt face for mounting a muscular edition of the smile cornelia had shown his feelings she cried internally and the fact presented itself to her that feelings were a luxury utterly unfit for poor men who were to be accused of presumption for indulging in them now i suppose you are happy she spoke low between arabella and edward the effect of these words was to colour violently two pair of cheeks arabellas behaviour did not quite satisfy the fair critic edward buxley was simply caught in a trap he had the folly to imagine that by laughing he released himself is not that the laugh of an engaged said adela to freshfield he replied that would have been my idea under other conditions and looked meaningly she met the look with there are harsh conditions in life are there not and left him sufficiently occupied by his own sensations mr barrett she inquired partly to assist the wretch out of his compromising depression and also that the question represented a real matter of debate in her mind i want your opinion will you give it me apropos of slang why does it sit well on some people it certainly does not vulgarize them after all in many cases it is what they call racy idiom perhaps our delicacy is strained now it was mr barretts established manner to speak in a deliberately ready fashion upon the introduction of a new topic habit made him on this occasion respond instantly but the opening of the gates displayed the confusion of ideas within and the rageing tumult he said in many cases there are two sorts if you could call it the language of nature which anything i beg your pardon slang polite society rightly excludes it because yes yes returned adela but do we do rightly in submitting to the absolute tyrannyi mean i think originality flies from us in consequence the pitiable mortal became a trifle more luminous the objection is to the repetition of risked phrases a happy audacity of expression may pass it is bad taste to repeat it that is all then there is the slang of heavy boorishness and the slang of impatient wit is there any fine distinction between the extremes said cornelia in as clear a tone as she could summon i think observed arabella that whatever shows staleness speedily is selfcondemned and that is the case with slang and yet its to avoid some feeling of the sort that people employ it was adelas remark and the discussion of this theme dropped lifelessly and they walked on as before coming to a halt near the garden gate adela tapped emilias cheek addressing her how demure she has become ah went arabella does she know papa has had a letter from mr pericles who wrote from milan to say that he has made arrangements for her to enter the academy there and will come to fetch her in a few days emilias wrists crossed below her neck while she gave ear to take me away she said the tragic attitude and outcry with the mournful flash of her eyes might have told emilias tale adela unwillingly shielded her by interpreting the scene see she must be a born actress they always exaggerate in that style so that you would really think she had a mighty passion for brookfield or in it suggested freshfield or in it she laughed assentingly mr pole was perceived entering the garden rubbing his hands a little too obsequiously to some remark of the baronets as the critical ladies imagined sir twickenhams arm spread out in a sweep mr poles head nodded after the ceremony of the salute the ladies were informed of sir twickenhams observation sir twickenham pryme a statistical member of parliament a wellpreserved halfcentury in age a gentleman in bearing passably greyheaded his whiskers brushed out neatly as if he knew them individually and had the exact amount of them collectively at his fingers ends sir twickenham had said of mr poles infant park that if devoted to mangoldwurzel it would be productive and would pay whereas now it was not ornamental and was waste sir twickenham calculates said mr pole that we should have a crop ofeh the average sir twickenham asked on the evident upward mounting of a sum in his brain and then with a relaxing look upon cornelia perhaps you might have fifteen sixteen perhaps for the first year or sayyou see the exact acreage is unknown to me say roughly ten thousand sacks the first year of what inquired cornelia mangoldwurzel said the baronet she gazed about her mr barrett was gone but no doubt you take no interest in such reckonings sir twickenham added on the contrary i take every interest in practical details practical men believe this when they hear it from the lips of gentlewomen and without philosophically analyzing the fact that it is because the practical quality possesses simply the fascination of a form of strength sir twickenham pursued his details day closed on brookfield blankly nevertheless the ladies felt that the situation was now dignified by tragic feeling and remembering keenly how they had been degraded of late they had a sad enjoyment of the situation chapter xviii meantime wilfrid was leading a townlife and occasionally visiting stornley he was certainly not in love with lady charlotte chillingworth but he was in harness to that lady in love we have some idea whither we would go in harness we are simply driven and the destination may be anywhere to be reduced to this condition which will happen now and then in the case of very young men who are growing up to something and is if a momentary shame to them rather a sign of promise than not the gentle male need not be deeply fascinated lady charlotte was not a fascinating person she did not lay herself out to attract had she done so she would have failed to catch wilfrid whose soul thirsted for poetical refinement and filmy delicacies in a woman what she had and what he knew that he wanted and could only at intervals assume by acting as if he possessed it was a victorious aplomb which gave her a sort of gallant glory in his sight he could act it well before his sisters and here and there a damsel and coming fresh from lady charlottes school he had recently done so with success and had seen the ladies feel toward him as he felt under his instructress in the art some nature however is required for every piece of art wilfrid knew that he had been brutal in his representation of the part and the retrospect of his conduct at brookfield did not satisfy his remorseless critical judgement in consequence when he again saw lady charlotte his admiration of that one prized characteristic of hers paralyzed him she looked and moved and spoke as if the earth were her own she was a note of true music and he felt himself to be an indecisive chord capable ultimately of a splendid performance it might be but at present crying out to be played upon this is the condition of a man in harness whom witlings may call what they will he is subjugated not won in this state of subjugation he will joyfully sacrifice as much as a man in love for having no consolatory sense of happiness such as encircles and makes a nest for lovers he seeks to attain some stature at least by excesses of apparent devotion lady charlotte believed herself beloved at last she was about to strike thirty and rumour stalking with a turban of cloud on her headenough that this shocking old celestial dowager from condemnation had passed to pity of the dashing lady beloved at last after a while there is no question of our loving but we thirst for love if we have not had it the key of lady charlotte will come in the course of events she was at the doubtful hour of her life a warmhearted woman known to be so by few generally consigned by devoutvisaged scandal for who save the devout will dare to sit in the chair of judgement as a hopeless rebel against conventional laws and worse than that far worsethough what is not said at stornley the following letter from emilia hit its mark dear mr wilfrid it is time for me to see you come when you have read this letter i cannot tell you how i am because my heart feels beating in another body pray come come now come on a swift horse the thought of you galloping to me goes through me like a flame that hums you will come i know it is time if i write foolishly do forgive me i can only make sure of the spelling and i cannot please you on paper only when i see you the signature of emilia alessandra belloni was given with her wonted proud flourish wilfrid stared at the writing what all this time she has been thinking the same thing her constancy did not swim before him in alluring colours he regarded it as a species of folly disgust had left him the pool of memory would have had to be stirred to remind him of the pipesmoke in her hair you are sure to please me when you see me he murmured you are very confident young lady so much had her charm faded and then he thought kindly of her and that a meeting would not be good for her and that she ought to go to italy and follow her profession if she grows famous whispered coxcombry why then oneself will take a little of the praises given to her and that seemed eminently satisfactory men think in this way when you have loved them ladies all men no only the coxcombs but it is to these that you give your fresh affection they are as it were the band of the regiment of adorers marching ahead while we sober working soldiers follow to their music if she grows famous why then i can bear in mind that her heart was once in my possession and it may return to its old owner perchance wilfrid indulged in a pleasant little dream of her singing at the operahouse and he tied to a ferocious detested wife how softly and luxuriously would he then be sighing for the old time it was partly good seed in his nature and an apprehension of her force of soul that kept him from a thought of evil to her passion does not inspire dark appetite dainty innocence does i am told things are tested by the emotions they provoke wilfrid knew that there was no trifling with emilia so he put the letter by commenting thus shes right she doesnt spell badly behind which to those who have caught the springs of his character volumes may be seen he put the letter by two days later at noon the card of captain gambier was brought to him in the billiardroomon it was written miss belloni waits on horseback to see you wilfrid thought waits and the impossibility of escape gave him a notion of her power so you are letting that go on said lady charlotte when she heard that emilia and the captain were in company there is no fear for her whatever there is always fear when a man gives every minute of his time to that kind of business retorted her ladyship wilfrid smiled the smile of the knowing rivalry with gambier and successful too did not make emilias admiration so tasteless some one cries out but what a weak creature is this young man i reply he was at a critical stage of his career all of us are weak in the period of growth and are of small worth before the hour of trial this fellow had been fattening all his life on prosperity the very best dish in the world but it does not prove us it fattens and strengthens us just as the sun does adversity is the inspector of our constitutions she simply tries our muscle and powers of endurance and should be a periodical visitor but until she comes no man is known wilfrid was not absolutely engaged to lady charlotte she had taken care of that and being free and feeling his heart beat in more lively fashion he turned almost delightedly to the girl he could not escape from as when the wriggling eel that has been prodded by the countrymans fork finds that no amount of wriggling will release it to it twists in a knot around the imprisoning prong this simile says more than i mean it to say but those who understand similes will know the measure due to them there sat emilia on her horse has gambier been giving her lessons thought wilfrid she sat up wellbalanced and as he approached began to lean gently forward to him a greeting equal to any ladys there was no doubt this was the point emilia had to attain in his severe contemplation a born lady on her assured level stood a chance of becoming a goddess but ladyship was emilias highest mark such is the state of things to the sentimental fancy when girls are at a disadvantage she smiled and held out both hands he gave her one nodding kindly but was too confused to be the lighthearted cavalier lady charlotte walked up to her horses side after receiving captain gambiers salute and said come catch hold of my hands and jump no replied emilia i only came to see him but you will see him and me in the bargain if you stay i fancy she has given her word to return early interposed wilfrid then well ride back with her said lady charlotte give me five minutes ill order a horse out for you she smiled and considerately removed the captain by despatching him to the stables a quivering dimple of tenderness hung for a moment in emilias cheeks as she looked upon wilfrid then she said falteringly i think they wish to be as we do alone cried wilfrid yes that is why i brought him over he will come anywhere with me you must be mistaken no i know it did he tell you so no mr powys did told you that lady charlotte yes not is but was and he used that word there is no word like it he said her loveroh mine emilia lifted her arms her voice from its deepest fall had risen to a cry wilfrid caught her as she slipped from her saddle his heart was in a tumult stirred both ways stirred with wrath and with love he clasped her tightly am iam i he breathed my lover emilia murmured he was her slave again for here was something absolutely his own his own from the roots from the first growth of sensation something with the bloom on it to which no other finger could point and say there is my mark and ladies if you will consent to be likened to a fruit you must bear with these observations and really deserve the stigma if you will smile on men because they adore you as vegetable products take what ensues lady charlotte did no more than double the time she had asked for the party were soon at a quiet canter up the lanes but entering a broad furzy common with brambleplots and oakshaws the amazon flew ahead emilias eyes were so taken with her that she failed to observe a tiny redflowing runlet in the clay with yellowridged banks almost baked to brick over it she was borne but at the expense of a shaking that caused her to rely on her hold of the reins ignorant of the notions of a horse outstripped wilfrid looked to see that the jump had been accomplished and was satisfied gambier was pressing his hack to keep a respectable second lady charlotte spun round suddenly crying catch the mare and galloped back to emilia who was deposited on a bush of bramble dismounting promptly the lady said my child youre not hurt not a bit emilia blinked not frightened not a bit was half whispered thats brave now jump on your feet tell me why you rode over to us this morning quick dont hesitate because i want wilfrid to see his sister cornelia came the answer with the required absence of indecision emilia ran straightway to meet wilfrid approaching and as both her hands according to her fashion were stretched out to him to assure him of her safety and take his clasp forgetful of the instincts derived from ridinghabits her feet became entangled she trod herself down falling plump forward and looking foolishperhaps for the first time in her life plainly feeling so up little woman said lady charlotte supporting her elbow now sir wilfrid we part here and dont spoil her courage now she has had a spill by any assiduous attentions and precautions shes sure to take as many as are needed if captain gambler thinks i require an escort he may offer the captain taken by surprise bowed and flowed in ardent commonplace wilfrid did not look of a wholesome colour do you return he stammered not without a certain aspect of righteous reproach yes you will ride over to us again probably in a day or two captain gambler will see me safe from the savage admirers that crowd this country if i interpreted him rightly emilia was lifted to her seat lady charlotte sprang unassisted to hers tata she waved her fingers from her lips the pairs then separated one couple turning into green lanes the other dipping to blue hills chapter xix gossip of course was excited on the subject of the choice of a partner made by the member for the county cornelia placed her sisters in one of their most pleasing of difficulties she had not as yet pledged her word it was supposed that she considered it due to herself to withhold her word for a term the rumour in the family was that sir twickenham appreciated her hesitation and desired that he might be intimately known before he was finally accepted when the tinleys called they heard that cornelias acceptance of the baronet was doubtful the copleys on the other hand distinctly understood that she had decided in his favour owing to the amiable dissension between the copleys and the tinleys each party called again giving the ladies of brookfield further opportunity for studying one of the levels from which they had risen arabella did almost all the fencing with laura tinley contemptuously as a youth of station returned from college will turn and foil an illconditioned villager whom formerly he has encountered on the green had they often met previous to the the proposal inquired laura and laughed i was going to say popping pray do not check yourself if a phrase appears to suit you returned arabella but it was in the neighbourhood was it not they have met in the neighbourhood at richford also at richford we thought it was sudden dear thats all why should it not be perhaps the best things are it is true you congratulate us upon a benefit he is to be congratulated seriously naturally when she decides let me know early i do entreat you because well i am of a different opinion from some people who talk of another attachment or engagement and i do not believe in it and have said so rising to depart laura tinley resumed most singular you are aware of course that poor creature our organisti ought to say yourswho looked it was mr sumner i heard say itsuch a good thing as if he had been a gentleman in another world and was the ghost of one in this really one of the cleverest things but he is cleverbarretts his name barrett and some musical name before it like handel i mean one that we are used to well the man has totally and unexpectedly thrown up his situation his appointment said arabella permitting no surprise to be visible she paused yes i dont think we shall give our consent to her filling the post laura let it be seen that her adversary was here a sentence too quick for her ah you mean your little miss belloni was it not of her you were thinking when asked laura shamefully bewildered when you alluded to mr barretts vacant place not at the moment i thought you must be pointing to her advancement i confess it was not in my mind in what consisted the singularity then the singularity you prefaced your remarks with the exclamation singular laura showed that arabella had passed her guard she hastened to compliment her on her kindness to emilia and so sheathed her weapon for the time having just enjoyed a casual inspection of mrs chump entering the room and heard the brogue an instant irish she whispered smiling with a sort of astonished discernment of the nationality and swept through the doorway thus conveying forcibly to arabella her knowledge of what the ladies of brookfield were enduring a fine parthian shot that cornelia should hold a notable county man a baronet and owner of great acres in a state between acceptance and rejection was considered high policy by the ladies whom the idea of it elevated and they encouraged her to pursue this course without having a suspicion shrewd as they were that it was followed for any other object than the honour of the family but mr pole was in the utmost perplexity and spoke of baronets as things almost holy to be kneeled to prayed for he was profane i thought papa said cornelia that women conferred the favour when they gave their hands it was a new light to the plain merchant how should you say if a prince came and asked for you still that he asked a favour at my hands oh went mr pole in the voice of a man whose reason is outraged the placidity of cornelias reply was not without its effect on him nevertheless he had always thought his girls extraordinary girls and born to be distinguished perhaps she has a lord in view he concluded it being his constant delusion to suppose that high towering female sense has always a practical aim at a material thing he was no judge of the sex in its youth just speak to her he said to wilfrid wilfrid had heard from emilia that there was a tragic background to this outward placidity tears on the pillow at night and long vigils emilia had surprised her weeping and though she obtained no confidences the soft mood was so strong in the stately lady that she consented to weep on while emilia clasped her petitioning on her behalf to wilfrid for aid emilia had told him the scene and he with a mans stupidity alluded to it not thinking what his knowledge of it revealed to a woman why do you vacillate and keep us all in the dark as to what you mean he began i am not prepared said cornelia the voice of humility issuing from a monument one of your oracular phrases are you prepared to be straightforward in your dealings i am prepared for any sacrifice wilfrid the marrying of a man in his position is a sacrifice i cannot leave papa and why not he is ill he does not speak of it but he is ill his actions are strange they are unaccountable he has an old friend to reside in his house it is not that i have noticed him his mindhe requires watching and how long is it since you made this discovery one sees clearer perhaps when one is not quite happy not happy then its for him that you turn the night to tears cornelia closed her lips she divined that her betrayer must be close in his confidence she went shortly after to emilia whose secret at once stood out bare to a kindled suspicion there was no fear that cornelia would put her finger on it accusingly or speak of it directly she had the sentimentalists profound respect for the name and notion of love she addressed emilia vaguely bidding her keep guard on her emotions and telling her there was one test of the truth of masculine protestations this will he marry you the which if you are poor is a passably infallible test emilia sucked this in thoughtfully she heard that lovers were false why then of course they were not like her lover cornelia finished what she deemed her duty and departed while emilia thought i wonder whether he could be false to me and she gave herself shrewd halfdelicious jarrings of pain forcing herself to contemplate the impossible thing she was in this state when mrs chump came across her and with a slight pressure of a sovereign into her hand said there its for you little belloni and i see yeve been thinkin me one o the scrapehards and closefists its pole who keeps me low on purpose and im a wretch if i havent my purse full so you see im all in the dark in the house and dont know half so much as the sluts o the kitchen so yell tell me little belloni is arrbella goin to marry mr annybody and is cornelia goin to marry sir tickleham and whether mr wilfruds goin to marry lady charlotte chillnworth becas my dear theres arrbella whos sharp she is as a northeaster in january which chump d cry out for for the sake of his ships poor fellahe kneelin by s bedside in a long nightgown and lookin just twice what he was she has me like a nail to my vary words and shows me that nothin can happen betas o what ive said and corneliaif yell fancy a tall codfish on its tail mrs chump i beg yell not go to believe annything of me so i says to her cornelia my dear do ye think now its true that chump went and marrud his cook that ye treat me so becas my father i tell her he dealt in porrk in a large way and i was a fine woman full of the arrstocracy and chump a little puffedout bladder of a man so then she says mrs chump i listen to no gossup listen you to no gossup and mr wilfrud my dear he sends me on the flat o my back laughin and adla she takes and turns me right about so that i dont see the thing im askin after and theres nobody but you little belloni to help me and if ye do ye shall know what the crumple of paper sounds like mrs chump gave a sugary suck with her tongue emilia returned the money to her yere foolush said mrs chump a shut fists good in fight and bad in friendship do ye know that open your hand excuse me persisted emilia pooh take the money or ill say yere in a conspiracy to make me blindmansbuff of the parrty take ut i dont want it maybe its not enough i dont want any maam maam to the deuce with ye ill be callin ye a forrner in a minute i will emilia walked away from a volley of terrific threats for some reason unfathomed by her she wanted to be alone with wilfrid and put a question to him no other in sooth than the infallible test not mind you that she wished to be married but something she had heard she had forgotten what it was disturbed her and that recent trifling with pain in her excess of happiness laid her open to it her heart was weaker and fluttered as if with a broken wing she thought if i can be near him to lean against him for one full hour it would make her strong again for she found that if her heart was rising on a broad breath suddenly for no reason that she knew it seemed to stop in its rise break and sink like a windbeaten billow once or twice in a quick fear she thought what is this is this a malady coming before death she walked out gloomily thinking of the darkness of the world to wilfrid if she should die she plucked flowers and then reproached herself with plucking them she tried to sing no not till i have been with him alone she said chiding her voice to silence a shadow crossed her mind as a springmist dulls the glory of may suppose all singing has gone from mewill he love wretched me byandby she met him in the house come out of doors tonight she whispered wilfrids spirit of intrigue was never to be taken by surprise in the wood under the pine at nine he replied not there said emilia seeing this place mournfully dark from cornelias grief it is too still say where theres water falling one cant be unhappy by noisy water wilfrid considered and named wilming weir and there well sit and youll sing to me i wont dine at home so they wont suspafancy anythingsoh and you want very much to be with me my bird what am i he bent his head my lover he pressed her hand rapturously halfdoubting whether her pronunciation of the word had not a rather too confident twang was it not delightful he asked her that they should be thus one to the other and none know of it she thought so too and smiled happily promising secresy at his request for the sake of continuing so felicitous a life you you know have an appointment with captain gambier and i with lady charlotte chillingworth said he how dare you make appointments with a captain of hussars and he bent her knuckles fondlingly emilia smiled as before he left her with a distinct impression that she did not comprehend that part of her lesson wilfrid had just bled his father of a considerable sum of money having assured him that he was the accepted suitor of lady charlotte chillingworth besides making himself pleasant in allusion to mrs chump so far as to cast some imputation on his sisters judgement for not perceiving the virtues of the widow the sum was improvidently large mr pole did not hear aright when he heard it named even at the repetition he went eh two or three times vacantly the amount was distinctly nailed to his ear whereupon he said ahyes you young fellows want money must have it i suppose up from the bowels of the earth up from the youre sure theyre not playing the fool with you over there wilfrid understood the indication to stornley i think you need have no fear of that sir and so his father thought after an examination of the youth who was of manly shape and had a fresh nonfatuous air well if thats all right sighed mr pole of course youll always know that moneys money i wish your sisters wouldnt lose their time as they do times worth more than money what sum i told you sir i wantedtheres the yacht you know and a lot of tradesmens bills which you dont like to see standingaboutperhaps i had better name the round sum suppose you write down eight hundred i shant want more for some months if you fancy it too much mr pole had lifted his head but he spoke nothing his lips and brows were rigid in apparent calculation wilfrid kept his position for a minute or so and then a little piqued he moved about he had inherited the antipathy to the discussion of the money question and fretted to find it unnecessarily prolonged shall i come to you on this business another time sir no god bless my soul cried his father are you going to keep this hanging over me for ever eight hundred you said he mumbled salary of a chief clerk of twenty years standing eight twice fourthere you have it exactly will you send it me in a letter said wilfrid out of patience ill send it you in a letter assented his father upon which wilfrid changed his mind i can take a chair though i can easily wait for it now save trouble if i send it eh do you wish to see whether you can afford it sir i wish to see you show more sensewith your confounded afford have you any idea of bankers booksbankers accounts mr pole fished his chequebook from a drawer and wrote wilfrids name and the sum tore out the leaf and tossed it to him there ive written today dont present it for a week he rubbed his forehead hastily touching here and there a paper to put it scrupulously in a line with the others wilfrid left him and thought kind old boy of course he always means kindly but i think i see a glimpse of avarice as a sort of a sign of age coming on i hope hell live long wilfrid was walking in the garden imagining perhaps that he was thinking as the swarming sensations of little people help them to imagine when cornelia ran hurriedly up to him and said come with me to papa hes ill i fear he is going to have a fit i left him sound and well just now said wilfrid this is your mania i found him gasping in his chair not two minutes after you quitted him dearest he is in a dangerous state wilfrid stept back to his father and was saluted with a ready well as he entered but the mask had slipped from half of the old mans face and for the first time in his life wilfrid perceived that he had become an old man well sir you sent for me he said girls always try to persuade you youre illthats all returned mr pole his voice was subdued but turning to cornelia he fired up its preposterous to tell a man who carries on a business like mine youve observed for a long while that hes queerthere my dear child i know that you mean well i shall look all right the day youre married this allusion and the sudden kindness drew a storm of tears to cornelias eyelids papa if you will but tell me what it is she moaned a nervous frenzy seemed to take possession of him he ordered her out of the room she was gone but his arm was still stretched out and his expression of irritated command did not subside wilfrid took his arm and put it gently down on the chair saying youre not quite the thing today sir are you a fool as well mr pole retorted what do you know of to make me ill i live a regular life i eat and drink just as you all do and if i have a headache im stunned with a whole family screaming as hard as they can that im going to die damned hard i say sir its he fell into a feebleness a little glass of brandy i think wilfrid suggested and when mr pole had gathered his mind he assented begging his son particularly to take precautions to prevent any one from entering the room until he had tasted the reviving liquor chapter xx a halfcircle of highbanked greensward studded with old parktrees hung round the roar of the water distant enough from the whitetwisting fall to be mirrored on a smoothheaved surface while its outpushing brushwood below drooped under burdens of drowned reedflags that caught the foam keen scent of hay crossing the dark air met emilia as she entered the rivermeadow a little more and she saw the white weirpiles shining and the grey roller just beginning to glisten to the moon eastward on her left behind a cedar the moon had cast off a thick cloud and shone through the cedarbars with a yellowish hazy softness making rosy gold of the first passion of the tide which writhing and straining on through many lights grew wide upon the wonderful velvet darkness underlying the wooded banks with the full force of a young soul that leaps from beauty seen to unimagined beauty emilia stood and watched the picture then she sat down hushed awaiting her lover wilfrid as it chanced was ten minutes late she did not hear his voice till he had sunk on his knee by her side what a reverie he said half jealously isnt it lovely here emilia pressed his hand but without turning her face to him as her habit was he took it for shyness and encouraged her with soft exclamations and expansive tenderness i wish i had not come here she murmured tell me why he folded his arm about her waist why did you let me wait said she wilfrid drew out his watch blamed the accident that had detained him and remarked that there were not many minutes to witness against him she appeared to throw off her moodiness you are here at last let me hold your hand and think and be quite silent you shall hold my hand and think and be quite silent my own girl if you will tell me whats on your mind emilia thought it enough to look in his face smiling has any one annoyed you he cried out no one then receive the command of your lord that you kiss him i will kiss him said emilia and did so the salute might have appeased an imperious lord but was not so satisfactory to an exacting lover he perceived however that whether as lover or as lord he must wait for her now owing to her having waited for him so he sat by her permitting his hand to be softly squeezed and trying to get at least in the track of her ideas while her ear was turned to the weir and her eyes were on the glowing edges of the cedartree finally on one of many deep breaths she said its over why were you late but never mind now never let it be long again when i am expecting you its then i feel so much at his mercy i mean if i am where i hear falling water sometimes thunder wilfrid masked his complete mystification with a caressing smile not without a growing respect for the only person who could make him experience the pangs of conscious silliness you see he was not a coxcomb that german emilia enlightened him your old musicmaster i wish it i wish it i should soon be free from him dont you know that dreadful man i told you about whos like a black angel to me because there is no music like his and hes a german i told you how i first dreamed about him and then regularly every night after talking with my father about italy and his blackyellow tedeschi this man came over my pillow and made me call him master master and he is he seems as if he were the master of my soul mocking me making me worship him in spite of my hate i came here thinking only of you i heard the water like a great symphony i fell into dreaming of my music thats when i am at his mercy theres no one like him i must detest music to get free from him how can i he is like the god of music wilfrid now remembered certain of her allusions to this rival who had hitherto touched him very little perhaps it was partly the lovely scene that lifted him to a spiritual jealousy partly his susceptibility to a sentimental exaggeration and partly the mysterious new charm in emilias manner that was as a bordering lustre showing how the full orb was rising behind her his name wilfrid asked for emilias lips broke to the second letter of the alphabet but she cut short the word why should you hear it and now that you are here you drive him away and the best is she laughed i am sure you will not remember any of his pieces i wish i could notnot that its the memory but he seems all round me up in the air and when the trees move all togetheryou chase him away my lover it was like a break in music the way that emilia suddenly closed her sentence coming with a shock of flattering surprise upon wilfrid then she pursued my english lover i am like italy in chains to that german and youbut no no no its not quite a likeness for my german is not a brute i have seen his picture in shopwindows the wind seemed in his hair and he seemed to hear with his eyes his forehead frowning so look at me and see so emilia pressed up the hair from her temples and bent her brows it does not increase your beauty said wilfrid theres the difference emilia sighed mildly he sees angels cherubs and fairies and imps and devils or he hears them they come before him from far off in music they do to me now and then only now and then when my heads on firemy lover wilfrid pressed his mouth to the sweet instrument she took his kiss fully and gave her own frankly in return then sighing a very little she said do not kiss me much why not no but look at me i will look at you only take my hand see the moon is getting whiter the water there is like a pool of snakes and then they struggle out and roll over and over and stream on lengthwise i can see their long flat heads and their eyes almost their skins no my lover do not kiss me i lose my peace wilfrid was not willing to relinquish his advantage and the tender deep tone of the remonstrance was most musical and catching what if he pulled her to earth from that rival of his in her soul she would then be wholly his own his lovers sentiment had grown rageingly jealous of the lordly german but emilia said i have you on my heart more when i touch your hand only and think if you kiss me i go into a cloud and lose your face in my mind yes yes replied wilfrid pleased to sustain the argument for the sake of its fruitful promises but you must submit to be kissed my darling you will have to she gazed inquiringly when you are married i mean when will you marry me she said the heirapparent of the house of pole blinked probably at that moment more foolishly than most mortal men have done taming his astonishment to represent a smile he remarked when are you thinking about it already she answered in a quiet voice that conveyed the fact forcibly yes but youre too young yet and youre going to italy to learn in the schools you wouldnt take a husband there with you would you what would the poor devil do but you are not too young said she wilfrid supposed not could you not go to my italy with me impossible what as a dangling husband wilfrid laughed scornfully they would love you too she said they are such loving people oh come consent to come my lover i must learn if i do not you will despise me how can i bring anything to lay at your feet my dear my dear if i do not impossible wilfrid reiterated as one who had found moorings in the word then i will give up italy he had not previously acted hypocrite with this amazing girl nevertheless it became difficult not to do so he could scarcely believe that he had on a sudden and by strange agency slipped into an earnest situation emilias attitude and tone awakened him to see it her hands were clenched straight down from the shoulders all that she conceived herself to be renouncing for his sake was expressed in her face would you really he murmured i will and be english altogether be yours mine yes from this time now stirred his better nature though not before had he sceptically touched her lips and found them cold as if the fire had been taken out of them by what they had uttered he felt that it was no animal love but the force of a soul drawn to him and forgetting the hypocritical foundation he had laid he said how proud i shall be of you i shall go with you to battle returned emilia my little darling you wont care to see those black fellows killed will you emilia shuddered no poor things why do you hurt them kill wicked people tyrant whitecoats and we will not talk of killing now proud of me if i can make you you sigh so heavily something makes me feel like a little beggar when i tell you i love you yes but i only feel rich when i am giving and i seem to have nothing to give nownow that i have lost italy but you give me your love dont you all of it but i seem to give it to you in tatters its like a beggar like a day without any sun do you think i shall have that idea when i hear you sing to me and know that this little leaping fountain of music here is mine dim rays of a thought led emilia to remark must not men keel to women i mean if they are to love them for ever wilfrid smiled gallantly i will kneel to you if it pleases you not now you should have done so once i dreamed only once just for a moment in italy when all were crying out to me that i had caught their hearts i fancied standing out like a bright thing in a dark crowd and then saying i am his pointing to you and folding my arms waiting for you to take me the lovers imagination fired at the picture and immediately he told a lovers lie for the emotion excited by the thought of her glory coloured deliciously that image of her abnegation of all to him he said i would rather have you as you are emilia leaned to him more and the pair fixed their eyes on the moon that had now topped the cedar and was pure silver silver on the grass on the leafage on the waters and in the west facing it was an arch of twilight and tremulous rose as if a spirit hung there over the shrouded sun at least thought wilfrid heaven and the beauty of the world approve my choice and he looked up fancying that he had a courage almost serene to meet his kindred with emilia on his arm she felt his arm dreamily stressing its clasp about her and said now i know you love me and you shall take me as i am i need not be so poor after all my dear my dear i cannot see beyond you is that your misery said he my delight my pleasure one can live a life anywhere and how can i belong to italy if i am yours do you know when we were silent just now i was thinking that water was the history of the world flowing out before me all mixed up of kings and queens and warriors with armour and shouting armies battles and numbers of mixed people and great red sunsets with women kneeling under them do you know those long low sunsets i love them they look like blood spilt for love the noise of the water and the moist green smell gave me hundreds of pictures that seemed to hug me i thoughtwhat could stir music in me more than this and am i not just as rich if i stay here with my lover instead of flying to strange countries that i shall not care for now so you shall take me as i am i do not feel poor any longer with that she gave him both her hands yes said wilfrid as if struck by the ridicule of so feeble a note falling upon her passionate speech he followed it up with the yes of a man adding whatever you are you are my dear girl my own love mine having said it he was screwed up to feel it as nearly as possible such virtue is there in uttered words then he set about resolutely studying to appreciate her in the new character she had assumed to him it is barely to be supposed that he should understand what in her love for him she sacrificed in giving up italy as she phrased it he had some little notion of the sacrifice but as he did not demand any sacrifice of the sort and as this involved a question perplexing irritating absurd he did not regard it very favourably as mistress of his fancy her prospective musical triumphs were the crown of gold hanging over her as wife of his bosom they were not to be thought of but the wife of his bosom must take her place by virtue of some wondrous charm what was it that emilia could show if not music beautiful eyebrows thick rare eyebrows no doubt couched upon her full eyes they were a marvel and her eyes were a marvel she had a sweet mouth too though the upper lip did not boast the aristocratic conventional curve of adorable pride or the under lip a pretty droop to a petty rounded chin her face was like the aftersunset across a rosegarden with the wings of an eagle poised outspread on the light some such coloured vague magnified impression wilfrid took of her still it was not quite enough to make him scorn contempt should it whisper nor even quite enough to combat successfully the image of elegant dames in their chosen attitudesthe queenly moments when perhaps they enter an assembly or pour out tea with an exquisite exhibition of arm or recline upon a couch commanding homage of the world of little men what else had this girl to count upon to make her exclusive a devoted heart she had a loyal heart and perfect frankness a mind impressible intelligent and fresh she gave promise of fair companionship at all seasons she could put a spell upon him moreover by that power of hers never wilfully exercised she came in spite of the effect left on him by her early awkwardnesses and animalities nearer to his idea of superhuman nature than anything he knew of but how would she be regarded when the announcement of mrs wilfrid pole brought scrutinizing eyes and gossiping mouths to bear on her it mattered nothing he kissed her and the vision of the critical world faded to a blank whatever she was he was her prime luminary so he determined to think that he cast light upon a precious an unrivalled land you are my own are you not emilia yes i am she answered that water seems to say for ever he murmured and emilias fingers pressed upon his of marriage there was no further word her heart was evidently quite at ease and that it should be so without chaining him to a date was wilfrids peculiar desire he could pledge himself to eternity but shrank from being bound to eleven oclock on the morrow morning so now the soft summer hours flew like white doves from off the mounting moon and the lovers turned to go all being still even the noise of the waters still to their ears as life that is muffled in sleep they saw the cedar greyedged under the moon and night that clung like a bat beneath its ancient open palms the bordering sward about the falls shone silvery in its shadow was a swan these scenes are but beckoning hands to the hearts of lovers waving them on to that eden which they claim but when the hour has fled they know it and by the palpitating light in it they know that it holds the best of them chapter xxi at this season mr pericles reappeared he had been he said through paris turin milano veniss and by trieste over the summering to vienna on a tour for a voice and in no part of the continent his vehement declaration assured the ladies had he found a single one it was one universal croakahi and mr pericles could affirm that purgatory would have no pains for him after the torments he had recently endured zey are frogs if zey are not geese said mr pericles i give up opera is dead hein for a time and he smiled almost graciously adding where is she for emilia was not present the ladies now perceived a greatness of mind in the greeks devotion to music and in his nonmercenary travels to assist managers of opera by discovering genius his scheme for emilia fired them with delight they were about to lay down all the material arrangements at once but mrs chump who had heard that there was a new man in the house now entered the room prepared to conquer him as thus after a short form of introduction dye do sir and yere mr paricles oh but yere a sultan they say not in morrls sir and vary pleasant to wander on the contnent with a lot o lacqueys at your heels its what a bachelor can do but i ask ye sir is ut fair ye think to the poor garls that has to stop at home hereat the ladies of brookfield thus miserably indicated drew upon their selfcommand that sprang from the high sense of martyrdom mr pericles did not reply to mrs chump at all he turned to adela saying aloud what is zis person it might have pleased them to hear any slight put publicly on mrs chump in the first resistance to the woman but in the present stage their pride defended her our friend was the reply with which arabella rebuked his rudeness and her sister approved her we can avoid showing that we are weak in our own opinion whatsoever degrades us they had said during a consultation simultaneously they felt that mr pericles being simply a millionaire and not in society being also a middleclass foreigner a greek whose fathers ran with naked heels and long lank hair on the shores of the aegean before such a man they might venture to identify this their guest with themselves an undoubted duty in any case but not always to be done at least not with grace and personal satisfaction therefore the our friend dispersed a common gratulatory glow very small points my masters but how are coralislands built mrs chump fanned her cheek in complete ignorance of the offence and defence chump deceased in amorous mood had praised her management of the fan once when breath was in him martha says he winkin a sort of mavourneen at me ye knowmartha with a fan in your hand if yere not a blackeyed beauty of a spaniard ye little devil of seville says he this she had occasionally confided to the ladies the marital eulogy had touched her and she was not a woman of coldlyflowing blood she had an excuse for the constant employment of the fan and well mr paricles have ye got nothin to tell us about foreign countesses and their slips because we can listen sir garls or not sure if they understand ye ye teach em nothin and if they dont understand ye wheres the harm done dye see sir its clear in favour of talkin mr pericles administered consolation to his moustache by twisting it into long waxy points i do not know i do not know he put her away with from time to time in the end mrs chump leaned over to arabella dont have m my dear she murmured you mean quoth arabella heres the driest stick that aver stood without sap arabella flushed when she took the implication that she was looking on the man as a husband adela heard the remarks and flushed likewise mrs chump eyed them both its for the money o the man she soliloquized aloud as her fashion was adela jumped up and with an easy sprightly posture of her fair commonly studious person and natural run of notes oh she cried i begin to feel what it is to be like a live fish on the fire frying frying frying and if he can keep his christian sentiments under this infliction what a wonderful hero he must be what a hot day she moved swiftly to the door and flung it open a sight met her eyes at which she lost her selfpossession she started back uttering a soft cry ah aha oh went the bitter ironic drawl of mr pericles whose sharp glance had caught the scene as well emilia came forward with a face like sunset diplomacy under the form of wilfrid pole kicked its heels behind and said a word or two in a tone of false cheerfulness oh so mr pericles frowned while emilia held her hand out to him yeas you are quite well hm you are burnt like a beanhein i shall ask you what you have been doing by and by happily for decency mrs chump had not participated in the fact presented by ocular demonstration she turned about comfortably to greet wilfrid uttering the inspired remark ye look red from a sly kiss for one said he sharpening his blunted wits on this dull instrument the ladies talked down their talk then wilfrid and mr pericles interchanged quasi bows oh if he doesnt show his upper teeth like an angry cat or a leopard ive seen cried mrs chump in adelas ear designating mr pericles does he know mr wilfruds in the british army and a new lieutent gazetted and all mr pericles certainly did not look pleasantly upon wilfrid emilia received his unconcealed wrath and spite go and sing a note he said at the piano emilia quietly asked at piano harp what you willit is ze voice i want emilia pitched her note high from a full chest and with glad bright eyes which her fair critics thought just one degree brazen after the revelation in the doorway mr pericles listened wearing an aching expression as if he were sending one eye to look up into his brain for a judgement disputed in that sovereign seat still she held on and then gave a tremulous rich contralto note oh the human voice cried adela overcome by the transition of tones like going from the nightingale to the nightjar said arabella mrs chump remarked yell not find a more susceptible woman to musuc than me wilfrid looked away pride coursed through his veins in a torrent when the voice was still mr pericles remained in a pondering posture you go to play fool with zat voice in milano you are flogged he cried terribly shaking his forefinger wilfrid faced round in wrath but mr pericles would not meet his challenge continuing you hear you hearso and mr pericles brought the palms of his hands in collision marcy man mrs chump leaped from her chair dye mean that those horrud forrnersll smack a fullgrown young womandont go to m my dear now take my dvice little belloni and dont go it isnt the sting o the smack ye know shall i sing anything to you emilia addressed mr pericles the latter shrugged to express indifference nevertheless she sang she had never sung better mr pericles clutched his chin in one hand elbow on knee the ladies sighed to think of the loss of homage occasioned by the fact of so few being present to hear her wilfrid knew himself the fountain of it all and stood fountainlike in a shower of secret adulation a really happy fellow this that his beloved should be the centre of eyes and pronounced exquisite by general approbation besides subjecting him to a personal spell this was what he wanted it was mournful to think that circumstance had not at the same time created the girl of noble birth or with an instinct for spiritual elegance but the world is imperfect presently he became aware that she was understood to be singing pointedly to him upon which he dismissed the council of his sensations and began to diplomatize cleverly leaning over to adela he whispered pericles wants her to go to italy my belief is that she wont and why returned adela archly reproachful well weve been spoiling her a little perhaps i mean we men of course but i really dont think that im chiefly to blame you wont allow captain gambier to be in fault i know why not said adela well if you will then he is the principal offender adela acted disbelief but unprepared for her brothers perfectly feminine audacity of dissimulation she thought he cant be in earnest about the girl and was led to fancy that gambier might and to determine to see whether it was so by this manoeuvre wilfrid prepared for himself a defender when the charge was brought against him mr pericles was thunderstruck on hearing emilia refuse to go to italy a scene of tragic denunciation on the one hand and stubborn decision on the other ensued i shall not mind zis he spoke of love and the awakening of the female heart not when you are trained it is good zen and you have fire from it but now little fool i say it is too airlytoo airly how shall you learneh with your brain upon a man and your voice little fool a thing of caprice zat comes and goes as he will not you will hein like a barrelorgan which he turns ze handlemon dieu why did i leave her mr pericles struck his brow with his wrist clutching at the long thin slice of hair that did greasy duty for the departed crop on his poll did i not know it was a woman and so you are what you say in lofe emilia replied i have not said so with exasperating coolness you have your eye on a man and i know him zat man when he is tired of youwhiff away you go a puff of smoke and you zat i should make a queen of opera a queen you shall have more rule zan twenty queensforty see mr pericles made his hand go like an aspenleaf from his uplifted wrist so you shall set ze hearts of sossands to dream of you to adore you and flowers flowers everywhere on your head at your feet you choose your lofer from ze world a husband if it is your taste bose if you please zen i say you shall you shall lofe a man let him tease and stingah it will be magnifique aha ze voice will sharpen go deep yeas to be a tale of blood lofe till you could stab yourselfbrava but now little fool i say emilia believed that she was verily forfeiting an empire her face wore a soft look of delight this renunciation of a splendid destiny for wilfrids sake seemed to make her worthier of him and as mr pericles unrolled the list of her rejected treasures her bosom heaved without a regret ha mr pericles flung away from her go and be a little guttergirl the musical connoisseur drew on his own disappointment alone for eloquence had he been thinking of her he might have touched cunningly on her love for italy music was the passion of the man and a millionaires passion is something that can make a stir he knew that in emilia he had discovered a pearl of song rarely to be found and his object was to polish and perfect her at all cost perhaps as a secondary and far removed consideration to point to her as a thing belonging to him for which emperors might envy him the thought of losing her drove him into fits of rage he took the ladies one by one and treated them each to a horrible scene of gesticulation and outraged english h accused their brother of conduct which they were obliged to throw by a process of their own into the region of fine shades before they dared venture to comprehend him gross facts in relationship with the voice this grievous machine not manas they saidstated to them harshly impetuously the ladies felt that he had bored their ears with hot iron pins adela tried laughter as a defence from his suggestion against wilfrid but had shortly afterwards to fly from the fearful anatomist she served her brother thoroughly in the council of three so that mr pericles was led by them to trust that there had been mere fooling in his absence and that the emotions he looked to as the triumphant reserve in emilias bosom to be aroused at some crisis when she was before the world slumbered still she on her part contrasting her own burning sensations with this quaint innocent devotion to art and passion for music felt in a manner guilty and whenever he stormed with additional violence she became suppliant and seemed to bend and have regrets mr pericles would then say with mollified irritability you will come to italy tomorrowze day afternot at all the last was given with a roar for lack of her immediate response emilia would find a tear on her eyelids at times surround herself as she might with her illusions she had no restingplace in wilfrids heart and knew it she knew it as the young know that they are to die on a future day without feeling the sadness of it but with a dimly prevalent idea that this life is therefore incomplete and again her blood as with a wave of rich emotion washed out the blank spot she thought what can he want but my love and thus she satisfied her own hungry questioning by seeming to supply an answer to his the ladies of brookfield by no means encouraged emilia to refuse the generous offer of mr pericles they thought too that she mightmight she oh certainly she might go to italy under his protection would you let one of your blood asked wilfrid brutally with some cunning he led them to admit that emilias parents should rightly be consulted in such a case one day mr pericles said to the ladies i shall give a fete a party monstre in ze air on grass i beg you to invite friends of yours before the excogitation of this splendid resolve he had been observed to wear for some period a conspiratorial aspect when it was delivered and arabella had undertaken the management of the party monstrewhich was to be on besworth lawn and as it was not their own party could be conducted with a sort of quasicontemptuous superiority to incongruous gatheringsthis being settled the forehead of mr pericles cleared and he ceased to persecute emilia i am not one that is wopped he said significantly nodding to his english hearers as if this piece of shrewd acquaintance with the expressive mysteries of their language placed them upon equal terms it was really a providential thing as devout people phrase it that laura tinley and mabel copley should call shortly after this and invite the ladies to a proposed picnic of theirs on besworth lawn on besworth lawn of all places and they used the word picnic a word suggestive of gnawed drumstick and gingerbeer bottles adela quoted some scapegoat of her acquaintance as her way was when she wished to be pungent without incurring the cold sisterly eye of reproof for a vulgarism both laura and mabel when they heard of the mighty entertainment fixed for besworth lawn by mr pericles looked down they were invited and looked up there was the usual amount of fencing with the combative laura who gave ground at all points and as she was separating said so sweetly of course you have heard of the arrest of yourwhat does one call himfriendor a french word you mean quoth arabella that poor neatly brushed nice creature whom you patronizedwho played the organ she jerked to arabellas dubious eyes and he arabella smiled complacently then perhaps you may know that all is arranged for him said laura interpreting by the look more than the word after a habit of women indeed to tell you the truth i know nothing said arabella really laura turned sharply to cornelia who met her eyes and did not exhibit one weak dimple the story was that mr chips the bookseller of hillford objected to the departure of mr barrett until mr barrett had paid the bill of mr chips and had signified his objection in the form of a writ when if you know anything of law said laura you will see why he remains for a writ once served you are a prisoner that is i believe if its above twenty pounds and mr chips bill against mr barrett was i have heard twentythree pounds and odd shillings could anything be more preposterous and mr chips deserves to lose his money ah to soar out of such a set as this of which laura tinley is a sample are not some trifling acts of inhumanity and practices in the art of cutting permissible so the ladies had often asked of the unseen in their onward course if they did not pointedly put the question now surely they had no desire to give pain but the nature that endowed them with a delicate taste inspired them to defend it they listened gravely to laura who related that not only english books but foreign repeated and emphasized had been supplied by mr chips to mr barrett they were in the library and lauras eyes rested on certain yellow and blue covers of books certainly not designed for the reading of mr pole i think you must be wrong as to mr barretts position said adela no dear not at all laura was quick to reply unless you know anything he has stated that he awaits money remittances he has in fact overrun the constable and my brother albert says the constable is very likely to overrun ham in consequence only a joke but an organist with at the highest computationpoor absurd thingfiftyfive pounds per annum additional for singing lessons it is truebut an organist with a booksellers bill of twentythree pounds consider foreign books too interjected adela not so particularly improving to his morals either added laura you are severe upon the greater part of the human race said arabella so are the preachers dear returned laura the men of our religion justify you asked arabella let me seewhere were we laura retreated in an affected mystification you had reached the enlightened belief that books written by any but english hands were necessarily destructive of mens innocence said arabella and her sisters thrilled at the neatness of the stroke for the moment while they forgot the ignoble object it transfixed laura was sufficiently foiled by it to be unable to return to the chipsbarrett theme throughout the interview cornelia had maintained a triumphant posture superior to arabellas skill in fencing seeing that it exposed no weak point of the defence by making an attack and concealed especially the confession implied by a relish for the conflict her sisters considerately left her to recover herself after this mighty exercise of silence chapter xxii cornelia sat with a clenched hand you are rich and he is poor was the keynote of her thoughts repeated from minute to minute and it is gold gives you the right in the worlds eye to despise him she apostrophized the vanished laura clothing gold with all the baseness of that person now when one really hates gold one is at war with ones fellows the tide sets that way there is no compromise to hate it is to try to stem the flood it happens that this is one of the temptations of the sentimentalist who should reflect but does not that the fine feelers by which the iniquities of gold are so keenly discerned are a growth due to it nevertheless those fine feelers or antennae of the senses come of sweet ease that is synonymous with gold in our islandlatitude the sentimentalists are represented by them among the civilized species it is they that sensitively touch and reject touch and select whereby the laws of the polite world are ultimately regulated and civilization continually advanced sometimes ridiculously the sentimentalists are ahead of us not by weight of brain but through delicacy of nerve and like all creatures in the front they are open to be victims i pray you to observe again the shrinking life that afflicts the adventurous horns of the snail for example such are the sentimentalists to usthe fat body of mankind we owe them much and though they scorn us let us pity them especially when they are young they deserve pity for they suffer cruelly i for my part prefer to see boys and girls led into the ways of life by nature but i admit that in many cases in most cases our good mother has not occupied as her hands must be made them perfectly presentable by which fact i am warned to have tolerance for the finer beings who labour under these excessive sensual subtleties i perceive their uses and they are right good comedy for which i may say that i almost love them man is the laughing animal and at the end of an infinite search the philosopher finds himself clinging to laughter as the best of human fruit purely human and sane and comforting so let us be cordially thankful to those who furnish matter for sound embracing laughter cornelia detested goldentirely on general grounds and for abstract reasons not a word of mr barrett was shaped even in fancy but she interjected to herself with meditative eye and mouth the saints were poor the saints of whom he had read translating from that old latin book st francis how divine was his life and so forth until the figure of mr penniless barrett walked out in her imagination clad in saintly garments superior not only to his creditor mr chips but to all who bought or sold i have been false she said implying the to him seeing him on that radiant height above her she thought how could i have fallen so it was impossible for her mind to recover the delusion which had prompted her signing herself to bondagepledging her hand to a man she did not love could it have been that she was guilty of the immense folly simply to escape from that piece of coarse earth mrs chump cornelia smiled sadly saying oh no i should not have committed a wickedness for so miserable an object despairing for a solution of the puzzle she cried out i was mad and with a gasp of horror saw herself madly signing her name to perdition i was mad is a comfortable cloak to our sins in the past mournful to think that we have been bereft of reason but the fit is over and we are not in bedlam cornelia next wrestled with the pride of mr barrett why had he not come to her once after reading the line pencilled in the book was it that he would make her his debtor in everything he could have reproached her justly why had he held aloof she thirsted to be scourged by him to hang her head ashamed under his glance and hug the bitter pain he dealt her revolving how the worst man on earth would have behaved to a girl partially in his power hands had been permitted to be pressed and the gateways of the eyes had stood open all but vows had been interchanged she came to regard mr barrett as the best man on the earth that she alone saw it did not depreciate the value of her knowledge a goal gloriously illumined blazed on her from the distance too late she put a curb on the hot courses in her brain and they being checked turned all at once to tears and came in a flood how indignant would the fair sentimentalist have been at a whisper of her caring for the thing before it was too late cornelia now daily trod the red pathways under the firs and really imagined herself to be surprised even vexed when she met mr barrett there at last emilia was by his side near a drooping birch she beckoned to cornelia whose north pole armour was doing its best to keep down a thumping heart we are taking our last walk in the old wood said mr barrett admirably collected that is i must speak for myself you leave early cornelia felt her throat rattle hideously in two days i expecti hope said he why does he hope thought cornelia wounded until a vision of the detaining chips struck her with pity and remorse she turned to emilia our dear child is also going to leave us i cried emilia fierily out of languor does not your italy claim you i am nothing to italy any more have i not said so i love england now cornelia smiled complacently let us hope your heart is capacious enough to love both then your theory is mr barrett addressed cornelia in the winning old style that the love of one thing enlarges the heart for another should it not she admired his cruel selfpossession pitiably as she contrasted her own husky tones with it emilia looked from one to the other fancying that they must have her case somewhere in prospect since none could be unconscious of the vehement struggle going on in her bosom but they went farther and farther off from her comprehension and seemed to speak of bloodless matters and yet he is her lover she thought when they meet they talk across a river and he knows she is going to another man and does not gripe her wrist and drag her away the sense that she had no kinship with such flesh shut her mouth faster than wilfrids injunctions which were ordinarily conveyed in too subtle a manner for her to feel their meaning enough to find them binding cornelia for a mask to her emotions gave emilia a gentle albeit highworded lecture on the artists duty toward art quoting favourite passages from mr barretts favourite artcritic and her fashion of dropping her voice as she declaimed the more dictatorial sentences to imply one might guess by a show of personal humility that she would have you to know her preaching was vicarious that she stood humbly in the pulpit and was but a vessel for the delivery of the burden of the oracle all this was beautiful to him who could see it i cannot think it was wholesome for him nor that cornelia was unaware of a naughty wish to glitter temporarily in the eyes of the man who made her feel humble the sorcery she sent through his blood communicated itself to hers when she had done emilia convincedly vanquished by big words said i cannot talk and turned heavily from them without bestowing a smile upon either cornelia believed that the girl would turn back as abruptly as she had retreated and it was not until emilia was out of sight that she remembered the impropriety of being alone with mr barrett the pitfall of sentiment yawned visible but this ladys strength had been too little tried for her to lack absolute faith in it so out of deep silences the two leapt to speech and immediately subsided to the depths again as on a sultry summers day fishes flash their tails in the sunlight and leave a solitary circle widening on the water then cornelia knew what was coming in set phrase and as one who performs a duty frigidly pleasant he congratulated her on her rumored union one hand was in his buttoned coat the other hung elegantly loose not a feature betrayed emotion he might have spoken it in a ballroom to cornelia who exulted in selfcompression after the roman method it was more dangerous than a tremulous tone you know me too well to say this mr barrett the words would come she preserved her steadfast air when they had escaped to conceal her shame seeing thus much he took it to mean that it was a time for plainspeaking to what end he did not ask you have not to be told that i desire your happiness above all earthly things he said and the lady shrank back and made an effort to recover her footing had he not been so careful to obliterate any badge of the squire of low degree at his elbows cuffs collar kneecap and headpiece she might have achieved it with better success for cynicism the younger brother of sentiment and inheritor of the family property is always on the watch to deal fatal blows through such vital parts as the hat or the hs or indeed any sign of inferior estate but mr barrett was armed at all points by a consummate education and a most serviceable clothesbrush you know how i love this neighbourhood said she and i above all that i have known they left the pathway and walked on mossessoft yellow beds run over with grey lichen and plots of emerald in the midst you will not fall off with your reading he recommenced she answered yes meaning no and corrected the error languidly thinking one of the weighty monosyllables as good as the other for what was reading to her now it would be ten thousand pities if you were to do as so many women do when when they make these great changes he continued of what avail is the improvement of the mind she said and followed his stumble over the when and dropped on it of what avail is marriage to stop your intellectual growth without sympathy she faltered and was shocked at what she said but it seemed a necessity you must learn to conquer the need for it alas his admonition only made her feel the need more cravingly promise me one thing he said you will not fall into the rut let me keep the ideal you have given me for the sake of heaven do not cloud for me the one bright image i hold let me know always that you are growing and that the pure noble intelligence which distinguishes you advances and will not be subdued cornelia smiled faintly you have judged me too generously mr barrett too little so might i tell you he stopped short and she felt the silence like a great wave sweeping over her they were nearing the lake with the stump of the pollardwillow in sight and toward it they went i shall take the consolation of knowing that i shall hear of you some day she said having recourse to a look of cheerfulness he knew her to allude to certain hopes of fame i am getting wiser i feartoo wise for ambition that is a fallacy a sophism he pointed to the hollow tree is there promise of fruit from that youyou are young mr barrett and on a young forehead it may be written come not to gather more cornelia put her hand out oh mr barrett unsay it the nakedness of her spirit stood forth in a stinging tear the words were cruel but if they live and are i feel that you must misjudge me when i wrote themyou cannot know the misery of our domestic life was so bitter and yet i have no excuse none i can only ask for pity and if you are wretched must not i be you pluck from me my last support this i petitioned providence to hear from youthat you would be happy i can have no comfort but in that happy cornelia murmured the word musically as if to suck an irony from the sweetness of the sound are we made for happiness mr barrett quoted the favourite sage concluding but a brilliant home and high social duties bring consolation i do acknowledge that an eminent station will not only be graced by you but that you give the impression of being born to occupy it it is your destiny a miserable destiny it pleased cornelia to become the wilful child who quarrels with its tutors teachings upon this point then mr barrett said quickly your heart is not in this union can you ask i have done my duty have you indeed his tone was severe in the deliberation of its accents was it her duty to live an incomplete life he gave her a definition of personal duty and shadowed out all her own ideas on the subject seeming thus to speak terrible unanswerable truth as one who changes the theme he said i have forborne to revert to myself in our interviews they were too divine for that you will always remember that i have forborne much yes she was willing at the instant to confess how much and if i speak now i shall not be misinterpreted you never would have been by me cornelia though she knew what was behind the door this flinging of it open with her name startled the lady and if he had faltered it would not have been well for him but plainly he claimed the right to call her by her christian name she admitted it and thenceforward they were equals it was an odd story that he told of himself she could not have repeated it to make it comprehensible she drank at every sentence getting no more from it than the gratification of her thirst his father at least was a man of title a baronet what was meant by estates not entailed what wild freak of fate put this noble young man in the power of an eccentric parent who now caressed him now made him an outcast she heard of the sum that was his coming from his dead mother to support him just one hundred pounds annual was ever fate so mournful practically she understood that if mr barrett would write to his father pledging himself to conform to his mysterious despotic will in something he would be pardoned and reinstated he concluded hitherto i have preferred poverty you have taught me at what a cost is it too late the fall of his voice with the repetition of her name seemed as if awakening her but not in a land of reason whywhy she whispered beloved why did you not tell me this before do you upbraid me oh no oh never she felt his hand taking hers gently my friend she said half in selfdefence and they who had never kissed as lovers kissed under the plea of friendship chapter xxiii all wilfrids diplomacy was now brought into play to baffle mr pericles inspire emilia with the spirit of secresy and carry on his engagement to two women to their common satisfaction adela whose penetration he dreaded most he had removed by a flattering invitation to stornley and that emilia might be occupied during his absences and mr pericles thrown on a false scent he persuaded tracy runningbrook to come to brookfield and write libretti for emilias operas the two would sit down together for an hour drawing wonderful precocious noses upon juvenile visages when emilia would sigh and say i cant worktracy adding with resignation i never can at first mr pericles dogged them assiduously after a little while he shrugged remarking it is a nonsense they were however perfectly serious about the production of an opera tracy furnishing verse to emilias music he wrote with extraordinary rapidity but clung to graphic phrases that were not always supple enough for nuptials with modulated notes then emilia had to hit his sense of humour by giving the words as they came in the run of the song you make me crow or i croak she said the woman follows the man and music fits to verse cried tracy musics the vine verse the tree emilia meditated not if they grow up together she suggested and broke into a smile at his rapture of amusement which was succeeded by a dark perplexity worthy of the present aspect of mr pericles thats what has upset us he said we have been trying to grow up together like firstcousins and nature forbids the banns tomorrow you shall have half a libretto and then really my child you must adapt yourself to the words i will emilia promised only not if theyre like iron to the teeth my belief is said tracy savagely that musics a fashion and as delusive a growth as cobbetts potatoes which will go back to the deadly nightshade just as music will go back to the tomtom what have you called out when i sang to you emilia reproached him for this irreverent nonsense oh it was you and not the music he returned halfcajolingly while he beat the tomtom on air hark here cried emilia she recited a verse doesnt that sound dead now hark she sang the verse and looked confidently for tracys verdict at the close what a girl that is he went about the house raving of her to everybody with sundry gallic interjections until mrs chump said deed sir ye dont seem to have much idea of a womans feelins tracy produced in a night two sketches of libretti for emilia to choose fromthe roman clelia being one and camillus the other tracy praised either impartially and was indifferent between them he told her clelia offered the better theme for passionate song but there was a winning political object and rebuff to be given to radicalism in camillus think of rome he said emilia gave the vote for camillus beginning forthwith to hum with visions of a long roll of swarthy cavalry headed by a cleareyed young chief sunlight perching on his helm yes but you dont think of the situations in clelia and what i can do with her snapped tracy i see a song there that would light up all london unfortunately the sentiments dead radical it wouldnt so much matter if we were certain to do camillus as well because one would act as a counterpoise to the other you know well follow your own fancy camillus is strictly classical i treat opera there as alfieri conceived tragedy clelia is modern style cast the die for camillus and lets take horse only we lose the lovebusinessexactly where i show my strength clelia in the camp of the king dactyllic chorusaccompaniment while she in heavy voluptuous anapaests confesses her love for the enemy of her country remember this is our romantic opera where we do what we like with history and make up our minds for asses telling us to go home and read our students rome then that scene where she and the king dance the dactyls and the anapaests go to the chorus sublime lets go into the woods and begin we might give the first song or two tonight in composition mind always strike out your great scene and work from itdont work up to it or youve lost fire when you reach the point thats my method they ran into the woods skipping like schoolboy and schoolgirl on hearing that camillus would not be permitted to love other than his ungrateful country emilias conception of the roman lord grew pale and a controversy ensuedshe maintaining that a great hero must love a woman he declaring that a great hero might love a dozen but that it was beneath the dignity of this drama to allow of a rival to rome in camilluss love he will not do for music said emilia firmly and was immoveable in despair tracy proposed attaching a lanky barbarian daughter to brennus whose deeds of arms should provoke the admiration of the roman and so we relinquish alfieri for florian theres a sentimental burlesque at once the youth ejaculated in gloom i chose this subject entirely to give you rome for a theme emilia took his hand i do thank you if brennus has a daughter why not let her be half roman tracy fired out shes a bony woman with a brawny development mammoth haunches strong of the skeleton cheekbones flatforward as a fish s rotting on a beach long scissor lipsnippers to any wretched rose of a kiss a pugilists nose to the nostrils of a phoca and eyesdont you see themluminaries of pestilence blotted yellow like a tallow candle shining through a horny lantern at this horrible forcedpoetic portrait emilia cried in pain you hate her suddenly i loathe the creaturepah went tracy why do you make her so hideous emilia complained i feel myself hating her too look at me am i such a thing as that you tracy was melted in a trice and gave the motion of hugging as a commentary on his private opinion can you also be sure that camillus can love nothing but his country would one love stop the other she persisted gazing with an air of steady anxiety for the answer there isnt a doubt about it said tracy emilia caught her face in her hands and exclaimed in a stifling voice its true its true tracy saw that her figure was shaken with sobsunmistakeable hard sorrowful convulsions confound historical facts that make her cry he murmured to himself in a fury at the roman fables its no use comforting her with niebuhr now shes got a live camillus in her brain and there hell stick tracy began to mutter the emphatic d quite cognizant of her case as he supposed this intensity of human emotion about a dry faggot of history by no means surprised him and he was as tender to the grief of his darling little friend as if he had known the conflict that tore her in two subsequently he related the incident in a tone of tender delight to wilfrid whom it smote am i a brute asked the latter of the intelligences in the seat of his consciousness and they for the moment gravely affirmed it i have observed that when young men obtain this mental confirmation of their suspicions they wax less reluctant to act as brutes than when the doubt restrained them he reasoned thus i can bring my mind to the idea of losing her if it must be so hear hear from the unanimous internal parliament but i cant make her miserable cheersi cant go and break her heart loud cheers drowning a faint dissentient humthe scene of which tracy had told him gave wilfrid a kind of dread of the girl if that was her state of feeling upon a distant subject how would it be when he applied the knife simply impossible to use the knife at all wield it thou o circumstance babemunching chronos whosoever thou art that jarrest our poor human music effectually from hour to hour colonel pierson paid his promised visit on his way back to his quarters at verona his stay was shortened by rumours of anticipated troubles in italy one day at table he chanced to observe speaking of the milanese that they required another lesson and that it would save the shedding of blood if annually the chief men of the city took a flogging for the community senseless arrogance that sensible and even kindly men will sometimes be tempted to utter and prompted to act on in that deteriorating state of a perpetual repressive forceemilia looked at him till she caught his eye i hope i shall never meet you there she said the colonel coloured and drew his finger along each curve of his moustache the table was silent colonel pierson was a gentleman but a false position and the irritating topic deprived him of proper selfcommand what would you do he said not gallantly emilia would have been glad to have been allowed to subside but the tone stung her i could not do much i am a woman said she whereto the colonel its only the women who do anything over there and that is why you flog them the colonel seeing himself surrounded by ladies lost the right guidance of his wits at this point reddened and was saved by an irish outcry of horror from some unpleasant and possibly unmanly retort mr paricles said exactly the same oh sir do ye wear an officers uniform to go about behavin in that shockin way to poor helpless females this was the first time mrs chump had ever been found of service at the brookfield diningtable colonel pierson joined the current smile and the matter passed he was affectionate with wilfrid and invited him to verona with the assurance that his the austrian school of cavalry was the best in the world you beat us in pace and weight but you cant skirmish you cant manage squadrons and you know nothing of outpost duty said the colonel wilfrid promised to visit him some day a fact he denied to emilia when she charged him with it her brain seemed to be set on fire by the presence of an austrian officer the miserable belief that she had abandoned her country pressing on her remorsefully she lost appetite briskness of eye and the soft reddishbrown ripe bloodhue that made her cheeks sweet to contemplate she looked worn small wretched her very walk indicated selfcontempt wilfrid was keen to see the change for which others might have accused a temporary headache now that she appeared under this blight it seemed easier to give her up and his magnanimity being thus encouraged i am not hard on himremember the constitution of love in which a heart unaroused is pure selfishness and a heart aroused heroic generosity they being one heart to outer lifehis magnanimity i say being under this favourable sun he said to himself that there should be an end of doubledealing and possibly consoled by feeling a martyr he persuaded himself to act the gentle ruffian to which end he was again absent from brookfield for a space and bitterly missed emilia for the last two sundays had taken mr barretts place at the organ she was playing the prelude to one of the evening hymns when the lover whose features she dreaded to be once more forgetting appeared in the curtained enclosure a stoppage in the tune and a prolonged squeal of the instrument gave the congregation below matter to speculate upon wilfrid put up his finger and sat reverently down while emilia plunged tremblingly at the note that was howling its life away and as she managed to swim into the stream of the sacred melody again her head was turned toward her lover under a new sensation and the first words she murmured were we have never been in church together before not in the evening he whispered likewise impressed no said emilia softly flattered by his greater accuracy if wilfrid could have been sure that he would be perfect master of that sentimental crew known to him under the denomination of his feelings the place he selected for their parting interview might be held creditable to this young officers acknowledged strategical ability it was a place where any fervid appeals were impossible where he could contemplate her listen to her be near her alone with her having nothing to dread from tears supplications or passion as a consequence of the short indulgence of his tenderness but he had failed to reckon on the chances that he himself might prove weak and be betrayed by the crew for whose comfort he was always providing and now as she sat there her face being sideways to him the flush of delight faint on her cheek and her eyelids half raised to the gilded pipes while full and sonorous harmony rolled out from her touch it seemed the very chorus of the heavens that she commanded and a subtle misty glory descended upon her forehead which he was long in perceiving to be cast from a moisture on his eyelids when the sermon commenced emilia quitted the organ and took his hand in very low whispers they spoke i have wanted to see you so you see me now little woman on friday week next i am to go away nonsense you shall not your sisters say yes mr pericles has got my fathers consent they say to take me to italy do you think of going emilia gazed at her nerveless hands lying in her lap you shall not go he breathed imperiously in her ear then you will marry me quite soon and emilia looked as if she would be smiling april at a word my dear girl he had an air of caressing remonstrance because she continued if my father finds me out i must go to italy or go to that life of torment in londonseeing those jewpeoplehorribleor others and the thought of it is like being under the earth tasting bitter gravel i could almost bear it before you kissed me my lover it would kill me now say say tell me we shall be together i shudder all day and night and feel frozen hands catching at me i faintmy heart falls deep down in the darki think i know what dying is now she stopped on a tearless sob and at her fingers ends wilfrid felt the quivering of her frame my darling he interjected he wished to explain the situation to her as he then conceived it but he had in his calculation failed also to count on a peculiar nervous fretfulness that the necessity to reiterate an explanation in whispers must superinduce so when emilia looked vacant of the intelligence imparted to her he began anew and emphatically and ere he was half through it mr marter from the pulpit underneath sent forth a significant reprimand to the conscience of a particular culprit of his congregation in the form of a solemn cough emilia had to remain unenlightened and she proceeded to build on her previous assumption doing the whispering easily and sweetly in the prettiest way from her tongues tip with her chin lifted up and sending the vowels on a prolonged hushed breath that seemed to print them on the hearing far more distinctly than a volume of sound wilfrid fell back on monosyllables he could not bring his mouth to utter flinty negatives so it appeared that he assented and then his better nature abused him for deluding her he grew utterly ashamed of his aimless selfish doubledealing can it be he questioned his own mind and listened greedily to any mental confirmations of surpassing excellence in her that the world might possibly acknowledge having with great zeal created a set of circumstances he cursed them heartily after the fashion of little people he grew resigned to abandon lady charlotte and to give his name to this subduing girl but a comfortable quieting sensation came over him at the thought that his filial duty stood in the way his father he knew was anxious for him to marry into a noble familyincomprehensibly anxious to have the affair settled and as two or three scenes rose in his mind wilfrid perceived that the obstacle to his present fancy was his father as clearly as he could with the dread of the preachers admonishing cough before him wilfrid stated the case to emilia saying that he loved her with his whole heart but that the truth was his father was not in a condition of health to bear contradiction to his wishes and would he was sure be absolutely opposed to their union he brought on himself another reprimand from mr marter in seeking to propitiate emilias reason to comprehend the position rightly and could add little more to the fact he had spoken than that his father had other views which it would require time to combat emilia listened attentively replying with a flying glance to the squeeze of his hand he was astonished to see her so little disconcerted but now the gradual fall of mr marters voice gave them warning my lover breathed emilia hurriedly and eagerly questioning with eye and tone my darling returned wilfrid she sat down to the organ with a smile he was careful to retreat before the conclusion of the service somewhat chagrined by his success that smile of hers was inexplicable to him chapter xxiv mr pole was closeted in his city countinghouse with mr pericles before a heap of papers and newlyopened foreign letters to one of which bearing a russian stamp he referred fretfully at times as if to verify a monstrous fact any one could have seen that he was not in a condition to transact business his face was unnaturally patched with colour and his greytinged hair hung tumbled over his forehead like waves blown by a changeing wind still he maintained his habitual effort to look collected and defeat the scrutiny of the salloweyed fellow opposite who quietly glanced now and then from the nervous feet to the nervous fingers and nodded to himself a sardonic outlandish nod now listen to me said mr pericles we shall not burst out about zis riga man he is a villainvery well say it he is a villainsay so and stop because and up went the greeks forefinger we must not have a scandal in ze fairst place we do not want pity in ze second saird we must seem to trust him in spite i say yeas what is pity to us of commerce it is contempt we trust him on and we lose what he pocketa sossand we burst on him and we lose twenty serty forty and we lose reputation id have every villain hanged cried mr pole the scoundrel id hang him with his own hemp he talks of a factory burnt and dares to joke about tallow and in a business letter and when he is telling one of a loss of money to that amount not bad ze joke grinned mr pericles it is a lesson of coolness we learn it but mind he say possible loss it is not positif hein ze man is trying us so shall we burst out and make him desperate we are in his hand at riga you see i see this said mr pole that hes a confounded rascal and ill know whether the law cant reach him ha ze law mr pericles sneered so you are you english always ze law but we are menwe are not machine law for a machine not a man we punish him perhaps well he is punished he is imprisonedforty monz we pay for him a sossand pound a monz he is floggedforty lashes we pay for him a sossand pound a lash you can afford zat it is a luxury like anozer it is not for me how long are we to trust the villain said mr pole if we trust him at all mind i dont say i do or will ze money is locked up for a year my friend so soon we get it so soon he goes from ze toe off mr pericles shining toestip performed an agile circuit and he smoothed his square clean jaw and venomous moustache reflectively not now he resumed while he hold us in his hand we will not drive him to ze devil or we go too i believe or part of ze way but now we say zat money is frozen in ze nord we will make it in australie and in greek waters i have exposed to you my plan yes said mr pole and ive told you ive no pretensions to be a capitalist we have no less than three ventures out already it is like you english when you have ze world to milk you go to one point and stick it fails and you fail what is zat wordmr pericles tapped his browpluckyou want pluck it is your decadence greek and russian and yankee all zey beat you for it is pluck you make a pins head not a pin it is in brain and heart you do fail you have only your positionan island and ships and some favour you are no match in pluck we beat you and we live for pleasure while you groan and sweatmon dieu it is slavery mr pericles twinkled his white eyes over the blinking merchant and rose from his chair humming a bit of opera and announcing casually that a certain primadonna had obtained a divorce from her husband but he added suddenly i say to you if you cannot afford to speculate run away from it as ze fire run away from it and hold up your coattail jump ditches and do not stop till you are safe homehein you say cosy i hear my landlady run till you are safe cosy but if you are a man wis a head and a pocket zen you know that speculate means a dozen ventures so you come clear or it is ruin it is ruin i say you have been playing an englishman returned mr pole disgusted at the shrugs he had witnessedan englishmans as good as any of you look at uslook at our historylook at our wealth by jingo but we like plaindealing and common sense and as to afford what do you mean no no mr pericles petitioned with uplifted hand my english is bad it isah bad you shall look it overmy plan it will strike your sense next week i go to italy i take ze little belloni you will manage all i have in you my friend perfec confidence an englishman he is honest an englishman and a greek conjoined zey beat ze world it is true ma foi for zat i seek you and not a countryman a frenchmanoh no a germannot a bit a russiannever a yankeesave me i am a greeki take an englishman well well you must leave me to think it over said mr pole pleasantly smoothed down as to honesty thats a matter of course with us thats the mere footing we go upon we dont plume ourselves upon whats general here there is i regret to say a difference between us and other nations i believe its partly their religion they swindle us and pay their priests for absolution with our money if youre a doubledyed sinner you can easily get yourself whitewashed over there confound them when that fellow sent no remittance last month i told you i suspected him who was the shrewdest then as for pluck i never failed in that yet but i will see a thing clear the man who speculates blindfold is a fowl who walks into market to be plucked between being plucked and having pluck youll see a distinction when you know the language better but you must make use of your head or the chances are you wont be much of a differenceeh ill think over your scheme im not a man to hesitate if the calculations are sound ill look at the papers here my friend you will decide before zat i go to italy said mr pericles and presently took his leave when he was gone mr pole turned his chair to the table and made an attempt to inspect one of the papers deliberately having untied it he retied it with care put it aside marked immediate and read the letter from riga anew this he tore into shreds with animadversions on the quality of the rags that had produced it and opened the important paper once more he got to the end of a sentence or two when his fingers moved about for the letter and then his mind conceived a necessity for turning to the directory for which he rang the bell the great red book was brought into his room by a youthful clerk who waited by while his master unaware of his presence tracked a name with his forefinger it stopped at pole samuel bolton and a lurking smile was on the merchants face as he read the name a smile of curious meaning neither fresh nor sad the meditative smile of one who looks upon an afflicted creature from whom he is aloof after a lengthened contemplation of this name he said with a sigh poor chump i wonder whether hes here too a search for the defunct proved that he was out of date mr pole thrust his hand to the bell that he might behold poor chump in an old directory that would call up the blotted years i am here sir said his clerk who had been holding deferential watch at a few steps from the table what do you do here then sir all this time i waited sir because you waste and dawdle away twenty or thirty minutes when you ought to be doing your work what do you mean mr pole stood up and took an angry stride the young man could scarcely believe his master was not stooping to jest with him he said for that matter sir it cant be a minute that i have been wasting i called you in half an hour ago returned mr pole fumbling at his watchfob it must have been somebody else sir did you bring in this directory look at it this this is the book that i brought in sir how long since i think not a minute and a half sir mr pole gazed at him and coughed slowly i could have sworn he murmured and commenced blinking i suppose i must be a little queer he pursued and instantly his right hand struck out quivering the young clerk grasped it and drew him to a chair tush said his master working his feverish fingers across his forehead want of food i dont eat like you young fellows fetch me a glass of wine and a biscuit good wine mind port or no you cant trust tavern portbrandy get it yourself dont rely on the porter and bring it yourself you understand the importance what is your name braintop replied the youth with the modesty of one whose name has been too frequently subjected to puns i think i never heard so singular a name in my life mr pole ejaculated seriously braintop itll always make me think of brandy what are you waiting for now i took the liberty of waiting before to say that a lady wished to see you sir mr pole started from his chair a foreign lady she may be foreign she speaks english sir and her name i think was foreign ive forgotten it i fear its the wife of that fellow from riga cried the merchant show her in show her in immediately i suspected this shes in london i know im equal to her show her in when you fetch the braintop and biscuit call me to the door you understand the youth affected meekly to enjoy this fiery significance given to his name and said that he understood without any doubt he retired and in a few moments ushered in emilia belloni mr pole was in the middle of the room wearing a countenance of marked severity and watchful to maintain it in his opening bow but when he perceived his little brookfield guest standing timidly in the doorway his eyebrows lifted and his hands spread out and well to be sure he cried while emilia hurried up to him she had to assure him that everything was right at home and was next called upon to state what had brought her to town but his continued exclamation of bless my soul reprieved her reply and she sat in a chair panting quickly mr pole spoke tenderly of refreshments wine and cake or biscuits i cannot eat or drink said emilia why whats come to you my dear returned mr pole in unaffected wonder i am not hungry you generally are at home about this timeeh emilia sighed and feigned the sad note to be a breath of fatigue well and why are you here my dear mr pole was beginning to step to the right and the left of her uneasily i have come she paused with a curious quick speculating look between her eyes i have come to see you see me my dear you saw me this morning yes i wanted to see you alone emilia was having the first conflict with her simplicity out of which it was not to issue clear as in the foregone days she was thinking of the character of the man she spoke to studying him that she might win him to succour the object she had in view it was a quality going and a quality coming nor will we if you please lament a law of growth why you can see me alone any day my dear said mr pole for many a day i hope you are more alone to me here i cannot speak at brookfield ohand emilia had to still her hearts throbbingyou do not want me to go to italy do you want you to go not a bit there is some talk of it isnt there i dont want you to go dont you want to go no no said emilia with decisive fervour dont want to go no to stay i want to stay eh to stay to stay with you never to leave england at least i want to give up all that i may stay all repeated mr pole evidently marvelling as to what that sounding box might contain and still more perplexed to hear emilias vehementyes all as if there were that in the mighty abnegation to make a reasonable listener doubtful no i really dont want you to go he said in fact and the merchants hospitable nature was at war with something in his mind i like you my dear i like to have you about me youre cheerful youre agreeable i like your smile your voice too youre a very pleasant companion only you know we may break up our house if the girls get married i must live somewhere in lodgings and i couldnt very well ask you to cook for me i can cook a little emilia smiled i went into the kitchen till adela objected yes but it wouldnt do you know pursued mr pole with the seriousness of a man thrown out of his line of argument you can cook eh got an idea of it i always said you were a useful little woman do have a biscuit and some wineno well where was ithat confounded boy braintytop top thats it braintop was i talking of him my dear oh no about your getting married for if you can cook why not get a husband and then you wont got to italy you ought to get one some young fellows dont look for money i shall make money come in time said emilia in the leaping ardour of whose eyes might be seen that what she had journeyed to speak was hot within her i know i shall be worth having i shall win a name i thinki do hope it well so pericles says hes got a great notion of you perhaps he means it himself hes rich rash i admit but as the chances go hes tremendously rich he may mean it what asked emilia marry you you know ah what a torture in that heat of her feelings she realized the horror of the words to her with an intensity that made them seem to quiver like an arrow in her breast you dont like him said mr pole not love him not love him yes yes but that comes after marriage often the case look here dont you go against your interests you mustnt be flighty if pericles speaks to you have him clap your hands dozens of girls would that i know but oh interposed emilia if he married me he would kiss me mr pole coughed and blinked well he remarked as one gravely cogitating and with the native delicacy of a briton turned it off in a playful so shall i now adding though i aint your husband he stooped his head emilia put her hands on his shoulders and submitted her face to him there went mr pole pon my honour it does me goodbetter than medicine but you mustnt give that dose to everybody my dear you dont of course all right all rightim quite satisfied i was only thinking of you going to italy among those foreign rascals whove no more respect for a girl than they have for a monkeytheir brother a set of swindlers i took you for the wife of one when you came in at first and now business is business lets get it over what have you come about glad to see youunderstand that emilia lifted her eyes to his you know i love you sir im sure youre a grateful little woman she rose oh how can i speak it an idea that his daughters had possibly sent her to herald one of the renowned physicians of london concerning whom he was perpetually being plagued by them or to lead him to one flashed through mr pole he was not in a state to weigh the absolute value of such a suspicion but it seemed probable it explained an extraordinary proceeding and having conceived his wrath took it up as a fact and fought with it stop if thats what youve come for well bring matters to a crisis you fancy me ill dont you my dear you do not look well sir emilias unhesitating reply confirmed his suspicion i am well i am i say and now understand that if thats your business i wont go to the fellow and i wont see him here theyll make me out mad next he shall never have a guinea from me while i live no nor when i die not a farthing sit down my dear and wait for the biscuits i wish to heaven theyd come theres brandy coming too wheres braintop he took out his handkerchief to wipe his forehead and jerked it like a bellrope emilia in a singular bewilderment sat eyeing a beam of sombre city sunlight on the dusty carpet she could only suppose that the offending he was wilfrid but why he should be so she could not guess and how to plead for him divided her mind dont blame him be angry with me if you are angry she began softly i know he thinks of you anxiously i know he would do nothing to hurt you no one is so kind as he is would you deprive him of money because he offends you deprive him of money repeated mr pole with ungrudging accentuation well ive heard about women but i never knew one so anxious for a doctor to get his fee as you are emilia wonderingly fixed her sight on him an instant and quite unillumined resumed blame me sir but i know you will be too kind oh i love him so i must love you and i would not give you pain it is true he loves me you will not see him because he loves me the doctor muttered mr pole the doctor he almost bellowed and got sharp up from his chair and looked at himself in the glass blinking rapidly and then turned to inspect emilia emilia drew him to her side again go on he said and there became visible in his face a frightful effort to comprehend her and get to the sense of her words and why it was so frightful as to be tragic you will know presently he thought of the arrival of braintop freighted with brandy as the only light in the mist and breathing heavily from his nose almost snorting the air he took in from a widened mouth he sat and tried to listen to her words as well as for braintops feet emilia was growing too conscious of her halting eloquence as the imminence of her happiness or misery hung balancing in doubtful scales before her oh he loves me and i love him she gasped and wondered why words should be failing her see us together sir and hear us we will make you well the exclamation good lord groaned out in a tone as from the lower pits of despair cut her short tearfully she murmured you will not see us sir together bawled the merchant yes i mean together if youre not mad i am and he jumped on his legs and walked to the farther corner of the room which of us is it his features twitched in horribly comic fashion what do you mean i cant understand a word my brain must have gone throwing his hand over his forehead ive feared so for the last four months good god a lunatic asylum and the business torn like a piece of old rag i know that fellow at rigas dancing like a cannibal and therethere ll be articles in the papershere girl come up to the light come here i say emilia walked up to him you dont look mad i dare say everybody else understands you do they the sadflushed pallor of his face provoked emilia to say you ought to have the doctor here immediately let me bring him sir a gleam as of a lantern through his oppressive mental fog calmed the awful irritability of his nerves somewhat youve got him outside no sir the merchants eagerness faded out he put his hand to her shoulder and went along to a chair sinking into it and closing his eyelids so they remained emilia at his right hand she watched him breathing with a weak open mouth and thought more of the doctor now than of wilfrid chapter xxv braintops knock at the door had been unheeded for some minutes at last emilia let him in the brandy and biscuits were placed on a table and emilia resumed her watch by mr pole she saw that his lips moved after a space and putting her ear down understood that he desired not to see any one who might come for an interview with him nor were the clerks to be admitted the latter direction was given in precise terms emilia repeated the orders outside on her return the merchants eyes were open my forehead feels damp he said and im not hot at all just take hold of my hands theyre like wet crumpets i wonder what makes me so stiff a man mustnt sit at business too long at a time sure to make people think hes ill what was that about a doctor i seem to remember i wont see one emilia had filled a glass with brandy she brought it nearer to his hand while he was speaking at the touch of the glass his fingers went round it slowly and he raised it to his mouth the liquor revived him he breathed ah several times and grimaced blinking as if seeking to arouse a proper brightness in his eyes then he held out his empty glass to her and she filled it and he sipped deliberately saying im warm inside i keep on perspiring so cold cant make it out look at my fingerends my dear theyre whitish arent they emilia took the hand he presented and chafed it and put it against her bosom half under one arm the action appeared to give some warmth to his heart for he petted her in return a third time he held out the glass and remarked that this stuff was better than medicine you women he sneered as at a reminiscence of their faith in drugs my legs are weak though he had risen and tested the fact very shaky i wonder what makes emi dont take much exercise pondering on this problem he pursued its the stomach im as empty as an eggshell odd ive got no appetite but my spirits are up i begin to feel myself again ill eat byandby my dear and i say ill tell you whatill take you to the theatre tonight i want to laugh a mans all right when hes laughing i wish it was christmas dont you like to see the old pantaloon tumbled over my boymy girl i mean i did when i was a boy my father took me i went in the pit i can smell oranges when i think of it i remember we supped on german sausage or hamone or the other those were happy old days he shook his head at them across the misty gulf perhaps theres a good farce going on now if so well go girls ought to learn to laugh as well as boys ill ring for braintop he rang the bell and bade emilia be careful to remind him that he wanted braintops address for braintop was useful it appeared that there were farces at several of the theatres braintop rattled them out their plot and fun and the merits of the actors with delightful volubility as one whose happy subject had been finally discovered he was forthwith commissioned to start immediately and take a stagebox at one of the places of entertainment where two great rivals of the doctor genus promised to laugh dull care out of the spirit of man triumphantly and at the description of whose drolleries any one with faith might be half cured the youth gave his address on paper to emilia make haste sir said mr pole and stop you shall go yourself go to the pit and have a supper and ill pay for it when youve ordered the boxdo you know the bedford hotel go there and see mrs chickley and tell her i am coming to dine and sleep and shall bring one of my daughters dinner sittingroom and two bedrooms mind and tell mrs chickley weve got no carpetbag and must come upon her wardrobe all clear to you dinner at halfpast five going to theatre braintop bowed comprehendingly now that fellow goes off chirping said mr pole to emilia its just the thing i used to wish to happen to me when i was his agemy master to call me in and say there go and be jolly i dare say the rascalll order a champagne supper poor young chap let his heart be merry ha ha heighotoo much business is bad for man and boy i feel better already if it werent for my legs my feet are so cold dont you think im pretty talkative my dear i am glad to hear you talk said emilia striving to look less perplexed than she felt he asked her slyly why she had come to london and she begged that she might speak of it byandby whereat mr pole declared that he intended to laugh them all out of that nonsense and what did you say about being in love with him a doctor in good practicebut you neednt commence by killing me if you do go and marry the fellow eh what is it emilia was too much entangled herself to attempt to extricate him and apparently his wish to be enlightened passed away for he was the next instant searching among his papers for the letter from riga not finding it he put on his hat must give up business today cant do business with a petticoat in the room i wish the lord mayord stop them all at temple bar now well go out and ill show you a bit of the city he offered her his arm and she noticed that in walking through the office he was erect and the few words he spoke were delivered in the peremptory elastic tone of a vigorous man my girls he said to her in an undertone never come here well we dont expect ladies you know different spheres in this world they mean to be tiptop in society and quite right too my dear i think well ride do you mind being seen in a cab he asked her hesitatingly and when emilia said oh no let us ride he seemed relieved i cant see the harm in a cab different tastes in this world my girlsbut thank the lord theyve got carriages for an hour the merchant and emilia drove about the city he showed her all the great buildings and dilated on the fabulous piles of wealth they represented taking evident pleasure in her exclamations of astonishment yes yes they may despise us city fellows i say come and see thats all now look up that court do you see three dusty windows on the second floor that man there could buy up any ten princes in europeexcepting one or two austrians or russians he wears a coat just like mine does he said emilia involuntarily examining the one by her side we dont show our goldlinings in the city my dear but you are rich too oh ias far as that goes dont talk about me imim still cold in the feet now look at that corner house three months ago that man was one of our most respected city merchants now hes a bankrupt and cant show his head it was all rotten a medlar he tampered with documents betrayed trusts what do you think of him what was it he did asked emilia mr pole explained and excused him then he explained and abused him he hadnt a family my dear where did the money go hes called a rascal now poor devil business brings awful temptations you think thisll save me you catch hold of it and it snaps thatll save me but youre too heavy and the roots give way and down you go lower and lower lower and lower the gates of hell must be very low down if one of our bankrupts dont reach em he spoke this in a deep underbreath lets get out of the city theres no air look at that cloud its about over brookfield i should say dear brookfield echoed emilia feeling her heart fly forth to sing like a skylark under the cloud and theyre not satisfied with it murmured mr pole with a voice of unwonted bitterness at the hotel he was received very cordially by mrs chickley and simon the old waiter you look as young as ever maam mr pole complimented her cheerfully while he stamped his feet on the floor and put forward emilia as one of his girls but immediately took the landlady aside to tell her that she was merely a chargea wardsomething of that sort admitting gladly enough that she was a very nice young lady shes a genius maam in musicgoing to do wonders shes not one of them and mr pole informed mrs chickley that when they came to town they usually slept in one or other of the great squares he for his part preferred old quarters comfort versus grandeur simon had soon dressed the dinnertable by the time dinner was ready mr pole had sunk into such a condition of drowsiness that it was hard to make him see why he should be aroused and when he sat down fronting emilia his eyes were glazed and he complained that she was scarcely visible some of your old yellow seal simon thats what i want i havent got better at home the contents of this old yellow seal formed the chief part of the merchants meal emilia was induced to drink two full glasses doesnt that make your feet warm my dear said mr pole it makes me want to talk emilia confessed ah we shall have some fun tonight totheruttetato if you could only sing begone dull care i like glees good honest english manly singing for me nothing like glees and madrigals to my mind with chops and baked potatoes and a glass of good stout they beat all other music emilia sang softly to him when she had finished mr pole applauded her mildly your music my dear my music mr runningbrooks words but only look he will not change a word and some of the words are so curious they make me lift my chin and pout its all in my throat i feel as if i had to do it on tiptoe mr runningbrook wrote the song in ten minutes he can afford tocomes of a family said mr pole and struck up a bit of celias arbour which wandered into the soldier tired as he came bendingly both sets of fingers filliping toward emilia with one of those ancient gleesuspensions taiahaiahaiahaia etc which were meant for jolly fellows who could bear anything eh went mr pole to elicit approbation in return emilia smoothed the wrinkles of her face and smiled theres nothing like port said mr pole get little runningbrook to write a song theres nothing like port you put the music ill sing it you will cried emilia yes upon my honour now my feet are warmer i by jingo whats that and again he wore that strange calculating look as if he were being internally sounded and guessed at his probable depth what a twitch something wrong with my stomach but a fellow must be all right when his spirits are up well be off as quick as we can taiahaihaiahum if the farce is bad its my last night of theatregoing the delight at being in a theatre kept emilia dumb when she gazed on the glittering lights after an inspection of the house mr pole kindly remarked you must marry and get out of this thisd never do all very well in the boxes but on the stageoh no i shouldnt like you to be there if my girls dont approve of the doctor they shall look out somebody for you i shouldnt like you to be painted and rigged out and have to squall in this sort of place stage wont do for you no no emilia replied that she had given up the stage and looked mournfully at the dropscene as at a lost kingdom scarcely repressing her tears the orchestra tuned and played a light overture she followed up the windings of the dropscene valley meeting her lover somewhere beneath the castleruin where the river narrowed and the trees intertwined on from dream to dream the music carried her and dull fell the first words of the farce mr pole said now then and began to chuckle as the farce proceeded he grew more serious repeating to emilia quite anxiously i wonder whether that boy braintops enjoying it emilia glanced among the sea of heads and finally eliminated the head of braintop who was respectfully devoting his gaze to the box she occupied when mr pole had been assisted to discover him likewise his attention alternated between braintop and the stage and he expressed annoyance from time to time at the extreme composure of braintops countenance why dont the fellow laugh does he think hes listening to a sermon poor braintop on his part sat in mortal fear lest his admiration of emilia was perceived divided between this alarming suspicion and a doubt that the hair on his forehead was not properly regulated he became uneasy and fitful in his deportment his imagination plagued him with a sense of guilt which his masters watchfulness of him increased he took an opportunity to furtively to eye himself in a pocketmirror and was subsequently haunted by an additional dread that emilia might have discovered the instrument and set him down as a vain foolish dog when he saw her laugh he was sure of it instead of responding to mr poles encouragement he assumed a taciturn aspect worthy of a youthful anchorite and continued to be the spectator of a scene to which his soul was dead i believe that fellows thinking of nothing but his supper said mr pole i dare say he dined early in the day returned emilia remembering how hungry she used to be in the evenings of the potatoedays yes but he might laugh all the same and mr pole gave emilia the sound advice mind you never marry a fellow who cant laugh braintop saw emilia smile then in an instant her face changed its expression to one of wonder and alarm and her hands clasped together tightly what on earth was the matter with her his agitated fancy centred in himself now decided that some manifestation of most shocking absurdity had settled on his forehead or his hair for he was certain of his necktie braintop had recourse to his pocketmirror once more it afforded him a rapid interchange of glances with a face which he at all events could distinguish from the mass though we need not the youth was in the act of conveying the instrument to its retreat when conscience sent his eyes toward emilia who to his horror beckoned to him and touched mr pole entreating him to do the same mr pole gesticulated imperiously whereat braintop rose and requested his neighbour to keep his seat for ten minutes as he was going into that particular box and if i dont come back in ten minutes i shall stop there said braintop a little grandly through the confusion of his ideas as he guessed at the possible reasons for the summons emilia had seen her father in the orchestra there he sat under the leader sullenly fiddling the prelude to the second play like a man ashamed and one of the beaten in this world flight had been her first thought she had cause to dread him the more she lived and the dawning knowledge of what it is to be a woman in the world grew with her the more she shrank from his guidance and from reliance on him not that she conceived him designedly base but he outraged her now conscious delicacy and what she had to endure as a girl seemed unbearable to her now besides she felt a secret shuddering at nameless things which made her sick of the thought of returning to him and his jew friends but alas he looked so miserablea child of harmony among the sons of discord he kept his head down fiddling like a machine the old potatoedays became pathetically edged with dead light to emilia she could not be cruel when i am safe she laid stress on the word in her mind to awaken blessed images i will see him often and make him happy but i will let him know that all is well with me now and that i love him always so she said to mr pole i know one of those in the orchestra may i write a word to him on a piece of paper before we go i wish to mr pole reflected and seeing her earnest in her desire to do this replied well yes if you mustthe girls are not here emilia borrowed his pencilcase and wrote sandra is well and always loves her caro papa and is improving and will see him soon her heart is full of love for him and for her mama and if they leave their lodgings they are to leave word where they go sandra never forgets italy and reads the papers she has a copy of the score of an unknown opera by our andronizetti and studies it and anatomy english french and pure italian and can ride a horse she has made rich friends who love her it will not be long and you will see her the hasty scrawl concluded with numerous little caressing exclamations in italian diminutives this done emilia thought but he will look up and see me she resolved not to send it till they were about to quit the theatre consequently braintop on his arrival was told to sit down you dont look cheerful in the pit said mr pole youre above iteh youre all alike in that none of you do what your dads did upupup you may get too high ehgallery and mr pole winked knowingly and laughed braintop thus elevated tried his best to talk to emilia who sat half fascinated with the fear of seeing her father lift his eyes and recognize her suddenly she sat boldly in the front as before not being a young woman to hide her head where there was danger and having perhaps a certain amount of the fatalism which is often youths philosophy in the affairs of life if this is to be can i avert it mr pole began to nod at the actors heavily he said to emilia if there is any fun going on give me a nudge emilia kept her eyes on her father in the orchestra full of pity for his deplorable wig in which she read his later domestic history and sad tales of the family dinners do you see one of thoseshe pointed him out to braintop he is next to the leader with his back to us are you sure i want you to give him this note before he goes when we go will you do it i shall always be thankful to you considering what braintop was ready to do that he might be remembered for a day and no more the request was so very moderate as to be painful to him you will leave him when you have given it into his hand you are not to answer any questions said emilia with a reassuring glance at the musicians wig braintop bent his head do see she pursued how differently he bows from the other men though it is only dance music oh how his ears are torn by that violoncello he wants to shriekhe bears it she threw a piteous glance across the agitated instruments and braintop was led to inquire is he anything particular he can bring out notes that are more like honeyif you can fancy a thread of honey drawn through your heart as if it would never end he is italian braintop modestly surveyed her hair and brows and cheeks and taking the print of her eyes on his brain to dream over smelt at a relationship with the wry black wig which cast a halo about it the musicians laid down their instruments and trooped out one by one emilia perceived a man brush against her fathers elbow her father flicked at his offended elbow with the opposite hand and sat crumpled up till all had passed him then went out alone that little action of disgust showed her that he had not lost spirit albeit condemned to serve amongst an inferior race promoters of discord just as the third play was opening some commotion was seen in the pit rising from near braintops vacated seat and presently a thing that shone flashing to the lights came on from hand to hand each hand signalling subsequently toward mr poles box it approached braintops eyes were in waiting on emilia who looked sadly at the empty orchestra a gentleman in the stalls a head beneath her bowed and holding up a singular article gravely said that he had been requested to pass it she touched mr poles shoulder eh anything funny said he and glanced around he was in time to see braintop lean hurriedly over the box and snatch his pocketmirror from the gentlemans hand ha ha he laughed as if a comic gleam had illumined him a portion of the pit and stalls laughed too emilia smiled merrily what was it said she and perceiving many faces beneath her red among handkerchiefs she was eager to see the thing that the unhappy braintop had speedily secreted come sir lets see it quoth mr pole itching for a fresh laugh and in spite of braintops protest and in defiance of his burning blush he compelled the wretched youth to draw it forth and be manifestly convicted of vanity a shout of laughter burst from mr pole no wonder these young sparks cut us all out lord what cunning dogs they are they aint satisfied with seeing themselves in their boots but theyha ha by george weve got the best fun in our box i say braintop you ought to have two my boy then youd see how you looked behind hahahah never enjoyed an evening so much in my life a lookingglass for their pockets ha hahooh luckily the farce demanded laughter or those parts of the pit which had not known braintop would have been indignant mr pole became more and more possessed by the fun as the contrast of braintops abject humiliation with this glaring testimony to his conceit tickled him he laughed till he complained of hunger emilia though she thought it natural that braintop should carry a pocketmirror if he pleased laughed from sympathy until braintop reduced to the verge of forbearance stood up and remarked that to perform the mission entrusted to him he must depart immediately mr pole was loth to let him go but finally commending him to a good supper he sighed and declared himself a new man oh what a jolly laugh the very thing i wanted its worth hundreds to me i was queer before no doubt about that again the ebbing convulsion of laughter seized him i feel as clear as day he said and immediately asked emilia whether she thought he would have strength to get down to the cab she took his hand trying to assist him from the seat he rose and staggered an instant a sort of reddish cloud he murmured feeling over his forehead ha i know what it is i want a chop a chop and a song but i couldnt take you and i like you by me good little woman he patted emilias shoulder preparatory to leaning on it with considerable weight and so descended to the cab chuckling ever and anon at the reminiscence of braintop there was a disturbance in the street a man with a foreign accent was shouting by the door of a neighbouring publichouse that he would not yield his hold of the collar of a struggling gentleman till the villain had surrendered his child whom he scandalously concealed from her parents a scuffle ensued and the foreign voice was heard again wat wat you have de shame you have de pluck ah to tell me you know not where she is and you bring me a letter hoyou have de cheeks to tell me this highly effective pluralizing of their peculiar slang brought a roar of applause from the crowd of britons only a street row said mr pole to calm emilia will he be hurt she cried i see a couple of policemen handy said mr pole and emilia cowered down and clung to his hand as they drove from the place chapter xxvi it was midnight mr pole had appeased his imagination with a chop and was trying to revive the memory of his old aftertheatre night carouses by listening to a song which emilia sang to him while he sipped at a smoking mixture and beat time on the table rejoiced that he was warm from head to foot at last thats a pretty song my dear he said a very pretty song it does for an old fellow and so did my supper light and wholesome im an old fellow i ought to know ive got a grownup son and grownup daughters i shall be a grandpa soon i dare say its not the thing for me to go about hearing glees i had an idea of it im better here all i want is to see my children happy married and settled and comfortable emilia stole up to him and dropped on one knee you love them i do i love my girls and my boy and my brandyandwater do you mean to say you rogue and me emilia looked up at him beseechingly yes and you i do i havent known you long my dear but i shall be glad to do what i can for you you shall make my house your home as long as you live and if i say make haste and get married its only just this girls ought to marry young and not be in an uncertain position am i worth having to be sure you are i should think so you havent got a penny but then youre not for spending one andmr pole nodded to right and left like a man who silenced a host of invisible logicians urging this and thatyoure a pleasant companion thrifty pretty musical by jingo what more do they want theyll have their song and chop at home yes but suppose it depends upon their fathers well if their fathers will be fools my dear i cant help em we neednt take em in a lump how about the doctor ill see him tomorrow morning and hear what he has to say shall i mr pole winked shrewdly you will not make my heart break emilias voice sounded one low chord as she neared the thing she had to say bless her soul the old merchant patted her im not the sort of man for that nor his his mr poles nerves became uneasy in a minute at the scent of a mystification he dashed his handkerchief over his forehead repeating his break a mans heart i whats the meaning of that for gods sake dont bother me emilia was still kneeling before him eyeing him with a shadowed steadfast air i say his because his heart is in mine he has any pain that hurts me he may be tremendously in love observed mr pole but he seems a deuced soft sort of a doctor whats his name i love wilfrid the merchant appeared to be giving ear to her long after the words had been uttered while there was silence in the room wilfrid my son he cried with a start he is my lover damned rascal mr pole jumped from his chair going and playing with an unprotected girl i can pardon a young mans folly but this is infamous my dear child he turned to emilia if youve got any notion about my son wilfrid you must root it up as quick as you can if hes been behaving like a villain leave him to me i detest i hate i loathe i would kick a young man who deceives a girl even if hes my sonmores the reason mr pole was walking up and down the room fuming as he spoke emilia tried to hold his hand as he was passing but he said there my child im very sorry for you and im damned angry with him let me go can you can you be angry with him for loving me deceiving you returned mr pole thats what it is and i tell you id rather fifty times the fellow had deceived me anything rather than that he should take advantage of a girl wilfrid loves me and would die for me said emilia now let me tell you the fact mr pole came to a halt fronting her my son wilfrid pole may be in love as he says here and there but he is engaged to be married to a lady of title i have his wordhis oath he got near a thousand pounds out of my pocket the other day on that understanding i dont speak about the money butnowits a lumpothers would have made a nice row about itbut is he a liar is he a seducing idling vagabond dog is he a contemptible scoundrel he is my lover said emilia she stood without changing a feature as in a darkness holding to the one thing she was sure of then with a sudden track of light in her brain i know the mistake she said pardon him he feared to offend you because you are his father and he thought i might not quite please you for he loves me he has loved me from the first moment he saw me he cannot be engaged to another i could bring him from any womans side i have only to say to myselfhe must come to me for he loves me it is not a thing to doubt mr pole turned and recommenced his pacing with hasty steps all the indications of a nervous tempest were on him interjecting halfformed phrases and now and then staring at emilia as at an incomprehensible object he worked at his hair till it lent him the look of one in horror at an apparition the fellows going to marry lady charlotte chillingworth i tell you he has asked my permission the infernal scamp he knew it pleased me he bled me of a thousand pounds only the other day i tell you hes going to marry lady charlotte chillingworth emilia received this statement with a most perplexing smile she shook her head he cannot cannot i say he shall and must and in a couple of months too the gravely sceptical smile on emilias face changed to a blank pallor then you make him siryou hell be a beggar if he dont you will keep him without money mr pole felt that he gazed on strange deeps in that girls face her voice had the wirelike hum of a rising wind there was no menace in her eyes the lashes of them drooped almost tenderly and the lips were but softly closed the heaving of the bosom though weighty was regular the hands hung straight down and were open she looked harmless but his physical apprehensiveness was sharpened by his nervous condition and he read power in her the capacity to concentrate all animal and mental vigour into one feelingthis being the power of the soul so she stood breathing quietly steadily eyeing him no no went on mr pole come come well sit down and see and talksee what can be done you know i always meant kindly by you oh yes emilia musically murmured and it cost her nothing to smile again now tell me how this began mr pole settled himself comfortably to listen all irritation having apparently left him under the influence of the dominant nature you need not be ashamed to talk it over to me i am not ashamed emilia led off and told her tale simply with here and there one of her peculiar illustrations she had not thought of love till it came to life suddenly she said and then all the world looked different the relation of wilfrids bravery in fighting for her varied for a single instant the low monotony of her voice at the close of the confession mr pole wore an aspect of distress this creatures utter unlikeness to the girls he was accustomed to corroborated his personal view of the case that wilfrid certainly could not have been serious and that she was deluded but he pitied her for he had sufficient imagination to prevent him from despising what he did not altogether comprehend so to fortify the damsel he gave her a lecture first on young mentheir selfish inconsiderateness their weakness the wanton lives they led their trick of lying for any sugarplum and how they laughed at their dupes secondly as to the conduct consequently to be prescribed to girls who were weaker frailer by disposition more confiding and who must believe nothing but what they heard their elders say emilia gave patient heed to the lecture but i am safe she remarked when he had finished for my lover is not as those young men are to speak at all and arrange his ideas was a vexation to the poor merchant he was here like an irritable traveller who knocks at a gate which makes as if it opens without letting him in emilias naive confidence he read as stupidity it brought on a fresh access of the nervous fever lurking in him and he cried jumping from his seat well you cant have him and theres an end you must give upconfound why do you expect to have everything you want at starting there my childbut upon my honour a man loses his temper at having to talk for an hour or so and no result you must go to bed anddo you say your prayers well thats one way of getting out of itpray that you may forget all about whats not good for you why youre almost like a young man when you set your mind on a thing bad wont do say your prayers regularly and please pour me out a mouthful of brandy my hand tremblesi dont know whats the matter with itjust like those rushes on the thames i used to see when out fishing no wind and yet there they shake away i wish it was daylight on the old river now its night and no mistake i feel as if i had a fellow twirling a stick over my head the rascals been at it for the last month there stop where you are my dear dont begin to dance he pressed at his misty eyes half under the impression that she was taking a succession of dazzling leaps in air terror of an impending blow which he associated with emilias voice made him entreat her to be silent after a space he breathed a long breath of relief saying no no youre firm enough on your feet i dont think i ever saw you dance my girls have given it up what led me to thinkbut lets to bed and say our prayers i want a kiss emilia kissed him on the forehead the symptoms of illness were strange to her and passed unheeded she was too full of her own burning passion to take evidence from her sight the sun of her world was threatened with extinction she felt herself already a wanderer in a land of tombs where none could say whether morning had come or gone intensely she looked her misery in the face and it was as a voice that said no sun never sun any more to her but a bluehued moon slipped from among the clouds and hung in the black outstretched fingers of the tree of darkness fronting troubled waters this is thy light for ever thou shalt live in thy dream so as in a prisonhouse did her soul now recall the blissful hours by wilming weir she sickened but an instant the blood in her veins was too strong a tide for her to crouch in that imagined corpselike universe which alternates with an irradiated eden in the brain of the passionate young why should i lose him the dry sob choked her she struggled with the emotion in her throat and mr pole who had previously dreaded supplication and appeals for pity caressed her instantly the flood poured out you are not cruel i knew it i should have died if you had come between us oh wilfrids father i love youi have never had a very angry word on my mouth think think if you had made me curse you for i could you would have stopped my life and wilfrids what would our last thoughts have been we could not have forgiven you take up dead birds killed by frost you cry cruel winter murdering cold but i knew better you are wilfrids father whom i can kneel to my lovers father my own father my friend next to heaven oh bless my love for him you have only to know what my love for him is the thought of losing him goes like perishing cold through my bonesmy heart jerks as if it had to pull up my body from the grave every time it beats god in heaven cried the horrified merchant on whose susceptible nerves these images wrought with such a force that he absolutely had dread of her he gasped and felt at his heart and then at his pulse rubbed the moisture from his forehead and throwing a fixedly wild look on her eyes he jumped up and left her kneeling his caress had implied mercy to emilia for she could not reconcile it with the rejection of the petition of her soul she was now a little bewildered to see him trotting the room frowning and blinking and feeling at one wrist at momentary pauses all his words being lets be quiet lets be good lets go to bed and say our prayers mingled with short ejaculations i may say she intercepted him i may tell my dear lover that you bless us both and that we are to live oh speak sir let me hear you lets go to bed iterated mr pole come candles do light them in gods name light candles and lets be off and say our prayers you consent sir whats that your heart does mr pole stopped to enquire adding there dont tell me youve played the devil with mine whod ever have made me believe that i should feel more at ease running up and down the room than seated in my armchair among the wonders of the world that emilia put up her lips to kiss him as he passed her there was something deliciously soothing and havenlike to him in the aspect of her calmness now youll be a good girl said he when he had taken her salute and you she rejoined will be happier his voice dropped if you go on like this youve done for me but she could make no guess at any tragic meaning in his words my fatherlet me call you so will you see that you cant have him he stamped the syllables into her ears and with a notion of there being a foreign element about her repeatednonot have himnot yourssomebody elses this was clear enough only you can separate us said emilia with a brow levelled intently well and i mr pole was pursuing in the gusty energy of his previous explanation his eyes met emilias gravely widening iim very sorry he broke down upon my soul i am the old man went to the mantelpiece and leaned his elbow before the glass emilias bosom began to rise again she was startled to hear him laugh a slight melancholy little burst and then a louder one followed by a fulltoned laughter that fell short and showed the heart was not in it that boy braintop what fun it was he said looking all the while into the glass why cant we live in peace and without bother is your candle alight my dear emilia now thought that he was practising evasion i will light it she said mr pole gave a wearied sigh his head being still turned to the glass he listened with a shrouded face for her movements saying good night good night ill light my own theres a dear a shouting was in his ears which seemed to syllable distinctly if she goes at once im safe the sight of pain at all was intolerable to him but he had a prophetic physical warning now that to witness pain inflicted by himself would be more than he could endure emilia breathed a low good night good night my loveall right tomorrow he replied briskly and remorse touching his kind heart as the music of her good night penetrated to it by thrilling avenues he added injudiciously dont fret well see what we can do soon make matters comfortable i love you and i know you will not stab me she answered no certainly not said mr pole still keeping his back to her struck with a sudden anticipating fear of having to go through this scene on the morrow he continued no misunderstands mind wilfrids done with there was a silence he trusted she might be gone turning round he faced her the light of the candle throwing her pale visage into ghostly relief where is sleep for you if you part us mr pole flung up his arms i insist upon your going to bed why shouldnt i sleep childs folly though he spoke so his brain was in strings to his timorous ticking nerves and he thought that it would be well to propitiate her and get her to utter some words that would not haunt his pillow my dear girl its not my doing i like you i wish you well and happy very fond of youblame circumstances not me then he murmured are black spots on the eyelids a bad sign i see big flakes of soot falling in a dark room emilias mated look fleeted you come between us sir because i have no money i tell you its the boys only chance to make his hit now mr pole stamped his foot angrily and you make my cornelia marry though she loves another as wilfrid loves me and if they do not obey you they are to be beggars is it you who can pray can you ever have good dreams i saved my father from the sin by leaving him he wished to sell me but my poor father had no money at all and i can pardon him money was a bright thing to him like other things to us mr pole what will any one say for you the unhappy merchant had made vehement efforts to perplex his hearing that her words might be empty and not future dragons round his couch he was looking forward to a night of sleep as a cure for the evil sensations besetting himhis only chance the chance was going and with the knowledge that it was unjustly torn from himthis one gleam of clear reason in his brain undimmed by the irritable storm which plucked him downhe cried out to clear himself they are beggars both and all if they dont marry before two months are out im a beggar then im ruined i shant have a penny im in a workhouse they are in good homes they are safe and thank their old father now then now shall i sleep emilia caught his staggering arm the glazed light of his eyes went out he sank into a chair white as if life had issued with the secret of his life wonderful varying expressions had marked his features and the tones of his voice while he was uttering that sharp succinct confession so that strange as it sounded every sentence fixed itself on her with incontrovertible force and the meaning of the whole flashed through her mind it struck her too awfully for speech she held fast to his nerveless hand and kneeling before him listened for his long reluctant breathing the shall i sleep seemed answered chapter xxvii for days after the foregoing scene brookfield was unconscious of what had befallen it wilfrid was trying his yacht the ladies were preparing for the great pleasuregathering on besworth lawn and shaping astute designs to exclude the presence of mrs chump for which they partly condemned themselves but as they said only hear her the excitable woman was swelling from conjecture to certainty on a continuous public cry of pon my honrdye think little bellonis gone and marrud pole emilias supposed flight had deeply grieved the ladies when alarm and suspicion had subsided fear of some wretched male baseness on the part of their brother was happily diverted by a letter wherein he desired them to come to him speedily they attributed her conduct to dread of mr pericles that fervid devotee of euterpe received the tidings with an obnoxious outburst which made them seriously ask themselves individually and in secret whether he was not a moneyed brute and nothing more nor could they satisfactorily answer the question he raved you let her go ha what creatures you arehein but you find not anozer in fifty years i say and here you stop and forty hours pass by and not a sing in motion what blood you have it is waternot blood such a voice a verve a style an eye a devil zat girl and all drawn up and out before ze time by a man she is spoilt he exhibited an anguish that they were not able to commiserate certain expressions falling from him led them to guess that he had set some plot in motion which emilias flight had arrested but his tragic outcries were all on the higher ground of the loss to art they were glad to see him go from the house soon he returned to demand wilfrids address arabella wrote it out for him with rebuking composure then he insisted upon having captain gambiers whom he described as ce nonchalant dandy him you will have a better opportunity of seeing by waiting here said adela and the captain came before mr pericles had retreated ce nonchalant was not quite true to his title when he heard that emilia had flown he did not say much but iterated gone with an elegant frown adding she must come back you know and was evidently more than commonly puzzled and vexed pursuing the strain in a way that satisfied mr pericles more thoroughly than adela she shall come back as soon as she has a collar growled mr pericles meaning captivity if shed only come back with her own maiden name interjected mrs chump ill give her a character but upon my honrdye think ut possible now arabella talked over her and rescued her fathers name the noisy sympathy and wild speculations of the tinleys and copleys had to be endured on the whole the feeling toward emilia was kind and the hope that she would come to no harm was fervently expressed by all the ladies frequently enough also to show the opinion that it might easily happen on such points mrs chump never failed to bring the conversation to a block supported as they were by captain gambier edward buxley freshfield sumner and more than once by sir twickenham whom freshfield launching angry shafts now called the semibetrothed the statistical cripple and other strong things that show a developing genius for streetcries and hustingsepithets in every member of the lists of the great rejected or of the jilted who can affect to be philosophical notwithstanding these aids the ladies of brookfield were crushed by mrs chump her main offence was that she revived for them so much of themselves that they had buried oh the unutterably sordid city life it hung about her like a smell of london smoke as a mere animal they passed her by and had almost come to a state of mind to pass her off it was the phantom or rather the embodiment of their first circle that they hated in the woman she took heroes from the journals read by servantmaids she thought highly of the court of aldermen she went on public knees to the aristocracy she was proud in fact of all city appetites what though none saw the peculiar sting they felt it and one virtue in possessing an ideal is that lodging in you as it does it insists upon the interior being furnished by your personal satisfaction and not by the blindness or stupidity of the outer world thus in one direction an ideal precludes humbug the ladies might desire to cloak facts but they had no pleasure in deception they had the feminine power of extinguishing things disagreeable so long as nature or the fates did them no violence when these forces sent an emissary to confound them as was clearly the case with mrs chump they fought the dreadful creature insisted upon shows of maudlin affection that could not be accorded to her so that she existed in a condition of preternatural sensitiveness among ladies pretending to dignity of life the horror of acrid complaints alternating with public offers of love from a gross woman may be pictured in the minds eye the absence of mr pole and wilfrid which caused mrs chump to chafe at the restraint imposed by the presence of males to whom she might not speak endearingly and deprived the ladies of proper counsel and what good may be at times in masculine authority led to one fierce battle wherein the great shot was fired on both sides mrs chump was requested to leave the house she declined interrogated as to whether she remained as an enemy knowing herself to be so looked upon she said that she remained to save them from the dangers they invited those dangers she named observing that mrs lupin their aunt might know them but was as liable to be sent to sleep by a fellow with a bag of jokes as a watchdog to be quieted by a bone the allusion here was to mrs lupins painful partially inexcusable incurable sense of humour especially when a gleam of it led to the prohibited passages of life the poor lady was afflicted so keenly that in instances where one of her sex and position in the social scale is bound to perish rather than let even the shadow of a laugh appear or any sign of fleshly perception or sympathy peep out she was seen to be mutely shockingly penitentially convulsed a degrading sight and albeit repeatedly remonstrated with she upon such occasions invariably turned imploring glancesa sort of frowning entreatyto the ladies or to any of her sex present did you not see that oh can you resist it she seemed to gasp as she made those fruitless efforts to drag them to her conscious level sink thou if thou wilt was the phrase indicated to her she had once thought her propensity innocent enough and enjoyable her nieces had almost cured her by sitting on her until mrs chump came to make her worst than ever it is to be feared that mrs chump was beginning to abuse her power over the little colourless lady we cannot when we find ourselves possessed of the gift of sending a creature into convulsions avoid exercising it mrs lupin was one of the victims of the modern feminine ideal she was in mind merely a woman devout and charitable as her nieces admitted but radicallywhat they did not like to think or to say whatrepugnant seemed to be the word a woman who consented to perceive the doublemeaning who acknowledged its suggestions of a violation of decency laughable and who could not restrain laughter was in their judgement righteously a victim after signal efforts to lift her up the verdict was that their aunt lupin did no credit to her sex if we conceive a timorous little body of finelystrung nerves inclined to be gay and shrewdly apprehensive but depending for her opinion of herself upon those about her we shall see that mrs lupins life was one of sorrow and scourges in the atmosphere of the ideal never did nun of the cloister fight such a fight with the flesh as this poor little woman that she might not give offence to the tribunal of the nice feelings which leads us to ask is sentimentalism in our modern days taking the place of monasticism to mortify our poor humanity the sufferings of the three of brookfield under mrs chump was not comparable to mrs lupins the good little womans soul withered at the selfcontempt to which her nieces helped her daily laughter far from expanding her heart and invigorating her frame was a thing that she felt herself to be nourishing as a traitor in her bosom and the worst was that it came upon her like a reckless intoxication at times possessing her as a devil might and justifying itself too and daring to say am i not nature mrs lupin shrank from the remembrance of those moments in another age the scenes between mrs lupin and mrs chump greatly significant for humanity as they are will be given without offence on one side or martyrdom on the other at present and before our sentimentalists are a concrete it would be profitless rashness to depict them when the great shots were fired off mrs chump being requested to depart and refusing mrs lupin fluttered between the belligerents doing her best to be a medium for the restoration of peace in repeating mrs chumps remarks which were rendered purposely strong with irish spice by that woman she choked and when she conveyed to mrs chump the counterremarks of the ladies she provoked utterances that almost killed her a sadder life is not to be imagined the perpetual irritation of a desire to indulge in her mortal weakness and listening to the sleepless conscience that kept watch over it her certainty that it would be better for her to laugh right out and yet her incapacity to contest the justice of her nieces rebuke her struggle to resist mrs chump which ended in a sensation of secret shameful liking for herall these warring influences within were seen in her behaviour i have always said observed cornelia that she labours under a disease what is more she had always told mrs lupin as much and her sisters had echoed her three to one in such a case is a severe trial to the reason of solitary one and mrs lupins case was peculiar inasmuch as the more she yielded to chumptemptation and eased her heart of its load of laughter the more her heart cried out against her and subscribed to the scorn of her nieces mrs chump acted a demons part she thirsted for mrs lupin that she might worry her hitherto she had not known that anything peculiar lodged in her tongue and with no other person did she think of using it to produce a desired effect but now the scenes in brookfield became hideous to the ladies and not wanting in their trials to the facial muscles of the gentlemen a significant sign of what the ladies were enduring was that they ceased to speak of it in their consultations it is a blank period in the career of young creatures when a fretting wretchedness forces them out of their dreams to action and it is then that they will do things that seen from the outside ie in the conduct of others they would hold to be monstrous all but impossible or how could cornelia persuade herself as she certainly persuaded sir twickenham and the world about her that she had a contemplative pleasure in his society arabella drew nearer to edward buxley whom she had not treated well and who as she might have guessed had turned his thoughts toward adela though clearly without encouragement adela indeed said openly to her sisters with a gallic ejaculation edward follows me do you know and he has adopted a sort of sicilianvespers look whenever he meets me with captain gambier i could forgive him if he would draw out a dagger and be quite theatrical but behold we meet and my bourgeois grunts and stammers and seems to beg us to believe that he means nothing whatever by his behaviour can you convey to his cityintelligence that he is just a trifle illbred now arabella had always seen edward as a thing that was her own which accounts for the treatment to which he had been subjected a quick spur of jealousya new sensationwas the origin of her leaning toward edward and the plea of saving adela from annoyance excused and covered it he for his part scarcely concealed his irritation until a little scented twisted note was put in his hand which said you are as anxious as i can be about our sweet lost emilia we believe ourselves to be on her traces this gave him wonderful comfort it put adela in a beautiful fresh light as a devoted benefactress and delicious intriguante he threw off some of his most telling caricatures at this period adela had divined that captain gambier suspected his cousin merthyr powys of abstracting emilia that he might shield her from mr pericles the captain confessed it calmly blushing and that he was in communication with miss georgiana ford mr powyss halfsister about whom adela was curious until the captain ejaculated a saintwhereat she was satisfied knowing by instinct that the preference is for sinners their meetings usually referred to emilia and it was astonishing how willingly the captain would talk of her adela repeated to herself this is our mask and thus she made it the captains for it must be said that the conquering captain had never felt so full of pity to any girl or woman to whom he fancied he had done damage as to emilia he enjoyed a most thorough belief that she was growing up to perplex him with her love and he had not consequently attempted to precipitate the measure but her flight had prematurely perplexed him in grave debate with the ends of his moustache for a term he concluded by accusing merthyr powys and with a little feeling of spite not unknown to masculine dignity he wrote to merthyrs halfsistermerely to inquire being aware that whatever he does you have been consulted on and the friends of this miss belloni are distressed by her absence the ladies of brookfield were accustomed to their fathers occasional unpremeditated absences and neither of them had felt an apprehension which she could not dismiss until one morning mr powys sent up his card to arabella requesting permission to speak with her alone chapter xxviii georgiana ford would have had little claim among the fair saints to be accepted by them as one of their order her reputation for coldness was derived from the fact of her having stood a siege from captain gambier but she loved a creature of earth too well to put up a hand for saintly honours the passion of her life centred in devotion to her halfbrother those who had studied her said perhaps with a touch of malignity that her religious instinct had its source in a desire to gain some place of intercession for him merthyr had leaned upon it too often to doubt the strength of it whatever its purity might be she when barely more than a child a girl of sixteen had followed him over the then luckless italian fieldssacrificing as much for a cause that she held to be trivial as he in the ardour of his halffanatical worship her theory was these italians are in bondage and since heaven permits it there has been guilt by endurance they are strengthened by suffering chastened so let them endure and suffer she would cleave to this view with many variations of pity merthyrs experience was tolerant to the weaker vessels young delight in power which makes her sometimes though sweet and merciful by nature enunciate hebraic severities oracularly he smiled and was never weary of pointing out practical refutations whereat she said will a thousand instances change the principle when the brain and especially the fine brain of a woman first begins to act for itself the work is of heavy labour she finds herself plunging abroad on infinite seas and runs speedily into the anchorage of dogmas obfuscatory saws and what she calls principles here she is safe but if her thinking was not originally the mere action of lively blood upon that battery of intelligence she will byandby reflect that it is not well for a live thing to be tied to a dead and that long clinging to safety confesses too much merthyr waited for georgians patiently on all other points they were heartinheart it was her pride to say that she loved him with no sense of jealousy and prayed that he might find a woman in plain words worthy of him this woman had not been found she confessed that she had never seen her georgians received captain gambiers communication in monmouth merthyr had now and then written of a miss belloni but he had seemed to refer to a sort of child and georgians had looked on her as another italian pensioner she was decisive the moment she awoke to feel herself brooding over the thought of this girl she started to join merthyr solitude is pasturage for a suspicion on her way she grew persuaded that her object was bad and stopped until the thought came if he is in a dilemma who shall help him save his sister and with spiritually streaming eyes at a vision of companionship broken but whether by his taking another adviser or by miss belloni she did not ask georgiana continued her journey at the door of lady gosstres townhouse she hesitated and said in her mind what am i doing and what earthliness has come into my love for him or turning to the cry will he want me stung herself conscious that there was some poison in her love but clinging to it not less she entered the house and was soon in merthyrs arms why have you come up he asked were you thinking of coming to me quickly she murmured in reply he did not say yes but that he had business in london nor did he say what georgiana let him go how miserable is such a weakness is this my love she thought again then she went to her bedroom and knelt and prayed her saviours pardon for loving a human thing too well but if the rays of her mind were dimmed her heart beat too forcibly for this complacent selfdeceit no not too well i cannot love him too well i am selfish when i say that it is myself i am loving to love him thrice as dearly as i do would bring me nearer to god love i mean not idolatryanother form of selfishness she prayed to be guided out of the path of snares can you pray can you put away all props of self this is true worship unto whatsoever power you kneel this passage out of a favourite book of sentences had virtue to help her now in putting away the props of self it helped her for the time she could not foresee the contest that was commencing for her love that shrieks at a mortal wound and bleeds humanly what is he but a pagan god with the passions of a pagan god yes thought georgiana meditating as different from the christian love as a brute from a man she felt that the revolution of the idea of love in her mind all that consoled her was becoming a temptation quick in her impulses she dismissed it i am like a girl she said scornfully like a woman would not have flattered her like what did she strive to be the picture of another self was before hera creature calmly strong unruffled and a refuge to her beloved it was a steady light through every wind that blew save when the heart narrowed and then it waxed feeble and the life in her was hungry for she knew not what georgianas struggle was to make her great passion eat up all the others sure of the intensity and thoroughness of her love for merthyr she would forecast for herself tasks in his service impossible save to one sensually dead and therefore spiritually sexless my love is pure she would say as if that were the talisman which rendered it superhuman she was under the delusion that lovers love was a reprehensible egoism her heart had never had place for it and thus her nature was unconsummated and the torment of a haunting insufficiency accompanied her sweetest hours ready to mislead her in all but very clearest actions she saw or she divined much of this struggle but the vision of it was fitful not consecutive it frightened and harassed without illuminating her now upon merthyrs return she was moved by it just enough to take his hand and say we are the same what can change us he replied or who and as she smiled up to him she was ashamed of her smile yes who he interjected by this time quite enlightened all subtle feelings are discerned by welsh eyes when untroubled by any mental agitation brother and sister were welsh and i may observe that there is human nature and welsh nature forgive me she said i have been disturbed about you perceiving that it would be well to save her from any spiritual twists and turns that she might reach what she desired to know he spoke out fully i have not written to you about miss belloni lately i think it must be seven or eight days since i had a letter from heryou shall see itlooking as if it had been written in the dark she gave the address of a london hotel i went to her and her story was that she had come to town to get mr poles consent to her marriage with his son and that when she succeeded in making herself understood by him the old man fell smitten with paralysis crying out that he was ruined and his children beggars ah said georgiana then this son is engaged to her she calls him her lover openly have i not told you naked and unashamed of course that has attracted my merthyr georgians drew to him tenderly breathing as one who has a burden off her heart but why did she write to you the question started up for this reason it appears that mr pole showed such nervous irritation at the idea of his family knowing the state he was in that the doctor attending him exacted a promise from her not to communicate with one of them she was alone in great perplexity and did what i had requested her to do she did me the honour to apply to me for any help it was in my power to give georgiana stood eyeing the ground sideways what is she like you shall see tomorrow if you will come with me dark or fair merthyr turned her face to the light laughing softly georgiana coloured with dropped eyelids she raised her eyes under their load of shame i will come gladly she said early tomorrow then rejoined merthyr on the morrow as they were driving to the hotel georgians wanted to know whether he called this miss belloni by her christian namea question so needless that her overconscious heart drummed with gratitude when she saw that he purposely spared her from one meaning look in this mutual knowledge mutual help in minute as in great things as well as in the recognition of a common nobility of mind the love of the two was fortified emilia had not been left by mr powys without the protection of a womans society in her singular position lady charlottes natural prompt kindness required no spur from her friend that she should go and brace up the spirits of a little woman whom she pitied doubly for loving a man who was deceiving her and not loving one who was good for her she went frequently to emilia and sat with her in the sombre hotel drawingroom still frank as she was and blunt as she affected to be she could not bring her tongue to speak of wilfrid if she had fancied any sensitive shuddering from the name and the subject to exist she would have struck boldly being capable of cruelty and where she was permitted to see a weakness rather fond of striking deep a belief in the existence of emilias courage touched her to compassion one day however she said what is it you take to in merthyr powys and this brought on plain speaking emilia could give no reason and it is a peculiarity of people who ask such questions that they think a want of directness in the answer suspicious lady charlotte said gravely come come what do you mean asked emilia i like so many things in him you dont like one thing chiefly i likewhat do i likehis kindness his kindness this was the sort of reply to make the lady implacable she seldom read others shrewdly and could not know that near her emilia thought of wilfrid in a way that made the vault of her brain seem to echo with jarred chords his kindness what a picture is the grateful girl i have seen rows of whitecapped charity children giving a bob and a sniffle as the parson went down the ranks promising buns well his kindness you are right in appreciating as much as you can see ill tell you why i like himbecause he is a gentleman and you havent got an idea how rare that animal is dear me should i be plainer to you if i called him a christian gentleman its the cant of a detestable school my child it means just thisbut why should i disturb your future faith in it the professors mainly profess to be a comfort to young women and i suppose you will meet your comfort and worship them with the growing mind and i must confess that they bait it rather cunningly nothing else would bite they catch almost all the raw boys who have anything in them but for me merthyr himself would have been caught long ago theres no absolute harm in them only that theyre a sentimental compromise i deny their honesty and if its flatly proved i deny their intelligence well this you cant understand i have not understood you at all said emilia no its the tongue thats the natural traitor to a woman and takes longer runs with every added year i suppose you know that mr powys wishes to send you to italy i do said emilia when are you going i am not going why emilias bosom rose she cried dear lady on the fall of it and was scarce audibleadding do you love wilfrid well you have brought me to the point quickly lady charlotte remarked i dont commonly beat the bush long myself love him you might as well ask me my age the indiscretion would be equal and the result the same love i have a proper fear of the word when two play at love they spoil the game its enough that he says he loves me emilia looked relieved poor lady she sighed poor lady charlotte echoed with curious eyes fixed on the puzzle beside her tell me you will not believe him emilia continued he is mine i shall never give him up it is useless for you or any one else to love him i know what love is now stop while you can i can be sorry for you but i will not let him go from me he is my lover emilia closed her lips abruptly she produced more effect than was visible lady charlotte drew out a letter saying perhaps this will satisfy you nothing cried emilia jumping to her feet read itread it and for heavens sake ma fille sauvage dont think im here to fight for the man he is not orpheus and our modern education teaches us that its we who are to be run after will you read it no will you read it to please me emilia changed from a look of quiet opposition to gentleness of feature why will it please you if i read that he has flattered you i never lie about what i feel i think men do her voice sank you wont allow yourself to imagine then that he has spoken false to you tell me retorted emilia are you sure in your heartas sure as it beats each timethat he loves you you are not it seems that we are dignifying my gentleman remarkably said lady charlotte when two women fight for a man that is almost a meal for his vanity now listen i am not as they phrase it in love i am an experienced personwhat is called a woman of the world i should not make a marriage unless i had come to the conclusion that i could help my husband or he me do me the favour to read this letter emilia took it and opened it slowly it was a letter in the tone of the gallant paying homage with some fervour emilia searched every sentence for the one word that being absent she handed back the letter her eyes lingering on the signature do you see what he says asked lady charlotte that i can be a right hand to him as i believe i can he writes like a friend emilia uttered this as when we have a contrast in the mind you excuse him for writing to me in that style yes he may write to any woman like that he has latitude you really fancy thats the sort of letter a friend would write that is how mr powys would write to me said emilia lady charlotte laughed my unhappy merthyr only if i could be a great deal older emilia hastened to add and lady charlotte slightly frowned but rubbed it out with a smile rising the lady said i have spoken to you upon equal terms and remember very few women would have done what i have done you are cared for by merthyr powys and thats enough it would do you no harm to fix your eyes upon him you wont get him but it would do you no harm he has a heart as they call it whatever it is its as strong as a cable he is a knight of the antique he is specially guarded however well he insists that you are his friend so you are mine and that is why i have come to you and spoken to you you will be silent about it i need not say no one but yourself is aware that lieutenant pole does me the honour to liken me to the good old gentleman who accompanied telemachus in his voyages and chooses me from among the handmaidens of earth on this head you will promise to be silent lady charlotte held forth her hand emilia would not take it before she had replied i knew this before you came and then she pressed the extended fingers lady charlotte drew her close has wilfrid taken you into his confidence so far emilia explained that she had heard it from his father the ladys face lit up as from a sting of anger very wellvery well she said and presently you are right when you speak of the power of lying in men observewilfrid told me that not one living creature knew there was question of an engagement between us what would you do in my case emilia replied forgive him and i should think no more of it yes it would be right and presuming him to have the vice i could be of immense service to him if at least he does not lie habitually but this is a description of treachery you know oh cried emilia what kind of treachery is that if he only will keep his heart open for me to give all mine to it she stood clutching her hands in the halfsobbing ecstasy which signalises a spiritual exaltation built on disquiet she had shown small emotion hitherto the sight of it was like the sight of a mighty hostile power to lady charlottea power that moved herthat challenged and irritated and subdued her for she saw there something that she had not and being of a nature leaning to greatmindedness though not of the first rank she could not meanly mask her own deficiency by despising it to do this is the secret evil by which souls of men and women stop their growth lady charlotte decided now to say goodbye her parting was friendlythe form of it consisting of a nod an extension of the hand and a kind word or two when alone emilia wondered why she kept taking long breaths and tried to correct herself but the heart laboured yet she seemed to have no thought in her mind she had no active sensation of pity or startled selflove she went to smooth mr poles pillow as to a place of forgetfulness the querulous tyrannies of the invalid relieved her but the heavy lifting of her chest returned the moment she was alone she mentioned it to the doctor who prescribed for liver informing her that the said organ conducted one of the most important functions of her bodily system emilia listened to the lecturer and promised to take his medicine trusting to be perfectly quieted by the nauseous draught but when mr powys came she rushed up to him and fell with a cry upon his breast murmuring broken words that georgiana might fairly interpret as her suspicions directed nor had she ever seen merthyr look as he did when their eyes next met chapter xxix the card of mr powys found arabella alone in the house mrs lupin was among village schoolchildren mrs chump had gone to london to see whether anything was known of mr pole at his office where she fell upon the youth braintop and made him her own for the day adela was out in the woods contemplating nature and cornelia was supposed to be walking whither her stately fancy drew her will you take long solitary walks unprotected she was asked i have a parasol she replied and could hear miles distant the domestic comments being made on her innocence and the story it would beshe thinks of no possible danger but from the sun a little forcing of her innocence now was necessary as an opiate for her conscience she was doing what her conscience could only pardon on the plea of her extreme innocence the sisters and the fashion at brookfield permitted the assumption and exaggerated it willingly it chanced however that adela had reason to feel discontented it was a breach of implied contract she thought that cornelia should as she did only yesterday tell her that she had seen edward buxley in the woods and that she was of opinion that the air of the woods was bad for her not to see would have been the sisterly obligation in adelas ideaespecially when seeing embraced things that no loving sister should believe bear in mind that we are sentimentalists the eye is our servant not our master andso are the senses generally we are not bound to accept more than we choose from them thus we obtain delicacy and thus as you will perceive our civilization by the aid of the sentimentalists has achieved an effective varnish there certainly to the vulgar mind a tail is visible the outrageous philosopher declares vehemently that no beast of the field or the forest would own such a tail his meaning is that he discerns the sign of the animal slinking under the garb of the stately polished creature i have all the difficulty in the world to keep him back and let me pursue my course these philosophers are a badmannered body either in opposition or in the support of them i maintain simply that the blinking sentimentalist helps to make civilization what it is and civilization has a great deal of merit did you not leave your parasol behind you at ipley said adela as she met cornelia in the afternoon cornelia coloured her pride supported her and she violated fine shades painfully in her response mr barrett left me there is that your meaning adela was too much shocked to note the courageousness of the reply well if all we do is to come into broad daylight was her horrified mental ejaculation the veil of life was about to be lifted for these ladies they found arabella in her room crying like an unchastened schoolgirl and their first idea was one of intense condemnationfresh offences on the part of mrs chump being conjectured little by little arabella sobbed out what she had heard that day from mr powys after the first stupor adela proposed to go to her father instantly and then suggested that they should all go she continued talking in random suggestions and with singular heat as if she conceived that the sensibility of her sisters required to be aroused by moving and acting it seemed to her that the prospect of a vast misery might be expunged and that she might escape from showing any likeness to arabellas shamefullydiscoloured face it was impossible for her to realize grief in her own bosom she walked the room in a nervous tremour shedding a note of sympathy to one sister and to the other at last arabella got fuller command of her voice when she had related that her fathers positive wish furthered by the doctors special injunction to obey it scrupulously was that they were not to go to him in london and not to breathe a word of his illness but to remain at brookfield entertaining friends adela stamped her foot saying that it was more than human nature could bear if we go said arabella the london doctor assured mr powys that he would not answer for papas life but good heavens are we papas enemies and why may mr powys see him if we his daughters cannot tell me how mr powys met him and knew of it tell mei am bewildered i feel that we are cheated in some way oh tell me something clear arabella said calmingly emilia is with papa she wrote to mr powys whether she did rightly or not we have not now to inquire i believe that she thought it right entertain friends interjected adela but papa cannot possibly mean that we are to go throughtothe fete on besworth lawn bella its in two days from this dreadful day papa has mentioned it to mr powys he desires us not to postpone it we arabellas voice broke piteously oh but this is torture cried adela with a deplorable vision of the lookingglass rising before her as she felt the tears sting her eyelids this cannot be no father wouldnot loving us as dear papa does to be quiet to sit and be gay to flaunt at a fete oh mercy mercy tell mehe left us quite wellno one could have guessed i remember he looked at me from the carriage window tell meit must be some moral shockwhat do you attribute it to wilfrid cannot be the guilty one we have been only too compliant to papas wishes about that woman tell me what you think it can be a voice said money which of the sisters had spoken adela did not know it was bitter enough that one could be brought to utter the thing even if her ideas were so base as to suspect it the tears now came dancing over her underlids like triumphing imps money echoed through her again and again curiously too she had no occasion to ask how it was that money might be supposed to have operated on her fathers health unable to realize to herself the image of her father lying ill and suffering but just sufficiently touched by what she could conceive of his situation the bare whisper of money came like a foul insult to overwhelm her in floods of liquid selflove she wept with that last anguish of a woman who is compelled to weep but is incapable of finding any enjoyment in her tears cornelia and arabella caught her hands she was the youngest and had been their pet it gratified them that adela should show a deep and keen feeling adela did not check herself from a demonstration that enabled her to look broadly as it were on her own tenderness of heart following many outbursts she asked and the illnesswhat is it not its causeitself a voice said paralysis adelas tears stopped she gazed on both faces trying with open mouth to form the word chapter xxx flying from port to port to effect an exchange of stewards the endless occupation of a yacht proprietor wilfrid had no tidings from brookfield the night before the gathering on besworth lawn he went to london and dined at his cluba place where youths may drink largely of the milk of this worlds wisdom wilfrids romantic sentiment was always corrected by an hour at his club after dinner he strolled to a not perfectly regulated theatre in company with a brother officer and when they had done duty before the scenes for a space of time they lounged behind to disenchant themselves in obedience to that precocious cynicism which is the young mans extraluxury the first figure that caught wilfrids attention there was mr pericles in a white overcoat stretched along a sofahis eyelids being down though his eyes were evidently vigilant beneath a titter of ladies present told of some recent interesting commotion only a row between that rich greek fellow who gave the supper and marion a vivacious dame explained to wilfrid shes in one of her jealous fits shed be jealous if her poodledog went on its hindlegs to anybody else poodle by jove said wilfrid pericles himself looks like an elongated poodle shaved up to his moustache look at him and he plays the tyrant does he oh she stands that some of those absurd women like it i think shes fussing about another girl you wouldnt what mans worth it but would you it depends upon the him monsieur depends upon his being very handsome and good and rich no the lady fired up there you dont know us the colloquy became almost tender until she said isnt this gassy and stifling i confess i do like a carriage and richmond on a sunday and then with two daughters you know but what i complain of is her folly in being in love or something like it with a rich fellow love the poor devilmanage the rich you mean yes of course that makes them both happy its a method of being charitable to two a rather fleshy fairy now entered and walked straight up to the lookingglass to examine her paintpronouncedly turning her back to the sofa where mr pericles still lay at provoking full length her panting was ominous of a further explosion innocent child in the mockery of a foreign accent commenced it while wilfrid thought how unjustly and coldly critically he had accused his little emilia of vulgarity now that he had this feminine display of it swarming about him innocent child indeed be as deaf as you like you shall hear and sofas are not made for mens dirty boots in this country i believe theyre all pigs abroadthe men and the womencats oh dont open your eyesdont speak pray youre certain i must go when the bell rings youre waiting for that you unmanly dog a pig mr pericles here ventured to remind her murmuring as one in a dream a peeg she retorted mildly somewhat mollified by her apparent success but mr pericles had relapsed into his exasperating composure the breath of a deliberate and undeserved peacefulness continued to be drawn in by his nostrils at the accustomed warning there was an ostentatious rustle of retiring dresses whereat mr pericles chose to proclaim himself awake the astute fairyfury immediately stepped before him now you cant go on pretending sleep you shall hear and everybody shall hear you know youre a villain youre a wolf seeking mr pericles waved his hand and she was caught by the wrist and told that the scene awaited her let them wait she shouted and sharpening her cry as she was dragged off dare to take that girl to italy i know what that means with you an englishman might mean rightbut you you think youve been dealing with a fool why i can stop this in a minute and i will its youre the fool why i know her father he plays in the orchestra i know her namebelloni up sprang the greek like a galvanized corpse while two violent jerks from the man hauling her out rattled the laugh of triumph which burst from her at the same time wilfrid strove forward with the frown of one still bent listening and he and pericles were face to face the eyebrows of the latter shot up in a lively arch he made a motion toward the ceremony of shakehands but perceiving no correspondent overture grinned it is warmha you feel the heat step outside a minute said wilfrid oh no mr pericles looked pleasantly sagacious ze draughta cold will you come pursued wilfrid many sanks wilfrids hand was rising at this juncture his brother officer slipped out some languid words in his ear indicative of his astonishment that he should be championing a termagant and horror at the idea of such a thing being publicly imagined tamed wilfrid quickly he recovered himself with his usual cleverness seeing the signs of hostility vanish mr pericles said you are on a search for your father you have found him hom i should say a maladie of nerfs will come to him a pin fallhe start a storm at nighthe is out dancing among his ships of venture not a bid of coragewhich is bad if you shall find mr pole for tomorrow on ze lawn vary glad with a smile compounded of sniffing dog and parisian obsequiousness mr pericles passed thinking he has not got her for such was his deduction if he saw that a man could flush for a womans name wilfrid stood like a machine with a thousand wheels in revolt sensations pricked at ideas and immediately left them to account for their existence as they best could the ideas committed suicide without a seconds consideration he felt the great gurgling sea in which they were drowned heave and throb then came a fresh set that poised better on the slackrope of his understanding by degrees a buried dread in his brain threw off its shroud the thought that there was something wrong with his father stood clearly over him to be swallowed at once in the less tangible belief that a harm had come to emilianot was coming but had come passion thinks wilfully when it thinks at all that night he lay in a deep anguish revolving the means by which he might help and protect her there seemed no way open save by making her his own and did he belong to himself what bound him to lady charlotte she was not lovely or loving he had not even kissed her hand yet she held him in a chain the two men composing most of us at the outset of actual life began their deadly wrestle within him both having become awakened if they wait for circumstance that steady fire will fuse them into one who is commonly a person of some strength but throttling is the custom between them and we are used to see men of murdered halves these men have what they fought for they are unaware of any guilt that may be charged against them though they know that they do not embrace life and so it is that we have vague discontent too universal change o lawgiver the length of our minority and let it not end till this battle is thoroughly fought out in approving daylight the period of our duality should be one as irresponsible in your eyes as that of our infancy is he we call a young man an individualwho is a pair of alternately kicking scales is he educated when he dreams not that he is divided he has drunk latin like a vital air and can quote what he remembers of homer but how has he been fortified for this tremendous conflict of opening manhood which is to our life here what is the landing of a soul to the life to come meantime it is a bad business when the doubleman goes about kneeling at the feet of more than one lady society to give that institution its due permits him to seek partial invulnerability by dipping himself in a dirty styx which corrects as we hear said the adolescent tendency to folly wilfrids sentiment had served him well or ill as it may be by keeping him from a headlong plunge in the protecting river and his folly was unchastened he did not even contemplate an escape from the net at emilias expense the idea came the idea will come to a young man in such a difficulty my mistress my glorious stolen fruit my dark angel of love he deserves a little credit for seeing that emilia never could be his mistress in the debased sense of the term union with her meant lifelong union he knew ultimate mental subjection he may also have seen in it unconsciously for hazy thoughts of that nature may mix with the belief that an alliance with her degrades us in this curious hotchpotch of emotions known to the world as youthful man a wife superior to her husband makes him ridiculous wilfully if the wretch is to be laughed at but a mistress thus illmatched cannot fail to cast the absurdest light on her monstrous dwarfcustodian wilfrid had the sagacity to perceive and the keen apprehension of ridicule to shrink from the picture besides he was beginning to love emilia his struggle now was to pluck his passion from his heart and such was already his plight that he saw no other way of attempting it than by taking horse and riding furiously in the direction of besworth chapter xxxi i am curious to see what you will make of this gathering i can cook a small company myself it requires the powers of a giantess to mix a body of people in the open air and all that is said of commanders of armies shall be said of you if you succeed this was lady gosstres encouragement to the fair presidents of the fete on besworth lawn there had been a time when they would have cried out internally we will do it fail who may that fallow hour was over their sole thought was to get through the day a little feverish impulse of rivalry with her great pattern may have moved arabella but the pressure of grief and dread and the contrast between her actions and feelings forcibly restrained a vain display as a consequence she did her duty better and won applause from the great ladys moveable court on eminences of the ground these girls are clever she said to lady charlotte they dont bustle too much they dont make too distinct a difference of tone with the different sets i shall propose miss pole as secretary to our pin and needle relief society do was the reply there is also the polish dance committee and if she has any energy left she might be treasurer to the ladies general revolution ball that is an association with which i am not acquainted said lady gosstre directing her eyeglass on the field here comes young pole hes gallant they tell me and handsome he studies us too obviously thats a mistake to be corrected charlotte one doesnt like to see a pair of eyes measuring us against a preconception quelconque now there is our ionian ambut you have corrected me merthyrhost if you please but see what is the man doing is he smitten with madness mr pericles had made a furious dash at the band in the centre of the lawn scattered their music and knocked over the stands when his gesticulations had been observed for some moments freshfield sumner said he has the look of a plucked hen who remembers that she once clapped wings and tries to recover the practice very good said lady gosstre she was not one who could be unkind to the professional wit and the musicleaves go for feathers what has the band done to displease him i thought the playing was good the instruments appear to have received a dismissal said lady charlotte i suppose this is a clearing of the stage for coming alarums and excursions behold the female element is agitated there arecan you reckon at this distance merthyrtwelve fourteen of my sex entreating him in the best tragic fashion can he continue stern they seem to be as violent as the women who tore up orpheus said lady gosstre tracy runningbrook shrieked in a paroxysm splendid from his couch on the sward and immediately ran off with the idea bodily have i stumbled anywhere lady gosstre leaned to mr powys he replied with a satiric sententiousness that told lady gosstre what she wanted to know this is the isolated case where a little knowledge is truly dangerous said lady gosstre i prohibit girls from any allusion to the classics until they have taken their degree and are warranted not to open the wrong doors on the whole dont you think merthyr its better for women to avoid that pool and accept what the noble creature chooses to bring to us in buckets added lady charlotte what is your opinion georgey i forget merthyr has thought you worthy of instruction merthyr taught me in camp said georgians looking at her brotherher face showing peace and that confirmed calm delight habitual to it we found that there are times in war when you can do nothing and you are feverish to be employed then if you can bring your mind to study you are sure to learn quickly i liked nothing better than latin grammar studying latin grammar to the tune of great guns must be a new sensation freshfield sumner observed the pleasure is in getting rid of all sensation said she i mean you command it without at all crushing your excitement you cannot feel a fuller happiness than when you look back on those hours at least i speak for myself so said lady gosstre georgey did not waste her time after all charlotte what the latter thought was she could not handle a sword or fire a pistol would i have consented to be mere campbaggage yet no woman admired georgiana ford so much disappointment vitiated many of lady charlottes first impulses and not until strong antagonism had thrown her upon her generosity could she do justice to the finer natures about her there was full life in her veins and she was hearing the thirty fatal bells that should be music to a woman if melancholy music and she had not lived time that sounded in her ears as it kindled no past spoke of no future she was in unceasing rivalry with all of her sex who had a passion or a fixed affection or even an employment a sense that she was wronged by her fate haunted this lady rivalry on behalf of a man she would have held meanshe would have plucked it from her bosom at once she was simply envious of those who in the face of death could say i have lived pride and the absence of any power of selfinspection kept her blind to her disease no recollection gave her boy save of the hours in the huntingfield there she led gallantly but it was not because of leading that she exulted there the quick blood struck on her brain like wine and she seemed for a time to have some one among the crowns of life an objectwho cared how smallwas ahead a poor old fox trying to save his brush and charlotte would have it if the master of cunning did not beat her its my natural thirst for blood she said she did not laugh as she thought now and then that the old red brush dragging over grey dews toward a yellow yolk in the curdled wintermorning sky was the single thing that could make her heart throb brookfield was supported in its trial by the discomfiture of the tinleys these girls with their brother had evidently plotted to draw out mrs chump they had asked concerning her severally and hearing that she had not returned from town had each shown a blank face or had been doubtful of the next syllable of wilfrid emilia and mr pole question and answer were interchanged wilfrid will come in a few minutes miss belloni you know is preparing for italy papa papa i really do fear will not be able to join us such was brookfields concerted form of reply the use of it together with the gaiety of dancing blood gave adela who believed that she ought to be weeping and could have wept easily strange twitches of what i would ask permission to call the juvenile shrugphilosophy as thus what creatures we are but life is so and again is not merriment dreadful when a duty she was as miserable as she could be but not knowing that youth furnished a plea available the girl was ashamed of being cheerful at all edward burleys sketch of mr pericles scattering his band sent her into muffled screams of laughter for which she did internal penance so bitter that for her to be able to go on at all the shrugphilosophy was positively necessary mr pericles himself saw the sketch and remarked critically it is zat i have more hair following which he tapped the signal for an overture to commence and at the first stroke took a run with his elbows clapping exactly as the shrewd hand of edward had drawn him see himzat fellow mr pericles said to laura tinley pointing to the leader see him pose a maestro zat leads zis tintamarre he is a humabug laura did the vocal caricaturing when she had gathered plenty of matter of this kind altogether as host mr pericles accomplished his duty in furnishing amusement late in the afternoon sir twickenham pryme and wilfrid arrived in company the baronet went straight to cornelia wilfrid beckoned to adela from whom he heard of his fathers illness at the hotel in town and the conditions imposed on them he nodded said lightly wheres emilia and nodded again to the answer with papa and then stopped as he was walking off to one of the groups after all it wont do for us to listen to the whims of an invalid im going back you neednt say youve seen me we have the doctors most imperative injunction dearest pleaded adela deceived for a moment papas illness is mental chiefly he is able to rise and will be here very soon if he is not in any way crossed for heavens sake command yourself as we have donepainfully indeed besides you have been seen has she wilfrid began and toned an additional carelessness she writes of course no not once and we are angry with her it looks like ingratitude or stupidity she can write people might say that we are not behaving well returned wilfrid repeating that he must go to town but now edward burley camp running with a message from the aristocratic heights and thither wilfrid walked captivesaying in adelas ear dont be angry with her adela thought very justly i shall if youve been making a fool of her naughty boy wilfrid saluted the ladies and made his bow of introduction to georgiana ford at whom he looked twice to confirm an impression that she was the perfect contrast to emilia and for this reason he chose not to look at her again lady charlotte dropped him a quick recognition if brookfield could have thrown the burden from its mind the day was one to feel a pride in three circles were present and brookfield denominated two that it had passed through and patronized allfrom lady gosstre aristocracy to the tinley set lucre and from these to the representative sumner girls cultivated poverty there were also intellectual scientific and art circles to deal with music pleasant to hear albeit condemned by mr pericles agreeable chatter courtly flirtation and homage and no dread of the defection of the letter h from their family i feel more and more convinced said adela meeting arabella that we can have really no cause for alarm otherwise papa would not have been cruel to his children arabella kindly reserved her opinion so let us try and be happy continued adela determining to be encouraged by silence with that she went on tiptoe gracefully and blew a kiss to her sisters lips running to captain gambier she said do you really enjoy this charming replied the everaffable gentleman if i might only venture to say what makes it so infinitely much to her immediate chagrin at missing a direct compliment which would have had to be parried and might have led to vistas the too sprightly young lady found herself running on its as nice as sin without the knowledge that you are sinning oh do you think that part of it disagreeable said the captain i think the heat terrific she retrieved her ground coquet et coquette muttered lady charlotte observing them from a distance and wondered whether her sex might be strongly represented in this encounter it was not in the best taste nor was it perhaps good policy if i may quote the tinley set for the ladies of brookfield to subscribe openly to the right of certain people present to be exclusive arabella would have answered lady gosstre and her party cannot associate with you to your mutual pleasure and profit and do you therefore blame her for not attempting what would fail ludicrously with herself as she was not sorry to show lady gosstre could associate cornelia had given up work to become a part of the court adela made flying excursions over the lawn laura tinley had the field below and mr pericles to herself that anxious gentleman consulted his watch from time to time as if he expected the birth of an event lady gosstre grew presently aware that there was more acrimony in freshfield sumners replies to sir twickenham whom he had seduced into a political argument than the professional wit need employ and as mr powyss talk was getting so attractive that the court had become crowded she gave a hint to georgiana and lady charlotte prompt lieutenants whose retirement broke the circle i never shall understand how it was done adela said subsequently it is hoped that everybody sees the importance of understanding such points she happened to be standing alone when a messenger came up to her and placed a letter in her hand addressed to her sister cornelia adela walked slowly up to the heights she knew mr barretts handwriting good heavensher thought may be translated out of fine shadesdoes c really in her heart feel so blind to our situation that she can go on playing still when she reached the group it was to hear mr powys speaking of mr barrett cornelia was very pale and stood wretchedly in contrast among the faces adela beckoned her to step aside here is a letter she said theres no postmark what has been the talk of that man do you mean of mr barrett cornelia repliedthat his father was a baronet and a madman who has just disinherited him just cried adela she thought of the title cornelia had passed on a bizarre story of mr barretts father was related to adela by sir twickenham she grappled it with her sense and so got nothing out of it disinherited him because he wrote to his father who was dying to say that he had gained a livelihood by playing the organ he had a hatred of music its incomprehensible you know sir twickenham the interest we take in mr barrett the masked anguish of cornelias voice hung in her ears she felt that it was now possible cornelia might throw over the rich for the penniless baronet and absolutely for an instant she thought nakedly the former ought not to be lost to the family thick clouds obscured the vision lady gosstre had once told her that the point of sir twickenhams private character was his susceptibility to ridicule her ladyship had at the same time complimented his discernment in conjunction with cornelia yes adela now thought but if my sister shows that she is not so wise as she looks cornelias figure disappeared under the foliage bordering besworth lawn as usual arabella had all the practical laboura fact that was noticed from the observant heights one sees mere de famille written on that young woman was the eulogy she won from lady gosstre how much would the great dame have marvelled to behold the ambition beneath the bustling surface arabella was feverish and freshfield sumner reported brilliant things uttered by her he became after a time her attendant aide and occasional witfoil they had some sharp exchanges and he could not but reflect on the pleasure her keen zest of appreciation gave him compared with cornelias grave smile which had often kindled in him profane doubts of the positive brightness or rapidity of her intelligence besworth at sunset what a glorious picture to have living before you every day said lady charlotte to her companion wilfrid flushed she read his look and said when they were out of hearing what a place for old people to sit here near the end of life the idea of it makes one almost forgive the necessity for getting olddoesnt it tracy runningbrook might make a poem about silver heads and sunsetsomething you know very easy cantering thenno hunting i suppose one wouldnt have even a desire to go fasta sort of cockhorse just as we began with the stables let me tell you are too near the scullery one is bound to devise measures for the protection of the morals of the household while she was speaking wilfrids thoughts ran my time has come to strike for liberty this too she perceived and was prepared for him he said lady charlotte i feel that i must tell youi fear that i have been calculating rather more hopefully here the pitfall of sentiment yawned before him on a sudden i mean he struggled to avoid it but was at the brink in the next sentence i mean dear lady that i had hopesbesworth pleased you to offer you this with yourself she relieved him a different manner in a protesting male would have charmed her better she excused him knowing what stood in his way that i scarcely dared to hope said wilfrid bewildered to see the loose chain he had striven to cast off gather tightly round him you do hope it i have you have hoped that i she was not insolent by nature and corrected the form to marry me yes lady charlotte ii had that hopeif i could have offered this placebesworth i find that my father will never buy it i have misunderstood him he fixed his eyes on her expecting a cool or an ironical rejoinder to end the colloquyafter which fair freedom she answered we may do very well without it wilfrid was not equal to a start and the trick of rapturous astonishment he heard the words like the shooting of dungeonbolts thinking oh heaven if at the first i had only told the woman i do not love her but that sentimental lead had ruined him and on second thoughts how could he have spoken thus to the point when they had never previously dealt in anything save sentimental implications the folly was in his speaking at all the game was now in lady charlottes hands adela in another part of the field had released herself by a consummate use of the same weapon wilfrid had so clumsily handled her object was to put an end to the absurd and compromising sighs of edward buxley and she did so with the amiable contempt of a pupil dismissing a first instructor in an art we saw from the beginning it could not be edward the enamoured caricaturist vainly protested that he had not seen it from the beginning and did not now he recalled to her that she had said he was her first she admitted the truth with eyes dwelling on him until a ringlet got displaced her first to be that sentimental man would perish in the fires to have been that will sometimes console him even when he has lived to see what a thing he was who caught the budding fancy the unhappy caricaturist groaned between triumph as a leader and anguish at the prospect of a possible host of successors king in that pure bosom the thought would comeking of a mighty line mayhap and sentimental man awakened to this disastrous view of things endures shrewder pangs of rivalry in the contemplation of his usurping posterity than if as do they he looked forward to a tricked perfumed pommaded whipster pirouetting like any pierrotthe enviable image of the one who realized her first dream and to whom specially missioned angels first opened the golden gates of her heart i have learnt to see edward that you do not honour me with a love you have diverted from one worthier than i am and in answer to the question whether though having to abjure her love she loved him no no it is my arabella i love i love i will love no one but herwith sundry caressing ejaculations that spring a thirst for kisses and a tender putting of the case now and then so much for adelas part in the conflict edward was unaware that the secret of her mastering him was that she was now talking commonsense in the tone of sentiment he on the contrary talked sentiment in the tone of commonsense of course he was beaten and o you young lovers when you hear the dear lips setting what you call the worlds harsh language to this music know that an hour has struck for you it is a fatal sound to hear edward believed that his pleading had produced an effect when he saw miss adelas bosom rise as with a weight on it the burden of her thoughts washow big and heavy edwards eyes look when he is not amusing to get rid of him she said as with an impassioned coldness go her figure repeating this under closed eyelids was mysterious potent when he exclaimed then i will go her eyelids lifted wide she shut them instantly showing at the same time a slight tighteningin of the upper lip you beheld a creature tied to the stake of duty but she was exceedingly youthful and had not reckoned upon mans being a live machine possessing impulses of his own a violent seizure of her waist and enough of kisses to make up the sum popularly known as a shower stopped her performance she struggled and muttered passionately to be released we are seen she hazarded at the repetition edward accustomed to dread the warning let her go and fled turning hurriedly about adela found that she had spoken truth unawares and never wished so much that she had lied sir twickenham pryme came forward to her with his usual stiff courtly step if you could have been a littlea little earlier she murmured with an unflurried face laying a trembling hand in his and thus shielded herself from a suspicion could i know that i was wanted he pressed her hand i only know that i wish i had not left your side said sheadding though you must have thought me what if i were a man you members of parliament would call a bore for asking perpetual questions nay an apposite interrogation is the guarantee of a proper interest in the subject said the baronet cornelia was very soon reverted to her intellect is contemplative said adela exhibiting marvellous mental composure she would lose her unerring judgement in active life she cannot weigh things in her mind rapidly she is safe if her course of action is clear sir twickenham reserved his opinion of the truth of this i wonder whether she can forgive those who offend or insult her easily a singular pleasure warmed adelas veins her cheeks kindling she replied giving him her full face no if they are worthy of punishment but and now he watched a downcast profileone must have some forgiveness for fools indeed you speak like charity out of the windows of wisdom said the baronet do you not require in parliament to be tolerant at times adela pursued he admitted it and to her outcry of oh that noble public life smiled deprecatinglymy dear young lady if you only knew the burden it brings it brings its burden said adela correcting with a most proper instinct another enthusiastic burst at the same time the honour is above the load am i talking too romantically you are at least occupied ninetenths of us to no very good purpose the baronet appended she rejoined if it were but a fraction the good done would survive and be more honourable to do perhaps he ejaculated the consolation should be great and is somehow small said she and they laughed softly at this stage adela was an exceedingly interesting young person in sir twickenhams mental register he tried her on politics and sociology she kept her ears open and followed his lead carefullyventuring here and there to indicate an opinion and suggesting dissent in a pained interrogation finally i confess she said i understand much less than i am willing to think and so i console myself with the thought that after all the drawingroom and the the kitchenwell an educated female must serve her term there if she would be anything better than a mere ornament even in the highest walks of lifei mean the household is our sphere from that we mount to companionshipif we can amazement of sir twickenham on finding his own thought printed as it were on the air before him by these pretty lips the conversation progressed until adela by chance turned her eyes up a cross pathway and perceived her sister cornelia standing with mr barrett under a beech the man certainly held one of her hands pressed to his heart and her attitude struck a doubt whether his other hand was disengaged or her waist free adela walked nervously on without looking at the baronet she knew by his voice presently that his eyes had also witnessed the sight two in a day she thought what will he imagine us to be the baronet was thinking for your sister exposed you display more agitation than for yourself insulted adela found arabella in so fresh a mood that she was sure good news had been heard it proved that mrs chump had sent a few lines in a letter carried by braintop to this effect my dears all i found your father on his back in bed and he discharged me out of the room and the sight of me put him on his legs and you will soon see him be civil to mr braintop who is a faithful young man of great merit and show your gratitude tomartha chump braintop confirmed the words of the letter and then adela saidyou will do us the favour to stay and amuse yourself here tonight there will be a bed at brookfield what will he do arabella whispered associate with the tinleys returned adela in accordance with the sentiment here half concealed brookfield soon showed that it had risen from the hour of depression when it had simply done its duty arabella formed an oppositioncourt to the one in which she had studied but mr pericles defeated her by constantly sending to her for advice concerning the economies of the feast nevertheless she exhibited good pretensions to social queendom both personal and practical and if freshfield sumner instead of his crisp waspish comments on people and things had seconded her by keeping up a twominutes flow of talk from time to time she might have thought that lady gosstre was only luckier than herselfnot better endowed below the tinleys and their set surrounded mr periclesprompting him as was seen to send up continual messages one to wit is there to be dancing tonight being answered now if you please provoked sarcastic cheering and laura ran up to say how kind of you we appreciate it continue to dispense blessings on poor mortals by the way though freshfield took his line from the calm closed lips of his mistress poor mortals are not in the habit of climbing olympus to ask favours i perceived no barrier quoth laura audacity never does pray how am i to be punished freshfield paused for a potent stroke not like semele she saw the godyou never will while laura was hanging on the horrid edge between a false laugh and a starting blush arabella said that visual excommunication has been pronounced years ago freshfield ah then he hasnt changed his name in heaven laura touched her thus for the familiar use of the gentlemans christian name you must not imagine that very great changes are demanded of those who can be admitted i really find it hotter than below said laura flying arabellas sharp eyes discerned a movement in lady gosstres circle and she at once went over to her and entreated the great lady who set her off so well not to go the sunset fronted besworth lawn the last light of day was danced down to inspiriting music and now arabella sent word for besworth halldoors and windows to be opened and on the company beginning to disperse there beckoned promise of a brilliant suppertable admirable said lady gosstre and the encomium was general among the crowd surrounding arabella for up to this point the feasting had been delicate and something like plain hunger prevailed indeed arabella had heard remarks of a bad nature which she traced to the tinley set and bore with to meet her present reward making light of her triumph she encouraged freshfield to start a witcontest and took part in it herself with the gaiety of an unoccupied mind her sisters had aforetime more than once challenged her supremacy but they bowed to it now and adela especially did when after a ringing hit to freshfield which the tinleys might also take to their own bosoms she said in an undertone what is there between c and surprised by this astonishing vigilance and power of thinking below the surface while she performed above it adela incautiously turned her face toward the meditative baronet and was humiliated by arabellas mute indication of contempt for her coming answer this march across the lawn to the lighted windows of besworth was the culmination of brookfields joy and the crown for which it had striven though for how short a term it was to be worn was little known was it not a very queenly sphere of fine shades and nice feelings that brookfield had realized in arabellas conscience lay a certain reproach of herself for permitting the vice of a lower circle to cling to herviz she had still betrayed a stupid hostility to the tinleys she had rejoiced to see them incapable of mixing with any but their own set and thus be stamped publicly for what they were she had struggled to repress it and yet continually her wits were in revolt against her judgement perhaps one reason was that albert tinley had haunted her steps at an early part of the day and alberta sickening city young man full of insolence and half eyeglass according to freshfieldhad once ventured to propose for her the idea that the tinleys strove to catch at her skirts made arabella spiteful up to the threshold of besworth freshfield mr powys tracy and arabella kept the wheel of a dazzling run of smalltalk throwing intermittent sparks laura tinley would press up apparently to hear but in reality as all who knew her could see with the object of being a rival representative of her sex in this illustrious rare encounter of divine intelligences you are anxious to know said arabella hesitatingly to know dear echoed laura there was i presumed something you did not hear arabella was half ashamed of the rudeness to which her antagonism to lauras vulgarity forced her oh i hear everything laura assured her indeed said arabella by the way who conducts you laura was on edward burleys arm oh will you go tosuch and such an end of the table and if lady gosstre i may beg of you to do me the service to go there also was added aloud and lower but quite audibly mr pericles will have music so there can be no talking this with the soupcon of a demishrug you will not suffer much being implied laura said to herself i am not a fool a moment after arabella was admitting in her own mind as well as fine shades could interpret it that she was on entering the dininghall she beheld two figures seated at the point whither laura was led by her partner these were mrs chump and mr pole with champagne glasses in their hands arabella was pushed on by the inexorable crowd of hungry people behind chapter xxxii despite the pouring in of the flood of guests about the tables mrs chump and mr pole sat apparently unconcerned in their places and as if to show their absolute indifference to observation and opinion went through the ceremony of drinking to one another upon which they nodded and chuckled a suspicious eye had the option of divining that they used the shelter of the table cloth for an interchange of squeezes this would have been further strengthened by mrs chumps arresting exclamation pole company mr pole looked up he recognized lady gosstre and made an attempt in his usual brisk style to salute her mrs champ drew him back nothin but his legs my lady she whispered theres nothin sets m up like champagne my dears she called out to the three of brookfield those ladies were now in the hall gazing as mildly as humanity would allow at their common destiny thus startlingly displayed there was no doubt in the bosom of either one of them that exposure was to follow this prelude mental resignation was not even demanded of themmerely physical they did not seek comfort in an interchange of glances but dropped their eyes and masked their sight as they best could caesar assassinated did a similar thing my dears pursued mrs chump in irish exaggerated by wine ive found m for ye and if yed seen m this afternoonthe little peaky shaky fellow that he was and a doctor too feelin his pulse is ut slow says i doctor and draws a bottle of champagne he could hardly stand before his first glass pon my honr my lady ye naver saw sch a change in a mortal beinpole didnt ye go ha ha now and seem to be nutcracking with your fingers he did and if ye aver saw an astonished doctor why says i doctor ye think uts maguc why wheres the secret drink with m to be sure and you go and do that my lord doctor my dear mr doctor do ut all round and your patients ll bless your feet why isnt cheerful society and champagne the vary best of medicines if onnly the blood ll go of itself a little the faults in his legs hes all right at topif hed smooth his hair a bit checking her tongue mrs chump performed this service lightly for him in the midst of his muttered comments on her irish the fact was manifest to the whole assembly that they had indeed been drinking champagne to some purpose wilfrid stepped up to two of his sisters warning them hurriedly not to go to their father adela he arrested with a look but she burst the restraint to fulfil a childs duty she ran up gracefully and taking her fathers hand murmured a caressing dear papa thereall rightquite rightquite well mr pole repeated glad to see you all go away he tried to look kindly out of the nervous fit into which a word in a significant tone from one of his daughters had instantly plunged him mrs chump admonished her will ye undo all that ive been doin this blessed day glad you havent missed the day altogether sir wilfrid greeted his father in an offhand way ah my boy went the old man returning him what was meant for a bluff nod lady charlotte gave wilfrid an open look it meant if you can act like that and know as much as i know you are worth more than i reckoned he talked evenly and simply and appeared on the surface as composed as any of the guests present nor was he visibly disturbed when mrs chump catching his eye addressed him aloud yed have been more grateful to me to have brought little belloni as well now i know mr wilfrid but i was just obliged to leave her at the hotel for pole cant endure her he bomunates the sight of r if ye aver saw a dog burnt by the fire poles second to m if onnly ye speak that garls name the head of a strange musician belonging to the band stationed outside was thrust through one of the window apertures mr pericles beckoned him imperiously to retire and perform he objected and an altercation in bad english diverted the company it was changed to italian mia figlia seized wilfrids ear mr pericles bellowed allegro two minutes after braintop felt a touch on his shoulder and wilfrid speaking in a tone of friend to friend begged him to go to town by the last train and remove miss belloni to an hotel which he named certainly said braintop but if i meet her father wilfrid summoned champagne for him whereupon mrs chump cried out yere kind to wait upon the young man mr wilfrid and that mr braintops an invaluble young man and what do ye want with the hotel when weve left it mr paricles the greek raised his head from mr pole shrugging at her openly he and wilfrid then measured eyes a moment some champagne togezer said mr pericles with all my heart was the reply and their glasses were filled and they bowed and drank wilfrid took his seat drew forth his pocketbook and while talking affably to lady charlotte beside him and affecting once or twice to ponder over her remarks or to meditate a fitting answer wrote on a slip of paper under the table mine my angel you will see me tomorrow your lover this being inserted in an envelope with zigzag letters of address to form emilias name he contrived to pass to braintops hands and resumed his conversation with lady charlotte who said when there was nothing left to discover but what is it you concoct down there i cried wilfrid lifting his hands and so betraying himself after the fashion of the very innocent she despised any reading of acts not on the surface and nodded to the explanation he gaveto wit by the way do you meanhave you noticed my habit of touching my fingers ends as i talk i count them backwards and forwards shows nervousness said lady charlotte you are a boy exceedingly a boy now i put a finger on his vanity said she and thought indeed that she had played on him mr pole lady gosstre addressed that gentleman i must hope that you will leave this dininghall as it is there is nothing in the neighbourhood to match it delightful interposed laura tinley but is it settled mr pole leaned forward to her ladyship and suddenly catching the sense of her words ah why not he said and reached his hand to some champagne which he raised to his mouth but drank nothing of reflection appeared to tell him that his safety lay in drinking and he drained the glass at a gulp mrs chump had it filled immediately and explained to a wondering neighbour its that that keeps m on his legs we shall envy you immensely said laura tinley to arabella who replied i assure you that no decision has been come to ah you want to surprise us with cards on a sudden from besworth that is not the surprise i have in store returned arabella sedately then you have a surprise do tell me how true to her sex is the lady who seeks to turn what it is into what it isnt said freshfield trusty lieutenant i think a little peeping makes surprises sweeter im weak enough to think that lady charlotte threw in that is so true exclaimed laura well and a secret shared is a fact uncommonly well airedthat is also true but remember you do not desire the surprise you are a destroying force to it and freshfield bowed curiosity sighed some one relieving freshfield from a sense of the guilt of heaviness i am a pandora laura smilingly said to whom tracy runningbrooks shout was heard with champagne in the heads of the men and classics in the heads of the women we shall come to something remarked lady gosstre half to herself and georgiana near her an observer of mr pole might have seen that he was fretting at a restriction on his tongue occasionally he would sit forward erect in his chair shake his coatcollar frown and sound a preparatory hem but it ended in his rubbing his hair away on the back of his head mrs chump who was herself perceiving new virtues in champagne with every glass took the movements as indicative of a companion exploration of the spiritual resources of this vintage she no longer called for it but lifted a majestic finger a siddons or tenthmuse finger as freshfield named it behind the row of heads upon which champagne speedily bubbled in the glasses laughter at the performance had fairly set in arabella glanced nervously round for mr pericles who looked at his watch and spread the fingers of one hand open thricean act that telegraphed fifteen minutes in fifteen minutes an opera troupe with three famous chiefs and a renowned primadonna were to arrive the fact was known solely to arabella and mr pericles it was the surprise of the evening but within fifteen minutes what might not happen with heads going at champagnepace arabella proposed to freshfield to rise dont the ladies go first the wit turned sensualist stammered and incurred that worse than frown a cold look of halfcomprehension which reduces indefinitely the proportions of the object gazed at there were probably a dozen very young men in the room waiting to rise with their partners at a signal for dancing and these could not be calculated upon to take an initiative or follow oneas ladies poor slaves will do when the electric hostess rustles the men present were nonconductors arabella knew that she could carry off the women but such a proceeding would leave her father at the mercy of the wine and moreover the probability was that mrs chump would remain by him and sole in a company of males explode her sex with ridicule brookfield in the bargain so arabella under a prophetic sense of evil waited and this came of it mr pole patted mrs chumps hand publicly in spite of the steady hum of smalltalkin spite of freshfield sumners circulation of a crisp anecdotein spite of lady gosstres kind effort to stop him by engaging him in conversation mr pole forced on for a speech he said that he had not been the thing lately it might be his legs as his dear friend martha on his right insisted but he had felt it in his head though as strong as any man present harrk at m cried mrs chump letting her eyes roll fondly away from him into her glass business my lady mr pole resumed ah you dont know what that is weve got to work hard to keep our heads up equal with you we dont swim with corks and my old friend ralph tinleyhe sells iron and has got a mine thats simple but my god maam when a man has his eye on the indian ocean and the atlantic and the baltic and the black sea and halfadozen colonies at once heyou well its a precious big eye hes got pole mrs chump came to his relief he dont know whether hes a ruined dog or a man to hold up his head in any company oh lord pole if yere going to talk of beggary mrs chump threw up her hands my lady i naver could abide the name of t im a kind heart ye know but i cant bear a ragged friend i hate m he seems to give me a pinch having uttered this it struck her that it was of a kind to convulse mrs lupin for whose seizures she could never accurately account and looking round she perceived sure enough that little forlorn body agitated with a handkerchief to her mouth as to besworth mr pole had continued i might buy twenty besworths ifif the cut shows the right card if sweat started on his forehead and he lifted his eyebrows blinking but none he smote the table none can say i havent been a good father ive educated my girls to marry the best the land can show i bought a house to marry them out of it was their own idea he caught arabellas eyes i thought so at all events for why should i have paid the money if i hadnt thought so when thenyes that sum was he choking saved mesaved me a piteous desperate outburst marked the last words that seemed to struggle from a tightened cord not that theres anything the matter he resumed with a very brisk wink im quite sound hearts sound lungs sound stomach regular i can see and smell and hear sense of touch is rather lumpy at times i know but the doctor says its nothingnothing at all and i should be all right if i didnt feel that i was always wearing a great leaden hat my gracious pole if yere not talkin postuv nonsense exclaimed mrs chump well my dear martha mr pole turned to her argumentatively how do you account for my legs i feel it at top i declare ive felt the edge of the brim half a yard out now my lady a man in that statesound and strong as the youngestbut i mean a vexed manworried man bothered man he doesnt want a woman to look after himi mean he doeshe does and why wont young girlsoh they might they mightsee that and when shes no extra expense but brings himhelps him to faceand no one has said the worlds a jolly world so often as i have its jolly he groaned lady charlotte saw wilfrid gazing at one spot on the table without a change of countenance she murmured to him what hits you hits me mr pole had recommenced on the evident instigation of laura tinley though lady gosstre and freshfield sumner had both sought to check the current in chumps lifetime it appeared he mr pole had thought of mrs chump with a respectful ardour and albeit she was no longer what she was when chump brought her over a blooming irish girlher hair exactly as now the black curl half over the cheek and a bright laugh and a white neck fat round arms and a shout of oh pole ye seem to be undressin of me before them all diverted the neighbours of the beauty who would not like such praise laura tinley to keep alive the subject laid herself open to freshfield by a remark at the same personal peril he inquired smoothly mr pericles stood up crying enfin as the doors were flung open and a great signora of operatic fame entered the hall supported on one side by a charming gentleman a tenore who shared her fame and more with her in the rear were two working baritones and behind them outside italian heads might be discerned the names of the queen of song and prince of singers flew round the room and laura uttered words of real gratitude for the delightful surprise to arabella as the latter turned from her welcome of them she is exactly like emiliayoung was uttered the thought went with a pang through wilfrids breast when the signora was asked if she would sup or take champagne and she replied that she would sup byandby and drink porter now the likeness to emilia was established among the poles meantime the unhappy braintop received an indication that he must depart as he left the hall he brushed past the chiefclerk of his office who soon appeared bowing and elbowing among the guests what a substitute for me thought braintop bitterly and in the belief that this old clerk would certainly go back that night and might undertake his commission he lingered near the band on the verge of the lawn a touch at his elbow startled him in the halflight he discerned emilia dont say you have seen me were her first words but when he gave her the letter she drew him aside and read it by the aid of lighted matches held in braintops hat drawing in her fervent breath to a yes yes at the close while she pressed the letter to her throat presently the singing began in an upper room that had shortly before flashed with sudden light braintop entreated emilia to go in and then rejoiced that she had refused they stood in a clear nightair under a yellowing crescent listening to the voice of an imperial woman impressed as he was braintop had nevertheless leisure to look out of his vinous mist and notice with some misgiving a parading light at a certain distanceapparently the light of cigarettes being freshly kindled he was too much elated to feel alarm but if her father were to catch me again he thought and with emilia on his arm mr poles chiefclerk had brought discomposing news he was received by an outburst of no business payne i wont have business turning to mr pericles the old clerk said i came rather for you sir not expecting to find mr pole he was told by mr pericles to speak what he had to say and then the guests who had fallen slightly back heard a cavernous murmur and some whose eyes where on mr pole observed a sharp conflict of white and red in his face there there there there went mr pole hem pericles his handkerchief was drawn out and he became engaged as it were in wiping a moisture from the palm of his hand pericles have you got pluck now eh mr pericles had leaned down his ear for the whole of the news ten sossand he said smoothing his waistbands and then inserting his thumbs into the pits of his waistcoat also a chance of forty let us not lose time for ze music he walked away i dont believe in that dd coolness maam said mr pole wheeling round on freshfield sumner its put on that wears a mask hes one of those confounded humbugs who wear a mask tenforty and all for a shrug its not human i tell you he does that just out of a sort of jealousy to rival me as an englishman because im cool he must be do you think a mother doesnt feel the loss of her children i fear that i must grow petticoats before i can answer purely feminine questions said freshfield of courseof course assented mr pole and a man feels like a mother to his money for the moment he doesfor the moment what are those fellowsspartanswomen who cut off their breasts freshfield suggested amazons no they were women mr pole corrected him and if anything hurt them they never cried out thats whathaour friend pericles is trying at hes a fool he wont sleep tonight hell lie till he gets cold in the feet and then tuck them up like a dutch doll and perspire cold till his heart gives a bound and hell jump up and think his last hours come wind on the stomach do ye call it i say its wearing a mask the birdseye of the little merchant shot decisive meaning two young ladies had run from his neighbourhood making as if to lift hands to ears the sight of them brought mrs chump to his side pole pole she said is there annything wrong wrong martha he bent to her attempting irisharrah now and mustnt all be right if youre here she smote his cheek fondly yere not a bit of an irishman ye deer little fella come along and dance cried he imperiously a pretty spectacletwo fandangoes when theres singing ye silly mrs chump led him upstairs chafing one of his hands and remarking loudly on the wonder it was to see his knees constantly give as he walked on the dark lawn pressing wilfrids written words for fiery nourishment to her heart emilia listened to the singing why do people make a noise and not be satisfied to feel she said angrily to braintop as a great clapping of hands followed a divine aria her ideas on this point would have been different in the room by degrees a tender delirium took hold of her sense and then a subtle emotionwhich was partly prompted by dim rivalry with the voice that seemed to be speaking so richly to the man she lovedset her bosom rising and falling she translated it to herself thus what a joy it will be to him to hear me now and in a pause she sang clear out prima ditalia amica and hung on the last note to be sure that she would be heard by him braintop saw the cigarette dash into sparks on the grass at the same moment a snarl of critical vituperation told emilia that she had offended taste and her father he shouted her name and striding up to her stumbled over braintop whom he caught with one hand while the other fell firmly on emilia amicaamicaaa he burlesqued her stress of the luckless notelowing it at her and telling her in triumphant italian that she was found at last braintop after a short struggle and an effort at speech which was loosely shaken in his mouth heard that he stood a prisoner eh you have not lost your cheeks insulted his better acquaintance with english slang alternately in this queer tongue and in italian the pair of victims were addressed emilia knew her fathers temper he had a habit of dallying with an evil passion till it boiled over and possessed him believing braintop to be in danger of harm she beckoned to some of the faces crowding the windows but the movement was not seen as none of the circumstances were at all understood wilfrid however knew well who had sung those three bars concerning which the prima donna questioned mr pericles and would not be put off by hearing that it was a startled jackdaw or an owl and an ole nightingale the greek rubbed his hands now to recommence he said and we shall not notice a jackdaw again his eye went sideways watchfully at wilfrid you like zat piece of opera immensely said wilfrid half bowing to the signorato whom as to majesty mr pericles introduced him and fixed him now to seats mr pericles mandates was being obeyed when a cry of wilfrid from emilia below raised a flutter mr pole had been dozing in his chair he rose at the cry looking hard with a mechanical jerk of the neck at two or three successive faces and calling somebodysomebody to take his outstretched hand trembling in a paroxysm of nervous terror hearing his sons name again but more faintly he raised his voice for martha dont let that girl come near me ii cant get on with foreign girls his eyes went among the curious faces surrounding him wilfrid he shouted to the second summons sir was replied in the silence neither saw the other as they spoke are you going out to her wilfrid someone called me sir hes got the cunning of hell said mr pole baffled by his own agitation oh dont talk o that place moaned mrs chump stop cried the old man are you going stop you shant do mischief i meantherestop dont go youre not to go i say youre not to go out emphasis and gesticulations gave their weight to the plain words but rage at the upset of all sentiments and dignity that day made wilfrid reckless and he now felt his love to be all he had he heard his emilia being dragged away to miseryperhaps to be sold to shame maddened he was incapable of understanding his fathers state or caring for what the world thought his sisters gathered near him but were voiceless is he gone mr pole burst forward youre gone sir wilfrid have you gone to that girl i ask you whethertheres one shot at my heart he added in a swift undertone to one of the heads near him while he caught at his breast with both hands wilfrid will you stay here for gods sake go to him wilfrid murmured adela i cant because if you doif you donti mean if you go the old man gasped at the undertone now i have got it in my throat a quick physical fear caught hold of him in a moment his voice changed to entreaty i beg you wont go my dear boy wilfrid i tell you dont go because you wouldnt act like a ddim not angry but it is like acting like aheres company wilfrid come to me my boy do come here you maynt hahave your poor old father long now hes got you uup in the world i mean accidents for im sound enough only a little nervous from brainis he gone wilfrid was then leaving the room lady gosstre had been speaking to mr powys she was about to say a word to lady charlotte when the latter walked to the doorway and in a manner that smote his heart with a spasm of gratitude said dont heed these people he will bring on a fit if you dont stop his nerves are out and the wine they have given him go to him i will go to emilia and do as much for her as you could wilfrid reached his father in time to see him stagger back into the arms of mrs chump whose supplication was for the female stimulant known as something chapter xxxiii on reaching home that night arabella surprised herself thinking in the midst of her anguish whatever is said of us it cannot be said that there is a house where the servants have been better cared for and this reflection continued to burn with an astounding brilliancy through all the revolutions of a mind contemplating the dread of a fallen fortune the fact of a public exposure and what was to her an ambition destroyed adela had no such thoughts i have been walking on a plank she gasped from time to time as she gave startled glances into the abyss of poverty and hurried to her bedchambera faint whisper of selfcondemnation in her ears at the i being foremost the sisters were too proud to touch upon one anothers misery in complaints or to be common by holding debate on it they had not once let their eyes meet at besworth as the tinleys wonderingly noticed they said good night to their papa who was well enough to reply adding peremptorily downstairs at halfpast eightan intimation that he would be at the breakfast table and read prayers as usual inexperienced in nervous disease they were now filled with the idea that he was possibly actinga notion that had never been kindled in them before or otherwise how came these rapid almost instantaneous recoveries cornelia alone sounded near the keynote since the night that she had met him in the passage and the next morning when mrs chump had raised the hubbub about her loss cornelias thoughts had been troubled by some haunting spectral relationship with money it had helped to make her reckless in granting interviews to purcell barrett if we are poor i am free and that she might then give herself to whomever she pleased was her logical deduction the exposure at besworth and the partial confirmation of her suspicions were not without their secret comfort to her in the carriage coming home wilfrid had touched her hand by chance and pressed it with good heart she went to the library imagining that if he wished to see her he would appear and by exposing his own weakness learn to excuse hers she was right in her guess wilfrid came he came sauntering into the room with ah you here cornelia consented to play into his hypocrisy yes i generally think better here she replied and what has this pretty head got to do with thinking not much i suppose my lord she replied affecting nobly to acknowledge the weakness of the female creature wilfrid kissed her with an unaccustomed fervour this delicate mumming was to his taste it was yet more so when she spoke playfully to him of his going soon to be a married man he could answer to that in a smiling negative playing round the question until she perceived that he really desired to have his feeling for the odd dark girl who had recently shot across their horizon touched if only it were led to by the muffled ways of innuendo as a dog that cannot ask you verbally to scratch his head but wishes it will again and again thrust his head into your hand petitioning mutely that affection may divine him sobut we deal with a sentimentalist and the simile is too gross to be exact for no sooner was wilfrids head scratched than the operation stuck him as humiliating in other words the moment he felt his sisters fingers in the ticklish part he flew to another theme then returned and so backward and forwardmystifying her not slightly and making her think then he has no heart she by no means intended to encourage love for emilia but she hoped for his sake that the sentiment he had indulged was sincere byandby he said that though he had no particular affection for lady charlotte he should probably marry her without loving her wilfrid it is unfair to her it is unfair to yourself wilfrid understood perfectly who it was for whom she pleaded thus vehemently he let her continue and when she had dwelt on the horrors of marriages without love and the supreme duty of espousing one who has our hearts loyalty he said you may be right a man must not play with a girl he must consider that he owes a duty to one who is more dependentimplying that a woman s duty was distinct and different in such a case cornelia could not rise and plead for her sex had she pushed forth the woman she must have stood for her this is the game of fine shades and nice feelings under whose empire you see this family and from which they are to emerge considerably shorn but purifiedexamples of one present passage of our civilization at least dear if cornelia desperately breathed the name if emilia were forced to give her handlovingyouwe should be right in pitying her the snare was almost too palpable wilfrid fell into it from the simple passion that the name inspired and now his hand tightened poor child he moaned she praised his kind heart you cannot be unjust and harsh i know that you could not see hermeany of us miserable women feel dear ah i need not tell you that their tears are not the witnesses when they do not weep but the hot drops stream inwardlyand oh wilfrid let this never happen to me i shall not disgrace you because i intend to see you happy withwith her whoever she is and i would leave you happy but i should not survive it i can look on death a marriage without love is dishonour sentiment enjoys its splendid moods wilfrid having had the figure of his beloved given to him under nuptial benediction cloaked even as he wished it to be could afford now to commiserate his sister and he admired her at the same time ill take care you are not made a sacrifice of when the event is fixed he saidas if it had never been in contemplation oh i have not known happiness for years till this hour cornelia whispered to him bashfully and set him wondering why she should be happy when she had nothing but his sanction to reject a man on the other hand her problem was to gain lost ground by letting him know that of the pair it was not she who would marry beneath her station she tried it mentally in various ways in the end she thought it best to give him this positive assurance no he rejoined a woman never should there was no admission of equality to be got out of him so she kissed him of their fathers health a few words were saidof emilia nothing further she saw that wilfrids mind was resolved upon some part to play but shrank from asking his confidence lest facts should be laid bare at the breakfasttable mr pole was a little late he wore some of his false air of briskness on a hazy face and read prayersdrawing breath between each sentence and rubbing his forehead but the work was done by a man in ordinary health if you chose to think so as mrs chump did she made favourable remarks on his appearance begging the ladies to corroborate her they were silent now take a chop pole and show your appetite she said a chumpchop my love my little man used to invite me of a mornin and that was the onnly joke he had so its worth rememberin a chop was placed before mr pole he turned it in his plate and wonderingly called to mind that he had once enjoyed chops at a loss to account for the distressing change he exclaimed to himself chump i wish the woman wouldnt thrust her husband between ones teeth an egg the chop was displaced for an egg which he tapped until mrs chump cried out oh if yere not like a postman pole and dye think yeve got a letter for a chick inside there this allusion scared mr pole from the egg he quitted the table muttering business business and went to the library when he was gone mrs chump gave a cry to know where braintop was but forgetting him immediately turned to the ladies and ejaculated brothm its just brothin he wants broth i say for anny man that wont eat his chop or his egg and my dears now what do ye say to me for bringing him home to ye i expect to be thanked i do and then well broth pole together till hes lusty as a prizeox and capers like a monkey wretched woman that could not see the ruin she had inflictedthat could not imagine how her bitter breath cut against those sensitive skins during a short pause little mrs lupin trotted to the door and shot through it in a paroxysm then wilfrids voice was heard he leaned against a corner of the window and spoke without directly looking at mrs chump so that she was some time in getting to understand the preliminary madam you must leave this house but presently her chin dropped and after feeble efforts to interpose an exclamation she sat quietovercome by the deliberate gravity of his manner and motioning despairingly with her head to relieve the swarm of unborn figureless ideas suggested by his passing speech the ladies were ranged like tribunal shapes it could not be said of souls so afflicted that they felt pleasure in the scene but to assist in the administration of a rigorous justice is sweet to them that are smarting they scarcely approved his naked statement of things when he came to mrs chumps particular aspiration in the householdviz to take a station and the dignity of their name the effect he produced satisfied them that the measure was correct her back gave a sharp bend as if an eternal support had snapped oh ye hit hard she moaned i tell you kindly that we who you will acknowledge must count for something here do not sanction any change that revolutionizes our domestic relations said wilfrid while mrs chump heaved and rolled on the swell of the big words like an overladen boat you have only to understand so much and thisthat if we resist it as we do you by continuing to contemplate it are provoking a contest which will probably injure neither you nor me but will be death to ham in his present condition mrs chump was heard to mumble that she alone knew the secret of restoring him to health and that he was rendered peaky and poky only by people supposing him so an astonishin thing she burst out if i kiss m and say poor pole hes poor pole on the spot and if onnly i but wilfrids stern voice flowed over her listen madam and let this be finished between us you know well that when a man has children he may wish to call another woman wifea woman not their mother but the main question is will his children consent to let her take that place we are of one mind and will allow no oneno oneto assume that position and now theres an end well talk like friends i have only spoken in that tone that you might clearly comprehend me on an important point i know you entertain a true regard for my father and it is that belief which makes me friends cried mrs chump getting courage from the savour of cajolery in these words friends oh ye fox ye fox and now commenced a curious duett wilfrid merely wished to terminate his sentence mrs chump wantonly sought to prevent him each was burdened with serious matter but they might have struck hands here had not this petty accidental opposition interposed makes me feel confident wilfrid resumed and poles promos mr wilfrud yere forgettin that confident maam he was the first to be soft i say maam for his sake an its for his sake and weak as he is on s legs poor fells which marrge ll cure bein a certain remdy mrs chump i beg you to listen mr wilfrud and i can see too and its three weeks and ye kissed little belloni in the passage outside this vary door and out in the garden the blow was entirely unexpected and took wilfrids breath so that he was not ready for his turn in this singular piece of harmony ye did mrs chump rejoiced to behold how her chance spark kindled flame in his cheeks its postuv ye did and yere the best blusher of the two my dear and no shame to ye though it is a garls business that little belloni takes to t like milk but you wilfrid strode up to her saying imperiously i tell you to listen she succumbed at once to a show of physical ascendency murmuring its sure he was seen kissin of her twice and mayhap more and hearty smacks of the lips toolikin it the ladies rewarded wilfrid for his service to their cause by absolutely hearing nothinga feat women can be capable of wilfrid however was angered by the absurdity of the charge and the scene and also by the profane touch on emilias name i must tell you maam that for my fathers sake i must desire you to quit thisyou will see the advisability of quitting this house for a time poles promus poles promus mrs chump wailed again will you give me your assurance now that you will go to be our guest again subsequently in writin and in words mr wilfrud answer me maam i will mr wilfrud and mr braintops a witness knowin the nature of an oath there naver was a more sacrud promus says pole martha wilfrid changed his tactics sitting down by her side he said i am sure you have an affection for my father im the most lovin woman my dear if it wasnt for my vartue i dont know whatd become o me ye could ask chump if he wasnt in his grave poor fella ill be cryin like a squeezed orrnge presently what with chump and pole twos too many for a melanchly woman you have an affection for my father i know maam now see hes ill if you press him to do what we certainly resist you endanger his life mrs chump started back from the man who bewildered her brain without stifling her sense of justice she knew that there was another way of putting the case whereby she was not stuck in the criminal box but the knowledge groped about blindly and finding herself there mrs chump lost all idea of a counteraccusation and resorted to wriggling and cajolery ah ye look sweeter when yere kissin us mr wilfrud and i wonder where the little belloni has got to tell me that there maybe no misunderstanding wilfrid again tried to fix her a rosy rosy fresh bit of a mouth shes got and pouts ut wilfrid took her hand answer me deed and im modust mr wilfrud you do him the honour to be very fond of him i am to believe that then you must consent to leave us at the end of a week you abandon any idea of an impossible ceremony and of us you make friends and not enemies at the concluding word mrs chump was no longer sustained by her excursive fancy she broke down and wrung her hands crying enmies poles children my enmies oh lord that i should live to hear ut and pole that knew me a bride first blushin she wailed and wept so that the ladies exchanged compassionate looks and arabella rose to press her hand and diminish her distress wilfrid saw that his work would be undone in a moment and waved her to her seat the action was perceived by mrs chump oh mr wilfrud my dear and a soldier and you that was my favourut if half my ffection for pole wasnt the seein of you so big and handsome and all my ideas to get ye marrud avery one so snug in a corner with a neat little lawful ring on your fingers and you that go to keep me a lone woman frightened of the darrk im an awful coward thats the truth and ye know that marrge is a holy thing and its such a beautful cermony oh mr wilfrudlieutent y are and id have bought ye a captain and made the hearts o your sisters jump with bonnuts and gowns and jools oh pole pole why did you keep me so short o cash its been the roon of me what did i care for your brooches and your gifts i wanted the good will of your daughters siryour son pole mrs chump stopped her flow of tears dear hearts she addressed her silent judges in mysterious guttural tones is it becas ye think theres a bit of a fear of the ladies repressed a violent inclination to huddle together like cattle from the blowing east i assure ye taint possble pursued mrs chump why do i gree to marry pole just this now we sit chirpin and chatterin of times thats gone and live twice over pole and myself and im used to m and i was soft to m when he was a merry buck and you cradle lumber in ideas mind for my vartue was always unmpeachble thats just the reason so come and lets all be friends with money in our pockuts yell find me as much of a garl as army of ye and there my weak times after my porrt my dears so now ye know when i cant be refusin a thing to ye are we friendssay are we even if the ladies had been disposed to pardon her vulgarity they could not by any effort summon a charitable sentiment toward one of their sex who degraded it by a public petition for a husband this was not to be excused and moreover they entertained the sentimentalists abhorrence of the second marriage of a woman regarding the act as simply execrable being treason to the ideal of the sextreason to womans puritytreason to the mysterious sentiment which places woman so high that when a woman slips there is no help for it but she must be smashed seeing that each looked as implacable as the other mrs chump called plaintively arrbella the lady spoke we are willing to be your friends mrs chump and we request that you will consider us in that light we simply do not consent to give you a name but well do without the name my dear interposed mrs chump yell call me plain martha which is almost mother and not a bit of t therecornelia my love what do ye say i can only reiterate my sisters words which demand no elucidation replied cornelia the forlorn woman turned her lap towards the youngest adla ye sweet little cajoler and dont use great cartwheels o words that leave a body crushed adela was suffering from a tendency to levity which she knew to be unbefitting the occasion and likely to defeat its significance she said i am sure mrs chump we are very much attached to you as mrs chump but after a certain period of life marriage does make people ridiculous and as much for your sake as our own we would advise you to discard a notion that cannot benefit anybody believe in our attachment and we shall see you here now and then and correspond with you when you are away and oh ye puss such an eel as y are mrs chump cried out what are ye doin but sugarin the same dose miss be qut its a traitor that makes whats nasty taste agreeble dye think my stomachs a fool ye may wheedle the mouth but not the stomach at this offence there fell a dead silence wilfrid gazed on them all indifferently waiting for the moment to strike a final blow when she had grasped the fact that pity did not sit in the assembly mrs chump rose oh if i havent been sitting among three owls and a raven she exclaimed then she fussed at her gown i wish ye good day young ladus and mayhap yed like to be interduced to no yourselves some fine mornin provdence can wait theres a patient hen on the eggs of all of ye i wouldnt marry pole nownot if he was to fall flat and howl for me mr wilfrud i wish ye goodbye yeve done your work ill be out of this house in halfanhour this was not quite what wilfrid had meant to effect he proposed to her that she should come to the yacht and indeed leave brookfield to go on board but mrs chump was in that frame of mind when shamefully wounded by others we find our comfort in wilfully wounding ourselves no she said betraying a meagre mollification at every offer ill not stop i wont go to the yachtunless i think better of ut but i wont stop yeve hurrt me and ill say goodbye i hope yell none of ye be widows its a crool thing and when yeve got no children of your own and feel all your inside risin to another persons and they hate yehate ye oh ohthere mr wilfrud ye neednt touch me elbow oh dear look at me in the glass and my hair annybodyd swear id been drinkin i wont let pole look at me thatd cure m and he must let me have money because i dont care for cumulations not now when theres no youngno garls and a precious boy whod say when im gone bless her oh poor thing bless oh augh a note of sorrows own was fetched and the next instant with a figure of dignity the afflicted woman observed theres seven bottles of my porrt and theres eleven of champagne and some comut clart i shall write where uts to be sent and if you please look to the packing for bits o glass and a red stains not like your precious hope when youre undoin a hamper and thats just myself now and im a broken woman but naver mind nobody a very formal and stiff goodbye succeeding a wheezy lamentation concluded the speech casting a look at the glass mrs chump retired with her fingers on the ornamental piece of hair the door having closed on her wilfrid said to his sisters i want one of you to come with me to town immediately decide which will go his eyes questioned cornelia hers were dropped i have work to do pleaded adela an appointment you will break it no dear not not exactly an appointment then theres nothing to break put on your bonnet adela slipped from the room in a spirit of miserable obedience i could not possibly leave papa said arabella and wilfrid nodded his head his sisters knew quite well what was his business in town but they felt that they were at his mercy and dared not remonstrate cornelia ventured to say i think she should not come back to us till papa is in a better state perhaps not replied wilfrid careless how much he betrayed by his apprehension of the person indicated the two returned late that night and were met by arabella at the gate papa has beendont be alarmed she began he is better now but when he heard that she was not in the house the blood left his hands and feet i have had to use a falsehood i said she left word that she was coming back tonight or tomorrow then he became simply angry who could have believed that the sight of him so would ever have rejoiced me adela worn with fatigue sobbed oh oh by the way sir twickenham called and wished to see you said arabella curiously oh so weary the fair girl ejaculated halfdreaming that she saw herself as she threw back her head and gazed at stars and clouds we met captain gambier in town here she pinched arabellas arm the latter said where in a miserable street where he looked like a peacock in a quagmire arabella entreated wilfrid to be careful in his management of their father pray do not thwart him he has been anxious to know where you have gone hehe thinks you have conducted mrs chump and will bring her back i did not say iti merely let him think so she added presently he has spoken of money yes went adela in a low breath cornelia imagines thatthat wehe is perhaps inin want of it merchants are sometimes did sir twickenham say he would call tomorrow asked adela he said that most probably he would wilfrid had been silent as he entered the house mr poles bedroombell rang and word came that he was to go to his father as soon as the sisters were alone adela groaned we have been hunting that girl all day in vile neighbourhoods wilfrid has not spoken more than a dozen sentences i have had to dine on buns and hideous soup i am halfdead with the smell of cabs oh if ever i am poor it will kill me that damp hay and close musty life are too intolerable yes you see i care for what i eat i seem to be growing an animal and wilfrid is going to drag me over the same course tomorrow if you dont prevent him i would not mind only it is absolutely necessary that i should see sir twickenham she gave a reason why which appeared to arabella so cogent that she said at once if cornelia does not take your place i will the kiss of thanks given by adela was accompanied by a request for tea arabella regretted that she had sent the servants to bed to bed cried her sister but they are the masters not we really if life were a round of sensual pleasure i think our servants might congratulate themselves arabella affected to show that they had their troubles but her statement made it clear that the servants of brookfield were peculiarly favoured servants as it was their mistresss pride to make them eventually adela consented to drink some sparkling light wine and being thirsty she drank eagerly and her tongue was loosed insomuch that she talked of things as one who had never been a blessed inhabitant of the kingdom of fine shades she spoke of cornelias chances of wilfrids headstrong infatuationor worse and of papas position remarking that she could both laugh and cry arabella glad to see her refreshed was pained by her rampant tone and when adela who had fallen into one of her reflective longshot moods chanced to say what a number of different beings there are in the world her reply was i was just then thinking we are all less unlike than we suppose oh my goodness cried adela what am i at allat allin the remotest degreelike that creature we have got rid of the negative was not decisively enunciated or immediate that is it did not come with the vehemence and volume that could alone have satisfied adelas expectation the we are all of one family was an offensive truism of which adela might justly complain that night the ladies received their orders from wilfridthey were to express no alarm before their father as to the state of his health or to treat him ostensibly as an invalid they were to marvel publicly at mrs chumps continued absence and a letter requesting her to return was to be written at the sign of an expostulation wilfrid smote them down by saying that the old mans life hung on a thread and it was for them to cut it or not chapter xxxiv lady charlotte was too late for emilia when she went forth to her to speak for wilfrid she found the youth braintop resting heavily against a tree muttering to himself that he had no notion where he was as an excuse for his stationary posture while the person he presumed he should have detained was being borne away near him a scrap of paper lay on the ground struck out of darkness by long slips of light from the upper windows thinking this might be something purposely dropped she took possession of it but a glance subsequently showed her that the writing was too fervid for a female hand or does the girl write in that way she thought she soon decided that it was wilfrid who had undone her work in the line of thirsty lovespeech how can a little fool read them and not believe any lie that he may tell she cried to herself she chose to say contemptuously its like a child proclaiming he is hungry that it was couched in bad taste she positively conceivedtaking the paper up again and again to correct her memory the termination your lover appeared to her if not laughable revolting she was uncertain in her sentiments at this point was it amusing or simply execrable some charity for the unhappy document lady charlotte found when she could say i suppose this is the general run of the kind of again was it she reflected and drank at the words again no she came to think men dont commonly write as he does whoever wrote this she had no doubt that it was wilfrid by fits her wrath was directed against him its villany she said but more and more frequently a crouching abject longing to call the words her ownto have them poured into her heart and braindesire for the intoxication of the naked speech of love usurped her spirit of pride until she read with envious tears half loathing herself but fascinated and subdued mine my angel you will see me tomorrowyour lover of jealousy she felt very littleher chief thought coming like a wave over her here is a man that can love she was a woman of chaste blood which spoke to her as shyly as a girls now that it was in tumult so indeed that pressing her heart she thought youth to have come back and feasted on the exultation we have when at an odd hour we fancy we have cheated time the sensation of youth and strength seemed to set a seal of lawfulness and naturalness hitherto wanting on her feeling for wilfrid i can help him she thought i know where he fails and what he can do i can give him position and be worth as much as any woman can be to a man thus she justified the direction taken by the new force in her two days later wilfrid received a letter from lady charlotte saying that she with a chaperon had started to join her brother at the yachtstation according to appointment amazed and utterly discomfited he looked about for an escape but his father whose plea of sickness had kept him from pursuing emilia petulantly insisted that he should go down to lady charlotte adela was ready to go there were numbers either going or now on the spot and the net was around him cornelia held back declaring that her place was by her fathers side fine shades were still too dominant at brookfield for anyone to tell her why she stayed with anguish so deep that he could not act indifference wilfrid went on his miserable expeditionfirst setting a watch over mr pericles the which in connection with the electric telegraph was to enable him to join that gentleman speedily whithersoever he might journey he was not one to be deceived by the greeks mask in running down daily to brookfield a manoeuvre like that was poor and besides he had seen the sallow eyes give a twinkle more than once now on the besworth night georgiana ford had studied her brother merthyrs face when emilias voice called for wilfrid her heart was touched and in the midst of some little invidious wonder at the power of a girl to throw her attraction upon such a man she thought as she hoped that probably it was due to the girls italian blood merthyr was not unwilling to speak of her and say what he feared and desired for emilias sake and georgiana read by this mark of confidence how sincerely she was loved and trusted by him one never can have more than half of a mans heart she thoughtadding its our duty to deserve that nevertheless she was mystified say that merthyr loved a girl whom he certainly distinguished with some visible affection what sort of man must he be that was preferred to merthyr and this set georgiana at work thinking of wilfrid he has at times the air of a student he is one who trusts his own light too exclusively is he godless she concluded he is a soldier and an officer with brainsa good class rare also altogether though emilia did not elevate herself in this ladys mind by choosing wilfrid when she might have had merthyr the rivalry of the two men helped to dignify the one of whom she thought least might she have had merthyr georgiana would not believe itthat is to say she shut the doors and shot the bolts the knocking outside went on her brother had told her the whole circumstances of emilias life and position when he said do what you can for her she knew that it was not the common empty phrase young as she was simple in habits clear in mind open in all practices of daily life she was no sooner brought into an active course than astuteness and impetuosity combined wonderfully in her she did not tell merthyr that she had done anything to discover emilia and only betrayed that she was moving at all in a little conversation they had about a meeting at the house of his friend marini an italian exile possibly belloni goes there said merthyr i wonder whether marini knows anything of him they have a meeting every other night georgiana replied he went there and took his daughter the night after we were at besworth he took her to be sworn in still that old folly of marinis cried merthyr almost wrathfully he had some of the english objection to the mixingup of women in political matters georgiana instantly addressed herself to it he thinks that the country must be saved by its women as well as its men and if they have not brains and steadfast devotion he concludes that the country will not be saved but he gives them their share of the work and dearest has he had reason to repent it no merthyr was forced to admittaking shelter in his antipathy to the administration of an oath to women and consider that this is a girl the oaths of girls are sometimes more binding on them than the oaths of women true it affects their imaginations vividly but it seems childish does she have to kiss a sword and a book merthyr made a gesture like a shrug with a desponding grimace you know answered georgiana smiling that i was excused any formula by special exemption i have no idea of what is done water salt white thorns and other carbonaro mysteries may be in use or not i think no worse of the cause whatever is done i love the cause said merthyr i dislike this sort of conspiratorial masque marini and his chief indulge in i believe it sustains them and theres its only use i said georgiana love the cause only from association with it but in my opinion marini is right he deals with young and fervent minds that require a ceremony to keep them fastyes dear and women more than others do after that they cease to have to rely upon themselvesa reliance their good instinct teaches them is frail there now have i put my sex low enough she slid her head against her brothers shoulder if he had ever met a man worthy of her merthyr would have sighed to feel that all her precious love was his own is there any likelihood that belloni will be there tonight he asked she shook her head he has not been there since he went for that purpose perhaps marini is right after all said merthyr smiling georgiana knew what he meant and looked at him fondly but i have never bound you to an oath he resumed in the same tone i dare say you consider me a little different from most said georgiana she had as small reserve with her brother as vanity and could even tell him what she thought of her own worth without depreciating it after the fashion of chartered hypocrites mr powys wrote to marini to procure him an interview with belloni as early as possible and then he and georgiana went down to lady charlotte letters from adela kept the brookfield public informed of the doings on board the yacht before leaving home wilfrid with arabellas concurrence certainlyat her instigation as he thoughthad led his father to imagine on tolerably good grounds that mrs chump had quitted brookfield to make purchases for her excursion on lively waters and was then awaiting him at the appointed station one of the old mans intermittent nervous fits had frightened them into the quasifabrication of this little innocent tale the doctors words were that mr pole was to be crossed in nothingnot even if it should appear to be of imminent necessity that i should see him and he refuses the man of science stated that the malady originated in some long continued pressure of secret apprehension both wilfrid and arabella conceived that persuasion alone was wanted to send mrs chump flying to the yacht so they had less compunction in saying she is there and here began a terrible trial for the children of nine shades to save a father they had to lie grievouslyto continue the lie from day to dayto turn it from a lie extensive and inappreciable to the lie minute and absolute then to get a particle of truth out of this monstrous lie they had to petition in utter humiliation the woman they had scorned that she would return among them and consider their house her own no answer came from mrs chump and as each day passed the querulous invalid still painfully acting the man in health had to be fed with fresh lies until at last writing of one of the scenes in brookfield arabella put down the word in all its unblessed aboriginal bluntness and did not ask herself whether she shrank from it lies she wrote what has happened to bella thought adela in pure wonder saltair and dazzling society kept all idea of penance from this vivacious young person it was queer that sit twickenham should be at the seaside instead of at brookfield wooing but a mans physical condition should be an excuse for any intermission of attentions now that i know him better wrote adela i think him the pink of chivalry and of this i am sure i can convince you bella c will be blessed indeed for a delicate nature in a man of the world is a treasure he has a beautiful little vessel of his own sailing beside us arabella was critic enough to smile at this last on the whole she was passably content for the moment in a severe fashion save to feel herself the dreadful lying engine and fruitlessly abject person that she had become we imagine that when souls have had a fall they immediately look up and contrast their present with their preceding position this does not occur the lower their fall the less generally their despair for despair is a business of the will and when they come heavily upon their humanity they get something of the practical seriousness of nature if they fall very low the shock and the sense that they are still on their feet make them singularly earnest to set about the plain plan of existencegetting air for their lungs and elbowroom contrast that mother of melancholy comes when they are some way advanced upon the upward scale the poles did not look up to their lost height but merely exerted their faculties to go forward and great as their ambition had been in them now that it was suddenly blown to pieces they did not sit and weep but strove in a stunned way to work ahead the truth is that we rarely indulge in melancholy until we can take it as a luxury little people never do and they when we have not put them on their guard are humankind naked the yachting excursions were depicted vividly by adela and were addressed as a sort of reproach to the lugubrious letters of her sister she said pointedly once really if we are to be miserable i turn catholic and go into a convent the strange thing was that arabella imagined her letters to be rather of a cheerful character she related the daily events at brookfieldthe change in her fathers soups and his remarks on them and which he preferred his fight with his medicine and declaration that he was as sound as any man on shore the health of the servants mr marter the curates call with a gregorian chant doubts of his orthodoxy cornelias lonely walks and singular appetite the bills and so forthending what is to be said further of her in return adelas delight was to date each day from a different port to which catching the wind the party had sailed and there slept the ladies were under the protecting wing of the hon mrs bayruffle a smooth woman of the world you think she must have sinned in her time but are certain it will never be known wrote adela i do confess kind as she is she does me much harm for when she is near me i begin to think that society is everything her tact is prodigious it is never seenonly felt i cannot describe her influence yet it leads to nothing i cannot absolutely respect her but i know i shall miss her acutely when we part what charm does she possess i call her the hon mrs heathencaptain g the hon mrs balm i know you hate nicknames be merciful to people yachting what are we to do i would look through a telescope all day and calculate the number of gulls and gannets we see but i am not so old as sir t and that occupation could not absorb me i begin to understand lady charlotte and her liking for mr powys better he is ready to play or be serious as you please but in either case merthyr is never a buffoon nor a parsonlady c remarked this morning and that describes him if it were not for the detestable fling at the clergy which she never misses it seems in her blood to think that all priests are hypocrites what a little boat to be in on a stormy sea bella she appears to have no concern about it whether she adores wilfrid or not i do not pretend to guess she snubs hima thing he would bear from nobody but her i do believe he feels flattered by it he is chiefly attentive to miss ford whom i like and do not like and like and do not likebut do like she is utterly cold and has not an affection on earth sir ti have not a dictionarycalls her a fair clictic i think let even cornelia read hard or woe to her in their hours of privacyhis vocabulary grows distressingly rich the more you know him i am not uneducated but he introduces me to words that seem monsters i must pretend to know them intimately well whether a clictic or notand pray burn this letter lest i should not have the word correctshe has the air of a pale young princess above any creature i have seen in the world i know it has struck wilfred also my darling and i are ever twins in sentiment he converses with miss ford a great deal lady c is peculiarly civil to captain g we scud along and are becalmed having no will of our own we have no knowledge of contrary winds as mr powys saysthe word is eclictic i find i ventured on it and it was repeated and i heard that i had missed a syllable ask c to look it outi mean to tell me they mining on a little slip of paper in your next i would buy a pocketdictionary at one of the ports but you are never alone aesthetic we know mr barrett used to be of service for this sort of thing i admit i am inferior to mrs bayruffle who if men talk difficult words in her presence holds her chin above the conversation and seems to shame them i love to learni love the humility of learning and there is something divine in the idea of a teacher i listen to sir t on parliament and parties and chide myself if my interest flags his algebrapuzzles or euclidpuzzles in figuressometimes about sheepboys and sheep and hurdles or geese oxen or anythingare delicious he quite masters the conversation with them i disagree with mrs bayruffle when she complains that they are posts in the way of speech there is a use in all men and though she is an acknowledged tactician materially she cannot see she has in sir t a quality necessary to intellectual conversation if she knew how to employ it remarks of this nature read very oddly to arabella insomuch that she would question herself at times in forced seriousness whether she had dreamed that an evil had befallen brookfield or whether adela were forgetting that it had in a dream one day she enclosed a letter from her father to mrs chump adela did not forge a reply but she had the audacity to give the words of a message from the woman in which mrs chump was supposed to say that she could not write while she was being tossed about we must carry it on adela told her sister with horrible bluntness the message savoured strongly of mrs chump it was wickedly clever arabella resolved to put it by but morning after morning she saw her fathers anxiety for the reply mounting to a pitch of fever she consulted with cornelia who said no never do such a thing and subsequently with a fainter firmness repeated the negative monosyllable arabella in her wretchedness became endued with remorseless discernment it means that cornelia would never do it herself she thought and comforted haply by reflecting that for their common good she could do it she did it she repeated an irish message her father calmed immediately making her speak it over twice he smiled and blinked his birdseyes pleasurably ah thats martha he said and fell into a state of comparative repose for some hours a sensation of bubbling hotwater remained about the sera of arabella happily mrs chump in person did not write a correspondence now commenced between the fictitious mrs chump on sea and mr pole dyspeptic in his armchair arabella took the doctor aside to ask him if in a hypothetical instance it would really be dangerous to thwart or irritate her father she asked the curate if he deemed it wicked to speak falsely to an invalid for the invalids benefit the spiritual and bodily doctors agreed that occasion altered and necessity justified certain acts so far there was comfort but the task of assisting in this correspondence and yet more the contemplation of adelas growing delight in it she would now use irish words vulgar words words expressive of physical facts airing her natural wit in irish as if she had found a new weapon became a bitter strain on arabellas mind and she was compelled to make cornelia take her share of the burden but i cannot conceali cannot feign said cornelia arabella looked at her whom she knew to be feigning thinking must i lose my high esteem of both my sisters action alone saved her from denuding herself of this garment that night was now the allusion to the scene at besworth it stood for all the misery they suffered nor could they see that they had since made any of their own a letter with the dover postmark brought exciting news a debate had been held on board the yacht wilfrid and lady charlotte gave their votes for the devon coast all were ready to be off when miss ford received a telegram from shore and said no it must be dover now mrs chumps villa was on the devon coast lady charlotte had talked to wilfrid about her and in the simplest language had said that she must be got on board this was the reason of their deciding for devon but georgiana stood for dover thither merthyr said that he must go whether be sailed or went on land by a simultaneous reading of georgianas eyes both wilfrid and lady charlotte saw what was meant by her decision wilfrid at once affected to give way halfprotestingly and this wrote adela taught me that he was well pleased to abandon the west for the east lady c favoured him with a look such as i could not have believed i should ever behold off the stage there was a perfect dagger in her eyes she fought against dover do men feel such compliments as these they are the only true ones she called the captain to witness that the wind was not for dover she called the mate she was really eloquentyes and handsome i think wilfrid thought so or the reason far the opposition to dover impressed my brother i like him to be made to look foolish for then he retrieves his character so dashinglyalways his face was red and he seemed undecidedwasuntil one taunt it must have been a taunt roused him up they exchanged about six sentencesthese two i cannot remember them unhappily but for neatness and irony never was anything so delicious heard they came sharp as fencingthrusts and you could really believe if you liked that they were merely stating grounds for diverse opinions of course we sailed east reaching dover at ten and the story is thisi knew emilia was in ittracy runningbrook had been stationed at dover ten days by miss ford to intercept emilias father if he should be found taking her to the continent by that route he waited and met them at last on the esplanade he telegraphed to miss ford and a signor marini we were wrong in not adding illustrious exiles to our list while he invited them to dine and detained them till the steamboat was starting and signor marini came down by rail in a great hurry and would not let emilia be taken away there was a quarrel but by some mysterious power that he possesses this signor marini actually prevented the father from taking his child mysterious but is anything more mysterious than emilias influence i cannot forget what she was ere we trained her and when i think that we seem to be allall who come near herconnected with her fortunes explain it if you can i know it is not her singing i know it is not her looks captivations she does not deal in is it the magic of indifference no for then some one whom you know and who longs to kiss her bella bella now would be dangerous she is very little so believe me emilia is am i chronicling a princessshe is in london with signor marini and wilfrid has not seen her lady charlotte managed to get the first boat full and pushed off as he was about to descend i pitied his poor trembling hand i went on shore in the second boat with him we did not find the others for an hour when we heard that emilia had gone with signor m the next day whom should we sea but mr pericles he i have never seen him so civilhe shook wilfrid by the hand almost like an englishman and wilfrid too though he detests him was civil to him and even laughed when he said here it is dull ze continent for a week i follow philomelaze nightingales i was just going to say well then you are running away from one wilfrid pressed my fingers and taught me to be still and i did not know why till i reflected poor mr pericles seeing him friendly for the first time rubbed his hands and it was most painful to me to see him shake hands with wilfrid again and again till he was on board the vessel chuckling wilfrid suddenly laughed with all his mighta cruel laugh and mr pericles tried to be as loud but commenced coughing and tapping his chest to explain that his intention was good bella the passion of love must be judged by the person who inspires it and i cannot even go so far as to feel pity for wilfrid if he has stooped to the humiliation ofthere is another way of regarding it know let him be sincere and noble but not his own victim he scarcely holds up his head we are now for devon tracy is with us and we never did a wiser thing than when we decided to patronize poets if kept in orderunderthey are the aristocracy of light conversationalists adieu we speed for beautiful devon me love to pole and im just etc that will do this time next she will speak herself that i should wish it but the world is full of change as i begin to learn what will ensue chapter xxxv when mrs chump had turned her back on brookfield the feelings of the outcast woman were too deep for much distinctly acrimonious sensation toward the ladies but their letters soon lifted and revived her until being in a proper condition of prickly wrath she sat down to compose a reply that should bury them under a mountain of shame the point however was to transfer this mountain from her bosom which laboured heavily beneath it to their heads nothing could appear simpler here is the mountain the heads are yonder accordingly she prepared to commence in a moment the difficulty yawned monstrous for the mountain she felt was not a mountain of shame yet that was the character of mountain she wished to cast if she crushed them her reputation as a forgiving soul might suffer she could not pardon without seeing them abased thus shaken at starting she found herself writing i know that your father has been hearing tales told of me or he would have written and he has not so you shall never see me not if you cried to me from the next worldthe hot part perusing this it was too tremendous oh thats awful she said getting her body a little away from the manuscript ye couldnt curse much louder a fresh trial found her again rounding the fact that mr pole had not written to her and again flying into consequent angers she had some dim conception of the sculpture of an offended goddess i look so she said before the glass im above ye and ye cant hurt me and dont come anigh me but heres a chequeand may ye be haunted in your dreamsbut heres a cheque there was pain in her heart for she had felt faith in mr poles affection for her and he said she cried out in her lonely roomhe said martha yeve onnly to come and be known to m and then theyll take to the ideea and wasnt i a patient creature and its pole thats turnedpole varied with the frequent oh and augh these dramatic monologues occupied her time while the yacht was sailing for her devon bay at last the thought struck her that she would send for braintoptelegraphing that expenses would be paid and that he must come with a good quill it goes faster she whispered suggesting the pentup torrent as it were of blackest ink in her breast that there was to pour forth a very cunning postscript to the telegram brought braintop almost as quick to her as a return message it was merely little belloni she had forgotten this piece of artifice but when she saw him start at the opening of the door keeping a sheepish watch in that direction bynby she said with a nod and shortly afterward unfolded her object in summoning him from his london labours a widdewoman ought to get marrud mr braintop if onnly to have a husband to write letters for rr now thats a task but sup tonight and mind ye say yer prayers before gettin into bed and no tryin to flatter your maker with your knees cuddled up to your chin under the counterpane i do t myself sometimes and i know one prayer out of beds worrth ten of m in then ill pray too and mayhap well get permission and help to write our letter tomorrow though sunday as ye say on the morrow braintops spirits were low he having perceived that the little belloni postscript had been but an irish chuckle and nudge in his ribs by way of sly insinuation or reminder he looked out on the sea and sighed to be under certain white sails visible in the offing mrs chump had received by the mornings post another letter from arabella enclosing one for wilfrid a dim sense of approaching mastery and that she might soon be melted combined with the continued silence of mr pole to make her feel yet more spiteful she displayed no commendable cunning when to sharpen and fortify braintops wits she plumped him at breakfast with all things tempting to the appetite of man ill help ye to rr she said from time to time finding that no encouragement made him potent in speech fronting the sea a desk was laid open on it were the quills faithfully brought down by braintop poles own quills she said having fixed braintop in this official seat while she took hers at a station halfcommanding the young clerks face the mighty breakfast had given braintop intolerable desire to stretch his limbs by the sounding shore and enjoy life in semioblivion he cheered himself with the reflection that there was only one letter to write so he remarked politely that he was at his hostesss disposal thereat mrs chump questioned him closely whether mr pole had spoken her name aloud and whether he did it somehow now and then by accident and whether he had looked worse of late braintop answered the latter question first assuring her that mr pole was improving then theres no marcy from me said mrs chump and immediately discharged an exclamatory narrative of her recent troubles and the breach between herself and brookfield at braintops ears this done she told him that he was there to write the reply to the letters of the ladies in her name begin she said yeve got head enough to guess my feelins im invited and i wont gotill im fetched but dont say that thats their guess ye know and i dont care for ye enough to be angry at all but its pity i feel at a parcel of fine garlsso on mr braintop the perplexities of epistolary correspondence were assuming the like proportions to the recruited secretary that they had worn to mrs chump steadily watching his countenance she jogged him thus as if ye couldnt help ut ye know ye begin jest like wakin in the mornin after dancin all night ye make the garls seem to hear me seemin to sayoooo i was so comfortable before your disturbin me with your horrud voices ye understand mr braintop im in bed and youre a cold bath begin like that ye know heres clover and youre nettles dye see here from my glass o good porrt to your tumbler of horrud acud vingar bless the boy he dont begin she stamped her foot braintop in desperation made a plunge at the paper looking over his shoulder in a delighted eagerness she suddenly gave it a scornful push dear she exclaimed youre dearin them absurd young man im not the woman to i dear emnot at the starrt im indignantim hurrt i come round to the dear byandby after i have whipped each of the proud sluts and their brother mr wilfrid just as if by accident yell promus to forget avery secret i tell ye but our way is always to pretend to believe the men cant help themselves so the men look like fools ye sly laughin fella and the women horrud scheming spiders now away with ye and no dearin the sundaybells sounded mockingly in braintops ears appearing to ask him how he liked his holiday and the white sails on the horizon line have seldom taunted prisoner more he spread out another sheet of notepaper and wrote my and there he stopped mrs chump was again at his elbow but they arent my she remonstrated when ive nothin to do with m and a my has a dear to t always yere not awake mr braintop try again shall i begin formally mrs chump presents her compliments maam said braintop stiffly and i stick myself up on a post and talk like a parrot sir dont you see im familiar and im woundud go along try again braintops next effort was ladies but they dont behave to me like ladus and its against my conscience to call em said mrs chump with resolution braintop wrote down women in the very irony of disgust and avery one of em unmarred garls exclaimed mrs chump throwing up her hands mr braintop mr braintop yere next to an ejut braintop threw dawn the pen i really do not know what to say he remarked rising in distress i naver had such a desire to shake anny man in all my life said mrs chump dropping to her chair the posture of affairs was chimed to by the monotonous bell after listening to it for some minutes mrs chump was struck with a notion that braintops sinfulness in working on a sunday or else the shortness of the prayer he had put up to gain absolution was the cause of his lack of ready wit hearing that he had gloves she told him to go to church listen devoutly and return to luncheon braintop departed with a sensation of relief in the anticipation of a sermon quite new to him when he next made his bow to his hostess he was greeted by a pleasant sparkle of refreshments mrs chump herself primed him with sherry thinking in the cunning of her heart that it might haply help the inspiration derived from his devotional exercise after this pen and paper were again produced well now mr braintop and what have ye thought of said mrs chump encouragingly braintop thought rapidly over what he might possibly have been thinking of and having put a file of ideas into the past said with the air of a man who delicately suggests a subtlety it has struck me maam that perhaps girls might begin very well to be sure dear girls is the best if you would consent to it take another glass of wine mr braintop mrs chump nodded yere nearer to ut now garls is what they are at all events but dont you see my dear your man it isnt the real thing we want so much as a sort of a proud beginnin shorrt of slappin their faces think of dinner furrst soup that prepares ye for whats comin then fish which is on the road to meat dye seewe pepper em then joint mr braintopout we burrst oh and what inslent hussies yeve been to me and yell naver see annything of me but my back then the sweetsbut im a forgivin woman and a christian in the bargain ye ungrateful minxes and if ye really are sorrowful and there mr braintop yeve got it all laid out as flat as a pancake mrs chump gave the motion of a lightning scrawl of the pen braintop looked at the paper which now appeared to recede from his eyes and flourish like a descending kite the nature of the task he had undertaken became mountainous in his imagination till at last he fixed his forehead in his thumbs and fingers and resolutely counted a number of meaningless words one hundred times as this was the attitude of a severe student mrs chump remained in expectation aware of the fearful confidence he had excited in her braintop fell upon a fresh hundred with variations the truth is i think better in church he said disclosing at last as ingenuous a face as he could assume he scarcely ventured to hope for a second dismissal to his joy mrs chump responded with a sigh there go again and the lord forgive ye for directin your mind to temporal matters when yere there its none of my doin remember that and dont be tryin to make me a particpator in your wickudness this is so difficult maam because you wont begin with dear he observed snappishly as he was retiring of coorse its difficult if it bothers me retorted mrs chump divided between that view of the case and contempt of braintop for being on her own level do you see we are not to say dear anything or ladies orin short really if you come to think maam is that a womans business mr braintop said mrs chump as from a height and the youth retired in humiliation braintop was not destitute of the ambition of his time of life and yearned to be what he believed himselfsomething better than a clerk if he had put forth no effort to compose mrs chumps letter he would not have felt that he was the partner of her stupidity but he had thoughtlessly attempted the impossible thing and now contemplating his utter failure he was in so low a state of mind that he would have taken pen and written himself down with ordinary honesty goodfornothing he returned to his task and found the dinner spread mrs chump gave him champagne and drank to him requesting him to challenge her we wont be beaten she said and at least they dined the we smote braintops swelling vanity it signified an alliance and that they were yoked to a common difficulty oh lets finish it and have it over he remarked with a complacent roll in his chair naver stop a good impulse said mrs chump herself removing the lamp to light him braintop sat in the chair of torture and wrote flowingly while his taskmistress looked over him ladies of brookfield he read it out ladies of brookfield ill be vary happy to represent ye at the forthcomin lection mrs chump gave a continuation in his tone why wont that do maam braintop asked in wonderment captal for a circular mr braintop and yell allow me to say that i dont think yeve been to church at all this accusation containing a partial truth that is true if it referred to the afternoon but not as to the morning it was necessary for braintops selfvindication that he should feel angry the two were very soon recriminating much in the manner of boy and girl shut up on a sunny afternoon after which they in like manner made it upthe fact of both having a habit of consulting the glass and the accident of their doing it at the same time causing an encounter of glances there that could hardly fail to be succeeded by some affability for a last effort mrs chump laid before braintop a prospect of advancement in his office if he so contrived as to write a letter that should land her in brookfield among a scourged repentant and forgiven people that he might understand the position she went far modestly to reveal her weakness for mr pole she even consented to let ladies be the opening apostrophe provided the word young went before it theyll feel that sting she said braintop stipulated that she should not look till the letter was done and observing his pen travelling the lines in quick succession mrs chump became inspired by a great but uneasy hope she was only to be restrained from peeping by braintops petulant pray maam which sent her bouncing back to her chair with a face upon one occasion too solemn for braintops gravity he had written himself into excellent spirits and happening to look up as mrs chump retreated from his shoulder the womans comic reverence for his occupationthe prim movement of her lips while she repeated mutely the words she supposed he might be penningtouched him to laughter at once mrs chump seized on the paper young ladus she read aloud yours of the nd the th and st ulto the ffection i bear to your onnly remaining parent her enunciation waxed slower and significantly staccato toward a pause the composition might undoubtedly have issued from a merchants office and would have done no discredit to the establishment when the pause came braintop half for an opinion and to encourage progress said yes maam and with there sir mrs chump crumpled up the paper and flung it at him and there sir she tossed a pen hearing braintop mutter ladylike behaviour mrs chump came out in a fiery bloom ye detestable young fella oh ye young deceiver ye cannt do the work of a man oh and heres another woman dispointed and when she thought shed got a man to write her letters braintop rose and retorted yere false mr braintopyere offensuv sir said mrs chump and braintop instantly retired upon an expressive bow when he was out of the room mrs chump appealed spitefully to an audience of chairs but when she heard the frontdoor shut with a report she jumped up in terror crying incredulously is the young man postively one oh and me alone in a rage the contemplated horrors of which position set her shouting vociferously mr braintop sounded over the stairs and mr braintop into the street the maid brought mrs chump her bonnet night had fallen and nothing but the greatest anxiety to recover braintop would have tempted her from her house she made halfadozen steps and then stopped to mutter oh if yed onnly come id forgive yeindeed i would well here i am was instantaneously answered her waist was clasped and her forehead was kissed the madness of braintops libertinism petrified her yeve taken such a liberty sir deed yeve forgotten yourself while she was speaking she grew confused with the thought that braintop had mightily altered both his voice and shape when on the doorstep he said come out of the darkness or upon my honour i shall behave worse she recognized wilfrid and understood by his yachting costume in what manner he had come he gave her no time to think of her dignity or her wrath lady charlotte is with me i sleep at the hotel but you have no objection to receive her have you this set her mind upon her best bedroom her linen and the fitness of her roof to receive a title then in a partial fit of gratitude for the honour and immense thankfulness at being spared the task of the letter she fell on wilfrids shoulder beginning to sobtill he in alarm at his absurd position suggested that lady charlotte awaited a welcome mrs chump immediately flew to her drawingroom and rang bells appearing presently with a lamp which she set on a gardenpillar together they stood by the lamp a spectacle to ocean but no lady charlotte drew near chapter xxxvi though mrs chump and wilfrid as they stood by the light of the lamp saw no one they themselves were seen lady charlotte had arranged to give him a moment in advance to make his peace she had settled it with that air of practical sense which her title made graceful to him i will follow and i dare say i can complete what you leave unfinished she said her humorous sense of the aristocratic prestige was conveyed to him in a very taking smile he scarcely understood why she should have planned so decisively to bring about a reconciliation between mrs chump and his family still as it now chimed perfectly with his own views and wishes he acquiesced in her scheme giving her at the same time credit for more than common wisdom while lady charlotte lingered on the beach she became aware of a figure that hung about her as she was moving away a voice of one she knew well enough asked to be directed to the house inhabited by mrs chump the lady was more startled than it pleased her to admit to herself dont you know me she said bluntly you went emilias voice why on earth are you here what brings you here are you alone returned the lady emilia did not answer what extraordinary expedition are you making but tell me one thing are you here of your own accord or at somebody elses bidding impatient at the prospect of a continuation of silences lady charlotte added come with me emilia seemed to be refusing the appointment was made at that house i know said the lady but if you come with me you will see him just as readily at this instant the lamp was placed on the pillar showing wilfrid in his sailors hat and overcoat beside the fluttering irishwoman come i must speak to you first said lady charlotte hurriedly thinking that she saw emilias hands stretch out pray dont go into attitudes there he is as you perceive and i dont use witchcraft come with me i will send for him havent you learnt by this time that theres nothing he detests so much as a public display of the kind youre trying to provoke emilia half comprehended her he changes when hes away from me she said low toneless voice less than i fancied the lady thought then she told emilia that there was really no necessity for her to whine and be miserable she was among friends and so forth the simplicity of her manner of speech found its way to emilias reason quicker than her arguments and in the belief that wilfrid was speaking to mrs chump on urgent private matters she had great awe of the word business emilia suffered herself to be led away she uttered twice a little exclamation as she looked back that sounded exceedingly comical to lady charlottes ears they were the repressions of a poignant outcry doggies make that noise thought the lady and succeeded in feeling contemptuous wilfrid when he found that lady charlotte was not coming bestowed a remark upon her sex and went indoors for his letter he considered it politic not to read it there mrs chump having grown so friendly and even motherly that she might desire out of pure affection to share the contents he put it by and talked gaily till mrs chump partly to account for the defection of the lady observed that she knew they had a quarrel she was confirmed in this idea on a note being brought in to him over which before opening it he frowned and flushed aware of the treachery of his countenance he continued doing so after his eyes had taken in the words though there was no special ground furnished by them for any such exhibition mrs chump immediately with a gaze of mightiest tribulation burst out ill help ye pon my honour ill help ye oh the arrstocracy oh their pride but if i say my dear when i die which its so horrud to think of youll have a share and the biggestthis vary cottage and a good parrt o the bank propertyshell come down at that and if ye marry a lady of title ill be s good as my word i will wilfrid pressed her fingers can you ever believe that i have called you a simmering pot of emerald broth my dear annything thats lots o words ye may call me returned mrs chump as long as its no name ye wont call me a name will ye lots o wordsits onnly as if ye peppered me and i sneeze and thats all but a name sticks to yer back like a bit o pinned paper dont call me a name and she wriggled pathetically yes said wilfrid i shall call you pole oh ye sweetest of young fellas mrs chump threw out her arms she was on the point of kissing him but he fenced with the open letter and learning that she might read it she gave a cry of joy dear w she begins and its twice dear from a lady of title shes just a multiplicationtable for annything she says and touches dear w and the shorter time a single you the better ill have my joke mr wilfrud dear w bless her heart now i seem to like her next best to the queen alreadyi have another plan yed better keep to the old but its two paths i suppose to one pointanother plan come to me at the dolphin where i am alone oh lord alone with a line under it mr wilfrud but therethe arrstocracy neednt matter a bit its a very singular proceeding not the less said wilfrid why didnt she go to the hotel where the others are if she wouldnt come here but the arrstocracy mr wilfrud and alonealone dye see which couldnt be among the others becas of sweet whisperin alone mrs chump read on and tomorrow ill pay my respects to what you call your simmering pot of emerald broth oh ye hussy id say if ye werent a borrn lady and signs ut all your faithful charlotte mr wilfrud id give five pounds for this letter if i didnt know ye wouldnt part with it under fifty and deed i am a simmerin pot for shell be a relation my dear go to r ill have your bed ready for ye here at the end of an hour and tomorrrow perhaps if lady charlotte can spare me ill condescend to see adla wilfrid fanned her cheek with the note and then dropped it on her neck and left the room he was soon hurrying on his way to the dolphin midway he stopped there may be a bad shot in bellas letter he thought shoplights were ahead a very luminous chemist sent a green ray into the darkness wilfrid fixed himself under it confoundedly appropriate for a man reading that his wife has run away from him he muttered and hard quickly plunged into matter quite as absorbing when he had finished it he shivered thus it ran my beloved brother i bring myself to plain words happy those who can trifle with human language papa has at last taken us into his confidence he has not spoken distinctly he did us the credit to see that it was not necessary if in our abyss of grief we loss delicacy what is leftwhat the step he desired to take which we opposed he has anticipated and must consummate oh wilfrid you see it do you not you comprehend me i am surf i should have said had anticipated how to convey to you but it would be unjust to himto ourselveswere i to say emphatically what i have not yet a right to think what i have hinted above is after all nothing but cornelias conjecture i wish i could not say confirmed by mine we sat with papa two hours before any idea of his meaning dawned upon us he first scolded us we both saw from this that more was to come i hope there are not many in this world to whom the thought of honour being tied to money ever appears possible if it is so there is wide sufferingdeep for it must be silent cornelia suggests one comfort for them that they will think less of poverty why was brookfield ever bought our old peaceful citylifethe vacant sundaysmy ears are haunted by their bells for evening service i said there they go the dowdy population of heaven i remember it now it should be almost punishment enough to be certain that of all those people going to church there cannot be one more miserable than we who stood at the old window ridiculing them they at least do not feel that everything they hope for in human life is dependent upon one human willthe will of a mortal weathervane it is the case and it must be conciliated there is no halfmeasureno choice feel that nothing you have ever dreamed of can be a disgrace if it is undergone to forestall what positively impends and act immediately i shall expect to see you in three days she is to have the southwest bedroom mine for which she expressed a preference prepare every mind for the ceremonyan old mans infatuationmoneywe submit it will take place in town to have the tinleys in the church but this is certainly my experience that misfortune makes me feel more and more superior to those whom i despise i have even asked myselfwas i so once and apropos of laura we hear that their evenings are occupied in performing the scene at besworth they are still as distant as ever from richford let me add that albert tinley requested my hand in marriage yesterday i agree with cornelia that this is the first palpable sign that we have sunk consequent upon the natural consequences came the interview with papa dearest dearest wilfrid can you can i can any one of us settlethat is involve another life in doubt while doubt exists papa insists his argument is now now and no delay i accuse nothing but his love excessive love is perilous for principle you have understood me i know and forgiven me for writing so nakedly i dare not reperuse it you must satisfy him that lady c has fixed a date adela is incomprehensible one day she sees a friend in lady c and again it is an enemy papas immediate state of health is not alarming above all things do not let the girl come near him papa will send the cheque you required when wilfrid burst out upon arabellas affectionate signature when will he send it he doesnt do me the honour to mention the time and this is his reply to a third application the truth was that wilfrid was in dire want of tangible cash simply to provision his yacht the light kindled in him by this unsatisfied need made him keen to comprehend all that arabellas attempt at plain writing designed to unfold good god my fathers the womans trustee shaped itself in wilfrids brain and next if he marries her we may all be as poor as before that is to say honour may be saved without ruin being averted his immediate pressing necessity struck like a pulse through all the chords of dismal conjecture his heart flying about for comfort dropped at emilias feet bellas right he said reverting to the green page in his hand we cant involve others in our scrape whatever it may be he ceased on the spot to be at war with himself as he had been for many a day by which he was taught to imagine that he had achieved a mental indifference to misfortune this lightened his spirit considerably so theres an end of that he emphasized as the resolve took form to tell lady charlotte flatly that his father was ruined and that the son therefore renounced his particular hope and aspiration she will say in the most matteroffact way in the world oh very well that quite alters the case said wilfrid aloud with the smallest infusion of bitterness then he murmured poor old governor and wondered whether emilia would come to this place according to his desire love that had lain crushed in him for the few recent days sprang up and gave him the thought she may be here now but his eyes not being satiated instantly with a sight of her the possibility of such happiness faded out blessed little woman he cried openly ashamed to translate in tenderer terms the soft fresh blossom of love that his fancy conjured forth at the recollection of her he pictured to himself hopefully moreover that she would be shy when they met a contradictory vision of her eyes lifted hungry for his first words or the pressure of his arm displeased him slightly it occurred to him that they would be characterized as a singular couple to combat this he drew around him all the mysteries of sentiment that had issued from her voice and her eyes she had made earth lovely to him and heaven human shewhat a grief for ever that her origin should be what it was for this reasonlovers must live like ordinary people outwardly and say ye fates how had she been educated to direct a gentlemens household i cant exist on potatoes he pronounced humorously but when his thoughts began to dwell with fitting seriousness on the womanoftheworld tone to be expected from lady charlotte he folded the mental image of emilia closely to his breast and framed a misty idea of a little lighted cottage wherein she sat singing to herself while he was campaigning two or three fellowslumley and fredericksshall see her he thought the rest of his brother officers were not even to know that he was married his yacht was lying in a strip of moonlight near sir twickenhams companion yawl he gave one glance at it as at a history finished and sent up his name to lady charlotte ah you havent brought the good old dame with you she said rising to meet him i thought it better not to see her tonight he acquiesced mentioning the lateness of the hour and adding you are alone she stared and let fall certainly and then laughed i had forgotten your regard for the proprieties i have just sent my maid for georgiana she will sleep here i preferred to come here because those people at the hotel tire me and besides i said i should sleep at the villa and i never go back to people who dont expect me wilfrid looked about the room perplexed and almost suspicious because of his unexplained perplexity her as he deemed itnot much above the level of mrs chump in that respect aristocratic indifference to opinion and conventional social observances would have pleased him by daylight but it fretted him now lady charlottes maid came in to say that miss ford would join her the maid was dismissed to her bed theres nothing to do there said her mistress as she was moving to the foldingdoors the window facing seaward was open he went straight to it and closed it next in an apparent distraction he went to the foldingdoors he was about to press the handle when lady charlottes quiet remark my bedroom brought him back to his seat crying pardon have you had news she inquired you thought that a letter might be there bad is it it is not good he replied briefly i am sorry that isit tells me wilfrid disciplined his tongue that iwe area lieutenant on halfpay may say that he is ruined i suppose when his other supplies are cut off i can excuse him for thinking it said lady charlotte she exhibited no sign of eagerness for his statement of facts her outward composure and a hard animation of countenance which having ceased the talking within himself he had now leisure to notice humiliated him the sting helped him to progress i may try to doubt it as much as i please to avoid seeing what must follow i may shut my eyes in the dark but when the light stares me in the facei give you my word that i have not been justified even in imagining such a catastrophe the preamble is awful said lady charlotte rising from her recumbent posture pardon me i have no right to intrude my feelings i learn today for the first time that we areare ruined she did not lift her eyebrows or look fixedly but without any change at all said is there no doubt about it none whatever this was given emphatically resentment at the perfect realization of her anticipated worldly indifference lent him force ruined she said yes you ill be more so than you were a month ago i mean you tell me nothing new i have known it amid the crush and hurry in his brain caused by this strange communication pressed the necessity to vindicate his honour i give you the word of a gentleman lady charlotte that i came to you the first moment it has been made known to me i never suspected it before this day nothing would prompt me to disbelieve that she reached him her hand you have known it he broke from a short silence yesnever mind how i could not allude to it of course i had to wait till you took the initiative the impulse to think the best of what we are on the point of renouncing is spontaneous if at the same time this object shall exhibit itself in altogether new undreamtof glorious colours others besides a sentimentalist might waver and be in some danger of clutching it a little tenderly ere it is cast off my duty was to tell you the very instant it came to my knowledge he said fascinated in his heart by the display of greatness of mind which he now half divined to be approaching and wished to avoid well i suppose that is a duty between friends said she between friends shall we stillalways be friends i think i have said more than once that it wont be my fault if we are not because the greater and happier ambition to which i aspired this was what he designed to say sentimentally propelled by way of graceful exit and what was almost printed on a scroll in his head for the tongue to read off fluently he stopped at the greater beginning to stumbleto flounder and fearing that he said less than was due as a compliment to the occasion he said more by no means a quick reader of character lady charlotte nevertheless perceived that the man who spoke in this fashion after what she had confessed must be sentimentally if not actually playing double thus she came to his assistance are you begging permission to break our engagement at least whatever i do get i must beg for now he took refuge adroitly in a foolish reply and it served him that he had in all probability lost his chance by the method he had adopted and by sentimentalizing at the wrong moment was becoming evident notwithstanding in a sort of despair he attempted comfort by critically examining her features and trying to suit them to one or other of the numerous models of love that a young man carries about with him her eyes met his and even as he was deciding against her on almost every point the force of their frankness held his judgement in suspense the world is rather harsh upon women in these cases she said turning her head a lithe with a conscious droop of the eyelids i will act as if we had an equal burden between us on my side what you have to tell me does not alter me i have known it you see that i am just the same to you for your part you are free if you please that is fair dealing is it not the gentlemans mechanical assent provoked the ladys smile but wilfrid was torn between a profound admiration of her and the galling reflection that until she had named the engagement none had virtually existed which diplomacy aided by time and accident might not have stopped you must be aware that i am portionless she continued i havelet me name the suma thousand pounds it is some credit to me that i have had it five years and not spent it some men would think that a quality worth double the amount well you will make up your mind to my bringing you no moneyi have a few jewels en revanche my habits are not expensive i like a horse but i can do without one i like a large house and can live in a small one i like a french cook and can dine comfortably off a single dish society is very much to my taste i shall indulge it when i am whipped at home wilfrid took her hand and pressed his lips to the fingers keeping his face ponderingly down he was again so divided that the effort to find himself absorbed all his thinking faculties at last he muttered a lieutenants payexpecting her to reply we can wait as girls do that find it pleasant to be adored by curates then might follow a meditative pausea short gaze at her from which she could have the option of reflecting that to wait is not the privilege of those who have lived to acquire patience the track he marked out was clever in a poor way perhaps it was not positively unkind to instigate her to look at her age but though he read character shrewdly and knew hers pretty accurately he was himself too much of a straw at the moment to be capable of leadingmoves we can make up our minds without great difficulty to regard the lieutenants pay as nothing at all was lady charlottes answer you will enter the diplomatic service my interest alone could do that if we are married there would be plenty to see the necessity for pushing us i dont know whether you could keep the lieutenancy you might i should not like you to quit the army an opening might come in it theres the indian staffthe persian mission they like soldiers for those eastern posts but we must take what we can get we should anyhow live abroad where in the matter of money society is more sensible we should be able to choose our own and advertize tea brioche and conversation in return for the delicacies of the season but you charlotteyou could never live that life wilfrid broke in the contemplation of her plain sincerity diminishing him to himself it would drag you down too horribly remorse at giving tea in return for dinners and balls ah there are other things to consider she blushed unwontedly something lighted by the blush struck him as very feminine and noble then i may flatter myself that you love me he whispered do you not see she rejoined my project is nothing but a whima whim the divided man saw himself whole if not happy in the ranks of diplomacy with a resolute frank faithful woman a lady of title loving him to back him fortune shone ahead and on the road he saw where his deficiencies would be filled up by her she was firm and openhe irresolute and selfinvolved animal courage both possessed their differences were so extreme that they met where they differed it struck him specially now that she would be like day to his spirit in continued intercourse young as he was he had wisdom to know the right meaning of the word helpmate it was as if the head had dealt the heart a blow saying see here the lady thou art to serve but the heart was a surly rebel lady charlotte was fully justified in retorting upon his last question i think i also should ask do you love me it is not absolutely imperative for the occasion or for the catastrophe i merely ask for what is called information and yet despite her flippancy which was partly designed to relieve his embarrassment her hand was moist and her eyes were singularly watchful you who sneer at love he gave a musical murmur not at all i think it a very useful part of the capital to begin the married business upon you unsay your own words not absolutely imperative i think i said if i remember rightly but i take the other view charlotte you imagine that there must be a little bit of love there should be no marriage without it on both sides at least if not on both sides one should bring such a love enough for two so then we are not to examine your basket touched by the pretty thing herein implied he squeezed her hand this is the answer said she can you doubt me she rose from her seat oh if you talk in that style i really am tempted to say that i do are there menwomen and womenmen my dear wilfrid have we changed parts tonight his quickness in retrieving a false position outwardly came to his aid he rose likewise and while perfecting the minor details of an easy attitude against the mantelpiece said i am so constituted charlotte that i cant talk of my feelings in a business tone and i avoid that subject unless you spoke of a basket just now well i confess i cant bring mine into the market and bawl out that i have so many pounds weight of the required material would a man go to the market at all if he had nothing to dispose of in plain wordssince my fault appears to be according to your reading in the opposite directionshould i be here if my sentiments could not reply eloquently to your question this very common masterpiece of cunning from a man in a corner which suggests with so persuasive an air that he has ruled his actions up to the very moment when he faces you and had almost preconceived the present occasion rather won lady charlotte or it seemed to or the scene had been too long for her vigilance in the affirmative she whispered coming nearer to him she knew that she had only to let her right shoulder slip under his left arm and he would very soon proclaim himself her lover as ardently as might be wished why did she hesitate to touch the blood of the man it was her fate never to have her great heart read aright wilfrid could not know that generosity rather than iciness restrained her from yielding that one unknown kiss which would have given the final spring to passion in his breast he wanted the justification of his senses and to run headlong blindly had she nothing of a womans instinct in the affirmative was his serene reply that means yes her tone had become pleasantly soft yes that means yes said he she shut her eyes murmuring how happy are those who hear that they are loved and opening them all her face being red say it she pleaded her fingers fell upon his wrist i have this weakness wilfrid i wish to hear you say it the flush of her face and tremour of her fingers told of an unimagined agitation hardly to be believed though seen and felt yet still some sign some shade of a repulsion in her figure kept him as far from her as any rigid rival might have stipulated for the interrogation to the attentive heavens was partially framed in his mind how can i tell this woman i love her without without putting his arm about her waist and demonstrating it satisfactorily to himself as well as to her in other words not so framed how without that frenzy which shall make me forget whether it be so or not he remained in his attitude incapable of moving or speaking but fancying that possibly he was again to catch a glimpse of the vanished mountain nymph sweet liberty her womans instinct warmed more and more until if she did not quite apprehend his condition she at least understood that the pause was one preliminary to a mans feeling himself a fool dear wilfrid she whispered you think you are doubted i want to be certain that you think you have met the right woman to help you in me he passed through the loophole here indicated and breathed yes charlotte i am sure of that if i could be only half as worthy you are full of courage and unselfishness and i could swear faithful as steel thank younot dogs she laughed i like steel i hope to be a good sword in your hand my knightor shield or whatever purpose you put me to she went on smiling and seeming to draw closer to him and throw down defences after all wilfrid the task of loving your good piece of steel wont be less thoroughly accomplished because you find it difficult sir i do not admit any protestation handsome faces musical voices sly manners and methods that i choose not to employ make the business easy to men who discover that the lady is not steel said wilfrid need she in any case wear so much there he pointed flittingly as it were with his little finger to the slope of her neck she turned her wrist touching the spot here you have seen then that it is something worn there followed a delicious interplay of eyes who would have thought that hers could be sweet and mean so much it is something worn then and thrown aside for me only charlotte for him who loves me she said for me for him who loves me she repeated then it is for me she had moved back showing a harder figure or the i love you love you would have sounded with force it came though not so vehemently as might have been to the appeal of a soft fixed look yes i love you charlotte you know that i do you love me yes say it i love you dead inanimate charlotte i love you she threw out her hand as one would throw a bone to a dog my living breathing noble charlotte he cried a little bewitched i love you with all my heart it surprised him that her features should be gradually expressing less delight with all your heart could i give you a part it is done sometimes she said mocksadly then in her original voice good i never credited that story of you and the girl emilia i suppose what people say is a lie her eyes in perfect accordance with the tone she had adopted set a quiet watch on him who says it he thundered just as she anticipated its not true not truehow can it be true you never loved emilia bellonidont love her nowdo not love her now if you have ever said that you love emilia belloni recant and you are forgiven and then go for i think i hear georgiana below quick i am not acting its earnest the word if you please as you are a gentleman tell me because i have heard tales i have been perplexed about you i am sure youre a manly fellow who would never have played tricks with a girl you were bound to protect but you might havepardon the slangspoonedwho knows you might have been in love with her downright no harm even if a trifle foolish but in the present case set my mind at rest quick there are both my hands take them press them and speak the two hands were taken but his voice was not so much at command no image of emilia rose in his mind to reproach him with the casting over of his hearts dear mistress but a blind struggle went on it seemed that he could do what he dared not utter the folly of lips more loyal than the spirit touched his lively perception and as the hot inward struggle masked behind his softlyplaying eyes had reduced his personal consciousness so that if he spoke from his feeling there was a chance of his figuring feebly he put on his everready other self categorically i reply have i loved miss emilia bellonino do ino do i love charlotte chillingworthyes ten thousand times and now let britomart disarm he sought to get his reward by gentle muscular persuasion her arms alone yielded and he judged from the angle of the neck ultrasharp though it was that her averted face might be her form of exhibiting maidenly reluctance feminine modesty suddenly the fingers in his grasp twisted and not being at once released she turned round to him for gods sake spare the girl emilia stood in the doorway chapter xxxvii a knock at merthyrs chamber called him out while he sat writing to marini on the national business he heard georgianas voice begging him to come to her quickly when he saw her face the stain of tears was there anything the matter with charlotte was his first question no but come i will tell you on the way do not look at me no personal matter of any kind oh no i can have none and she took his hand for a moment they passed into the dark windy street smelling of the sea emilia is here said georgiana i want you to persuade heryou will have influence with her oh merthyr my darling brother i thank god i love my brother with all my love what a dreadful thing it is for a woman to love a man i suppose it is while she has nothing else to do said merthyr how did she comewhy if you had seen emilia tonight you would have felt that the difference is absolute georgiana dealt first with the general case she came i think by some appointment also just as absolute between her and her sex he rejoined controlling himself not to be less cool what has happened georgiana pointed to the hotel whither their steps were bent that is where charlotte sleeps her going there was not a freak she had an object she wished to cure emilia of her love for mr wilfrid pole emilia had come down to see him charlotte put her in an adjoining room to hear him saywhat i presume they do say when the fit is on them was it not singular folly it was a folly that merthyr could not understand in his friend charlotte he said so and then he gave a kindly sad exclamation of emilias name you do pity her still cried georgiana her heart leaping to hear it expressed so simply why what other feeling can i have said he unsuspiciously no dear merthyr she replied and only by her tone he read the guilty little rejoicing in her heart marvelling at jealousy that could twist so straight a stem as his sisters spirit this had taught her who knew nothing of love that a man loving does not pity in such a case i hope you will find her here georgiana hurried her steps say anything to comfort her i will have her with me and try and teach her what selfcontrol means and how it is to be won if ever she can act on the stage as she spoke tonight she will be a great dramatic genius she was transformed she uses strange forcible expressions that one does not hear in everyday life she crushed charlotte as if she had taken her up in one hand and without any display at all no gesture or spasm i noticed as they stood together that there is such a contrast between animal courage and imaginative fire charlotte could meet a great occasion i should think said merthyr and taking his sister by the elbow you speak as if you had observed very coolly did emilia leave you so cold did she seem to speak from head not from heart no she moved mepoor child only how humiliating to hear her beg for lovebefore us merthyr smiled i thought it must be the womans feeling that would interfere to stop a natural emotion is it trueor did i not see that certain eyes were red just now that was for him said georgiana hastily i am sure that no man has stood in such a position as he did to see a man made publicly ashamed and bearing it i have never had to endure so painful a sight to stand between two women claimed by both like solomons babe a man might as well at once have solomons judgement put into execution upon him you wept for him do you know georgey that charity of your sex which makes you cry at any affecting situation must have been designed to compensate to us for the severities of providence no merthyr she arrested his raillery do i ever cry but i thoughtif it had been my brother and almost at the thought i felt the tears rush at my eyelids as if the shame had been mine the probability of its not being your brother seemed distant at the moment said merthyr with his halfmelancholy smile tell mei can conjure up the scene but tell me whether you saw more passions than one in her face emilias no her face reminded me of the sombrethat dull glow of a fire that you leave burning in the grate late on winter nights was that natural it struck me that her dramatic instinct was as much alive as her passion had she been clumsy would you not have been less suspicious of her and if she had only shown the accustomed northern retenue and merely looked all that she had to say preserved her dignityour womanly critic would have been completely satisfied but merthyr to parade her feelings and then to go on appealing on the principle that she ought to be ashamed of them she was wrong if you had heard her utter abandonment i can believe that she did not blush it seems to me to belong to those excesses that promptthat are in themselves a species of suicide love is said to be the death of self no but i must use cant words merthyr i do wish to see modesty yes i know i must be right there is very little of it to be had in a tropical storm you admit then that this sort of love is a storm that passes it passes i hope but where is your defence of her now have i defended her i need not try a man has deceived her and she doesnt think it possible and has said so i presume when she sees it she will be quieter than most she will not reproach him subsequently here is the hotel and that must be charlottes room if i may judge by the lights what pranks will she always be playing we seem to have brought new elements into the little town do you remember bergamo the rainy night the austrian trooped out of milanone light that was a thousand in the twinkling of an eye having arrived he ran hastily up to the room expecting to find the three but lady charlotte was alone sitting in her chair with knotted arms ah merthyr she said im sorry you should have been disturbed i perceive what georgeys leaving the room meant i suppose the hotel people are used to yachtingparties and then not seeing any friendly demonstration on his part she folded her arms in another knot georgiana asked where emilia was lady charlotte replied that emilia had gone and then wilfrid had followed her one minute later to get her into shelter somewhere or put penknives out of her way i am rather fatigued with a scene merthyr i never had an idea before of what your southern women were one plays decidedly second to them while the fit lasts of course you have a notion that i planned the whole of the absurd business this is the casei found the girl on the beach she follows him everywhere which is bad for her reputation because in this climate people suspect positive reasons for that kind of female devotedness so to put an end to itreally for her own sake quite as much as anything elseam i a monster of insensibility merthyri made her swear an oath one must be a point above wild animals to feel that to be binding however i made her swear to listen and remain there silent till i opened the door to set her at liberty she consentedgave her word solemnly i calculated that she might faint and fixed her in an armchair was that cruel merthyr you have called me austrian more than once but upon my honour i wanted her to get over her delusion comfortably i thought she would have kept the oath i confess she looked up like a child when she was making it you have heard the rest from georgey i must say the situation was rather hard on wilfrid if he blames me it will be excuseable though what i did plan was to save him from a situation somewhat worse so now you know the whole merthyr commence your lecture make me a martyr to the sorrows of italy once more merthyr took her wrist feeling the quick pulse and dropped it she was effectually humbled by this direct method of dealing with her secret heart after some commonplace remarks had passed she herself urged him to send out men in search for emilia before he went she murmured a soft forgive me the pressure of her fingers was replied to but the words were not spoken there she cried to georgiana i have offended the only man for whose esteem i care one particle devote yourself to your friends how devote yourself murmured georgiana astonished do you think i should have got into this hobble if i hadnt wished to serve some one else you must have seen that merthyr has a sentimental sort of fondnesscall it passionfor this girl shes his italy in the flesh is there a more civilized man in the world than merthyr so he becomes fascinated by a savage we all play the game of oppositesor like to and no woman in his class will ever catch him i couldnt have believed that he was touched by a girl but for two or three recent indications you must have noticed that he has given up reading others and he objected the other day to a responsible office which would have thrown him into her neighbourhood alone these are unmistakeable signs in merthyr though he has never been in love and doesnt understand his case a bit tell me do you think it impossible georgiana answered dryly you have fallen into a fresh mistake exactly then let me rescue you from a similar fatality georgey if your eyes are bandaged now are you going to be devoted to me also charlotte i believe im a miracle of devotion said the lady retiring into indifferent topics upon that phrase she had at any rate partially covered the figure of ridicule presented to her feminine imagination by the aspect of her fair self exposed in public contention with one of her sexand for a man it was enough to make her pulse and her brain lively on second thoughts too it had struck her that she might be serving merthyr in disengaging emilia and undoubtedly she served georgiana by giving her a warning through this silliness went the current of a clear mind nevertheless the ladys heart was justified in crying out what would i not abandon for my friend in his need meantime her battle in her own behalf looked less pleasing by the light of new advantages the question recurred shall i care to win at all she had to force the idea of a violent love to excuse her proceedings to get up any flame whatsoever an occasional blast of jealousy had to be called for jealousy was a quality she could not admit as possible to her so she acted on herself by an agent she repudiated and there was no help for it had wilfrid loved her the womans heart was ready it was ready with a trembling tenderness softer and deeper than a girls for charlotte would have felt with this love that i have craved for you give me life and she would have thanked him for both exultingly to feel i can repay you as no girl could do though she had none of the rage of love to give as it was she thought conscientiously that she could help him she liked him his peculiar suppleness of a growing mind his shrouded sensibility in conjunction with his reputation for an evidently quite reliable prompt courage and the mask he wore which was to her transparent pleased her and touched her fancy nor was he so vain of his person as to make him seem like a boy to her he affected maturity he could pass a mirror on his right or his left without an abstracted look over either shouldera poor example but worth something to a judge of young men indeed had she chosen from a crowd the choice would have been one of his age she was too set for an older man but a youth aspiring to be older than he was whose faults she saw and forgave whose merits supplied two or three of her own deficiencies whom her station might help to elevate to whom she might come as a benefactress feeling so while she accomplished her own desiresuch a youth was everything to her as she awoke to discover after having played with him a season if she lost him what became of her even if she had rejoiced in a mother to plot and playto bait and snare for her her time was slipping and the choosers among her class were wary her spirit besides was high and elective it was gradually stooping to nature but would never have bowed to a fool or save under protest to one who gave all on wilfrid she had fixed her mind so therefore she bore the remembrance of the recent scene without much fretting at her burdensthe more that wilfrid had in no way shamed her and the more that the heat of emilias love played round him and illumined him this borrowing of the passion of another is not uncommon at daybreak mrs chump was abroad she had sat up for wilfrid almost through the night oh the arrstocracy she breathed exclamations as she swept along the esplanade ill be killed and murdered if i tell a word meeting captain gambier she fell into a great agitation and explained it as an anxiety she entertained for wilfrid when becoming entangled in the mesh of questions she told all she knew and nearly as much as she suspected which fatal step to retrieve she entreated his secresy adela was now seen fluttering hastily up the walk fresh as a creature of the seawave before mrs chump could summon her old wrath of yesterday she was kissed and to the arch interrogation as to what she had done with this young ladys brother replied by telling the tale of the night again mrs chump was ostentatiously caressed into a more comfortable opinion of the worlds morality for the nonce invited by them to breakfast at the hotel she hurried back to her villa for a flounced dress and a lace cap of some pretensions while they paced the shore see what may be said adelas countenance changed as she muttered it thought would be enough she added shuddering yes if one is off guardcareless the captain assented flowingly can one in earnest be other than careless i shall walk on that line up to the end who makes me deviate is my enemy the playful little person balanced herself to make one foot follow the other along a piece of washed grey rope on the shingle soon she had to stretch out her hand for help and the captain at full arms length conducted her to the final knot arrived safe she said smiling but not disengaged he rejoined in similar style please she doubled her elbow to give a little tug for her fingers no he pressed them tighter pray no must i speak to somebody else to get me released would you must i thank heaven he is not yet in existence husband being implied games of this sweet sort are warranted to carry little people as far as they may go swifter than any other invention of lively satan the yachting party including mrs chump were at the breakfasttable and that dumb guest had done all the blushing for lady charlotte when wilfrid entered neat carefully brushed and with ready answers though his face could put on no fresh colours to mrs chump he bent passing and was pushed away and drawn back your eyes she whispered myyeyes went wilfrid in schoolboy style and she who rarely laughed was struck by his humorous skill saying to sir twickenham beside her hes as cunnin as a lord sir twickenham expressed his ignorance of lords having usurped priority in that department frightened by his portentous parliamentary phraseology she remained tolerably demure till the sitting was over now sidling in her heart to the sins of the great whom anon she angrily reproached her principal idea was that as the world was discovered to be so wicked they were all in a boat going to perdition and it would be as well to jump out immediately but while so resolving she hung upon lady charlottes looks and little speeches altogether seduced by so fresh and frank a sinner if safe from temptation here was the soul of a woman in great danger of corruption among the aristocracy thought mrs chump its just the male that hangs his head and the female struts and is sprightly the contrast between lady charlotte and wilfrid who when he ceased to set outrageously sat like a man stricken by a bolt produced this reflection and in spite of her disastrous vision of the fate of the boat they were in mrs chump owned to the intoxication of gliding smoothlygliding on the rapids the breakfast was coming to an end when braintops name was sent in to mrs chump she gave a cry of motherly compassion for braintop and began to relate the little deficiencies of his temper while as it were simmering on her seat to go to him wilfrid sent out word for him to appear which he did unluckily for himself even as mrs chump wound up the public description of his character by remarking hes just the opposite of a lord now in everything braintop stood bowing like the most faithful confirmation of an opinion ever seen he looked the victim of fatigue in the bargain a light broke on mrs chump ill never forgive myself ye poor gentle heart to throw pens and penwipers at ye that did your best poor boy what have ye been doin and why didnt ye return and not go hoppin about about all night like a young kangaroo as they say they do have ye read the arcana of nature and science maam the hon mrs bayruffle thus abruptly addressed observed that she had not and was it an amusing book becas itll open your mind pursued mrs chump and there hes eatin and when a man takes to eatin yell never have any fear about his abouts and if ye read the arcana of nature and science maam yell first feel that yeve gone half mad for it contains averything in the world and yell read ut ten times all through and not remember five lines runnin oh its a dreadful book and thats the book to read to your husband when hes got a fit o the gout hes got nothin to do but swallow knolludge then now mr braintop dont stop but tell me as ye go on what ye did with yourself all night a slight hesitation in braintop caused her to crossexamine him rigidly suggesting that he might not dare to tell and he exercising some selfcommand adopted narrative as the less ignominious form of confession no one save mrs chump listened to him until he mentioned the name miss belloni and then it was curious to see the steadiness with which certain eyes feigning abstraction fixed in his direction he had met emilia on the outskirts of the town and unable to persuade her to take shelter anywhere had walked on with her in dead silence through the night to the third station of the railway for london is this a mad person asked the hon mrs bayruffle adela shrugged a genius dont eat with the tips of your teeth like a bird mr braintop for no company minds your eatin cried mrs chump angrily and encouragingly and this little bellonimy belief is that she came after you and what have ye done with her it was queerly worried out of braintop who was trying his best all the time to be obedient to wilfrids direct eye that the two wanderers by night had lost themselves in lanes refreshed themselves with purloined apples from the tree at dawn obtained a draught of morning milk with a handful of damsons apiece and that nothing would persuade emilia to turn back from the route to london braintop bit daintily at his toast unwilling to proceed under the discouraging expression of wilfrids face and the meditative silence of two or three others the discovery was forcibly extracted that emilia had no moneythat all she had in her possession was sevenpence and a thimble and that he braintop had but a few shillings which she would not accept and what has become of her was asked braintop stated that she had returned to london and blushing confessed that he had given her his return ticket georgiana here interposed to save him from the awful encomiums of mrs chump by desiring to know whether emilia seemed unhappy or distressed braintops spirited reply not at all was corrected to she did not cry and further modified that is she called out sharply when i whistled an opera tune lady charlotte put a stop to the subject by rising pointedly watch in hand she questioned the ladies as to their occupations and told them what time they had to dispose of then baynes captain of the yacht heard to be outside was summoned in he pronounced doubtfully about the weather but admitted that there was plenty of wind and if the ladies did not mind it a little fresh he was sure he did not wind was favourable for the island headquarters of the yacht well see who gets there first she said to wilfrid and the company learnt that wilfrid was going to other headquarters on special business whereupon there followed chatter and exclamations wilfrid quickly explained that his fathers condition called him away imperiously to adela and mrs chump demanding peculiar personal explanations he gave reassuring reasons separately aside mrs chump understood that this was merely his excuse to get away that he might see her safe to brookfield adela only required a look and a gesture merthyr and georgiana likewise spoke expected adieux as did sir twickenham who parted company in his own little yawl lady charlotte with her head over a map and one hand arranging an eyeglass hastily nodded them off scarcely looking at them she allowed herself to be diverted from this study for an instant by the unbefitting noise made by adela for the loss of her brother not that she objected to the noise particularly it was modulated and delicate in tone but that she could not understand it seeing sir twickenham however in a leavetaking attitude she uttered an easy oh to herself and diligently recommenced spying at ports and harbours and following the walnut thumb of baynes on the map all seemed to be perfectly correct in the arrangements to go to london was wilfrids thought and the rest were almost as much occupied with their own ideas captain gambier received their semiironical congratulations and condolences incident to the man who is left alone in the charge of sweet ladies and the hon mrs bayruffle remarked that she supposed ten hours not a long period of time though her responsibility was onerous lady gosstre is at the island said lady charlotte to show where it might end if she pleased within an hour the yacht was flying for the island with a full western breeze and mrs chump and wilfrid were speeding to brookfield as the latter permitted her to imagine braintop realized the fruits of the sacrifice of his return ticket by facing mrs chump in the train merthyr had telegraphed to marini to meet emilia at the station in london and instructed braintop to deliver a letter for her at marinis house to marini he wrote let giulia guard her as no one but a woman can in such a case by this time giulia will know her value there is dangerous stuff in her now and my anxiety is very great have you seen what a nature it is you have not alluded to her beyond answers to instructions but her character cannot have escaped you i am never mistaken in my estimates of italian and cymric blood singularly too she is part welsh on the mothers side to judge by the name leave her mind entirely free till it craves openly for some counteraction her italy and her music will not do let them be my fear is that you have seen too clearly what a daughter of italy i have found for you but whatever you put up now to distract her you sacrifice my good marini bear that in mind it will be a disgust in her memory and i wish her to love her country and her art when she recovers so we treat the disease dear friend let your italy have no sorrows for her ears till the storm within is tranquil i am with you speedily marinis reply said among all the things we have to thank our merthyr for this treasure if it is not the greatest he has given to us makes us grateful the most we met her at the station ah there was an elbow when she gave her hand she thought to be alone and started and hated till giulia smothered her face and there was dead fire in the eyes which is powder when you spring it we go with her to her new lodging and the track is lost this is your wish it is pitching new camps to avoid the enemy but so a man takes this disease and his common work at once of a womanshe is all the disease till it is extinct or she what is this disease but a silly a senseless waste giuliawoman that she iswill not call it so see her eyes doze and her voice go a soft buzz when she speaks it as a dove of the woods that it almost makes it sweet to me yes a daughter of italy so giulia has beenwill be i know not so will this your emilia be in the time that comes to the young people she has this as you say malady very strongma ogni male ha la sua ricetta i can say it of persons of nations to think my heart is as an infidelvery heavy ah till i turn to youwho revive to the thought as you were an army of deliverance for you are hope you know not despair you are hope and you love as myself a mother whose son you are not oh is giulias cry will our italy reward him with a daughterthe noblest that we have yes for she would be italian always through you we pray that you may not get old too soon before she grows for you and is found only that you may know in her our love see i am brought to talk this language the woman is in me merthyr said as he read this i could wish no better his feeling for emilia waxed toward a selfavowal as she advanced to womanhood and the last stage of it had struck among trembling strings in the inmost chambers of his heart that last stage of ither passionate claiming of wilfrid before two women one her rivalslept like a covered furnace within him can you remember none of her words he said more than once to georgiana who replied i would try to give you an idea of what she said but i might as well try to paint lightning my lover suggested merthyr oh yes that she said it sounded oddly to your ears very indeed what more did she say do you mean is my poor sister ashamed to repeat it i would repeat anything that would give you pleasure to hear sometimes pain you know is sweet little by little and with a contest at each step georgiana coasted the conviction that her undivided reign was over then she judged emilia by human natures hardest standard the measure of the qualities brought as usurper and successor unconsciously she placed herself in the seat of one who had fulfilled all the great things demanded of a woman for merthyr and it seemed to her that emilia exercised some fatal fascination girl though she was to hurl her from that happy sovereignty but emilias worst crime before the arraigning lady was that wilfrid had cast her off female justice therefore said you must be unworthy of my brother and female delicacy thought you have been soiled by a previous history she had pitied wilfrid now she held him partially blameless and while love was throbbing in many pulses all round her the man she had seen besieged by passionate love touched her cold imagination with a hue of fire as winter dawn lies on a frosty field she almost conceived what this other not sisterly love might be though not as its victim by any means she became as she had never before been spiritually tormented and restless the thought framed itself that charlotte and wilfrid were not by any law of selection to match what mattered it simply that it in some way seemed to increase the merits of one of the two the task moreover of avoiding to tease her brother was made easier to her by flying to this new refuge of mysterious reflection at times she poured back the whole flood of her heart upon merthyr and then in alarm at the host of little passions that grew cravingly alive in her she turned her thoughts to wilfrid again and so till they turned wittingly to him that this host of little passions will invariably surround a false great one she learnt by degrees by having to quell them and rise out of them she knew that now she occasionally forced her passion for merthyr but what nothing could teach her was that she did so to eject anothers image on the contrary her confession would have been voluntarily i dwell upon that other that my love for merthyr may avoid excess to such a state of clearness much selfquestioning brought her but her blood was as yet unwarmed and that is a condition fostering selfdeception as much as when it rages madame marini wrote to ask whether emilia might receive the visits of a sir purcell barrett whom they had met and whom emilia called her friend adding the other gentleman has called at our old lodgings three times the last time our landlady says he wept is it an englishman really merthyr laughed at this remarking charlotte is not so vigilant after all he wept georgiana thought and remembered the cold selfcommand that his face had shown when emilia claimed him and his sole reply was i am engaged to this lady designating lady charlotte now too some of emilias phrases took life in her memory she studied them thinking over them as if a voice of nature had spoken less and less it seemed to her that a woman need feel shame to utter them she interpreted this as her growth of charity for a girl so violently stricken with love in such a case the more she says the more is she to be excused for nothing but a frenzy of passion could move her to speak so thought georgiana accepting the words and sanctioning the passion the person of him who had inspired it stood magnified in its light she believed that if he had played with the girl he repented and the idea of a man shedding tears burnt to her heart merthyr and georgiana remained in devonshire till a letter from madame marini one morning told them that emilia had disappeared you delayed too long to go to her merthyr said his sister astonishing him i understand why but you may trust to time and scorn chance too much let us go now and find her if it is not too late marini met them at the station in london and they heard that wilfrid had discovered marinis new abode and had called there that morning i had my eye on him it was not a piece of loveplay said marini and today she should have seen my chief which would have cured her of sis pestilence of a love to give her sublime thoughts do you love her miss ford aha it will be christian names in italy again i like her very much said georgiana but i confess it mystifies me to see you all so excited about her it must be some attraction possessed by herwhat i cannot say i like her certainly figlia mia she is an elementshe is fire said marini my sought when our mertyr brought her was it is italy he sees in her faceher voicenameanysing and a day passed and i could not lose her for my own sake and felt a somesing too she is half man a singular reason for an attraction georgiana smiled she is not marini put out his fingers like claws to explain while his eyelashes met over his eyesshe is not what man has made of your sex and she is brave of heart can you possibly tell what such a child can be questioned georgiana almost irritably marini did not reply to her a face to find a home ineh mertyr lets discover where that face has found a home said merthyr she is a very plain and unpretending person if people will not insist upon her being more this morbid admiration of heroines puts a trifle too much weight upon their shoulders does it not georgiana knew that to call emilia child was to wound the most sensitive nerve in merthyrs system if he loved her and she had determined to try harshly whether he did nevertheless though the expression succeeded and was designedly cruel she could not forgive the insincerity of his last speech craving in truth for confidence as her smallest claim on him now so at all the consultations she acquiesced in any scheme that was proposed the advertizings and the use of detectives the communication with emilias mother and father and the callings at suburban concertrooms sir purcell barrett frequently called to assist in the discovery at first he led them to suspect mr pericles but a trusty italian playing spy upon that gentleman soon cleared him and they were more in the dark than ever it was only when at last georgiana heard merthyr the picture of polished selfpossession giving way to a burst of disappointment in the room before them all are we sure that she lives he criedthen georgiana looking at the firelight over her joined fingers said but have you forgotten the serviceable brigade you have in your organboys marini if emilia sees one be sure she will speak to him have i not said she is a general marini pointed at georgiana with a gleam of his dark eyes and merthyr squeezed his sisters hand thanking her by which he gave her one whole night of remorse because she had not spoken earlier chapter xxxviii my voice i have my voice emilia had cried it out to herself almost aloud on the journey from devon to london the landscape slipping under her eyes with flashing grey pools and light silver freshets little glades little copses farms and meadows rounding away to spires of village churches under blue hills would not let her sink heavy as was the spirit within her and dead to everything as she desired to be here a great strange old oak spread out its arms and seemed to hold the hurrying train a minute when gone by emilia thought of it as a friend and that there there was the shelter and thick darkness she had hoped she might be flying to or the reach of a stream was seen and in the middle of it one fair group of clouds showing distance beyond distance in colour emilia shut her sight and tried painfully to believe that there were no distances for her this was an easy task when the train stopped it was surprising to her then why the people moved the whistle of the engine and rush of the scenery set her imagination anew upon the horror of being motionless my voice i have my voice the exclamation recurred at intervals as a quick fear that bubbled up from blind sensation of her being utterly abandoned and a stray thing carrying no light startled her darkness she still had her desire for but not to be dark in the darkness she looked back on the recent night as a lake of fire through which she had plunged and of all the faculties about her memory had suffered most so that it could recall no images of what had happened but lay against its black corner a shuddering bundle of nerves the varying fields and woods and waters offering themselves to her in the swiftness were as wine dashed to her lips which could not be dead to it the wish to be of some worth began a painful quickening movement at first she could have sobbed with the keen anguish that instantaneously beset her forif i am of worth who looks on me was her outcry and the darkness she had previously coveted fell with the strength of a mace on her forehead but the creatures heart struggled further and byandby in despite of her the pulses sprang a clear outlook on hope it struck through her like the first throb of a swordcut she tried to blind herself to it the face of hope was hateful this conflict of the baffled spirit of youth with its forceful flood of being continued until it seemed that emilia was lifted through the fiery circles into daylight her last cry being as her first i have my voice of that which her voice was to achieve for her she never thought she had no thought of value but only an eagerness to feel herself possessor of something wilfrid had appeared to her to have taken all from her until the recollection of her voice made her breathe suddenly quick and deep as one recovering the taste of life despair i have said before is a wilful business common to corrupt blood and to weak woeful minds native to the sentimentalist of the better order the only touch of it that came to emilia was when she attempted to penetrate to wilfrids reason for calling her down to devon that he might renounce and abandon her she wanted a reason to make him in harmony with his acts and she could get none this made the world look black to her but i have my voice she said exhausted by the passion of the night tearless and only sensible to pain when the keen swift wind and the flying squares of field and meadow prompted her nature mysteriously to press for healthy action a man opposite to her ventured a remark were going at a pretty good pace now miss she turned her eyes to him and the sense of speed was reduced in her at once she could not comprehend how remembering presently that she had not answered him she said it is because you are going home perhaps that you think it fast no miss he replied im going to market they cant put on steam too stiff for me when im bound on business emilia found it impossible to fathom the sensations of the man and their common desire for speed bewildered her more she was relieved when the train was lightened of him soon the skirts of red vapour were visible and when the guard took poor braintops returnticket from her petulant hand all of the journey that she bore in mind was the sight of a butcherboy in blue with a red cap mounted on a white horse who rode gallantly along a broad highroad and for whom she had struck out some tune to suit the measure of his gallop she accepted her capture by the marinis more calmly than merthyr had been led to suppose the butcherboys gallop kept her senses in motion for many hours and that reckless equestrian embodied the idea of the vivifying pace from which she had dropped he went slower and slower by degrees the tune grew dull and jarred and then emilia looked out on the cold grey skies of our autumn the rain and the fogs and roaring london filled her ears so had ended a dream she thought she would stand at the window listening to streetorgans whose hideous discord and clippings and drawls did not madden her and whose suggestion of a lovely tune rolled out no golden land to her that treasure of her voice to which no one in the house made allusion became indeed a buried treasure in the southwestern suburb where the marinis lived plots of foliage were to be seen and there were lanes not so black but that they showed the hues of the season these led to the parks and to noble gardens emilia daily went out to keep the dying colours of the year in view and walked to get among the trees where with madame attendant on her she sat counting the leaves as each one curved and slid and spun to earth or on a gust of air hosts went aloft but it always ended in their coming down emilia verified that fact repeatedly however high they flew the ground awaited them madame entertained her with talk of italy and tuscan wine and lombard bread and turin chocolate marini never alluded to his sufferings for the loss of these cruelly interdicted dainties never but madame knew how his exile affected him and in england the sums one paid for everything one fancies one pays for breath said madame shivering one day the exorganist of hillford church passed before them emilia let him go the day following he passed again but turned at the end of the alley and simulated astonishment at the appearance of emilia as he neared her they shook hands and talked while madame zealously eyed any chance person promenading the neighbourhood she wrote for instructions concerning this gentleman calling himself sir purcell barrett and receiving them she permitted emilia to invite him to their house he is an englishman under a rope ready for heaven madame described him to her husband who though more at heart with englishmen could not but admit that this one wore a look that appeared as a prognostication of sadness sir purcell informed emilia of his accession to title and in reply to her are you not glad smiled and said that a mockery could scarcely make him glad indicating nevertheless how feeble the note of poverty was in his grand scale of sorrow he came to the house and met them in the gardens frequently with some perversity he would analyze to herself emilias spirit of hope partly perhaps for the sake of probing to what sort of thing it might be in its nature and defences and as against an accomplished disputant she made but a poor battle he injured what was precious to her without himself gaining any good whatever why what do you look forward to she said wondering at the end of one of their arguments as he courteously termed this play of logical foils with a baby death answered the grave gentleman striding on emilia pitied him thinking i might feel as he does if i had not my voice seeing that calamity very remote she added i should she knew of his position toward cornelia that is she knew as much as he did for the want of a womans heart over which to simmer his troubles was urgent within him and emilias though it lacked experience was a womans regarding love and moreover she did not weep but practically suggested his favourable chances which it was a sad satisfaction to him to prove baseless and to knock utterly over the grief in which the soul of a human creature is persistently seeking since it cannot be thrown off to clothe itself comfortably finds in tears an irritating expression of sympathy hints of a brighter future are its nourishment such embryos are not tenacious of existence and when destroyed they are succulent food for a space to the moody grief i am describing the melancholy gentleman did emilia this good that never appearing to imagine others to know misery save himself he gave her full occupation apart from the workings of her own mind as to her case he might have offered the excuse that she really had nothing of the aspect of a lovesick young lady and was not a bit seagreen to view or lamentable in tone he was sufficiently humane to have felt for anyone suffering and the proof of it is that the only creature he saw under such an influence he pitied so deplorably as to make melancholy a habit with him he fretted her because he would do nothing and this spectacle of a lover beloved but consenting to be mystified consentingly paralyzedof a lover beloved does she love you said emilia beseechingly if the truth is in her she does he returned she has told you she loves youthat she loves no one else of this i am certain then why are you downcast my goodness i would take her by the hand woman do you know yourself you belong to mei would say that and never let go her hand that would decide everything she must come to you then or you know what it is that means to separate you my goodness i see it so plain but he declined to look thus low and stood pitifully smilingthis spectacle together with some subtle spur from the talk of love roused emilia from her lethargy the warmth of a new desire struck around her heart the old belief in her power over wilfrid joined to a distinct admission that she had for the moment lost him and she said yes now as i am now he can abandon me but how if he should see her and hear her in that hushed hour when she was to stand as a star before men emilia flushed and trembled she lived vividly though her farprojected sensations until truly pity for wilfrid was active in her bosom she feeling how he would yearn for her the vengeance seemed to her so keen that pity could not fail to come thus to her contemplation their positions became reversed it was wilfrid now who stood in the darkness unselected her fiery fancy unchained from the despotic heart illumined her under the golden future come to us this evening i will sing to you she said and the englishman under a rope bowed assentingly sad songs if you like she added i have always thought sadness more musical than mirth said he surely there is more grace in sadness poetry sculpture and songs and all the arts were brought forward in mournful array to demonstrate the truth of his theory when emilia understood him she cited dogs and cats and birds and all things of nature that rejoiced and revelled in support of the opposite view nay if animals are to be your illustration he protested he had been perhaps half under the delusion that he spoke with cornelia and with a sense of infinite misery he compressed the apt distinction that he had in his mind which was to show where humanity and simple nature drew a line and wherein humanity claimed the loftier seat but such talk must be uttered to a soul he phrased internally and emilia was denied what belonged to cornelia hitherto emilia had refused to sing and madame marini faithful to her instructions had never allowed her to be pressed to sing emilia would brood over notes thinking i can take that and that and dwell on such and such a note for any length of time but she would not call up her voice she would not look at her treasure it seemed more to her untouched and went on doubling its worth until doubtless her idea of capacity greatly relieved her of the burden on her breast and the reflection that she held a charm for all and held it from all flattered one who had been cruelly robbed on their way homeward among the chrysanthemums in the long gardenwalk they met tracy runningbrook between whose shouts of delight and emilias reserve there was so marked a contrast that one would have deemed tracy an offender in her sight she had said to him entreatingly do not come when he volunteered to call on the marinis in the evening and she got away from him as quickly as she could promising to be pleased if he called the day following tracy flew leaping to one of the great houses where he was tame cat when sir purcell as they passed on spoke a contemptuous word of his soft habits and idleness emilia said he is one of my true friends and why is he interdicted the visit this evening because she answered and grew pale hehe does not care for music i wish i had not met him she recollected how tracys flaming head had sprung up before herhe who had always prophesied that she would be famous for arts unknown to her and not for song just when she was having a vision of triumph and caressing the idea of her imprisoned voice bursting its captivity and soaring into its old heavens he does not care for music interjected sir purcell with something like a frown i have nothing in common with him but that i might have known i can have nothing in common with a man who is not to be impressed by music i love him quite as well said emilia he is a quick friend i am always certain of him and i imagine also that you are quits with your quick friend added sir purcell you do not care for verse or he for voices poetry said emilia no not much it seems like talking on tiptoe like animals in cages always going to one end and back again and making the same noise when they get at the endlike the bears sir purcell slightly laughed you dont approve of the rhymes yes i like the rhymes but when you use wordsi mean if you are in earnesthow can you count and have stops andno i do not care anything for poetry sir purcells opinion of emilia though he liked her was that if a genius she was an incomplete one and his positive judgement which i set down in phrase that would have startled him ranked both her and tracy as a pair of partial humbugs entertaining enough they were both too real for him haply at that moment the girl was intensely susceptible for she chilled by his side and when he left her she begged madame to walk fast i wonder whether i have a cold she said madame explained all the signs of it with tragic minuteness deciding that emilia was free at present and by miracle from this english scourge but emilia kept her hands at her mouth over the hornbeam hedge of the lane that ran through the marketgardens she could see a murky sunset spreading its deepcoloured lines that seemed to her really like a great sorrowing over earth it had never seemed so till now and entering the house the roar of vehicles in a neighbouring road sounded like something implacable in the order of things among us and clung about her ears pitilessly running upstairs she tried a scale of notes that broke on a cough did i cough purposely she asked herself but she had not the courage to try the notes again while dressing she hummed a passage and sought stealthily to pass the barrier of her own watchfulness by dwelling on a deep note from which she was to rise bursting with full bravura energy and so forth on a tide of song but her breath failed she stared into the glass and forced the note a panic caught at her heart when she heard the sound that issued am i ill i must be hungry she exclaimed it is a cough but i dont cough what is the matter with me under these auspices she forced her voice again and subsequently loosened her dress complaining of the dressmakers affection for tightness now she said having fallen upon an attempt at simple do re me fa and laughed at herself was it the laugh that stopping her at si made that si so husky asthmatic like the wheezing of a crooked old witch i am unlucky tonight said emilia or rather so said her surfaceself the submerged selfself in the depthsrarely speaks to the occasions but lies under calamity quietly apprehending all willing that the talker overhead should deceive others and herself likewise if possible emilia found her hands acting daintily and critically in the attirement of her person and then surprised herself murmuring i forgot that tracy wont be here tonight by which she betrayed that she had divined those arts she was to shine in according to tracy and betrayed that she had a terrible fear of a loss of all else it pained her now that tracy should not be coming can i send for him she thought as she looked winningly into the glass trying to feel what sort of a feeling it was to be in love with a face like that one fronting her so familiar in its aspects so strange when scrutinized studiously she drew a chair and laying her elbow on the toilettable gazed hard until the thought what face did wilfrid see last meaning when he saw me last drove her away not only did she know herself now a face of many faces but the life within her likewise as a soul of many souls the one emilia so unquestioning so sure lay dead and a dozen new spirits with but a dim likeness to her were fighting for possession of her frame now occupying it alone now in couples and each casting grim reflections on the other which is only a way of telling you that the great result of mortal sufferingconsciousnesshad fully set in to ripen perhaps to debase at any rate to prove her to be of worth was still her fixed ideaall that was clear in the thickening mist i cannot be ugly she said and reproved herself for simulating a childish tone why do i talk in that way i know i am not ugly but if a fire scorched my face there is nothing that seems safe the love of friends was suggested to her as something to rely on and the loving them but if i have nothing to give said emilia and opened both her empty hands she had diverted her mind from the pressure upon it by this colloquy with a lookingglass and gave herself a great rapture by running up notes to this theme no no no no nonothing nothing clear full sonant notes the notes of her true voice she did not attempt them a second time nor when sir purcell requested her to sing in the course of the evening did she comply the signora thinks i have a cold she said madame marini protested that she hoped not she even thought not though none could avoid it at this season in this climate and she turned to sir purcell to petition for any receipts he might have in his possession specifics for warding off the frightful affliction of households in england i have now twenty said madame and throwing up her eyes i have tried all oh so many lozenge marini and emilia laughed while sir purcell was maintaining the fact of his total ignorance of the subject against madames incredulity emilia left the room when she came back madame was pressing her visitor to be explicit with regard to a certain process of cure conducted by an application of cold water the neapolitan gave several shudders as she marked him attentively water cold she murmured with the deepest pathos and dropped her face in her hands with narrowed shoulders emilia held a letter over to sir purcell he took it first assuring himself that marini was in complicity with them to marini emilia addressed a momus forefinger and marini shrugged smiling water cold ejaculated madame showing her countenance again in winter luigi they are mad marini poked the fire briskly for his sensations entirely sided with his wife the letter sir purcell held contained these words be kind and meet me tomorrow at ten in the morning at that place where you first saw me sitting i want you to take me to one who will help me i cannot lose time any more i must work i have been dead for i cannot say how long i know you will come i am for ever your thankful friend emilia chapter xxxix the pride of punctuality brought sir purcell to that appointed seat in the gardens about a minute in advance of emilia she came hurrying up to him with three fingers over her lips the morning was cold frost edged the flat brown chestnut and beech leaves lying about on rimy grass so at first he made no remark on her evident unwillingness to open her mouth but a feverish look of her eyes touched him with some kindly alarm for her you should not have come out if you think you are in any danger he said not if we walk fast she replied in a visiblycontrolled excitement it will be over in an hour this way she led the marvelling gentleman toward the row and across it under the big black elms begging him to walk faster to accommodate her he suggested that if they had any distance to go they might ride and after a short calculating hesitation she consented letting him know that she would tell him on what expedition she was bound whilst they were riding the accompaniment of the wheels however necessitated a higher pitch of her voice which apparently caused her to suffer from a contraction of the throat for she remained silent with a discouraged aspect her full brown eyes showing as in a sombre meditation beneath the thick brows the direction had been given to the city on they went with the torrent and were presently engulfed in fog the roar grew muffled phantoms poured along the pavement yellow beamless lights were in the shopwindows all the vehicles went at a slow march it looks as if business were attending its own obsequies said sir purcell whose spirits were enlivened by an atmosphere that confirmed his impression of things emilia cried twice oh what cruel weather her eyelids blinked either with anger or in misery they were set down a little beyond the bank and when they turned from the cabman sir purcell was warm in his offer of his arm to her for he had seen her wistfully touching what money she had in her pocket and approved her natural good breeding in allowing it to pass unmentioned now he said i must know what you want to do a quiet place there is no quiet place in this city said emilia fretfully a gentleman passing took off his hat saying with city politeness pardon me you are close to a quiet place through that door and the hall you will find a garden where you will hear london as if it sounded fifty miles off he bowed and retired and the two emilia thankful sir purcell tending to anger following his indication soon found themselves in a most perfect retreat the solitude of which they had the misfortune however of destroying for another and a scared couple here emilia said i have determined to go to italy at once mr pericles has offered to pay for me its my fathers wish andand i cannot wait and feel like a beggar i must go i shall always love englanddont fear that sir purcell smiled at the simplicity of her pleading look now i want to know where to find mr pericles she pursued and if you will come to him with me he is sure to be very angryi thought you might protect me from that but when he hears that i am really going at lastat oncehe can laugh sometimes you will see him rub his hands i must enquire where his chambers are to be found said sir purcell oh anybody in the city must know him because he is so rich emilia coughed this fog kills me pray make haste dear friend i trouble you very much but i want to get away from this i can hardly breathe i shall have no heart for my task if i dont see him soon wait for me then said sir purcell you cannot wait in a better place and i must entreat you to be careful he half alluded to the adjustment of her shawl and to anything else as far as she might choose to apprehend him her dexterity in tossing him the letter unseen by madame marini might have frightened him and given him a dread that albeit woman there was germ of wickedness in her this pained him acutely for he never forgot that she had been the means of his introduction to cornelia from whom he could not wholly dissociate her and the idea that any prospective shred of impurity hung about one who had even looked on his beloved was utter anguish to the keen sentimentalist be very careful he would have repeated but that he had a warning sense of the ludicrous and emilias large eyes when they fixed calmly on a face were not of a flighty east she stood too with the dignity of sadness as he was pleased to phrase it she must be safe here he said to himself and yet upon reflection he decided not to leave her peremptorily informing her to that effect emilia took his arm and as they were passing through the hall of entrance they met the same gentleman who had directed them to the spot of quiet both she and sir purcell heard him say to a companion there she is a deep glow covered emilias face do they know you asked sir purcell no she said and then he turned but the couple had gone on that deserves chastisement he muttered briefly telling her to wait he pursued them emilia was standing in the gateway not at all comprehending why she was alone sandra belloni struck her ear looking forward she perceived a hand and a head gesticulating from a cabwindow she sprang out into the street and instantly the hand clenched and the head glared savagely it was mr pericles himself in travelling costume i am your fool he began overbearing emilias most irritating how are you and are you quite well i am your fool hein you send me to paris to geneve i go over lago maggiore and aha it is your joke meess i juste return oh capital at milano i waiti enquiretill a letter from old belloni and i learn i am your foolof you all jomp in a gentleman is coming said emilia by no means intimidated though the forehead of mr pericles looked portentous he was bringing me to you zen jomp in cried mr pericles here sir purcell came up emilia said softly mr pericles there was the form of a bow of moderate recognition between them but other hats were off to emilia the two gentlemen who had offended sir purcell had insisted on learning the nature of their offence that they had a right to present their regrets to the lady in person and beg an excuse from her lips sir purcell stood white with a futile effort at selfcontrol as one of them preluding pardon me said i had the misfortune to remark to my friend as i passed you there she is may i indeed ask your pardon my friend is an artist i met him after i had first seen you he at least does not think foolish my recommendation to him that he should look on you at all hazards let me petition you to overlook the impertinence i think gentlemen you have now made the most of the advantage my folly in supposing you would regret or apologize fittingly for an impropriety has given you interposed sir purcell his new and superior tone for he had previously lost his temper and spoken with a silly vehemence caused them to hesitate one begged the word of pardon from emilia to cover his retreat she gave it with an air of thoroughbred repose saying i willingly pardon you and looking at them no more whereupon they vanished ten minutes later emilia and sir purcell were in the chambers of mr pericles the greek had done nothing but grin obnoxiously to every word spoken on the way drawing his hand down across his jaw to efface the hard pale wrinkles and eyeing emilias cavalier with his shrewdest suspicious look you will excusehe pointed to the confusion of the room they were in and the heap of unopened lettersi am from ze continent i do not expect ze pleasure a seat mr pericles handed chairs to his visitors it is a climate is it not he resumed emilia said a word and he snapped at her immediately adding hein ah so with a charming urbanity how lucky that we should meet you exclaimed emilia we were just coming to youto find out i mean where you were and call on you ough do not tell me lies said mr pericles clasping the hollow of his cheeks between thumb and forefinger allow me to assure you that what miss belloni has said is perfectly correct sir purcell remarked mr pericles gave a short bow it is ze same i am much obliged and you have just come from italy said emilia where you did me ze favour to send me it is true sanks oh what a difference between italy and this emilia turned her face to the mottled yellow windows many sanks repeated mr pericles after which the three continued silent for a time at last emilia said bluntly i have come to ask you to take me to italy mr pericles made no sign but sir purcell leaned forward to her with a gaze of astonishment almost of horror will you take me persisted emilia still the sullen greek refused either to look at her or to answer because i am ready to go she went on i want to go at once today if you like i am getting too old to waste an hour mr pericles uncrossed his legs ejaculating what a fog ah and that was all he rose and went to a cupboard sir purcell murmured hurriedly in emilias ear have you considered what youve been saying yes yes it is only a journey emilia replied in a like tone a journey my father wishes it your mother hush i intend to make him take the madre with me she designated mr pericles who had poured into a small liqueur glass some green chartreuse smelling strong of pines his visitors declined to eject the london fog by this aid of the mountain monks and mr pericles warmed himself alone you are wiz old belloni he called out i am not staying with my father said emilia where mr pericles shed a baleful glance on sir purcell i am staying with signor marini servente mr pericles ducked his head quite low while his hand swept the floor with an imaginary cap malice had lighted up his features and finding after the first burst of sarcasm that it was vain to indulge it toward an absent person he altered his style look he cried to emilia it is marini stops you and old bellonia conspirator aha is it for an artist to conspire and be carbonaro and kiss books and mon dieu bon it is marini plays me zis trick i mark him i mark him i say he is paid by young pole i hold zat family in my hand i say so i go to be met by you and on i go to italy i

meine herrn he was to come i leave word at paris for him at geneve at stresa to bring his daughter to ze conservatoire for which i pay she has a voiceor she had has exclaimed emilia had mr pericles repeated she has zen sing with which thunder of command mr pericles gave up his vindictive narration of the points of his injuries sustained and pitching into a chair pressed his fingers to his temples frowning attention his eyes were on the floor presently he glanced up and saw emilias chest rising quickly no voice issued it is to commence cried mr pericles hein now sing emilia laid her hand under her throat not now oh not now when you have told me what those austrians did to you i want to hear i am very anxious to hear and what they said of my father how could he have come to milan without a passport he had only a passport to paris and at paris i leave instructions for ze procuration of a passport over lombardy am i not antonio pericles agriolopoulos sing i say ah but what voices you must have heard in italy said emilia softly i am afraid to sing after them si i dare not she panted little in keeping with the cajolery of her tones but she had got mr pericles upon a theme serious to his mind not a voice not one he cried stamping his foot all is french i go twice wizin six monz and if i go to a gooseyard i hear better oh yes it is tunetatatatititito and of ze heartwhere is zat mon dieu i despair i see music go dead let me hear you sandra his enthusiasm had always affected emilia and painfully since her love had given her a consciousness of infidelity to her art but now the pathetic appeal to her took away her strength and tears rose in her eyes at the thought of his faith in her his repetition of her namethe sandra being uttered with unwonted softnessplunged her into a fit of weeping ah mr pericles shouted see what she has come to and he walked two or three paces off to turn upon her spitefully she will be vapeurs nerfs i know not when it wants a physique of a saint sandra belloni he added gravely lift up ze head sing sempre al tuo santo nome emilia checked her tears his hand being raised to beat time she could not withstand the signal semprethere came two struggling notes to which another clung shuddering like two creatures on the deeps she stopped herself oddly calling out stop stop who donc mr pericles postured an indignant interrogation i mean i must stop emilia faltered its the fog i cannot sing in this fog it chokes me apparently mr pericles was about to say something frightfully savage which was restrained by the presence of sir purcell he went to the door in answer to a knock while emilia drew breath as calmly as she might her head moving a little backward with her breathing in a sad mechanical way painful to witness sir purcell stretched his hand out to her but she did not take it she was listening to voices at the door was it really mr pole who was there quite unaware of the effect the sight of her would produce on him emilia rose and walked to the doorway she heard mr pole abusing mr pericles half banteringly for his absence while business was urgent saying that they must lay their heads together and consult otherwisea significant indication appeared to close the sentence but if youve just come off your journey and have got a lady in there we must postpone i suppose say this afternoon ill keep up to the mark if nothing happens emilia pushed the door from the hand of mr pericles and was advancing toward the old man on the landing but no sooner did the latter verify to his startled understanding that he had seen her than with an exclamation of all right goodbye he began a rapid descent of the stairs a distance below he bade mr pericles take care of her and as an excuse for his abrupt retreat the word busy sounded up does my face frighten him emilia thought it made her look on herself with a foreign eye this is a dreadful but instructive piece of contemplation acting as if the rich warm blood of self should have ceased to hug about us and we stand forth to be dissected unresistingly all emilias vital strength now seemed to vanish at the renewal of mr pericles peremptory mandate for her to sing she could neither appeal to him nor resist but raising her chest she made her best effort and then covered her face this was done less for concealment of her shamestricken features than to avoid sight of the stupefaction imprinted upon mr pericles again zat a flat he called sternly she tried it again again she did her utmost to accomplish the task if you have seen a girl in a fit of sobs elevate her head with hardshut eyelids while her nostrils convulsively take in a long breath as if for speech but it is expended in one quick vacant sigh you know how emilia looked and it requires a humane nature to pardon such an aspect in a person from whom we have expected triumphing glances and strong thrilling tones what is zis mr pericles came nearer to her he would listen to no charges against the atmosphere commanding her to give one simple run of notes a contralto octave he stood over her with keenly watchful eyes sir purcell bade him observe her distress i am much obliged mr pericles bowed she is ruined i have suspected ha but i ask for a note one this imperious signal drew her to another attempt the deplorable sound that came sent emilia sinking down with a groan basta basta so it is zis tale said mr pericles after an observation of her huddled shape did i not say his voice was so menacingly loud and harsh that sir purcell remarked this is not the time to repeat itpardon mewhatever you said ze foolshe play ze fool sir i forget ze christianah purcelli say she play ze fool and look at her why is it she comes to me now a dozen times i warn her to italy to italy all is ready you will have a place at ze conservatorio no she refuse i say go and you are a queen you are a prima at twenty and europe is beneas you no she refuse and she is ruined what i say what zat dam silly smile mean oh no i am not lazy but you area fool oh no and what are you zen and what shall you do nussing nussing nussing and dam zere is an end emilia had caught blindly at sir purcells hand by which she raised herself and then uncovering her face looked furtively at the malign furnacewhite face of mr pericles it cannot have goneshe spoke as if mentally balancing the possibility it has gone i say and you know why mademoiselle ze fool mr pericles retorted no no it cant be gone gone voices never go the reiteration of the you know why from mr pericles and all the wretchedness of loss it suggested robbed her of the little spark of nervous fire by which she felt halfreviving in courage and confidence let me try once more she appealed to him in a frenzy mr pericles though fully believing in his heart that it might only be a temporary deprivation of voice affected to scout the notion of another trial but finally extended his forefinger well now start sempre al tuo santo commence sem and mr pericles hummed the opening bar not as an unhopeful man would do the next moment he was laughing horribly emilia to make sure of the thing she dreaded forced the note and would not be denied what voice there was in her came to the summons it issued if i may so express it ragged as if it had torn through a briarhedge then there was a whimper of tones and the effect was like the lamentation of a hardlyused urchin lacking a certain music that there is in his undoubted heartfelt earnestness no single note poised firmly for the instant but swayed trembling on its neighbour to right and to left when pressed for articulate sound it went into a ghastly whisper the laughter of mr pericles was pleasing discord in comparison chapter xl emilia stretched out her hand and said goodbye seeing that the hardened girl with her dead eyelids did not appear to feel herself at his mercy and also that sir purcells forehead looked threatening mr pericles stopped his sardonic noise he went straight to the door which he opened with alacrity and mimicking very wretchedly her words of adieu stood prepared to bow her out she astonished him by passing without another word before he could point a phrase bitter enough for expression sir purcell had likewise passed and in going had given him a quietly admonishing look zose poles are beggars mr pericles roared after them over the stairs and slammed his door for emphasis almost immediately there was a knock at it mr pericles stood bent and catlike as sir purcell reappeared the latter avoiding all preliminaries demanded of the greek that he should promise not to use the names of his friends publicly in such a manner again i require a promise for the future an apology will be needless from you i shall not give it said mr pericles with a sharp lift of his upper lip but you will give me the promise i have returned for in answer mr pericles announced that he had spoken what was simply true that the prosperity of the poles was fictitious that he or any unfavourable chance could ruin them and that their friends might do better to protect their interests than by menacing one who had them in his power sir purcell merely reiterated his demand for the promise which was ultimately snarled to him whereupon he retired joy on his features for cornelia poor she might be claimed by him fearlessly that is to say without the fear of people whispering that the penniless baronet had sued for gold and without the fear of her father rejecting his suit at least he might with this knowledge that he had gained appoint to meet her now all the morning sir purcell had been combative owing to that subordinate or secondary post he occupied in a situation of some excitementwhich combativeness is one method whereby men thus placed imagining that they are acting devotedly for their friends contrive still to assert themselves he descended to the foot of the stairs where he had told emilia to wait for him full of kind feelings and ready cheerful counsels as thus nothing that we possess belongs to usall will come round rightly in the end be patient look about for amusement and improve your mind and more of this copper coinage of wisdom in the way of proverbs but emilia was nowhere visible to receive the administration of comfort outside the house the fog appeared to have swallowed her with some chagrin on her behalf partly a sense of duty unfulfilled sir purcell made his way to the residence of the marinis to report of her there if she should not have arrived the punishment he inflicted on himself in keeping his hand an hour from that letter to be written to cornelia was almost pleasing and he was rewarded by it for the projected sentences grew mellow and rich condensed and throbbed eloquently what wonder that with such a mental occupation he should pass emilia and not notice her she let him go but when he was out of sight all seemed gone the dismallylighted city wore a look of judgement terrible to see her brain was slave to her senses she fancied she had dropped into an underground kingdom among a mysterious people the anguish through which action had just hurried her now fell with a conscious weight upon her heart she stood a moment seeing her desolation stretch outwardly into endless labyrinths and then it narrowed and took hold of her as a force within changing thus almost with each breathing of her body the fog had thickened up and down the groping city went muffled men few women emilia looked for one of her sex who might have a tender face desire to be kissed and loved by a creature strange to her and to lay her head upon a womans bosom moved her to gaze around with a longing once or twice but no eyes met hers and the fancy recurred vividly that she was not in the world she had known otherwise what had robbed her of her voice she played with her fancy for comfort long after any real vitality in it had oozed out her having strength to play at fancies showed that a spark of hope was alive in truth firm of flesh as she was to believe that all worth had departed from her was impossible and when she reposed simply on her sensations very little trouble beset her only when she looked abroad did the aspect of numerous indifferent faces and the harsh flowing of the world its own way tell her she had lost her power could it be lost the prospect of her desolation grew so wide to her that she shut her eyes abandoning herself to feeling and this by degrees moved her to turn back and throw herself at the feet of mr pericles for if he said wait my child and all will come round well she was prepared blindly to think so the projection of the words in her mind made her ready to weep but as she neared the house of his office the wish to hear him speak that became passionate she counted all that depended on it and discovered the size of the fabric she had built on so thin a plank after a while her steps were mechanically swift before she reached the chambers of mr pericles she had walked she knew not why once round the little quiet enclosed citygarden and a cold memory of those men who had looked at her face gave her some wonder to be quickly kindled into fuller comprehension beholding emilia once more mr pericles enjoyed a revival of his taste for vengeance but unhappily for her he found it languid and when he had rubbed his hands stared and by sundry sharp utterances brought her to his feet his satisfaction was less poignant than he had expected as a consequence instead of speaking outrageously according to his habit in wrath he was now frigidly considerate informing emilia that it would be good for her if she were dead seeing that she was of no use whatever but as she was alive she had better go to her father and mother and learn knitting or some such industrial employment unless zat man for whom you play fool mr pericles shrugged the rest of his meaning but my voice may not be gone urged emilia i may sing to you tomorrowthis evening it must be the fog why do you think it lost it cant be cracked cried mr pericles it is not no do not think it i may stay here dont tell me to go yet the streets make me wish to die and i feel i may perhaps sing presently wait will you wait a hideous imitation of her lamentable tones burst from mr pericles cracked he cried again emilia lifted her eyes and looked at him steadily she saw the idea grow in the eyes fronting her that she had a pleasant face and she at once staked this little bit of newlyconceived worth on an immediate chance remember that she was as near despair as a creature constituted so healthily could go speaking no longer in a girlish style but with the grave pleading manner of a woman she begged mr pericles to take her to italy and have faith in the recovery of her voice he however far from being softened as he grew aware of her sweetness of feature waxed violent and insulting take me she said my voice will reward you i feel that you can cure it for zat man to go to him again mr pericles sneered i never shall do that there sprang a glitter as of steel in emilias eyes i will make myself yours for life if you like take my hand and let me swear i do not break my word i will swear that if i recover my voice to become what you expectedi will marry you whenever you ask me and then more she was saying but mr pericles sputtering a laugh of sanks presented a postured supplication for silence i am not a man who marries he plainly stated the relations that the woman whom he had distinguished by the honours of selection must hold toward him emilias cheeks did not redden but without any notion of shame at the words she listened to she felt herself falling lower and lower the more her spirit clung to mr pericles yet he alone was her visible personification of hope and she could not turn from him if he cast her off it seemed to her that her voice was condemned she stood there still and the coldeyed greek formed his opinion he was evidently undecided as regards his own course of proceeding for his chin was pressed by thumb and forefinger hard into his throat while his eyebrows were wrinkled up to their highest elevation from this attitude expressive of the accurate balancing of the claims of an internal debate he emerged into the posture of a cock crowing and emilia heard again his bitter mimicry of her miserable broken tones followed by ha dam basta basta sit here cried mr pericles he had thrown himself into a chair and pointed to his knee emilia remained where she was standing he caught at her hand but she plucked that from him mr pericles rose sounding a cynical hein dont touch me said emilia nothing exasperates certain natures so much as the effort of the visibly weak to intimidate them i shall not touch you mr pericles sneered zen why are you here i came to my friend was emilias reply your friend he is not ze friend of a couaccouac once if you please but now mr pericles shrugged now you are like ze rest of women you are game come to me he caught once more at her hand which she lifted then at her elbow will you touch me when i tell you not to there was the soft line of an involuntary frown over her white face and as he held her arm from the doubled elbow with her clenched hand aloft she appeared ready to strike a tragic blow anger and every other sentiment vanished from mr pericles in the rapturous contemplation of her admirable artistic pose mon dieu and wiz a voice he exclaimed dashing his fist in a delirium of forgetfulness against the one plastered lock of hair on his shining head little fool little dam foolzat might have beenmr pericles figured in air with his fingers to signify the exaltation she was to have attainedmon dieu and look at you did i not warn you non a vero did i not say ruin ruin if you go so for a mana voice you will not come to me zen hear you shall go to old belloni i do not want you my pretty dear woman is a trouble a drug you shall go to old belloni and crack if ze voice will come back to a whipbravo old belloni mr pericles turned to reach down his hat from a peg at the same instant emilia quitted the room dusk was deepening the yellow atmosphere and the crowd was now steadily flowing in one direction the bereaved creature went with the stream glad to be surrounded and unseen till it struck her at last that she was moving homeward she stopped with a pang of grief turned and met all those people to whom the fireside was a beacon for some time she bore against the pressure but her loneliness overwhelmed her none seemed to go her way for a refuge she turned into one of the city side streets where she was quite alone unhappily the street was of no length and she soon came to the end of it there was the choice of retracing her steps or entering a strange street and while she hesitated a troop of sheep went by that made a piteous noise she followed them thinking curiously of the something broken that appeared to be in their throats byandby the thought flashed in her that they were going to be slaughtered she held her step looking at them but without any tender movement of the heart they came to a butchers yard and went in when she had passed along a certain distance a shiver seized her and her instinct pushed her toward the lighted shops where there were pictures in one she saw the portrait of that queen of song whom she had heard at besworth two young men glancing as they walked by arm in arm pronounced the name of the great enchantress and hummed one of her triumphant airs the features expressed health humour power every fine animal faculty genius was on the forehead and the plastic mouth the forehead being well projected fair and very shapely showing clear balance as well as capacity to grasp flame and fling it the line reaching to a dimple from the upper lip was saved from scornfulness by the lovely gleam halfchallenging halfconsoling regal roguishwhat you wouldthat sat between her dark eyelashes like white sunlight on the fringed smooth roll of water by a weir such a dimple and such a gleam of eyes would have been keys to the face of a weakling and it was the more fascinating from the disregard of any minor charm notable upon this grand visage which could not suffer a betrayal you saw and there was no effort to conceal that the spirit animating it was intensely human but it was human of the highest chords of humanity indifferent to finesse and despising subtleties gifted to speak to inspire and to command all great emotions in fact it was the masque of a dramatic artist in repose tempered by beauty the robust frame showed that she possessed a royal nature and could as a foremost qualification for art feel harmoniously she might have many of the littlenesses of which women are accused for art she promised unspotted excellence and adorable as she was by attraction of her sex she was artist over all emilia found herself on one of the bridges thinking of this aspect beneath her was the stealing river with its red intervals and the fog had got a wider circle she could not disengage that face from her mind it seemed to say to her boldly i live because success is mine and to hint as with a paler voice death the fruit of failure could she emilia ever be looked on again by her friends the dread of it gave her shudders then death was certainly easy but death took no form in her imagination as it does to one seeking it she desired to forget and to hide her intolerable losses to have the impostor she felt herself to be buried as she walked along she held out her hands murmuring helpless useless it came upon her as a surprise that one like herself should be allowed to live i dont want to she said and the neat moment i wonder what a drowned woman is like she hurried back to the streets and the shops the shops failed now to give her distraction for a stiff and dripping image floated across all the windows and she was glad to see the shutters being closed though when the streets were dark some friendliness seemed to have gone when the streets were quits dark save for the row of lamps she walked fast fearing she knew not what a little italian boy sat doubled over his organ on a doorstep while a yet smaller girl at his elbow plied him with questions in english emilia stopped before them and the girl complained to her that the perverse little foreigner would not answer two or three words in his native tongue soon brought his face to view emilia sat down between them and listened to the prattle of two languages the girl said that she never had supper which was also the case with the boy so emilia felt for her purse and sent the girl with sixpence in search of a shop that sold cafes the girl came back with her apron full as they were all about to eat a policeman commanded them to quit the spot informing them that he knew both them and their dodges emilia stood up and was taking her little people away when the policeman having suddenly changed his accurate opinion of her said youre giving em some supper miss oh they must sit down to their suppers you know and walked away not to be a witness of this infraction of the law so they sat down and ate and the boy and girl tried to say intelligible things to one another and laughed emilia could not help joining in their laughter the girl was very anxious to know whether the boy was ever beaten and hearing that he was she appeared better satisfied remarking that she was also but curious still as to the different forms of chastisement they received this being partially explained she wished to know whether he would be beaten that night emilia interpreting a grin and a rapid whistle and cluck significant of the application of whips told the state of his expectations at which the girl clapped her hands adding lamentably so shall i cause i am always emilia gathered them under each shoulder when to her delight and half perplexity they closed their eyes leaning against her the policeman passed and for an hour endured this spectacle at last he felt compelled to explain to emilia what were the sentiments of gentlefolks with regard to their doorsteps apart from the law of the matter he put it to her human nature whether she would like her doorsteps to be blocked so that no one could enter and anyone emerging stood a chance of being precipitated nose foremost upon the pavement then again as gentlefolks had good experience of the young ones in london were twice as cunning as the old emilia pleaded for her sleeping pair that they might not be disturbed her voice gave the keeper of the peace notions of her being one of the eccentric young ladies who are occasionally missing and have advertizing friends he uttered a stern ahem preliminary to assent but the noise wakened the children who stared and readily obeyed his gesture which said be off while his words were those of remonstrance emilia accompanied them a little way both promised eagerly that they would be at the same place the night following and departedthe boy with laughing nods and waving of hands which the girl imitated emilias feeling of security went with them she at once feigned a destination in the distance and set forward to reach it but the continued exposure of this delusion made it difficult to renew she fell to counting the hours that were to elapse before she would meet those children saying to herself that whatever she did she must keep her engagement to be at the appointed steps this restriction set her darkly fancying that she wished for her end remembering those men who had looked at her admiringly am i worth looking at she said and it gave her some pleasure to think that she had it still in her power to destroy a thing of value she was savagely ashamed of going to death emptyhanded byandby great fatigue stiffened her limbs and she sat down from pure want of rest the luxury of rest and soothing languor kept hard thoughts away she felt as if floating for a space the fear of the streets left her but when necessity for rest had gone she clung to the luxury still and sitting bent forward with her hands about her knees she began to brood over tumbled images of a wrong done to her she had two distinct visions of herself constantly alternating and acting like the temptation of two devils one represented her despicable in feature and bade her die the other showed a fair face feeling which to be her own emilia had fits of intolerable rage this vision prevailed and this wicked side of her humanity saved her active despair is a passion that must be superseded by a passion passive despair comes later it has nothing to do with mental action and is mainly a corruption or degradation of our blood the rage in emilia was blind at first but it rose like a hawk and singled its enemy she fixed her mind to conceive the foolishness of putting out a face that her rival might envy and of destroying anything that had value the flattery of beauty came on her like a warm garment when she opened her eyes seeing what she was and where she almost smiled at the silly picture that had given her comfort those men had looked on her admiringly it was true but would wilfrid have ceased to love her if she had been beautiful an extraordinary intuition of wilfrids sentiment tormented her now she saw herself in the light that he would have seen her by till she stood with the sensations of an exposed criminal in the dark length of the street and hurried down it back as well as she could find her way to the friendly policeman her question on reaching him are you married was prodigiously astonishing and he administered the rebuff of an affirmative with severity then said emilia when you go home let me go with you to your wife perhaps she will consent to take care of me for this night the policeman coughed mildly and replied its plain you know nothing of womenbegging your pardon missfor i can see youre a lady emilia repeated her petition and the policeman explained the nature of women not to be baffled emilia said i think your wife must be a good woman hereat the policeman laughed arming that the best of them knew what bad suspicions was ultimately he consented to take her to his wife when he was relieved after the term of so many minutes emilia stood at a distance speculating on the possible choice he would make of a tune to accompany his monotonous walk to and fro and on the certainty of his wearing any tune to nothing she was in a bed sleeping heavily a little before dawn the day that followed was her day of misery the blow that had stunned her had become as a loud intrusive pulse in her head by this new daylight she fathomed the depth and reckoned the value of her loss and her senses had no pleasure in the light though there was sunshine the woman who was her hostess was kind but full of her first surprise at the strange visit and too openly ready for any information the young lady might be willing to give with regard to her condition prospects and wishes emilia gave none she took the womans hand asking permission to remain under her protection the woman byandby named a sum of money as a sum for weekly payment and emilia transferred all to her that she had the policeman and his wife thought her though reasonable a trifle insane she sat at a window for hours watching a last man of the fly species walking up and plunging down a pane of glass on this transparent solitary field for the most objectless enterprise ever undertaken he buzzed angrily at times as if he had another meaning in him which was being wilfully misinterpreted then he mounted again at his leisure to pitch backward as before emilia found herself thinking with great seriousness that it was not wonderful for boys to be always teasing and killing flies whose thin necks and bobbing heads themselves suggested the idea of decapitation she said to her hostess i dont like flies they seem never to sing but when they are bothered the woman replied ah indeed very smoothly and thought if you was to bust out now which of us two would be strongest emilia grew distantly aware that the policeman and his wife talked of her and watched her with combined observation when it was night she went to keep her appointment the girl was there but the boy came late he said he had earned only a few pence that day and would be beaten he spoke in a whimpering tone which caused the girl to desire a translation of his words emilia told her how things were with him and the girl expressed a wish that she had an organ as in that case she would be sure to earn more than sixpence a day such being the amount that procured her nightly a comfortable reception in the arms of her parents do you like music said emilia the girl replied that she liked organs but as if to avoid committing an injustice cited parrots as foremost in her affections holding them both to her breast emilia thought that she would rescue them from this beating by giving them the money they had to offer for kindness but the restlessness of the children suddenly made her a third party to the thought of cakes she had no money her heart bled for the poor little hungry apprehensive creatures for a moment she half fancied she had her voice and looked up at the windows of the pitiless houses with a bold look but there was a speedy mockery of her thought you shall listen you shall open she coughed hoarsely and then fell into fits of crying her friend the policeman came by and took her arm with a force that he meant to be persuasive so lifting her and handing her some steps beyond the limit of his beat with stern directions for her to proceed home immediately she obeyed next day she asked her hostess to lend her halfacrown the woman snapped shortly in answer no the less you have the better emilia was obliged to abandon her little people she was to this extent the creature of mania that she could not conceive of a way being open by which she might return to her father and mother or any of her friends it was to her not a matter for her will to decide upon but simply a black door shut that nothing could displace when the week for which term of shelter she had paid was ended her hostess spoke upon this point saying more to convince emilia of the necessity for seeking her friends than from any unkindness me and my husband cant go on keepin you you know my dear however wells our meaning emilia drew the woman toward her with both her lands softly shaking her head she left the house about noon it was now her belief that she had probably no more than another day to live for she was destitute of money the thought relieved her from that dreadful fear of the street and she walked at her own pace even after dark the rumble and the rattle of wheels the cries and grinding noises the hum of motion and talk all under the lingering smoky red of a london winter sunset were not discord to her animated blood her unhunted spirit made a music of them it was not like the music of other days nor was the exultation it created at all like happiness but she at least forgot herself voices came in her ear and hung unheard until long after the speaker had passed hunger did not assail her she was not beset by an animal weakness and having in her mind no image of death and with her ties to life cut awaythus devoid of apprehension or regret she was what her quick blood made her for the time she recognized that for one near extinction it was useless to love or to hate so wilfrid and lady charlotte were spared emilia thought of them both with a sort of equanimity not that any clear thought filled her brain through that delirious night the intoxicating music raged there at one level depression never rising any scale never undulating ever so little scarcely changing its barbarous monotony of notes she had no power over it her critical judgement would at another moment have shrieked at it she was moved by it as by a mechanical force the southwest wind blew and the hours of the night were not evil to outcasts emilia saw many lying about getting rest where they might she hurried her eye pityingly over little children but the devil that had seized her sprang contempt for the othersolder beggars who appeared to succumb to their fate when they should have lifted their heads up bravely on she passed from square to market market to park and presently her mind shot an arrow of desire for morning which was nothing less than hunger beginning to stir when will the shops open she tried to cheat herself by replying that she did not care when but pangs of torment became too rapid for the counterfeit her imagination raised the roof from those great rich houses and laid bare a brilliancy of dishcovers and if any sharp gust of air touched the nerve in her nostril it seemed instantaneously charged with the smell of old dinners no cried emilia i dislike anything but plain food she quickly gave way and admitted a craving for dainty morsels one lump of sugar she subsequently sighed but neither sugar nor meat approached her her seat was under trees between a man and a woman who slanted from her with hidden chins the chilly dry leaves began to waken and the sky showed its grey hunger had become as a leaden ball in emilias chest she could have eaten eagerly still but she had no ravenous images of food nevertheless she determined to beg for bread at a bakers shop coming into the empty streets again the dread of exposing her solitary wretchedness and the stains of night upon her kept her back when she did venture near the bakers shop her sensation of weariness want of washing and general misery made her feel a contrast to all other women she saw that robbed her of the necessary effrontery she preferred to hide her head the morning hours went in this conflict she was betweenwhiles hungry and desperate or stricken with shame fatigue bringing the imperious necessity for rest intervened as a relief emilia moaned at the weary length of the light but when dusk fell and she beheld flame in the lamps it seemed to be too sudden and she was alarmed passive despair had set in she felt sick though not weak and the thought of asking help had gone a street urchin of the true london species in whom excess of woollen comforter made up for any marked scantiness in the rest of his attire came trotting the pavement pouring one of the favourite tunes of his native metropolis through the tube of a pennywhistle from which it did not issue so disguised but that attentive ears might pronounce it the royal march of the cannibal islands a placarded post beside a lamp met this musicians eye and still piping he bent his knees and read the notification emilia thought of the hillford and ipley clubmen the big drum the speeches the cheers and all the wild strength that lay in her that happy morning she watched the boy piping as if he were reading from a score and her sense of humour was touched you foolish boy she said to herself softly but when having evidently come to the last printed line the boy rose and pocketed his pennywhistle emilia was nearly laughing thats because he cannot turn over the leaf she said and stood by the post till long after the boy had disappeared the slight emotion of fun had restored to her some of her lost human sensations and she looked about for a place where to indulge them undisturbed one of the bridges was in sight she yearned for the solitude of the wharf beside it and hurried to the steps to descend she had to pass a streetorgan and a small figure bent over it sei buon italiano she said the answer was a surly si emilia cried convulsively addio her brain had become on a sudden vacant of a thought and all she knew was that she descended chapter xli sei buon italiana across what chasm did the words come to her it seemed but a minutes and again many hours back that she had asked that question of a little fellow who if he had looked up and nodded would have given her great joy but who kept his face dark from her and with a sullen si extinguished her last feeling of a desire for companionship with life si she replied quite as sullenly and without looking up but when her hand was taken and other words were uttered she that had crouched there so long between death and life immovable loving neither rose possessed of a passion for the darkness and the void and struggling bitterly with the detaining hand crying for instant death no strength was in her to support the fury merthyr powys is with you said her friend and will never leave you will never take me up there emilia pointed to the noisy level above them listen and i will tell you how i have found you replied merthyr dont force me to go up she spoke from the end of her breath merthyr feared that it was more than misery even madness afflicting her he sat on the wharfbench silent till she was reassured but at his first words the eager question came you will not force me to go up there no we can stay and talk here said merthyr and this is how i have found you do you suppose you have been hidden from us all this time perhaps you fancy you do not belong to your friends well i spoke to all of your children as you used to call them do you remember the day before yesterday two had seen you you said to one from savoy or piedmont he said from savoy and you shook your head not looking on italy you said this night i roused one of them and he stretched his finger down the steps saying that you had gone down there sei buon italiano you said and that is how i have found you sei buon italiana emilia let her hand rest in merthyrs wondering to think that there should be no absolute darkness for a creature to escape into while living a trembling came on her let me look over at the water she said and merthyr who trusted her even in that extremity allowed her to lean forward and felt her grasp grow moist in his till she turned back with shudders giving him both her hands a drowned woman looks so dreadful her speech was faint as she begged to be taken away from that place merthyr put his hand to her armpit sustaining her steps as they neared the level where men were she looked behind her and realized the black terrors she had just been blindly handling fright sped her limbs for a second or two and then her whole weight hung upon merthyr he held her in both arms thinking that she had swooned but she murmured have you heard that my voice has gone if you have suffered i do not wonder he said i am useless my voice is dead useless to your friends tush my little emilia sandra mia dont you know that while you love your friends thats all they want of you oh she moaned the gaslamp hurts me what a noise there is we shall soon get away from the noise no i like it but not the light oh my feetwhy are you walking still what friends for instance myself you knew of my wandering about london it makes me believe in heaven i cant bear to think of being unseen this morning said merthyr i saw the policeman in whose house you have been staying emilia bowed her head to the mystery by which this friend was endowed to be cognizant of her actions i feel that i have not seen the streets for years if it were not for you i should fall downoh do you understand that my voice has quite gone merthyr perceived her anxiety to be that she might not betaken on doubtful terms your hand hasnt he said pressing it and so gratified her with a concrete image of something that she could still bestow upon a friend to this she clung while the noisy wheels bore her through london till her weak body failed to keep courage in her breast and she wept and came closer to merthyr he who supposed that her recent despair and present tears were for the loss of her lover gave happily more comfort than he took when old gentlemen choose to interest themselves about very young ladies he called upon his humorous philosophy to observe internally as men do to forestall the possible cynic externaland the rest of the sentence was acted under his eyes by the figures of three persons but there she was lying within his arm rescued the creature whom he had found filling his heart when lost and whom he thought one of the most hopeful of the women of earth he thanked god for bare facts she lay against him with her eyelids softly joined and as he felt the breathing of her body he marvelled to think how matteroffact they had both been on the brink of a tragedy and how naturally she had as it were argued herself up to the gates of death for want of what my sister may supply it thought merthyr oh that river is like a great black snake with a sick eye and will come round me said emilia talking as from sleep then started with fright in her face oh my hunger again hunger said he horrified it comes worse than ever she moaned i was half dead just now and didnt feel it therestheres no pain in death but thisits like fire and frost i feel being eaten up give me something merthyr set his teeth and enveloped her in a tight hug that relieved her from the sharper pangs and so held her the tears bursting through his shut eyelids till at the first hotel they reached he managed to get food for her she gave a little gasping cry when he put bread through the window of the cab bit by bit he handed her the morsels it was impossible to procure broth when they drove on she did not complain of suffering but her chest rose and fell many times heavily she threw him out in the reading of her character after a space by excusing herself for having eaten with such eagerness and it was long before he learnt what wilfrids tyrannous sentiment had done to this simple nature he understood better the fear she expressed of meeting georgiana nevertheless she exhibited none on entering the house and returned georgianas embrace with what strength was left to her chapter xlii up the centre aisle of hillford church the tinleys late as usual were seen trooping for morning service in midwinter there was a man in the rear known to be a man by the sound of his boots and measure of his stride for the ladies of brookfield having rejected the absurd pretensions of albert tinley could not permit curiosity to encounter the risk of meeting his gaze by turning their heads so with charitable condescension they returned the slight church nod of prim miss tinley passing of the detestable laura tinley of affected rose tinley whose complexion was that of a dustbin and of madeline tinley too young for a character beyond what the name bestowed and then they arranged their prayerbooks and apparently speculated as to the possible text that morning to be given forth from the pulpit but it seemed to them all that an exceedingly bulky object had passed as guardian of the lightfooted damsels preceding him though none of the ladies had looked up as he passed they were conscious of a stature and a circumference which they had deemed to be entirely beyond the reach of the tinleys and a scornful notion of the tinleys having hired a guardsman made arabella smile at the stretch of her contempt that could help her to conceive the ironic possibility relieved on the suspicion that albert was in attendance of his sisters they let their eyes fall calmly on the tinley pew could two men upon this earthly sphere possess such a bearskin there towered the shoulders of mr pericles his head looking diminished by the hugeous collar arabella felt a seizure of her hand from adelas side she placed her book open before her and stared at the pulpit from neither of the three of brookfield could lauras observation extract a sign of the utter astonishment she knew they must be experiencing and had it not been for the ingenuous broad whisper of mrs chump which sounded toward the verge even of her conception of possibilities the tinleys would not have been gratified by the first public display of the prize they had wrested from the poles mr pariclesoh went mrs chump and a great many pews were set in commotion forthwith she bent over cornelias lap and cornelia surveying her placidly had to murmur byandby byandby but did ye see m my dear and a forrner in a protestant church and such a forrner as he is to be sure and ye know ye said hed naver come with you and its them creatures ye dont like corrnelia the service commences remarked that lady standing up many eyes were on mr pericles who occasionally inspected the cornices and corbels and stained glass to right and left or detected a young lady staring at him or anticipated her going to stare and put her to confusion by a sharp turn of his head and then a sniff and smoothing down of his moustache but he did not once look at the brookfield pew by hazard his eye ranged over it and after the first performance of this trick he would have found the ladies a match for him even if he had sought to challenge their eyes they were constrained to admit that laura tinley managed him cleverly she made him hold a book and appear respectably devout she got him down in good time when seats were taken and up again without much transparent persuasion the first notes of the organ were seen to agitate the bearskin laura had difficulty to induce the man to rise for the hymn and when he had listened to the intoning of a verse mr pericles suddenly bent as if he had snapped in two nor could laura persuade him to rejoin the present posture of the congregation then only did laura to cover her failure turn the subdued light of a merry smile upon the brookfield pew the smile was noticed by apprehension sitting in the corner of one eye and it was likewise known that lauras chagrin at finding that she was not being watched affected her visibly at the termination of the sermon the ladies bowed their heads a short space and placing mrs chump in front drove her out so that her exclamations of wonderment and affectedly ostentatious gaspings of sympathy for brookfield were heard by few on they hurried straight and fast to brookfield mr pole was talking to tracy runningbrook at the gate the ladies cut short his needless apology to the young man for not being found in church that day by asking questions of tracy the first related to their brothers whereabouts the second to emilias condition tracy had no time to reply mrs chump had identified herself with brookfield so warmly that the defection of mr pericles was a fine legitimate excitement to her i hate m she cried i postively hate the man and he to go to church a pretty figure for an angelhe now but my dears we cannt let annybody else have m shorrt of his bein drowned or killed we must intrigue to keep the wretch to ourselves oh dear said adela impatiently well and i didnt say to myself ye little jealous thing retorted mrs chump indeed maam you are welcome to him and indeed miss i dont want m and perhaps ye were flirtin all the fun out of him on board the yacht and got tired of m and thats why adela said thank you with exasperating sedateness which provoked an intemperate outburst from mrs chump sunday sunday cried mr pole aint i the first to remember ut pole and didnt i get up airly so as to go to church and have my conscience quit and stead of that i come out full of evil passions all for the sake o these ungrateful garls thats always where ye cannt find em why if they was to be married at the altar theyd stare and be ffendud if ye asked them if they was thinking of their husbands they would oh dear no and yere mistaken and were thinkin o the coalscuttle in the back parlouror somethin about souls if not coals theres their answer what did ye do with mr paricles on board the yacht aha whats this about pericles said mr pole oh nothing papa returned adela nothing do ye call ut said mrs chump and mayhap good cause too didnt ye tease m now on board the yacht now did he go on board the yacht at all i should think you ought to know that as well as adela said mr pole adela interposed hurriedly all this my dear papa is because mr pericles has thought proper to visit the tinleys pew who would complain how or where he does it so long as the duty is fulfilled mr pole stared muttering the tinleys shes botherin of ye pole the puss said mrs chump certain that she had hit a weak point in that mention of the yacht ask her what sorrt of behaviour and he didnt speak to any of you said mr pole no papa he looked the other way he did us that honour ask her pole how she behaved to m on board the yacht cried mrs chump oh there was flirtin flirtin and go and see what the noble poet says of tying up in sacks and plumpin of poor bodies of women into forty fathoms by them turks and greeks all because of jealsy so they make a woman in earnest there the wretches cause she cannt have onny of her jokes didnt ye tease mr paricles on board the yacht adla now was he there martha youre a fool said mr pole looking the victim of one of his fits of agitation who knows whether he was there better than you youll be forgetting soon that weve ever dined together i hate to see a woman so absurd therenever mind go in take off bonnet somethinganything only i cant bear folly eh mr runningbrook deed pole and yere mad mrs chump crossed her hands to reply with full repose id like to know how im to know what i never said the scene was growing critical adela consulted the eyes of her sisters which plainly said that this was her peculiar scrape adela ended it by going up to mrs chump taking her by the shoulders and putting a kiss upon her forehead now you will see better she said dont you know mr pericles was not with us as surely as he was with the tinleys this morning and a nice morning it is ejaculated mr pole trotting off hurriedly does pole think mrs chump murmured with reference to her voyaging on the yacht the kiss had bewildered her sequent sensations he does think and will think and must think adela prattled some persuasive infantine nonsense her soul all the while in revolt against her sisters who left her the work to do and took the position of spectators and critics condemning an effort they had not courage to attempt by the way i have to congratulate a friend of mine said tracy selecting adela for an ironical bow then it is captain gambier cried mrs chump as if a whole revelation had burst on her adela blushed oh and what was that i heard continued the aggravating woman adela flashed her eyes round on her sisters even then they left her without aid their feeling being that she had debased the house by her familiarity with this woman before tracy stay didnt ye both mrs chump was saying yesadela passed by heronly in your ears alone you know at which hint mrs chump gleefully turned and followed her a rumour was prevalent of some misadventure to adela and the captain on board the yacht arabella saw her depart thinking how singular is her propensity to imitate me for the affirmative uttered in the tone of interrogation was quite arabellas own as also occasionally the negativethe negative however suiting the musical indifference of the sound and its implied calm breast as for pericles said tracy you need not wonder that the fellow prays in other pews than yours by heaven he may pray and pray id send him to hades with an epigram in his heart from tracy the ladies learnt that wilfrid had inflicted public chastisement upon mr pericles for saying a false thing of emilia he danced the prettiest pas seal that was ever footed by debutant on the hot iron plates of purgatory they dared not ask what it was that mr pericles had said but tracy was so vehement on the subject of his having met his deserts that they partly guessed it to bear some relation to their sexs defencelessness and they approved their brothers work sir twickenham and captain gambier dined at brookfield that day however astonishing it might be to one who knew his character and triumphs the captain was a butterfly netted and was on the highroad to an exhibition of himself pinned with his wings outspread during the service of the table tracy relieved adela from mrs chumps inadvertencies and little bits of feminine malice but he could not help the captain who blundered like a schoolboy in her rough hands it was noted that sir twickenham reserved the tolerating smile he once had for her mr poles nervous fretfulness had increased he complained in occasional underbreaths correcting himself immediately with a no no and blinking briskly but after dinner came the time when the painfullest scene was daily enacted mrs chump drank port freely to drink it fondly it was necessary that she should have another rosy wineglass to nod to and mr pole whose taste for wine had been weakened took this post as his duty the watchful pinched features of the poor pale little man bloomed unnaturally and his unintelligible eyes sparkled as he emptied his glass his daughters knew that he drank not for his pleasure but for their benefit that he might sustain martha chump in the delusion that he was a fitting bridegroom and with her money save them from ruin each evening with remorse that blotted all perception of the tragic comicality of the show they saw him in his false strength and his anxiety concerning his pulses play act this part the recurring words now martha heres the port sent a cold wave through their blood they knew what the doctor remarked on the effect of that port ill mrs chump would cry when she saw him wink after sipping you pole what do they say of ye ye deer and she returned the wink the ladies looking on not to drink a proper quantum of port when port was on the table was in mrs chumps eyes mean for a man even chump she would say was master of his bottle and thought nothing of it who does cried her present suitor and the port ebbed and his cheeks grew crimson this frightful rivalry with the ghost of alderman chump continued night after night the rapturous martha was incapable of observing that if she drank with a ghost in memory in reality she drank with nothing better than an animated puppet the nights ended with mr pole either sleeping in his armchair upon which occasions one daughter watched him and told dreadful tales of his waking or staggering to bed debating on the stairs between tea and brandy complaining of a loss of sensation at his kneecap or elbow or else rubbing his head and laughing hysterically his bride was not at such moments observant no wonder wilfrid kept out of the way if he had not better occupation elsewhere the ladies in their utter anguish after inveighing against the baneful port had begged their father to delay no more to marry the woman why said mr pole sharply what do you want me to marry her for they were obliged to keep up the delusion and said because she seems suited to you as a companion that satisfied him oh we wont be in a hurry he said and named a day within a month and not liking their unready faces laughed and dismissed the idea aloud as if he had not earnestly been entertaining it the ladies of brookfield held no more their happy energetic midnight consultations they had begun to crave for sleep and a snatch of forgetfulness the scourge being daily on their flesh and they had now no plans to discuss they had no distant horizon of low vague lights that used ever to be beyond their morrow they kissed at the bedroom door of one and separated silence was their only protection to the nice feelings now that fine shades had become impossible adela had almost made herself distinct from her sisters since the yachting expedition she had grown severely careful of the keys of her writingdesk and would sometimes slip the bolt of her bedroom door and answer eh dubiously in tone when her sisters had knocked twice and had said open once the house of brookfield showed those divisional rents which an admonitory quaking of the earth will create neither sister was satisfied with the other cornelias treatment of sir twickenham was almost openly condemned but at the same time it seemed to arabella that the baronet was receiving more than the necessary amount of consolation from the bride of captain gambier and that yacht habits and moralities had been recently imported to brookfield adela for her part looked sadly on arabella and longed to tell her as she told cornelia that if she continued to play freshfield sumner purposely against edward buxley she might lose both cornelia quietly measured accusations and judged impartially her mind being too full to bring any personal observations to bear she said perhaps less than she would have said had she not known that hourly her own nice feelings had to put up a petition for fine shades had she not known indeed that her conduct would soon demand from her sisters an absolutely merciful interpretation for she was now simply attracting sir twickenham to brookfield as a necessary medicine to her papa since mrs chumps return however mr pole had spoken cheerfully of himself and by innuendo emphasized had imparted that his mercantile prospects were brighter in fact cornelia half thought that he must have been pretending bankruptcy to gain his end in getting the consent of his daughters to receive the woman she and adela likewise began to suspect that the parental transparency was a little mysterious and that there is after all more than we see in something that we see through they were now in danger of supposing that because the old man had possibly deceived them to some extent he had deceived them altogether but was not the afterdinner scene too horribly true were not his hands moist and cold while the forehead was crimson and could a human creature feel at his own pulse and look into vacancy with that intense apprehensive look and be but an actor they could not think so but his conditions being dependent upon them the ladies felt in their hearts a spring of absolute rebellion when the call for fresh sacrifices came though they did not grasp the image they had a feeling that he was nourished bit by bit by everything they held dear and though they loved him and were generous they had begun to ask what next the ladies were at a deadlock and that the heart is the father of our histories i am led to think when i look abroad on families stagnant because of so weak a motion of the heart there are those who have none at all the mass of us are moved from the propulsion of the toes of the fates but the ladies of brookfield had hearts lively enough to get them into scrapes the getting out of them or getting on at all was left to providence they were at a deadlock for arabella flattered as she was by freshfield sumners wooing could not openly throw edward over whom indeed she thought that she liked the better of the two though his letters had not so wide an intellectual range her father was irritably anxious that she should close with edward adela could not move at least not openly cornelia might have taken an initiative but tenderness for her fathers health had hitherto restrained her and she temporized with sir twickenham on the noblest of principles she was by the devotion of her conduct enabled to excuse herself so far that she could even fish up an excuse in the shape of the effort she had made to find him entertaining as if the said effort should really be repayment enough to him for his assiduous and most futile suit one deep grief sat on cornelias mind she had heard from lady gosstre that there was something like madness in the barrett family she had consented to meet sir purcell clandestinely after debate on his claim to such a sacrifice on her part and if on those occasions her lovers tone was raised it gave her a tremour and he had of late appeared to lose his noble calm he had spoken it might almost be interpreted as if he doubted her once when she had mentioned her care for her father he had cried out upon the name of father with violence looking unlike himself his condemnation of the world too was not so christian as it had been it betrayed what the vulgar would call spite and was not all compassed in his peculiar smooth shrugexpressive of a sort of borderland between contempt and charity which had made him wear in her sight all the superiority which the former implies with a considerable share of the benign complacency of the latter this had gone he had been sarcastic even to her saying once and harshly have you a will personally she liked the poor organist better than the poor baronet though he had less merit it was unpleasant in her present mood to be told that we have come into this life to fashion for ourselves souls and that whosoever cannot decide is a soulless wretch fit but to pass into vapour he appeared to have ceased to make his generous allowances for difficult situations a senseless notion struck cornelia that with the baronetcy he had perhaps inherited some of the madness of his father the two were in a dramatic tangle of the nice feelings worth a glance as we pass on she wished to say to him you are unjust to my perplexities and he to her you fail in your dilemma through cowardice instead of uttering which they chid themselves severally for entertaining such coarse ideas of their idol doubtless they were silent from consideration for one another but i must add out of extreme tenderness for themselves likewise there are people who can keep the facts that front them absent from their contemplation by not framing them in speech and much benevolence of the passive order may be traced to a disinclination to inflict pain upon oneself my duty to my father being cited by cornelia sir purcell had to contend with it true love excludes no natural duty she said and he love discerns unerringly what is and what is not duty in the case of a father can there be any doubt she asked the answer shining in her confident aspect there are many things that fathers may demand of us he interjected bitterly she had a fatal glimpse here of the false light in which his resentment coloured the relations between fathers and children and deeming him incapable of conducting this argument she felt quite safe in her opposition up to a point where feeling stopped her devotedness to a father i must conceive to be a childs first duty she said sir purcell nodded yes a childs does not history give the higher praise to children who sacrifice themselves for their parents asked cornelia and he replied so you seek to be fortified in such matters by history courteous sneers silenced her feeling told her she was in the wrong but the beauty of her sentiment was not to be contested and therefore she thought that she might distrust feeling and she went against it somewhat at first very tentatively for it caused pain she marked a line where the light of duty should not encroach on the light of our human desires but love for a parent is not merely duty thought cornelia it is also loveand is it not the least selfish love step by step sir purcell watched the clouding of her mind with false conceits and knew it to be owing to the hearts want of vigour again and again he was tempted to lay an irreverent hand on the veil his lady walked in and make her bare to herself partly in simple bitterness he refrained but the chief reason was that he had no comfort in giving a shock to his own state of deception he would have had to open a dark closet to disentangle and bring to light what lay in an undistinguishable heap to disfigure her to herself and share in her changed eyesight possibly to be or seem coarse so he kept the door of it locked admitting sadly in his meditation that there was such a place and saying all the while if i were not poor he saw her running into the shelter of egregious sophisms till it became an effort to him to preserve his reverence for her and the sex she represented finally he imagined that he perceived an idea coming to growth in her no other than this that in duty to her father she might sacrifice herself though still loving him to whom she had given her heart thus ennobling her love for father and for lover with a wicked ingenuity he tracked her forming notions encouraged them on and provoked her enthusiasm by putting an ironical question whether the character of the soul was subdued and shaped by the endurance and the destiny of the perishable oh no no she exclaimed it cannot be or what comfort should we have few men knew better that when lovers sentiments stray away from feeling they are to be suspected of a disloyalty yet he admired the tone she took he had got an ideal of her which it was pleasanter to magnify than to distort an ideal is so arbitrary that if you only doubt of its being perfection it will vanish and never come again sir purcell refused to doubt he blamed himself for having thought it possible to doubt and this when all the time he knew through endless labyrinths of delusion these two unhappy creatures might be traced were it profitable down what a vale of little intricate follies should we be going lighted by one ghastly conclusion at times struggling from the midst of her sophisms cornelia prayed her lover would claim her openly and so nerve her to a pitch of energy that would clinch the ruinous debate forgetting that she was an idealthe accredited mistress of pure wisdom and of the power of deciding rightlyshe prayed to be dealt with as a thoughtless person and one of the herd of women she felt that sir purcell threw too much on her he expected her to go calmly to her father and to sir twickenham and tell them individually that her heart was engaged then with a stately figure to turn quit the house and lay her hand in his he made no allowance for the weakness of her sex for the difficulties surrounding her for the consideration due to sir twickenhams pride and to her fathers illhealth she halfprotested to herself that he expected from her the mechanical correctness of a machine and overlooked the fact that she was human it was a grave comment on her ambition to be an ideal so let us leave them till we come upon the ashy fruit of which this blooming sentimentalism is the seed it was past midnight when mrs chump rushed to arabellas room and her knock was heard vociferous at the door the ladies who were at work upon diaries and letters allowed her to thump and wonder whether she had come to the wrong door for a certain period after which arabella placidly unbolted her chamber and adela presented herself in the passage to know the meaning of the noise oh ye poor darlins ive heard ut all i have this commencement took the colour from their cheeks arabella invited her inside and sent adela for cornelia oh and ye poor deers cried mrs chump to arabella who remarked pray wait till my sisters come causing the woman to stare and observe if yere not as cold as the bottom of a pot that naver felt fire she repeated this to cornelia and adela as an accusation and then burst on my hearts just breakin for ye and ye shall naver want bread eh and roast beef and my last bottle of port yell share though yeve no ideea what a lot o thoughts o poor chumps under that cork and itll be a waste on you oh and that monster of a mr paricles thats got ye in his power ands goin to be the rroon of yeshame to m your fathers told me and oh my darlin garls dont think ut my fault for polepole mrs chump was choked by her grief the ladies unbending to some curiosity eliminated from her gasps and sobs that mr pole had in the solitude of his library below accused her of causing the defection of mr pericles and traced his possible ruin to it confessing that in the way of business he was at mr pericles mercy and in such a passion with me mrs chump wrung her hands what could i do to mr paricles he isnt one o the men that i can kiss and pole shouldnt wish me and pole settin down his rroon to me whatll i do my dears i do feel for ye for i feel id feel myself such a beast without money dye see its the most horrible thing in the world its like no candle in the darrk and i ye know i know id naver forgive annybody that took my money and whatll pole think of me for oh ye may call riches temptation but povertys punishment and i heard a young curate say that from the pulpit and he was lean enough to know poor fella both cornelia and arabella breathed more freely when they had heard mrs chumps tale to an end they knew perfectly well that she was blameless for the defection of mr pericles and understood from her exclamatory narrative that their father had reason to feel some grave alarm at the greeks absence from their house and had possibly reasons of his own for accusing mrs chump as he had done the ladies administered consolation to her telling her that for their part they would never blame her even consenting to be kissed by her hugged by her playfully patted complimented and again wept over they little knew what a fervour of secret devotion they created in mrs chumps bosom by this astounding magnanimity displayed to her who laboured under the charge of being the source of their ruin nor could they guess that the little hypocrisy they were practising would lead to any singular and pregnant resolution in the mind of the woman fraught with explosion to their house and that quick movement which they awaited mrs chump during the patient strain of a tender hug of arabella had mutely resolved in a great heat of gratitude that she would go to mr pericles and since he was necessary to the wellbeing of brookfield bring him back if she had to bring him back in her arms chapter xliii georgiana ford to wilfrid i have omitted replying to your first letter not because of the nature of its contents nor do i write now in answer to your second because of the permission you give me to lay it before my brother i cannot think that concealment is good save for very base persons and since you take the initiative in writing very openly i will do so likewise it is true that emilia is with me her voice is lost and she has fallen as low in spirit as one can fall and still give us hope of her recovery but that hope i have and i am confident that you will not destroy it in the summer she goes with us to italy we have consulted one doctor who did not prescribe medicine for her in the morning she reads with my brother she seems to forget whatever she reads the occupation is everything necessary just now our sharp monmouth air provokes her to walk briskly when she is out and the exercise has once or twice given colour to her cheeks yesterday being a day of clear frost we drove to a point from which we could mount the buckstone and here my brother says the view appeared to give her something of her lost animation it was a look that i had never seen and it soon went but in the evening she asked me whether i prayed before sleeping and when she retired to her bedroom i remained there with her for a time you will pardon me for refusing to let her know that you have written to your relative in the austrian service to obtain a commission for you but on the other hand i have thought it right to tell her incidentally that you will be married in the summer of this year i can only say that she listened quite calmly i beg that you will not blame yourself so vehemently by what you do her friends may learn to know that you regret the strange effect produced by certain careless words or conduct but i cannot find that selfaccusation is ever good at all in answer to your question i may add that she has repeated nothing of what she said when we were together in devon our chief desire for as we love her we may be directed by our instinct in the attempt to restore her is to make her understand that she is anything but worthless she has recently followed my brothers lead and spoken of herself but with a touch of scorn this morning while the clear frosty sky continues we were to have started for an old castle lying toward wales and i think the idea of a castle must have struck her imagination and forced some internal contrast on her mind i am repeating my brothers suggestionshe seemed more than usually impressed with an idea that she was of no value to anybody she asked why she should go anywhere and dropped into a chair begging to be allowed to stay in a darkened room my brother has some strange intuition of her state of mind she has lost any power she may have had of grasping abstract ideas in what i conceived to be play he told her that many would buy her even now she appeared to be speculating on this and then wished to know how much those persons would consider her to be worth and who they were nor did it raise a smile on her face to hear my brother mention jews and name an absolute sum of money but on the contrary after evidently thinking over it she rose up and said that she was ready to go i write fully to you telling you these things that you may see she is at any rate eager not to despair and is learning much as a child might learn it that it need not be believe me that i will in every way help to dispossess your mind of the remorse now weighing upon you as far as it shall be within my power to do so mr runningbrook has been invited by my brother to come and be her companion they have a strong affection for one another he is a true poet full of reverence for a true woman wilfrid to georgiana ford i cannot thank you enough when i think of her i am unmanned and if i let my thoughts fall back upon myself i am such as you saw me that night in devonhelpless and no very presentable figure but you do not picture her to me i cannot imagine whether her face has changed and pardon me were i writing to you alone i could have faith that the delicate insight and angelic nature of a woman would not condemn my desire to realize before my eyes the state she has fallen to i see her now under a black shroud have her features changed i cannot remember oneonly at an interval her eyes does she look into the faces of people as she used or does she stare carelessly away softly between the eyes is what i meant i meanbut my reason for this particularity is very simple i would state it to you and to no other i cannot have peace till she is restored and my prayer is that i may not haunt her to defeat your labour does her face appear to show that i am quite absent from her thoughts oh you will understand me you have seen me stand and betray no suffering when a shot at my forehead would have been mercy to you i will dare to open my heart i wish to be certain that i have not injured herthat is all perhaps i am more guilty than you think more even than i can call to mind if i may fudge by the punishment my guilt is immeasurable tell meif you will but tell me that the sacrifice of my life to her will restore her it is hers write and say this and i will come do not delay or spare me her dumb voice is like a ghost in my ears it cries to me that i have killed it be actuated by no charitable considerations in refraining to write could a miniature of her be sent you will think the request strange but i want to be sure she is not haggardnot the hospital face i fancy now which accuses me of murder does she preserve the glorious freshness she used to wear she had a lookor did you see her before the change i only want to know that she is well tracy runningbrook to wilfrid you had my promise that i would write and give your conscience a nightcap i have a splendid one for you put it on without any hesitation i find her quite comfortable powys reads italian with her in the morning his sister who might be a woman if she liked but has an insane preference for celestial neutrality does the moral inculcation the effect is comical i should like you to see cold steel leading tame fire about and imagining the taming to be her work you deserve well of your generation you just did enough to set this darling girl alight knights and squires numberless will thank you the idea of your reproaching yourself is monstrous why theres no one thanks you more than she does you stole her voice which some may think a pity but i dont seeing that i would rather have her in a salon than before the footlights imagine my glory in hershe has become half cat she moves softly as if she loved everything she touched making you throb to feel the little ball of her foot her eyes look steadily like green jewels before the veil of an egyptian temple positively her eyes have grown greenor greenish they were darkish hazel formerly and talked more of milkmaids and chattering pastorals than a discerning master would have wished take credit for the change and at least i dont blame you for the tender hollows under the eyes sloping outward just hinted loves mark on her so that mens hearts may faint to know that love is known to her and burn to read her history when she is about to speak the upper lids droop a very little or else the under lids quiver upwardi know not which take further credit for her manner she has now a manner of her own some of her naturalness has gone but she has skipped clean over the young lady stage from raw girl she has really got as much of the great manner as a woman can have who is not an ostensibly retired dowager or a matron on a pedestal shuffling the naked virtues and the decorous vices together she looks at you with an immense marvellous gravity before she replies to youenveloping you in a velvet light this is fact not fine stuff my dear fellow the light of her eyes does absolutely cling about you adieu you are a great master and know exactly when to make your bow and retire a little more and you would have spoilt her now she is perfect wilfrid to tracy runningbrook i have just come across a review of your last book and send it thinking you may wish to see it i have put a query to one of the passages which i think misquoted and there will be no necessity to call your attention to the critics english you can afford to laugh at it but i confess it puts your friends in a rage here are a set of fellows who arm themselves with whips and stand in the public thoroughfare to make any man of real genius run the gauntlet down their ranks till he comes out flayed at the other extremity what constitutes their right to be thereby the way i met sir purcell barrett the fellow who was at hillford and he would like to write an article on you that should act as a sort of rejoinder you wont mind of courseits bread to him poor devil i doubt whether i shall see you when you comeback so write a jolly lot of letters colonel pierson of the austrian army my uncle did you meet him at brookfield advises me to sell out immediately he is getting me an imperial commissioncavalry i shall give up the english service and if they want my medal they can have it and ill begin again im sick of everything except a cigar and a good volume of poems heres to light one and now for the other large eyes lit up by some imperial sin etc ten lines from tracys book are here copied neatly tracy runningbrook to wilfrid why the deuce do you write me such infernal trash about the opinions of a villanous dog who cant even en a decent sentence ive been damning you for a whitelivered austrian up and down the house let the fellow bark till he froths at the mouth and scatters the virus of the beast among his filthy friends i am maddog proof the lines you quote were written in an awful hurry coming up in the train from richford one morning you have hit upon my worst with commendable sagacity if it will put money in barrens pocket let him write i should prefer to have nothing said the chances are all in favour of his writing like a fool if youre going to be an austrian we may have a chance of shooting one another some day so heres my hand before you go and sell your soul and anything i can do in the meantimecommand me georgiana ford to wilfrid i do not dare to charge you with a breach of your pledged word let me tell you simply that emilia has become aware of your project to enter the austrian service and it has had the effect on her which i foresaw she could bear to hear of your marriage but this is too much for her and it breaks my heart to see her it is too cruel she does not betray any emotion but i can see that every principle she had gained is gone and that her bosom holds the shadows of a real despair i foresaw it and sought to guard her against it that you whom she had once called to me her lover should enlist himself as an enemy of her countryit comes to her as a fact striking her brain dumb while she questions it and the poor body has nothing to do but to ache surely you could have no object in doing this i will not suspect it mr runningbrook is acquainted with your plans i believe but he has no remembrance of having mentioned this one to emilia he distinctly assures me that he has not done so and i trust him to speak truth how can it have happened but here is the evil done i see no remedy i am not skilled in sketching the portraits you desire of her and yet if you have ever wished her to know this miserable thing it would be as well that you should see the different face that has come among us within twenty hours wilfrid to georgiana ford i will confine my reply to a simple denial of having caused this fatal intelligence to reach her ears for the truth of which i pledge my honour as a gentleman a seconds thought would have told meindeed i at once acquiesced in your viewthat she should not know it how it has happened it is vain to attempt to guess can you suppose that i desired her to hate me yet this is what the knowledge of the step i am taking will make her do if i could seeif i might see her for five minutes i should be able to explain everything and i sincerely think painful as it would be to me give her something like peace it is too late even to wish to justify myself but her i can persuade that shedo you not see that her mind is still unconvinced of myi will call it baseness is this the selfaccusing you despise a little of it must be heard if i may see her i will not fail to make her understand my position she shall see that it is i who am worthlessnot she you know the circumstances under which i last beheld herwhen i saw pang upon pang smiting her breast from my silence but now i may speak do not be prepossessed against my proposal it shall be only for five minutesno more not that it is my desire to come in truth it could not be i have felt that i alone can cure heri who did the harm mark me she will fret secretly but dear and kindest lady do not smile too critically at the tone i adopt i cannot tell how i am writing or what saying believe me that i am deeply and constantly sensible of your generosity in case you hesitate i beg you to consult mr powys georgiana ford to wilfrid i had no occasion to consult my brother to be certain that an interview between yourself and emilia should not take place there can be no object even if the five minutes of the meeting gave her happiness why the wound of the long parting should be again opened she is wretched enough now though her tenderness for us conceals it as far as possible when some heavenly light shall have penetrated her she will have a chance of peace the evil is not of a nature to be driven out by your hands if you are not going into the austrian service she shall know as much immediately otherwise be as dead to her as you may and your noblest feelings cannot be shown under any form but that wilfrid to tracy runningbrook some fellows whom i know want you to write a prologue to a play they are going to get up its about shakespeareat least the proceeds go to something of that sort do like a good fellow toss us off twenty lines why dont you write by the way i hope theres no truth in a report that has somehow reached me that they have the news down in monmouth of my deserting to the blackyellow squadrons of course such a thing as that should have been kept from them i hear too that youri suppose i must call her now yourpupil is falling into bad health think me as cold and british as you like but the thought of this does really affect me painfully upon my honour it does and now he yawns youre saying youre wrong we army men feel just as you poets do and for a longer time i think though perhaps not so acutely i send you the venus cameo which you admired pray accept it from an old friend i maynt see you again tracy runningbrook to wilfrid enclosing lines here they are it will require a man who knows something about metre to speak them had shakespeares grandmother three christian names and did she anticipate feminine posterity in her rank of life by saying habitually drat it there is as yet no society to pursue this investigation but it should be started enormous thanks for the venus i wore it this morning at breakfast just as we were rising i leaned forward to her and she jumped up with her eyes under my chin isnt she a beauty i said it was his she answered changing eyes of eagle for eyes of dove and then put out the lights i had half a mind to offer it on the spot may i that is to say if the impulse seizes me i take nobodys advice and fair venus certainly is not under my chin at this moment as to ill health great mother nature has given a house of iron to this soul of fire the windows may blaze or the windows may be extinguished but the house stands firm when you are lightning or earthquake you may have something to reproach yourself for as it is be under no alarm do not put words in my mouth that i have not uttered and now he yawns is what i shall say of you only when i am sure you have just heard a good thing you really are the best fellow of your set that i have come across and the only one pretending to brains your modesty in estimating your value as a leader of pandours will be pleasing to them who like that modesty goodbye this little emilia is a marvel of flying moods yesterday she went about as if she said ive promised apollo not to speak till tomorrow today shes in a feverish gabbleor began the day with a burst of it and now shes soft and sensible if you fancy a girl at her age being able to see that its a womans duty to herself and the world to be artisticto perfect the thing of beauty she is meant to be by natureand seeing too that love is an instrument like any other thing and that we must play on it with considerate gentleness and that tearing at it or dashing it to earth making it howl and quiver is madness and not lovei assure you she begins to see it she does see it she is going to wear a wreath of black briony preserved and set by miss ford a person cunning in these matters shes going to the ball at penarvon castle and will looksupply your favourite slang word a little more experience and she will have malice she wants nothing but that to make her consummate malice is the barb of beauty shes just at present a trifle blunt she will knock over but not transfix i am anxious to watch the effect she produces at penarvon poor little woman i paid a compliment to her eyes ive got nothing else said she dine as well as you can while you are in england german cookery is an education for the sentiment of hogs the play of sour and sweet and crowning of the whole with fat shows a people determined to go down in civilization and try the business backwards adieu curst croat on the wallachian border mayst thou gather philosophy from meditation chapter xliv dexterously as wilfrid has turned tracy to his uses by means of the foregoing correspondence in doing so he had exposed himself to the retributive poison administered by that cunning youth and now the hippogriff seized him and mounted with him into midair not as when the idle boy ganymede was caught up to act as cupbearer in celestial courts but to plunge about on yielding vapours with nothing near him save the voice of his desire the philosopher here peremptorily demands the pulpit we are subject he says to fantastic moods and shall dry readyminted phrases picture them forth as for example can the words delirium or frenzy convey an image of wilfrids state when his heart began to covet emilia again and his sentiment not only interposed no obstacle but trumpeted her charms and fawned for her and he thought her lost remembered that she had been his own and was ready to do any madness to obtain her madness is the word that hits the mark but it does not fully embrace the meaning to be in this state says the philosopher is to be on the hippogriff and to this as he explains the persons who travel to love by the road of sentiment will come if they have any stuff in them and if the one who kindles them is mighty he distinguishes being on the hippogriff from being possessed by passion passion he says is noble strength on fire and points to emilia as a representation of passion she asks for what she thinks she may have she claims what she imagines to be her own she has no shame and thus believing in she never violates nature and offends no law wild as she may seem passion does not turn on her and rend her when it is thwarted she was never carried out of the limit of her own intelligent force seeing that it directed her always with the simple mandate to seek that which belonged to her she was perfectly sane and constantly just to herself until the failure of her voice telling her that she was a beggar in the world came as a second blow and partly scared her reason constantly just to herself mind this is the quality of true passion those who make a noise and are not thus distinguishable are on hippogriff by which it is clear to me that my fantastic philosopher means to indicate the lover mounted in this wise as a creature bestriding an extraneous power the sentimentalist he says goes on accumulating images and hiving sensations till such time as if the stuff be in him they assume a form of vitality and hurry him headlong this is not passion though it amazes men and does the madder thing in fine it is hippogriff and right loath am i to continue my partnership with a fellow who will not see things on the surface and is as a necessary consequence blind to the fact that the public detest him i mean this garrulous supersubtle socalled philosopher who first set me upon the building of the three volumes it is true but whose stipulation that he should occupy so large a portion of them has made them rock topheavy to the forfeit of their stability he maintains that a story should not always flow or at least not to a given measure when we are knapsack on back he says we come to eminences where a survey of our journey past and in advance is desireable as is a distinct pause in any business here and there he points proudly to the fact that our people in this comedy move themselvesare moved from their own impulsionand that no arbitrary hand has posted them to bring about any event and heap the catastrophe in vain i tell him that he is meantime making tatters of the puppets golden robe illusion that he is sucking the blood of their warm humanity out of them he promises that when emilia is in italy he will retire altogether for there is a field of action of battles and conspiracies nerve and muscle where life fights for plain issues and he can but sum results let us he entreats be true to time and place in our fat england the gardener time is playing all sorts of delicate freaks in the lines and traceries of the flower of life and shall we not note them if we are to understand our species and mark the progress of civilization at all we must thus the philosopher our partner is our master and i submit hopefully looking for release with my emilia in the day when italy reddens the sky with the banners of a land revived i hear wilfrid singing out that he is aloft burning to rush ahead while his beast capers in one spot abominably ludicrous this trick of hippogriff is peculiar viz that when he loses all faith in himself he sinksin other words goes to excesses of absurd humility to regain it passion has likewise its panting intervals but does nothing so preposterous the wreath of black briony spoken of by tracy as the crown of emilias forehead had begun to glow with a furnacecolour in wilfrids fancy it worked a satanic distraction in him the girl sat before him swathed in a darkness with the edges of the briony leaves shining deadlyradiant aboveyoung hecate the next instant he was bleeding with pity for her aching with remorse and again stung to intense jealousy of all who might behold her amid a reserve of angry sensations at her present happiness why had she not made allowance for his miserable situation that night in devon why did she not comprehend his difficulties in relation to his fathers affairs why did she not know that he could not fail to love her for ever interrogations such as these were so many switches of the whip in the flanks of hippogriff another peculiarity of the animal gifted with wings is that around the height he soars to he can see no barriers nor any of the fences raised by men and here again he differs from passion which may tug against common sense but is never in a great nature divorced from it in air on hippogriff desires wax boundless obstacles are hidden it seemed nothing to wilfrid after several tremendous descents of humility that he should hurry for monmouth away to gaze on emilia under her fair infernal bewitching wreath nothing that he should put an arm round her nothing that he should forthwith carry her off though he died for it forming no design beyond that of setting his eyes on her he turned the head of hippogriff due westward chapter xlv penarvon castle lay over the borders of monmouthshire thither on a night of frosty moonlight troops of carriages were hurrying with the usual freightage for a country ballthe squire who will not make himself happy by seeing that his duty to the softer side of his family must be performed during the comfortable hours when bachelors snooze in armchairs and his nobler dame who not caring for port or tobacco cheerfully accepts the order of things as bequeathed to her the everlastingly halfsatisfied young man who looks forward to the hour when his cigarlight will shine and the damsel thrice demure as a cover for her eagerness within a certain distance of one of the carriages a man rode on horseback the court of the castle was reached and he turned aside lingering to see whether he could get a view of the lighted steps to effect his object he dismounted and led his horse through the gates turning from gravel to sward to keep in the dusk a very agile middleaged gentleman was the first to appear under the porticolamps and he gave his hand to a girl of fifteen and then to a most portly lady in a scarlet mantle the carriagedoor slammed and drove off while a groan issued from the silent spectator good heavens have i followed these horrible people for fiveandtwenty miles carriage after carriage rattled up to the steps was disburdened of still more horrible people to him and went the way of the others i shant see her after all he cried hoarsely and mounting said to the beast that bore him now go sharp whether you recognize the rider of hippogriff or not this is he and the poor liverystable screw stretched madly till wind failed when he was allowed to choose his pace wilfrid had come from london to have sight of emilia in the blackbriony wreath to see her himself unseen and go but he had not seen her so he had the full excuse to continue the adventure he rode into a welsh town and engaged a fresh horse for the night she wont sing at all events thought wilfrid to comfort himself before the memory that she could not in any case touched springs of weakness and pitying tenderness from an eminence to which he walked outside the town penarvon was plainly visible with all its lighted windows but i will pluck her from you he muttered in a spasm of jealousy the image of himself as an outcast against the world that held her striking him with great force at that moment i must give up the austrian commission if she takes me and be what for he had sold out of the english service and was to receive the money in a couple of days how long would the money support him it would not pay half his debts what then did this pursuit of emilia mean to blink this question he had to give the spur to hippogriff it meant upon hippogriff at a brisk gallop that he intended to live for her die for her if need be and carve out of the world all that she would require everything appears possible on hippogriff when he is going but it is a bad business to put the spur on so willing a beast when he does not go of his own willwhen he sees that there are obstructions it is best to jump off his back and we should abandon him then save that having once tasted what he can do for us we become enamoured of the habit of going keenly and defying obstacles thus do we begin to corrupt the uses of the gallant beast for he is a gallant beast though not of the first order we spoil his instincts and train him to hurry us to perdition if my sisters could see me now thought wilfrid halfsmitten with a distant notion of a singularity in his position there the mark for a frosty breeze while his eyes kept undeviating watch over penarvon after a time he went back to the inn and got among coachmen and footmen all battling lustily against the frost with weapons scientifically selected at the bar they thronged the passages and lunged hearty punches at one another drank and talked and only noticed that a gentleman was in their midst when he moved to get a light one complained that he had to drive into monmouth that night by a road that sent him five miles out of his way owing to a blocka great stone that had fallen from the hill you cant ask em to get out and walk ten steps he said or there id lead the horses and just tip up the off wheels and round the place in a twinkle pop m in again and nobody hurt but you cant ask ladies to risk catchin colds for the sake of the poor horses several coachmen spoke upon this and the shame and marvel it was that the stone had not been moved and between them the name of mr powys was mentioned with the remark that he would spare his beasts if he could whats that block youre speaking of just out of monmouth enquired wilfrid and it being described to him together with the exact bearings of the road and situation of the mass of stone he at once repeated a part of what he had heard in the form of the emphatic interrogation what there and flatly told the coachman that the stone had been moved it wasnt moved this morning then sir said the latter no but a great deal can be done in a couple of hours said wilfrid did you see em at work sir no but i came that way and the road was clear the deuce it was ejaculated the coachman willingly convinced and thats the way i shall return added wilfrid he tossed some money on the bar to aid in warming the assemblage and received numerous salutes as he passed out his heart was beating fast i shall see her in the teeth of my curst luck he thought picturing to himself the blessed spot where the mass of stone would lie and to that point he galloped concentrating all the light in his mind on this maddest of chances till it looked sound and finally certain its certain if thats not a hired coachman he calculated if he is he wont risk his fee if he isnt hell feel on the safe side anyhow at any rate its my only chance and away he flew between glimmering slopes of frost to where a white curtain of mist hung across the wooded hills of the wye chapter xlvi emilia was in skilful hands and against anything less powerful than a lover mounted upon hippogriff might have been shielded what is poison to most girls merthyr prescribed for her as medicine he nourished her fainting spirit upon vanity in silent astonishment georgiana heard him address speeches to her such as dowagers who have seen their day can alone of womankind complacently swallow he encouraged tracy runningbrook to praise the face of which she had hitherto thought shyly jewels were placed at her disposal and dresses laid out cunningly suited to her complexion she had a maid to wait on her who gabbled at the momentous hours of robing and unrobing oh miss of all the dark young ladies i ever seeemilia was the most bewitching byandby emilia was led to think of herself but with a struggle and under protest how could it be possible that she was so very nice to the eye and wilfrid had abandoned her the healthy spin of young new blood turned the wheels of her brain and then she thought perhaps i am really growing handsome the maid said artfully of her hair if gentlemen could only see it down miss its the longest and thickest and blackest i ever touched and so saying slid her fingers softly through it after the comb and thrilled the owner of that hair till soft thoughts made her bosom heave and then selflove began to be sensibly awakened followed by selfpity and some further form of what we understand as consciousness if partially a degradation of her nature this saved her mind from true despair when it began to stir after the vital shock that had brought her to earth to what purpose should i be fair was a question that did not yet come to her but it was sweet to see merthyrs eyes gather pleasure from the light of her own sweet though nothing more than coldly sweet she compared herself to her fathers old broken violin that might be mended to please the sight but would never give the tones again sometimes if hope tormented her she would strangle it by trying her voice and such a little piece of selfinflicted anguish speedily undid all merthyrs work he was patient as one who tends a flower in the spring georgiana marvelled that the most sensitive and proud of men should be striving to uproot an image from the heart of a simple girl that he might place his own there his methods almost led her to think that his estimate of human nature was falling low nevertheless she was constrained to admit that there was no diminution of his love for her and it chastened her to think so would it be the same with me if i she half framed the sentence blushing remorsefully while she denied that anything could change her great love for her brother she had caught a glimpse of wilfrids suppleness and selfishness contrasting him with merthyr she was singularly smitten with shame she knew not why the anticipation of the ball at penarvon castle had kindled very little curiosity in emilias bosom she seemed to herself a machine one of the rest and looked more to see that she was still coveted by merthyrs eyes than at the glitter of the humming saloons a touch of her old gladness made her smile when captain gambier unexpectedly appeared and walked across the dancers to sit beside her she asked him why he had come from london to which he replied with a most expressive gaze under her eyelids that he had come for one object to see me thought emilia wondering and reddening as she ceased to wonder she had thought as a child and the neat instant felt as a woman he finished merthyrs work for him emilia now thought then i must be worth something and with i am she ended her meditation glowing he might have said that she had all beauty ever showered upon woman she would have been led to believe him at that moment of her revival now lady charlotte had written to georgiana telling her that captain gambier was soon to be expected in her neighbourhood and adding that it would be as well if she looked closely after her charge when georgiana saw him go over to emilia she did not remember this warning but when she perceived the sudden brilliancy and softness in emilias face after the first words had fallen on her ears she grew alarmed knowing his reputation and executed some diversions which separated them the captain made no effort to perplex her tactics merely saying that he should call in a day or two merthyr took to himself all the credit of the visible bloom that had come upon emilia and pacing with her between the dances said now you will come to italy i think she paused before answering now and feverishly continued yes at once i will go i have almost felt my voice again tonight thats well i shall write to marini tomorrow you will soon find your voice if you will not fret for it touch italy yes but you must be near me said emilia georgiana heard this and could not conceive other than that emilia was growing to be one of those cormorant creatures who feed alike on the homage of noble and ignoble she was critical too of that very assured pose of emilias head and firm planting of her feet as the girl paraded the room after the dances in which she could not join previous to this evening georgiana had seen nothing of the sort in her but on the contrary a doubtful droop of the shoulders and an unwilling gaze as of a soul submerged in internal hesitations i earnestly trust that this is a romantic folly of merthyrs and no more thought georgiana who would have had that view concerning his love for italy likewise if recollection of her own share of adventure there had not softly interposed tracy georgiana merthyr and emilia were in the carriage well muffled up with one window open to the white mist emilia was eager to thank her friend if only for the physical relief from weariness and sluggishness which she was experiencing she knew certainly that the dim light of a recovering confidence in herself was owing all to him and burned to thank him once on the way their hands touched and he felt a shy pressure from her fingers as they parted presently the carriage stopped abruptly and listening they heard the coachman indulge his companion outside with the remark that they were a couple of fools and were now regularly dished i dont see why that observation cant go on wheels said tracy merthyr put out his head and saw the obstruction of the mass of stone across the road he alighted and together with the footman examined the place to see what the chance was of their getting the carriage past after a space of waiting georgiana clutched the wraps about her throat and head and impetuously followed her brother as her habit had always been emilia sat upright saying i must go too tracy moaned a petition to her to rest and be comfortable while the gods were propitious he checked her with his arm and tried to pacify her by giving a description of the scene the coachman remained on his seat merthyr georgiana and the footman were on the other side of the rock measuring the place to see whether by a partial ascent of the sloping rubble down which it had bowled the carriage might be got along go they have gone round see whether we can give any help said emilia to tracy who cried my goodness what help can we give this is an express situation where the fates always appear in person and move us on were sure to be moved if we show proper faith in them this is my attitude of invocation he curled his legs up on the seat resting his head on an arm but seeing emilia preparing for a jump he started up and immediately preceded her emilia looked out after him she perceived a figure coming stealthily from the bank it stopped and again advanced and now ran swiftly down she drew back her head as it approached the open door of the carriage but the next moment trembled forward and was caught with a catlike clutch upon wilfrids breast emilia my own for ever i swore to die this night it i did not see you you love me wilfrid love me come with me now now away with me your lover then you love me i love you come now i cannot move i am out in the night without you oh my lover oh wilfrid come to me my feet are dead its too late a sturdy hulloa sounding from the coachman made merthyrs ears alive when he returned he found emilia huddled up on the seat alone her face in her hands and the touch of her hands like fire he had to entreat her to descend and in helping her to alight bore her whole weight and supported her in a sad wonder while the horses were led across the rubble and the carriage was with difficulty and some confusions guided to clear its wheels of the obstructing mass emilia persisted in saying that nothing ailed her and to the coachman who could have told him something and was willing to have done so notwithstanding a gold fee for silence that stuck in his palm merthyr put no question as they were taking their seats in the carriage again georgiana said where is your wreath sandra the blackbriony wreath was no longer on her head then it wasnt a dream gasped emilia feeling at her temples georgiana at once fell into a scrutinizing coldness and when merthyr who fancied the wreath might have fallen as he was lifting emilia from the carriage proposed to go and search the place for it his sister laid her fingers on his arm remarking you will not find it dear and emilia cried oh no no it is not there and with her hands pressed hard against her bosom sat fixed and silent out of this mood she issued with looks of such tenderness that one who watched her speculating on her character as merthyr did could see that in some mysterious way she had been during the few minutes that separated them illumined upon the matter nearest her heart was it her own strength inspired by some sublime force that had sprung up suddenly to eject a worthless love so he hoped in despite of whispering reason till georgiana spoke to him chapter xlvii when the force of wilfrids embrace had died out from her body emilia conceived wilfully that she had seen an apparition so strange sudden and wild had been his coming and going but her whole body was a song to her he is not false he is true so dimly however was the he now fashioned in her brain and so like a thing of the air had he descended on her that she almost conceived the abstract idea love is true and possibly though her senses did not touch on it to shape it she had the reflection in her after all power is mine to bring him to my side almost it seemed to her that she had brought him from the grave she sat hugging herself in the carriage hating to hear words and seeing a ball of fire away in the white mist georgiana looked at her no more and when tracy remarked that he had fancied having seen a fellow running up the bank she said quietly did you robert must have seen him too added merthyr and so the interloper was dismissed on reaching home no sooner were they in the hall than emilia called for her bedroom candle in a thin querulous voice that made tracy shout with laughter and love of her quaintness emilia gave him her hand and held up her mouth to kiss georgiana but no cheek was bent forward for the salute the girl passed from among them and then merthyr said to his sister what is the matter surely merthyr you should not be at a loss she answered in a somewhat unusual tone that was half irony merthyr studied her face alone with her he said i could almost suppose that she has seen this man georgiana smiled sadly i have not seen him dear and she has not told me so you think it was so i can imagine it just possible what while we were out and had left her he must be mad not necessarily mad unless to be without principle is to be mad mad or graduating for a spanish comedie dintrigue said merthyr what on earth can he mean by it if he must see her let him come here but to dog a carriage at midnight and to prefer to act startling surprisesone cant help thinking that he delights in being a stagehero georgianas if he looks on her as a stageheroine was unheeded and he pursued she must leave england at once and stated certain arrangements that were immediately to be made you will not give up this task you have imposed on yourself she said to do what she could have answered to make this unsatisfactory creature love you but her words were to civilize this little savage merthyr was bright in a moment i dont give up till i see failure is it not possible dear to be dangerously blind urged georgiana keep to the particular case he returned and dont tempt me into your womans snare of a generalization its possible of course to be oneideaed and obstinate but i have not yet seen your savage guilty of a deceit her heart has been stirred and her heart as you may judge has force enough to be constant though none can deny that it has been roughly proved for which you like her better said georgiana herself brightening for which i like her better he replied and smiled perfectly armed oh is it because i am a woman that i do not understand this sort of friendship cried georgiana and from you merthyr to a girl such as she is me she satisfies less and less you speak of force of heart as if it were manifested in an abandonment of personal will no my darling but in the strong conception of a passion yes if she had discriminated and fixed upon a worthy object that rejoined merthyr is akin to the doctrine of justification by success you seek to foil me with sophisms said georgiana warming a womaneven a girlshould remember what is due to herself you are attracted by a passionate naturei mean men are the general instance assented merthyr then do you never reflect pursued georgiana on the composition and the elements of that sort of nature i have tried to think the best of it it seems to me still no not contemptible at allbut selfishness is the groundwork of it a brilliant selfishness i admit i see that it shows its best feature but is it the nobler for that i think and i must think that excellence is a point to be reached only by unselfishness and that usefulness is the test of excellence before there has been any trial of her asked merthyr have you not been a little too eager to put the test to her georgiana reluctantly consented to have her argument attached to a single person she is not a child merthyr ay but she should bethought one i confess i am utterly at sea georgiana sighed will you at least allow that sordid selfishness does less mischief than this passion you admire so much i will allow that she may do herself more mischief than if she had the opposite vice of avariceanything you will of that complexion and why should she be regarded as a child asked georgiana piteously because if she has outnumbered the years of a child she is no further advanced than a child owing to what she has to get rid of she is overburdened with sensations that set her head on fire her solid firm and gentle heart keeps her balanced so long as there is no one playing on it that a fool should be doing so is scarcely her fault georgiana murmured to herself he is not a fool she said i do see a certain truth in what you say dear merthyr but i have been disappointed in her i have taken her among my poor she listens to their tales without sympathy i took her into a sickroom she stood by a dying bed like a statue her remark when we came into the air was death seems easy if it were not so stifling herself always herself the centre of what she sees and feels and again she has no active desire to do good to any mortal thing a passive wish that everybody should be happy i know she has few have not she would give money if she had it but this is among the mysteries of providence to me that one no indifferent to others should be gifted with so inexplicable a power of attraction merthyr put this case to her suppose you saw any of the poor souls you wait on lying sick with fever would it be just to describe the character of one so situated as fretful ungrateful of rambling tongue poor in health and generally of loose condition of mind there again is that foreign doctrine which exults in the meanest triumphs by getting the thesis granted that we are animalonly animals georgiana burst out you argue that at this season and at that season she is helpless if she is a human creature must she not have a mind to cover those conditions and a mind merthyr took her up specially experienced armed and alert to be a safeguard to her at the most critical period of her life oh yes whether she must have it is one thing but no one can content the value of such a jewel to any young person georgiana stood silenced and knew later that she had been silenced by a fallacy for is youth the most critical period of life neither brother nor sister however were talking absolutely for the argument beneath this dialogue the current in her mind pressed to elicit some avowal of his personal feeling for the girl toward whom georgianas disposition was kindlier than her words might lead one to think he on the other hand talked with the distinct object of disguising his feelings under a tone of moderate friendship for emilia that was capable of excusing her a sensitive man of thirty odd years does not loudly proclaim his appreciation of a girl under twenty moreover merthyr wished to spare his sister he thought of questioning robert the coachman whether anyone had visited the carriage during his five minutes absence from it but merthyrs peculiar welsh delicacy kept him from doing that hard as it was to remain in doubt and endure the little poisoned shafts of a suspicion in the morning there was a letter from marini on the breakfasttable merthyr glanced down the contents his countenance flashed with a marvellous light where is she he said looking keenly for emilia emilia came in from the garden now my sandra cried merthyr waving the letter to her can you pack up to start in an hour theres work coming on for us and i shall be a boy again and not the drumstick i am in this country i have a letter from marini all lombardy is prepared to rise and this time the business will be done marini is off for genoa under the orangetrees my sandra and looking on the bay singing of italy free emilia fell back a step eyeing him with a grave expression of wonder as if she beheld another being from the one she had hitherto known the calm englishman had given place to a volcanic spirit isnt that the sketch we made he resumed the plots perfect i detest conspiracies but we must use what weapons we can and be old mole if they trample us in the earth once up we have turin to back us this i know we shall have nothing but the tedeschi to manage and if they beat us in cavalry its certain that they cant rely on their light horse the magyars would break in a charge we know that they will as for the rest soldati settentrionali come sarebbe boemi a croati we are a match for them artillery we shall get the piedmontese are mad for the signal come sit and eat the air seems dead down in this quiet country were out of the stream i must rush up to london to breathe and then we wont lose a moment we shall be in italy in four days four days my sandra and italy going to be free georgey im fasting and you will see all your old friends all good god nonot all their blood shall nerve us the austrian thinks he wastes us by slaughter with every dead man he doubles the life of the living am i talking like a foreigner sandra mia my child you dont eat and i who dreamed last night that i looked out over novara from the height of the col di colma and saw the plain under a red shadow from a huge eagle merthyr laughed swinging round his arm emilia continued staring at him as at a man transformed while georgiana asked may marinis letter be seen her visage had become firm and set in proportion as her brothers excitement increased eat my sandra eat called merthyr who was himself eating with a campaigning appetite georgiana laid down the letter folded under merthyrs fingers keeping her hand on it till he grew alive to her meaning that it should be put away marini is vague about artillery she murmured vague echoed merthyr say prudent if he said we could lay hands on fifty pieces then distrust him god grant that this be not another pit for further fruitless bloodshed was the interjection standing in georgianas eyes and then she dropped them pensively while merthyr recounted the patient schemes that had led to this hour the unuttered anxieties and the bursting hopes still emilia kept her distressfully unenthusiastic looks turned from one to the other though her italy was the theme she did not eat but had dropped one hand flat on her plate looking almost idiotic she heard of italy as of a distant place known to her in ancient years merthyrs transformation too helped some form of illusion in her brain that she was cut off from any kindred feeling with other people as soon as he had finished merthyr jumped up and coming round to emilia touched her shoulder affectionately saying now there wont be much packing to do we shall be in london tonight in time for your mother to pass the evening with you emilia rose straightway and her eyes fell vacantly on georgiana for help as far as they could express anything georgiana gave no response save a look well nigh as vacant in the interchange but you havent eaten at all said merthyr emilia shook her head no eat my sandra to please me you will need all your strength if you would be a match for georgey anywhere where theres action yes emilia traversed his words with a sudden outcry yes i will go to london i am ready to go to london now it was clear that a new light had fallen on her intelligence merthyr was satisfied to see her sit down to the table and he at once went out to issue directions for the first step in the new and momentous expedition emilia put the bread to her mouth and crumbled it on a dry lip but it was evident to georgiana hostile witness as she was that emilias mind was gradually warming to what merthyr had said and that a picture was passing before the girl she perceived also a thing that no misery of her own had yet drawn from emilia it was a tear that fell heavily on the back of her hand soon the tears came in quick succession while the girl tried to eat and bit at salted morsels it was a strange sight for georgiana this statuesque weeping that got human bit by bit till the bosom heaved long sobs and yet no turn of the head for sympathy nothing but passionless shedding of big teardrops she went to the girl and put her hand upon her kissed her and then said we have no time to lose my brother never delays when he has come to a resolve emilia tried to articulate i am ready but you have not eaten emilia made a mechanical effort to eat remember said georgiana we have a long distance to go you will want your strength you would not be a burden to him eat while i get your things ready and georgiana left her secretly elated to feel that in this expedition it was she and she alone who was merthyrs mate what storm it was and what conflict agitated the girl and stupefied her she cared not to guess now that she had the suitable designation savage confirmed in all her acts to apply to her when tracy runningbrook came down at his ordinary hour of noon to breakfast he found a twisted note from georgiana telling him that important matters had summoned merthyr to london and that they were all to be seen at lady gosstres townhouse i believe by jove powys manoeuvres to get her away from me he shouted and sat down to his breakfast and his book with a comforted mind it was not georgiana to whom he alluded but the appearance of captain gambier and the pronounced discomposure visible in the handsome face of the captain on his hearing of the departure led tracy to think that georgianas was properly deplored by another though that other was said to be engaged on revient toujours he hummed chapter xlviii three days passed as a running dream to emilia during that period she might have been hurried off to italy without uttering a remonstrance merthyrs spirited talk of the country she called her own of its heroic youth banded to rise and sworn to liberate it or die of good historic names borne by men his comrades in old campaigning adventures and stories and incidents of those past daysall given with his changed face and changed ringing voice almost moved her to plunge forgetfully into this new tumultuous stream while the picture of the beloved land lying shrouded beneath the perilous star it was about to follow grew in her mind shall i go with the army she asked georgiana no my child you will simply go to school was the cold reply to school emilia throbbed while they are fighting to the academy my brothers first thought is to further your progress in art when your artistic education is complete you will choose your own course he knows he knows that i have no voice emilia struck her lap with twisted fingers my voice is thick in my throat if i am not to march with him i cant go i will not go i want to see the fight you have why should i keep away could i run up notes even if i had any voice while he is in the cannonsmoke while he is in the cannonsmoke georgiana revolved the line thoughtfully you are aware that my brother looks forward to the recovery of your voice she said my voice is like a dead serpent in my throat rejoined emilia my voice i have forgotten music i lived for that once now i live for nothing only to take my chance everywhere with my friend i want to smell powder my father says it is like salt the taste of blood and is like wine when you smell it i have heard him shout for it i will go to italy if i may go where my friend merthyr goes but nothing can keep me shut up now my heads a wilderness when im in houses i can scarcely bear to hear this london noise without going out and walking till i drop coming to a knot in her meditation georgiana concluded that emilias heart was warming to merthyr she was speedily doubtful again these two delicate welsh natures as exacting as they were delicate were little pleased with emilias silence concerning her intercourse with wilfrid merthyr who had expressed in her defence what could be said for her was unwittingly cherishing what could be thought in her disfavour neither of them hit on the true cause which lay in georgianas coldness to her one little pressure of her hand carelessly given made merthyr better aware of the nature he was dealing with he was telling her that a further delay might keep them in london for a week and that he had sent for her mother to come to her i must see my mother she had said excitedly the extension of the period named for quitting england made it more imminent m her imagination than when it was a matter of hours i must see her i have sent for her said merthyr and then pressed emilias hand but she who without having brooded on complaints of its absence thirsted for demonstrative kindness clung to the hand drawing it doubled against her chin that is not the reason she said raising her full eyes up at him over the unrelinquished hand i love the poor madre let her come but i have no heart for her just now i have seen wilfrid she took a tighter hold of his fingers as fearing he might shrink from her merthyr hated mysteries so he said i supposed it must have been sothat night of our return from penarvon yes she murmured while she read his face for a shadow of a repulsion and my friend i cannot go to italy now merthyr immediately drew a seat beside her he perceived that there would be no access to her reason even as he was on the point of addressing it then all my care and trouble are to be thrown away he said taking the short road to her feelings she put the hand that was disengaged softly on his shoulder no not thrown away let me be what merthyr wishes me to be that is my chief prayer why then will you not do what merthyr wishes you to do emilias eyelids shut while her face still fronted him oh i will speak all out to you she cried merthyr my friend he came to kiss me once before i have only just understood it he is going to austria he came to touch me for the last time before his hand is red with my blood stop him from going i am ready to follow youi can hear of his marrying that womanoh i cannot live and think of him in that austrian white coat poor thingmy dear my dear and she turned away her head it is not unnatural that merthyr hearing these soft epithets should disbelieve in the implied selfconquest of her preceding words he had no clue to make him guess that these were simply old exclamations of hers brought to her lips by the sorrowful contrast in her mind it will be better that you should see him he said with less of his natural sincerity so soon are we corrupted by any suspicion that our egoism prompts here and she hung close to him openlipped openeyed openeared as if georgiana would think it thought merthyr her savage senses had laid the trap for this proposal and now sprung up keen for their prey here merthyr yes let me see him you will let me see him for he cannot resist me he tries he thinks he does but he cannot i can stretch out my fingeri can put it on the day when if he has galloped one way he will gallop another let him come she held up both her hands in petition half dropping her eyelids with a shadowy beauty in merthyrs present view the idea of wilfrid being in ranks opposed to him was so little provocative of intense dissatisfaction that it was out of his power to believe that emilia craved to see him simply to dissuade the man from the obnoxious step ah well see him see him if you must he said arrange it with my sister he quitted the room shrinking from the sound of her thanks and still more from the consciousness of his torment the business that detained him was to get money for marini georgiana placed her fortune at his disposal a second time there was his own which he deemed it no excess of chivalry to fling into the gulf the two sat together arranging what property should be sold and how they would share the sacrifice in common georgiana pressed him to dispose of a little estate belonging to her that money might immediately be raised they talked as they sat over the fire toward the dusk of the winter evening you would not have refused me once merthyr when you were a child and i hardly better than a boy now its different let mine go first georgey you may have a husband who will not look on these things as we do how can i love a husband was all she said and merthyr took her in his arms his gaiety had gone we cant go dancing into a pit of this sort he sighed partly to baffle the scrutiny he apprehended in her silence the garrison at milan is doubled and i hear they are marching troops through tyrol some alerte has been given and probably some traitors exist one wouldnt like to be shot like a dog you havent forgotten poor tarani i heard yesterday of the girl who calls herself his widow they were betrothed and she is exclaimed georgiana well theres a case of a man who had two lovesa woman and his country and both true to him and is he so singular merthyr no my best my sweetest my hearts rest no they exchanged tender smiles taranis bridebeloved you can listen to such mattersshe has undertaken her task who imposed it i confess i faint at the thought of things so sad and shameful but i dare not sit in judgement on a people suffering as they are outrage upon outrage they have endured and that deadensor rather makes their heroism unscrupulous taranis bride is one of the few fair girls of italy we have a lock of her hair she shore it close the morning her lover was shot and wore the thin white skullcap you remember until it was whispered to her that her beauty must serve i have the lock now in my desk said georgiana beginning to tremble do you wish to look at it yes fetch it my darling he sat eyeing the firelight till she returned and then taking the long golden lock in his handy he squeezed it full of bitter memories and sorrowfulness giulietta breathed his sister i would put my life on the truth of that womans love well yes she abandons herself to the commandant of the citadel a low outcry burst from georgiana she fell at merthyrs knees sobbing violently he let her sob in the end she struggled to speak oh can it be permitted oh can we not save her oh poor soul my sister is she blind to her lover in heaven georgianas face was dyed with shame we must put these things by said merthyr go to emilia presently and tell hersettle with her as you think fitting how she shall see this wilfrid pole i have promised her she shall have her wish coloured by the emotion she was burning from these words smote georgiana with a mournful compassion for merthyr he had risen and by that she knew that nothing could be said to alter his will a sentimental pair likewise if you please but these were sentimentalists who served an active deity and not that arbitrary protection of a subtle selfishness which rules the fairer portion of our fat england chapter xlix my brother tells me it is your wish to see mr wilfrid pole emilias yes came faintly in answer to georgianas cold accents have you considered what you are doing in expressing such a desire another yes was heard from under an uplifted heada culprit affirmative whereat the just take fire be honest emilia seek counsel and guidance tonight as you have done before with me and profited i think if i write to bid him come what will it mean nothing more breathed emilia to himfor in his way he seems to care for you fitfullyit will meanstop hear me the words you speak will have no part of the meaning even if you restrain your tongue to him it will imply that his power over you is unaltered i suppose that the task of making you perceive the effect it really will have on you is hopeless i have seen him and i know said emilia in a corresponding tone you saw him that night of our return from penarvon judge of him by that he would not spare you to gratify i know not what wildness in his nature he did not hesitate to open your old wound and to what purpose a freak of passion he could not help it i told him he would come and he came this possibly you call love do you not emilia was about to utter a plain affirmative but it was checked the novelty of the idea of its not being love arrested her imagination if he comes to you here resumed georgiana he must come cried emilia my brother has sanctioned it so his coming or not will rest with him if he comes let me know the good that you think will result from an interview ah you have not weighed that question do soor you give no heed to it in any ease try to look into your own breast you were not born to live unworthily you can be or will be if you follow your better star selfdenying and noble do you not love your country judge of this love by that your love if you have this power over him is merely a madness to him and hiswhat has it done for you if he comes and this begins again there will be a similar if not the same destiny for you emilia panted in her reply no it will not begin again she threw out both arms shaking her head it cannot i know what am i now it is what i was that he loves he will not know what i am till he sees me and i know that i have done things that he cannot forgive you have forgiven it and merthyr because he is my friend but i am sure wilfrid will not he might pardon the poor me but not his emilia i shall have to tell him what i did so and she came closer to georgiana there is some pain for me in seeing him georgiana was not proof against this simplicity of speech backed by a little dying dimple which seemed a continuation of the plain sadness of emilias tone she said my poor child almost fondly and then emilia looked in her face murmuring you sometimes doubt me not your truth but the accuracy of your perceptions and your knowledge of your real designs you are certainly deceiving yourself at this instant in the first place the relation of that madnessno poor child not wickednessbut if you tell it to him it is a wilful and unnecessary selfabasement if he is to be your husband unburden your heart at once otherwise why why you are but working up a scene provoking needless excesses you are storing misery in retrospect or wretchedness to be endured had you the habit of prayer by degrees it will give you the thirst for purity and that makes you a fountain of prayer in whom these blind deceits cannot hide georgiana paused emphatically as when by our unrolling out of our ideas we have more thoroughly convinced ourselves you pray to heaven said emilia and then faltered and blushed i must be loved she cried will you not put your arms round me georgiana drew her to her bosom bidding her continue emilia lay whispering under her chin you pray and you wish to be seen as you are do you not you do well if you knew what love is you would see it is the same you wish him to see and know you you wish to be sure that he loves nothing but exactly you it must be yourself you are jealous of his loving an idea of you that is not you you think he will wake up and find his mistake or you think that kiss was not intended for me not for me as i am those are tortures her discipline had transformed her when she could utter such sentiments as these feeling her shudder and not knowing how imagination forestalls experience in passionate blood georgiana said you speak like one who has undergone them but now at least you have thrown off the mask you love him still this man and with as little strength of will do you not see impiety in the comparison you have made oh what i see is that i wish i could say to him look on me for i need not be ashamedi am like miss ford the young ladys cheeks took fire and the clear path of speech becoming confused in her head she said miss ford georgiana said emilia and feeling that her friends cold manner had melted georgey my beloved my darling in italy where will we go i envy no woman but you who have seen my dear ones fight you and i and merthyr nothing but austrian shot shall part us and so we make up a pretty dream interjected georgiana the austrian shot i think will be fired by one who is now in the austrian service or who will soon be wilfrid emilia called out no that is what i am going to stop why did i not tell you so at first but i never know what i say or do when i am with you and everything seems chance i want to see him to prevent him from doing that i can why should you asked georgiana and one to whom the faces of the two had been displayed at that moment would have pronounced them a hostile couple why should i prevent him emilia doled out the question slowly and gave herself no further thought of replying to it apparently georgiana understood the significance of this odd silence she was perhaps touched by it she said you feel that you have a power over him you wish to exercise it never mind wherefore if you doif you try and succeedif by the aid of this love presupposed to exist you win him to what you require of himdo you honestly think the love is then immediately to be dropped emilia meditated she caught up her voice hastily i think so yes i hope so i mean it to be with a noble lover emilia not with a selfish one in showing him the belief you have in your power over him you betray that he has power over you and it is to no object his family his position his prospectsall tell you that he cannot marry you if he would and he is besides engaged let her suffer emilias eyes flashed ah and georgiana thought have i come upon your nature at last however it might be emilia was determined to show it she took my lover from me and i say let her suffer i would not hurt her myselfi would not lay my finger on her but she has eyes like blue stones and such a mouthi think the austrian executioner has one like it if she suffers and goes all dark as i did she will show a better face let her keep my lover he is not mine but he was and she took him from me that woman cannot feed on him as i did i know she has no hunger for love he will look at those blue bits of ice and think of me i told him so did i not tell him that in devon i saw her eyelids move as fast as i spoke i think i look on winter when i see her lips poor wretched wilfrid emilia halfsobbed this exclamation out i dont wish to hurt either of them she added with a smile of such abrupt opposition to her words that georgiana was in perplexity a lady who has assumed the office of lecturer will in such a frame of mind lecture on if merely to vindicate to herself her own preconceptions georgiana laid her finger severely upon wilfrids manifest faults and in fine she spoke a great deal of the common sense that the situation demanded nevertheless emilia held to her scheme but in the meantime georgiana had seen more clearly into the girls heart and she had been won also by a natural gracefulness that she now perceived in her and which led her to think is merthyr again to show me that he never errs in his judgement an unaccountable movement of tenderness to emilia made her drop a few kisses on her forehead emilia shut her eyes waiting for more then she looked up and said have you felt this love for me very long at which the puny flame scarce visible sprang up and warmed to a great heat my own emilia sandra listen to me promise me not to seek this interview will you always love me as much emilia bargained yes yes i never vary it is my love for you that begs you emilia fell into a chair and propped her head behind both hands tapping the floor briskly with her feet georgiana watched the conflict going on to decide it promptly she said and not only shall i love you thrice as well but my brother merthyr whom you call your friendhe willhe cannot love you better but he will feel you to be worthy the best love he can give there is a heart you simple girl he loves you and has never shown any of the pain your conduct has given him when i say he loves you i tell you his one weaknessthe only one i have discovered and judge whether he has shown want of selfcontrol while you were dying for another did he attempt to thwart you no to strengthen you and never once to turn your attention to himself that is love now think of what anguish you have made him pass through and think whether you have ever witnessed an alteration of kindness in his face toward you even now when he had the hope that you were cured of your foolish fruitless affection for a man who merely played with you and cannot give up the habit even now he hides what he feels so far emilia let her speak without interruption but gradually awakening to the meaning of the words for me she cried yes for you the same sort of love as wilfrid feels by no means the same sort but the love of man for woman and he saw me when i was that wretched heap and he knows everything and loves me he has never kissed me does that miserable test georgiana was asking pardon pardon said emilia penitently i know that is almost nothing now i am not a child i spoke from a sudden feeling for if he loves me how oh merthyr what a little creature i seem i cannot understand it i lose a brother and he was such a certainty to me what did he lovewhat did he love that night he found me on the pier i looked like a creature picked off a mudbank i felt like a worm and miserably abandoned i was a shameful sight oh how can i look on merthyrs face again in these interjections georgiana did not observe the proper humility and abject gratitude of a young person who had heard that she was selected by a prince of the earth a sort of eastern handmaid prostration with joined hands and above all things a closed mouth the lady desired she half regretted the revelation she had made and to be sure at once that she had reaped some practical good she said i need scarce ask you whether you have come to a right decision upon that other question to see wilfrid said emilia she appeared to pause musingly and then turned to georgiana showing happy features yes i shall see him i must see him let him know he is to come immediately that is your decision yes after what i have told you oh yes yes write the letter georgiana chid at an internal wrath that struggled to win her lips promise me simply that what i have told you of my brother you will consider yourself bound to keep secret you will not speak of it to others nor to him emilia gave the promise but with the thought to himwill not he speak of it so then i am to write this letter said georgiana do do at once emilia put on her sweetest look to plead for it decidedly the wisest of men are fools in this matter georgianas reflection swam upon her anger and dearest my georgey emilia insisted on being blunt to the outward indications to which she was commonly so sensitive and reflective my georgey let me be alone this evening in my bedroom the little madre comes andand i havent the habit of being respectful to her and i must be alone do not send up for me whoever wishes it georgiana could not stop her tongue not if mr wilfrid pole oh he i will see him said emilia and georgiana went from her straightway chapter l emilia remained locked up with her mother all that evening the good little shrill woman tendereyed and slatternly had to help try on dresses and run about for pins and express her critical taste in undertones believing all the while that her daughter had given up music to go mad with vanity the reflection struck her notwithstanding that it was a wiser thing for one of her sex to make friends among rich people than to marry a foreign husband the girl looked a brilliant woman in a superb venetian dress of purple velvet which she called the branciani dress and once attired in it and the rich purges and swelling creases over the shoulders puffed out to her satisfaction and the run of yellow braid about it properly inspected and flattened she would not return to her more homely wear though very soon her mother began to whimper and say that she had lost her so long and now that she had found her it hardly seemed the same child emilia would listen to no entreaties to put away her sumptuous robe she silenced her mother with a stamp of her foot and then sighed ah why do i always feel such a tyrant with you kissing her this dress she said and held up her mothers chin fondlingly between her two hands this dress was designed by my friend merthyrthat is mr powysfrom what he remembered of a dress worn by countess branciani of venice he had it made to give to me it came from paris countess branciani was one of his dearest friends i feel that i am twice as much his friend with this on me mother it seems like a deep blush all over me i feel as if i looked out of a rose she spread her hands to express the flower magnified oh what silly talk said her mother it does turn your head this dress does i wish it would give me my voice mother my father has no hope i wish he would send me news to make me happy about him or come and run his finger up the strings for hours as he used to i have fancied i heard him at times and i had a longing to follow the notes and felt sure of my semitones he wont see me mother he would think something of me if he saw me now her mothers lamentations reached that vocal pitch at last which emilia could not endure and the little lady was despatched to her home under charge of a servant emilia feasted on the lookingglass when alone had merthyr in restoring her to health given her an overdose of the poison countess branciani made the austrian governor her slave she uttered planting one foot upon a stool to lend herself height he told her who were suspected and who would be imprisoned and gave her all the state secrets beauty can do more than music i wonder whether merthyr loved her he loves me emilia was smitten with a fear that he would speak of it when she next saw him oh i hope he will be just the same as he has been she sighed and with much melancholy shook her head at her fair reflection and began to undress it had not struck her with surprise that two men should be loving her until standing away from the purple folds she seemed to grow smaller and smaller as a firelog robbed of its flame and felt insufficient and weak this was a new sensation she depended no more on her own vital sincerity it was in her nature doubtless to crave constantly for approval but in the service of personal beauty instead of divine art she found herself utterly unwound without it victim of a sense of most uncomfortable hollowness she was glad to extinguish the candle and be covered up dark in the circle of her warmth then her young blood sang to her again an hour before breakfast every morning she read with merthyr now this morning how was she to appear to him there would be no reading of course how could he think of teaching one to whom he trembled emilia trusted that she might see no change in him and above all that he would not speak of his love for her nevertheless she put on her robe of conquest having first rejected with distaste a plainer garb she went down the stairs slowly merthyr was in the library awaiting her you are late he said eyeing the dress as a thing apart from her and remarking that it was hardly suited for morning wear yellow if you must have a strong colour and you wouldnt exhibit the schwartzgelb of the tedeschi willingly but now this was the signal for the reading to commence wilfrid would not have been so cold to me thought emilia turning the leaves of ariosto as a book of ashes not a word of love appeared to be in his mind this she did not regret but she thirsted for the assuring look his eyes were quietly friendly so friendly was he that he blamed her for inattention and took her once to task about a melodious accent in which she vulgarized the vowels all the flattery of the branciani dress could not keep emilia from her feeling of smallness was it possible that he loved her she watched him as eagerly as her shyness would permit any shadow of a change was spied for getting no softness from him or superadded kindness no shadow of a change in that direction she stumbled in her reading purposely to draw down rebuke her construing was villanously bad he told her so and she replied i dont like poetry but seeing him exchange ariosto for roman history she murmured i like dante merthyr plunged her remorselessly into the second punic war but there was worse to follow she was informed that after breakfast she would be called upon to repeat the principal facts she had been reading of emilia groaned audibly take the book said merthyr its so heavy she complained heavy i mean to carry about if you want to carry it about the boy shall follow you with it she understood that she was being laughed at languor coupled with the consciousness of ridicule overwhelmed her i feel i cant learn she said feel that you must was replied to her no dont take any more trouble with me yes i expect you to distinguish scipio from cicero and not make the mistake of the other evening when you were talking to mrs cameron emilia left him abashed to dread shrewdly their meeting within five minutes at the breakfasttable to dread eating under his eyes with doubts of the character of her acts generally she was indeed his humble scholar though she seemed so full of weariness and revolt he however when alone looked fixedly at the door through which she had passed and said she loves that man still similar ages similar tastes i suppose she is dressed to be ready for him she cant learn she can do nothing my work maynt be lost but its lost for me merthyr did not know that georgiana had betrayed him but in no case would he have given emilia the signs she expected in the first place because he had selfcommand and secondly because of those years he counted in advance of her so she had the full mystery of his loving her to think over without a spot of the weakness to fasten on georgianas first sight of emilia in her branciani dress shut her heart against the girl with iron clasps she took occasion to remark we need not expect visitors so very early but the offender was impervious breakfast finished the reading with merthyr recommenced when emilia having got over her surprise at the sameness of things this day acquitted herself better and even declaimed the verses musically seeing him look pleased she spoke them out sonorously merthyr applauded upon which emilia said with odd abruptness and solemnity will he come today it was beyond merthyrs power of selfcontrol to consent to be taken into a consultation on this matter and he attempted to put it aside he may or he may notprobably tomorrow no today in the afternoon said emilia be near me i have engagements some word say that will seem to be you with me some flattery or you wont remember it yes i like flattery well you look like countess branciani when after thinking her husband the basest of men she discovered him to be the noblest emilia blushed thats not easily forgotten but she must have looked braver bolder not so under a burden as i feel the comparison was meant to suit the moment of your reciting yes said emilia halfmournfully then myself doesnt sit on my shoulders i dont even care what i am that is what art does for you only by fits and starts now once i never thought of myself there was a knock at the streetdoor and she changed countenance presently there came a gentle tap at their own door it is that woman said emilia i fancy it must be lady charlotte you will not see her merthyr was anticipating a negative but emilia said let her come in she gave her hand to the lady and was the less concerned of the two lady charlotte turned away from her briskly georgey didnt say anything of you in her letter merthyr i am going up to her but i wished to satisfy myself that you were in town firstto save halfaminute you see i anticipate the philosophic manly sneer is it really true that you are going to mix yourself up in this mad italian business again now that youre a man my dear merthyr it seems almost inexcuseablefor a sensible englishman lady charlotte laughed giving him her hand at the same time dont you know i swore an oath merthyr caught up her tone yes but you never succeed i complain that you never succeed of what use on earth are all your efforts if you never succeed emilias voice burst out piacemi almen che i miei sospir sien quali spera l tevero e l arno e l po merthyr continued the ode acting a similar fervour ben provvide natura al nostro stato quando dell alpi schermo pose fra noi e la tedesca rabbis we are merely bondsmen to the reestablishment of the provisions of nature and we know we shall succeed said emilia permitting her antagonism to pass forth in irritable emphasis lady charlotte quickly left them to run up to georgiana she was not long in the house emilia hung near merthyr all day and she was near him when the knock was heard which she could suppose to be wilfrids as it proved wilfrid was ushered in to georgiana delicacy had prevented merthyr from taking special notice to emilia of lady charlottes visit and he treated wilfrids similarly saying georgey will send down word only dont leave me till she does emilia rejoined her agitation laid her open to be misinterpreted it was increased when she saw him take a book and sit in the armchair between two lighted candles calmly careless of her she did not actually define to herself that he should feel jealously but his indifference was one extreme which provoked her instinct to imagine a necessity for the other word came from georgiana and emilia moved to the door remember we dine halfanhour earlier today on account of the cameron party was all that he uttered emilia made an effort to go she felt herself as a ship sailing into perilous waters without compass why did he not speak tenderly before georgiana had revealed his love for her she had been strong to see wilfrid now the idea smote her softened heart that wilfrids passion might engulf her if she had no word of sustainment from merthyr she turned and flung herself at his feet murmuring say something to me merthyr divined this emotion to be a sort of foresight of remorse on her part he clasped the interwoven fingers of her hands letting his eyes dwell upon hers the marvel of their not wavering or softening meaningly kept her speechless she rose with a strength not her own not comforted and no longer speculating it was as if she had been eyeing a golden door shut fast that might some day open but was in itself precious to behold she arose with deep humbleness which awakened new ideas of the nature of worth in her bosom she felt herself so low before this man who would not be played upon as an obsequious instrumentwho would not leap into ardour for her beauty before that man upstairs how would she feel the question did not come to her she entered the room where he was without a blush her step was firm and her face expressed a quiet gladness georgiana stayed through the first commonplaces then they were alone chapter li commonplaces continued to be wilfrids refuge for sentiment was surging mightily within him the commonplaces concerning father sisters health weather sickened him when uttered so much that for a time he was unobservant of emilias ready exchange of them to a compliment on her appearance she said you like this dress i will tell you the history of it i call it the branciani dress mr powys designed it for me the countess branciani was his friend she used always to dress in this colour just in this style she also was dark and she imagined that her husband favoured the austrians she believed he was an austrian spy it was impossible for her not to hate him her husband quoth wilfrid the unexpected richness that had come upon her beauty and the coolness of her prattle at such an interview amazed and mortified him she supposed him to be an austrian spy still he was her husband emilia gave her features a moments play but she had not full command of them and the spark of scorn they emitted was very slight ah his tone had fallen into a depth how i thank you for the honour you have done me in desiring to see me once before you leave england i know that i have not merited it more he said on this theme blaming himself emphatically until startled by the commonplaces he was uttering he stopped short and the stopping was effective if the speech was not where was the tongue of his passion he almost asked it of himself where was hippogriff he who had burned to see her he saw her now fair as a vision and yet in the flesh why was he as good as tonguetied in her presence when he had such fires to pour forth presuming that he has not previously explained it the philosopher here observes that hippogriff the foal of fiery circumstance out of sentiment must be subject to strong sentimental friction before he is capable of a flight his appetites must fast long in the very eye of provocation ere he shall be eloquent let him the philosopher repeat at the same time that souls harmonious to nature of whom there are few do not mount this animal those who have true passion are not at the mercy of hippogriffotherwise surexcited sentiment you will mark in them constantly a reverence for the laws of their being and a natural obedience to common sense they are subject to storm as in everything earthly and they need no lesson of devotion but they never move to an object in a madness now this is good teaching it is indeed my philosophers objecthis purposeto work out this distinction and all i wish is that it were good for my market what the philosopher means is to plant in the readers path a staring contrast between my pet emilia and his puppet wilfrid it would be very commendable and serviceable if a novel were what he thinks it but all attestation favours the critical dictum that a novel is to give us copious sugar and no cane i myself as a reader consider concomitant cane an adulteration of the qualities of sugar my philosophers error is to deem the sugar born of the cane inseparable from it the which is naturally resented and away flies my book back at the heads of the librarians hitting me behind them a far more grievous blow such is the construction of my story however that to entirely deny the philosopher the privilege he stipulated for when with his assistance i conceived it would render our performance unintelligible to that acute and honourable minority which consents to be thwacked with aphorisms and sentences and a fantastic delivery of the verities while my play goes on i must permit him to come forward occasionally we are indeed in a sort of partnership and it is useless for me to tell him that he is not popular and destroys my chance chapter lii dont blame yourself my wilfrid emilia spoke thus full of pity for him and in her adorable deepfluted tones after the effective stop he had come to the my wilfrid made the owner of the name quiver with satisfaction he breathed you have forgiven me that i have and there was indeed no blame my voice has gone yes but i do not think it your fault it was it is groaned wilfrid but has your voice gone he leaned nearer to her drawing largely on the claim his incredulity had to inspect her sweet features accurately you speak just asmore deliciously than ever i cant think you have lost it ah forgive me forgive me emilia was about to put her hand over to him but the prompt impulse was checked by a simultaneous feminine warning within she smiled saying i forgive seems such a strange thing for me to say and to convey any further meaning that might comfort him better than words could do she held on her smile the smile was of the acceptedly feigned conventional character a polished surface belonging to the passage of the discourse and not to the emotions wilfrids swelling passion slipped on it sensitively he discerned an ease in its formation and disappearance that shot a first doubt through him whether he really maintained his empire in her heart if he did not reign there why had she sent for him he attributed the unheated smile to a defect in her manner that was always chargeable with something as he remembered he began systematically to account for his acts but the man was so constituted that as he laid them out for pardon he himself condemned them most and looking back at his weakness and double play he broke through his phrases to cry without premeditation can you have loved me then emilias cheeks tingled dont speak of that night in devon she replied ah sighed he i did not mean then then you must have hated me no for what did i say i said that you would come to menothing more i hated that woman you oh no you loved me then did i not offer to work for you if you were poor andi cant remember what i said please do not speak of that night emilia as a man of honour i was bound she lifted her hands oh be silent and let that night die i may speak of that night when you drove home from penarvon castle and a robber you have forgotten him perhaps what did he steal not what he came for but something dearer to him than anything he possesses how can i say dear to me if it were dipped in my hearts blood emilia was far from being carried away by the recollection of the scene but remembering what her emotion had then been she wondered at her coolness now i may speak of wilming weir he insinuated her bosom rose softly and heavily as if throwing off some cloak of enchantment that clogged her spirit i was telling you of this dress she said i mean of countess branciani she thought her husband was the austrian spy who had betrayed them and she said he is not worthy to live everybody knew that she had loved him i have seen his portrait and hers i never saw faces that looked so fond of life she had that italian beauty which is to any other like the difference between velvet and silk oh do i require to be told the difference wilfrids heart throbbed she pursued emilia she loved him still i believe but her country was her religion there was known to be a great conspiracy and no one knew the leader of it all true italians trusted countess branciani though she visited the austrian governors housea general with some name on the teeth one night she said to him you have a spy who betrays you the general never suspected countess branciani women are devils of cleverness sometimes but he did suspect it must be her husbandthinking i suppose how otherwise would she have known he was my spy he gave count branciani secret work and high pay then he set a watch on him count branciani was to find out who was this unknown leader he said to the austrian governor you shall know him in ten days this was repeated to countess branciani and she said to herself my husband you shall perish though i should have to stab you myself emilias sympathetic hand twitched wilfrids seized it but it proved no soft melting prize she begged to be allowed to continue he entreated her to thereat she pulled gently for her hand and persisting it was grudgingly let go one night countess branciani put the austrians on her husbands track he knew that she was true to her country and had no fear of her whether she touched the blackyellow gold or not but he did not confide any of his projects to her and his reason was that as she went to the governors she might accidentally by a word or a sign show that she was an accomplice in the conspiracy he wished to save her from a suspicion brave branciani emilia had a little shudder of excitement only she added why will men always think women are so weak the count worked with conspirators who were not dreaming they would do anything but were plotting to do it the countess belonged to the other partymen who never thought they were strong enough to see their ideas actingi mean not bold enough to take their chance as if we die more than one death and the blood we spill for italy is ever wasted that night the austrian spy followed the count to the meetinghouse of the conspirators it was thought quite natural that the count should go there but the spy not having the password crouched outside and heard from two that came out muttering the next appointment for a meeting this was told to countess branciani and in the meantime she heard from the austrian governor that her husband had given in names of the conspirators she determined at once now may christ and the virgin help me emilia struck her knees while tears started through her shut eyelids the exclamation must have been caught from her father who liked not the priests of his native land well enough to interfere between his english wife and their child in such a matter as religious training what happened said wilfrid vainly seeking for personal application in this narrative listenah she fought with her tears and said as they rolled down her face for a miserable thing one can not help i find i must cry this is what she did she told him she knew of the conspiracy and asked permission to join it swearing that she was true to italy he said he believed heroh heavenand for some time she had to beg and beg but to spare her he would not let her join i cannot tell whyhe gave her the password for the neat meeting and said that an old gold coin must be shown she must have coaxed it though he was a strong man who could resist women i suppose he felt that he had been unkindwere i queen of italy he should stand for ever in a statue of goldthe next appointed night a spy entered among the conspirators with the password and the coin did i tell you the countess had one childa girl she lives now and i am to know her she is like her mother that little girl was playing down the stairs with her nurse when a band of austrian soldiers entered the hall underneath and an officer with his sword drawn and some men came marching up in their stiff waythe machines this officer stooped to her and before the nurse could stop her made her say where her father was those austrians make children betray their parents they dont think how we grow up to detest them do i hate is not the word it burns so hot and steady with me the countess came out on the first landing she saw what was happening when her husband was led out she asked permission to embrace him the officer consented but she had to say to him move back and then with her lips to her husbands cheek betray no more of them she whispered count branciani started now he understood what she had done and why she had done it ask for the charge that makes me a prisoner he said her husbands noble face gave her a chill of alarm the austrian spoke he is accused of being the chief of the sequin club and then the countess looked at her husband she sank at his feet my heart breaks wilfrid wilfrid you will not wear that uniform say never never you will not go to the austrian armywilfrid would you be my enemy brutes kneedeep in blood with bloody fingers ogres would you be one of them to see me turn my head shivering with loathing as you pass this is why i sent for you because i loved you to entreat you wilfrid from my soul not to blacken the dear happy days when i knew you will you hear me that woman is changeing youdoing all this resist her think of me in this one thing promise it and i will go at once and want no more i will swear never to trouble you oh wilfrid its not so much our being enemies but what you become i think of if i say to myself he also who was once my loveroh paid murderer of my dear people emilia threw up both hands to her eyes but wilfrid all on fire with a word made one of her hands his own repeating eagerly once once once she echoed him once my love said he not nowdoes it mean not now my darlingpardon me i must say it my beloved you said he who was once my loveryou said that what does it mean not thatnot does it mean alls over why did you bring me here you know i must love you forever speak once once emilia was breathing quick but her voice was well contained yes i said once you were then till that night in devon let it be but you love me still we wont speak of it i see you cannot forgive good heavens i think i remember your saying so onceonce yes then you said it then during our once when i little thought you would be merciless to mewho loved you from the first the very first i love you now i wake up in the night thinking i hear your voice you haunt me cruel coldwho guards you and watches over you but the man you now hate you sit there as if you could make yourself stone when you pleased did i not chastise that man pericles publicly because he spoke a single lie of you and by that act i have made an enemy to our house who may crush us in ruin do i regret it no i would do any madness waste all my blood for you die for you emilias fingers received a final twist and were dropped loose she let them hang looking sadly downward melancholy is the most irritating reply to passion and wilfrids heart waged fierce at the sight of her grown beautifulgrown elegantand to reject him when after a silence which his pride would not suffer him to break she spoke to ask what mr pericles had said of her he was enraged forgot himself and answered something disgraceful deep colour came on emilia you struck him wilfrid it was a small punishment for his infamous lie and whatever might be the consequences i would do it again wilfrid i have heard what he has said madame marini has told me i wish you had not struck him i cannot think of him apart from the days when i had my voice i cannot bear to think of your having hurt him he was not to blame that is he did not say it was not untrue she took a breath to make this last statement and continued with the same peculiar implicity of distinctness which a terrific thunder of what from wilfrid did not overbear i was quite mad that day i went to him i think in my despair i spoke things that may have led him to fancy the truth of what he has said on my honour i do not know and i cannot remember what happened after for the week i wandered alone about london mr powys found me on a wharf by the river at night a groan burst from wilfrid emilias instinct had divined the antidote that this would be to the poison of revived love in him and she felt secure though he had again taken her hand but it was she who nursed a mere sentiment now while passion sprang in him and she was not prepared for the delirium with which he enveloped her she listened to his raving senselessly beginning to think herself lost her tortured hands were kissed her eyes gazed into he interpreted her stupefaction as contrition her silence as delicacy her changeing of colour as flying hues of shame the partial coldness at their meeting he attributed to the burden on her mind and muttering in a magnanimous sublimity that he forgave her he claimed her mouth with force dont touch me cried emilia showing terror are you not mine you must not kiss me wilfrid loosened her waist and became in a minute outwardly most cool and courteous my successor may object i am bound to consider him pardon me once the wretched insult and silly emphasis passed harmlessly from her but a word had led her thoughts to merthyrs face and what is meant by the phrase keeping oneself pure stood clearly in emilias mind she had not winced and therefore wilfrid judged that his shot had missed because there was no mark with his eye upon her sideways showing its circle wide as a parrots he asked her one of those questions that lovers sometimes permit between themselves has another it is here as it was uttered eyespeech finished the sentence rapidly a train of thought was started in emilia and she came to this conclusion aloud then i love nobody for she had never kissed merthyr or wished for his kiss you do not said wilfrid after a silence you are generous in being candid a pressure of intensest sorrow bowed his head the real feeling in him stole to emilia like a subtle flame oh what can i do for you she cried nothing if you do not love me he was replying mournfully when yes yes rushed to his lips marry me marry me tomorrow you have loved me i am never to leave you can you forget the night when you said it emilia marry me and you will love me again you must this man whoever he isah why am i such a brute come be mine let me call you my own darling emiliaor say quietly you have nothing to hope for i shall not reproach you believe me he looked resigned the abrupt transition had drawn her eyes to his she faltered i cannot be married and then how could i guess that you felt in this way who told me that i should said he your words have come true you predicted that i should fly from that woman as you called her and come to you see here it is exactly as you willed it youyou are changed you throw your magic on me and then you are satisfied and turn elsewhere emilias conscience smote her with a verification of this charge and she trembled halfintoxicated for the moment by the aspect of her power this filled her likewise with a dangerous pity for its victim and now putting out both hands to him her chin and shoulders raised entreatingly she begged the victim to spare her any word of marriage but you go you run away from mei dont know where you are or what you are doing said wilfrid and you leave me to that woman she loves the austrians as you know there i will ask nothingonly this i will promise if i quit the queens service for good not to wear the white uniform oh emilia breathed inward deeply scarce noticing the if that followed nodding quick assent to the stipulation before she heard the nature of it it was that she should continue in england your word said wilfrid and she pledged it and did not think she was granting much in the prospect of what she gained you will then said he yes i will on your honour these reiterated questions were simply pretexts for steps nearer to the answering lips and i may see you he went on yes wherever you are staying and sometimes alone alone not if you do not know that i am to be respected said emilia huddled in the passionate fold of his arms he released her instantly and was departing wounded but his heart counselled wiser proceedings to know that you are in england breathing the same air with me near me is enough since we are to meet on those terms let it be so let me only see you till some lucky shot puts me out of your way this some lucky shot which is commonly pointed at themselves by the sentimental lovers with the object of hitting the very centre of the hearts of obdurate damsels glanced off emilias which was beginning to throb with a comprehension of all that was involved in the word she had given i have your promise he repeated and she bent her head not he resumed taking jealousy to counsel now that he had advanced a step not that i would detain you against your will i cant expect to make such a figure at the end of the piece as your count brancianiwho by the way served his friends oddly however well he may have served his country his friends she frowned did he not betray the conspirators he handed in names now and then oh she cried you understand us no better than an austrian he handed in namesyes he was obliged to lull suspicion two or three of the least implicated volunteered to be betrayed by him they went and confessed and put the government on a wrong track count branciani made a dish of traitorsnot true mento satisfy the austrian ogre no one knew the head of the plot till that night of the spy do you not seehe weeded the conspiracy poor fellow wilfrid answered with a contracted mouth i pity him for being cut off from his handsome wife i pity her for having to live said emilia and so their duett dropped to a finish he liked her phrase better than his own and being denied any privileges and feeling stupefied by a position which both enticed and stung him he remarked that he presumed he must not detain her any longer whereupon she gave him her hand he clutched the ready hand reproachfully goodbye said she you are the first to say it he complained will you write to that austrian colonel your cousin to say never never tomorrow wilfrid while you are in england i shall stay be sure of that she bade him give her love to all brookfield once you had none to give but what i let you take back for the purpose he said farewell i shall see the harp tonight it stands in the old place i will not have it moved or touched till you ah how kind you were wilfrid and how lovely you are there was no struggle to preserve the backs of her fingers from his lips and as this time his phrase was not palpably obscured by the one it countered artistic sentiment permitted him to go chapter liii a minute after his parting with emilia wilfrid swung round in the street and walked back at great strides what a fool i was not to see that she was acting indifference he cried let me have two seconds with her but how that was to be contrived his diplomatic brain refused to say and what a stiff formal fellow i was all the time he considered that he had not uttered a sentence in any way pointed to touch her heart she must think i am still determined to marry that woman wilfrid had taken his stand on the opposite side of the street and beheld a male figure in the dusk that went up to the house and then stood back scanning the windows wounded by his audacious irreverence toward the walls behind which his beloved was sheltered wilfrid crossed and stared at the intruder it proved to be braintop how do you do sirno that cant be the house stammered braintop with a very earnest scrutiny what house what do you want enquired wilfrid jenkinson was the name that won the honour of rescuing braintop from this dilemma no it is lady gosstres house miss belloni is living there and stop you know her just wait and take in two or three words from me and notice particularly how she is looking and the dress she wears you can saysay that mrs chump sent you to enquire after miss bellonis health wilfrid tore a leaf from his pocketbook and wrote i can be free tomorrow one word i shall expect it with your name in full but even in the red heat of passion his born diplomacy withheld his own signature it was not difficult to override braintops scruples about presenting himself and wilfrid paced a sentinel measure awaiting the reply free tomorrow he repeated with a glance at his watch under a lamp and thus he soliloquized what a time that fellow is yes i can be free tomorrow if i will i wonder what the deuce gambier had to do in monmouthshire if he has been playing with my sisters reputation he shall have short shrift that fellow braintop sees her nowmy little emilia my bird she wont have changed her dress till she has dined if she changes it before she goes outby jove if she wears it tonight before all those people thatll mean goodbye to me addio caro as those olive women say with their damned cold languor when they have given you up shes not one of them good god she came into the room looking like a little empress ill swear her hand trembled when i went though my sisters shall see her in that dress she must have a clever ladys maid to have done that knot to her back hair shes getting as full of art as any of themoh lovely little darling and when she smiles and holds out her hand what is itwhat is it about her her upper lip isnt perfectly cut theres some fault with her nose but i never saw such a mouth or such a face free tomorrow good god shell think i mean im free to take a walk at this view of the ghastly shortcoming of his letter as regards distinctness and the prosaic misinterpretation it was open to wilfrid called his inventive wits to aid and ran swiftly to the end of the street he had becomeas like unto a lunatic as resemblance can approach identity commanding the length of the pavement for an instant to be sure that no braintop was in sight he ran down a lateral street but the stationers shop he was in search of beamed nowhere visible for him and he returned at the same pace to experience despair at the thought that he might have missed braintop issuing forth for whom he scoured the immediate neighbourhood and overhauled not a few quiet gentlemen of all ages an envelope that was the object of his desire and for that he wooed a damsel passing jauntily with a jug in her hand first telling her that he knew her name was mary at which singular piece of divination she betrayed much natural astonishment but a fine round silver coin and an urgent request for an envelope told her as plainly as a blank confession that this was a lover she informed him that she lived three streets off where there were shops well then said wilfrid bring me the envelope here and youll have another opportunity of looking down the area think of yourself replied she saucily but proved a diligent messenger then wilfrid wrote on a fresh slip when i said free i meant free in heart and without a single chain to keep me from you from any moment that you please i am free this is written in the dark he closed the envelope and wrote emilias name and the address as black as his pencil could achieve it and with a smart doubleknock he deposited the missive in the box from his station opposite he guessed the instant when it was taken out and from that judged when she would be reading it or perhaps she would not read it till she was alone that must be her bedroom he said looking for a light in one of the upper windows but the voice of a fellow who went by with i should keep that to myself if i was you warned him to be more discreet well here i am i cant leave the street quoth wilfrid to the stock of philosophy at his disposal he burned with rage to think of how he might be exhibiting himself before powys and his sister it was halfpast nine when a carriage drove up to the door into this mr powys presently handed georgiana and emilia braintop followed the ladies and then the coachman received his instructions and drove away forthwith wilfrid started in pursuit he calculated that if his wind held till he could jump into a light cab his legitimate prey braintop might be caught for they cant be taking him to any party with them he chose to think and it was a fair calculation that they were simply conducting braintop part of his way home the run was pretty swift wilfrids blood was fired by the pace until forgetting the traitor braintop up rose truth from the bottom of the well in him and he felt that his sole desire was to see emilia once morebut once that night running hard in the midst of obstacles and with eye and mind fined on one object disasters befell him he knocked apples off a stall and heard vehement hallooing behind he came into collision with a gentleman of middle age courting digestion as he walked from his trusty dinner at home to his rubber at the club finally he rushed full tilt against a potboy who was bringing all his pots broadside to the flow of the street by jove is this what they drink he gasped and dabbed with his handkerchief at the beersplashes breathlessly hailing the lookedfor cab and with hot brow and straightenedout forefinger telling the driver to keep that carriage in sight the potboy had to be satisfied on his masters account and then on his own and away shot wilfrid wet with beer from throat to kneeto his chief protesting sense nothing but an exhalation of beer is this what they drink he groaned thinking lamentably of the tastes of the populace all idea of going near emilia was now abandoned an outward application of beer quenched his frenzy she seemed as an unattainable star seen from the depths of foul pits stop he cried from the window here we are sir said the cabman the carriage had drawn up and a footmans alarum awakened one of the houses the wretched cabman had likewise drawn up right under the windows of the carriage wilfrid could have pulled the trigger of a pistol at his forehead that moment he saw that miss ford had recognized him and he at once bowed elegantly she dropped the window and said you are in evening dress i think we will take you in with us wilfrid hoped eagerly he might be allowed to hand them to the door and made three skips across the mire emilia had her hands gathered away from the chances of seizure in wild rage he began protesting that he could not possibly enter when georgiana said i wish to speak to you and put feminine pressure upon him he was almost on the verge of the word beer by way of despairing explanation when the door closed behind him permit me to say a word to your recent companion he is my fathers clerk i had to see him on urgent business that is why i took this liberty he said and retreated braintop was still there quietly posted performing upon his head with a pocket hairbrush wilfrid put braintops back to the light and said is my shirt soiled after a short inspection braintop pronounced that it was just a little do you smell anything said wilfrid and hung with frightful suspense on the verdict a fellow upset beer on me it is beer sniffed braintop what on earth shall i do was the rejoinder and wilfrid tried to remember whether he had felt any sacred joy in touching emilias dress as they went up the steps to the door braintop fumbled in the breastpocket of his coat i happen to have he said rather shamefacedly what is it mrs chump gave it to me today she always makes me accept something i cant refuse its thisthe remains of some scent she insisted on my taking in a bottle wilfrid plucked at the stopper with a reckless desperation saturated his handkerchief and worked at his breast as if he were driving a lusty dagger into it what scent is it he asked hurriedly aldermans bouquet sir of all the detestable wilfrid had no time for more owing to fresh arrivals he hastened in with his smiling wary face half trusting that there might after all be purification in aldermans bouquet and promising heaven due gratitude if emilias senses discerned not the curse on him in the hall a gust from the great opening contention between aldermans bouquet and bad beer stifled his sickly hope frantic but under perfect selfcommand outwardly he glanced to right and left for the suggestion of a means of escape they were seven steps up the stairs before his wits prompted him to say to georgiana i have just heard very serious news from home i fear whator pardon me does it call you away she asked and emilia gave him a steady look i fear i cannot remain here will you excuse me his face spoke plainly now of mental torture repressed georgiana put her hand out in full sympathy and emilia said in her deep whisper let me hear tomorrow then they bowed wilfrid was in the street again thank god ive seen her was his first thought overhearing what did she think of me as he sighed with relief at his escape for lo the branciani dress was not on her shoulders and therefore he might imagine what he pleasedthat she had arrayed herself so during the day to delight his eyes or that he having seen her in it she had determined none others should though feeling utterly humiliated he was yet happy driving to the station he perceived starlight overhead and blessed it while his hand waved busily to conduct a current of fresh oblivious air to his nostrils the quiet heavens seemed all crowding to look down on the quiet circle of the firs where emilias harp had first been heard by him and they took her music charming his blood with imagined harmonies as he looked up to them thus all the way to brookfield his fancy soared plucked at from below by aldermans bouquet the philosopher up to this point rigidly excluded rushes forward to the footlights to explain in a note that wilfrid thus setting a perfume to contend with a stench instead of wasting for time change of raiment and the broad lusty airs of heaven to blow him fresh again symbolizes the vice of sentimentalism and what it is always doing enough chapter liv let me hear tomorrow wilfrid repeated emilias petition in the tone she had used and sent a delight through his veins even with that clumsy effort of imitation he walked from the railway to brookfield through the circle of firs thinking of some serious tale of home to invent for her ears tomorrow whatever it was he was able to conclude itbut alls right now he noticed that the dwarf pine under whose spreading head his darling sat when he saw her first had been cut down its absence gave him an ominous chill the first sight that saluted him as the door opened was a pile of mrs chumps boxes he listened and her voice resounded from the library gainsfords eye expressed a discretion significant that there had been an explosion in the house i shant have to invent much said wilfrid to himself bitterly there was a momentary appearance of adela at the librarydoor and over her shoulder came an outcry from mrs chump arabella then spoke mr pole and cornelia following with a word to which mrs chump responded shrilly ye shant talk to m none of ye till ive had the bloom of his ear now a confused hubbub of english and irish ensued the ladies drew their brother into the library doubtless you have seen a favourite sketch of the imaginative youthful artist who delights to portray scenes on a raft amid the tossing waters where sweet and satiny ladies in a pardonable abandonment to the exigencies of the occasion are exhibiting the full energy and activity of creatures that existed before sentiment was born the ladies of brookfield had almost as utterly cast off their garb of lofty reserve and inscrutable superiority they were begging mrs chump to be for pitys sake silent they were arguing with the woman they were remonstratingto such an extent as this in reply to an infamous outburst no no indeed mrs chump indeed they rose as she rose and stood about her motioning a beseeching emphasis with their hands not visible for one second was the intense indignation at their fate which wilfrid spying keenly into them perceived this taught him that the occasion was as grave as could be in spite of the oily words his father threw from time to time abruptly on the tumult he guessed what had happened briefly mrs chump aided by braintop her squire had at last hunted mr pericles down and the wrathful greek had called her a beggar with devilish malice he had reproached her for speculating in such and such bonds and sending ventures to this and that hemisphere laughing infernally as he watched her growing amazement yere jokin mr paricles she tried to say and think but the very naming of poverty had given her shivers she told him how she had come to him because of mr poles reproach which accused her of causing the rupture mr pericles twisted the waxy points of his moustache i shall advise you go home he said go to a lawyer say i will see my affairs how zey stand ze man will find pole is ruined it may bei do not knowpole has left a little of your money yes maam it may be the end of the interview saw mrs chump flying past mr pericles to where braintop stood awaiting her with a meditative speculation on that official promotion which in his attention to the lady he anticipated it need scarcely be remarked that he was astonished to receive a scentbottle on the spot as the only reward his meritorious service was probably destined ever to meet with breathless in her panic mrs chump assured him she was a howling beggar and the smell of a scent was like a crool blow to her above all the smell of aldermans bouquet which chumptelln a lie ye know mr braintop said was after him and i smelln at t over n irelanda raw garl i wasi just thought m a prince the little sly fella and oh im a beggar i am with which she shouted in the street and put braintop to such confusion that he hailed a cab recklessly declaring to her she had no time to lose if she wished to catch the train mrs chump requested the cabman that as a man possessed of a feeling heart for the interests of a helpless woman he would drive fast and at the station disputed his charge on the ground of the knowledge already imparted to him of her precarious financial state in this frame of mind she fell upon brookfield and there was clamour in the house wilfrid arrived two hours after mrs chump for that space the ladies had been saying over and over again empty words to pacify her the task now devolved on their brother mr pole though he had betrayed nothing under the excitement of the sudden shock had lost the proper control of his mask wilfrid commenced by fixedly listening to mrs chump until for the third time her breath had gone then taking on a smile he said perhaps you are aware that mr pericles has a particular reason for animosity tome weve disagreed together thats all i suppose its the habit of those fellows to attack a whole family where one member of it offends them as soon as the meaning of this was made clear to mrs chump she caught it to her bosom for comfort and finding it gave less than at the moment she required she flung it away altogether and then moaned a suppliant for it once more the only thing if you are in a state of alarm about my fathers affairs is for him to show you by his books that his house is firm said wilfrid now that he had so far helped to eject suspicion from her mind will pole do ut ejaculated mrs chump half off her seat of course i willof course of course havent i told you so said mr pole blinking mightily from his armchair over the fire sit down martha oh but howll i understand ye pole she cried ill do my best to assist in explaining wilfrid condescended to say the ladies were touched when mrs chump replied with something of a curtsey ill thank ye vary much sir she added immediately mr wilfrud as if correcting the sir for sounding cold it was so trustful and simple that it threw alight on the woman under which they had not yet beheld her compassion began to stir in their bosoms and with it an inexplicable sense of shame which soon threw any power of compassion into the background they dared not ask themselves whether it was true that their father had risked the poor things money in some desperate stake what hopeful force was left to them they devoted to her property and adela determined to pray that night for its safe preservation the secret feeling in the hearts of the ladies was that in putting them on their trial with poverty celestial powers would never at the same time think it necessary to add disgrace consequently and as a defence against the darker dread they now for the first time fully believed that monetary ruin had befallen their father they were civil to mrs chump and forgiving toward her brogue and her naked outcries of complaint and suddenlysuggested panic but their pity save when some odd turn in her conduct moved them was reserved dutifully for their father his wretched sensations at the pouring of a storm of tears from the exhausted creature caused arabella to rise and say to mrs chump kindly now let me take you to bed but such a novel mark of tender civility caused the woman to exclaim oh dear if ye dont sound like wheedlin to keep me blind even this was borne with come it will do you good to rest said arabella and howll i sleep by shutting my eyepeepsas i used to tell my old nurse said adela and mrs chump accustomed to an occasional though not public bit of wheedling from her was partially reassured ill sit with you till you do sleep said arabella suppose mrs chump moaned suppose im too poor aver to repay ye if im a bankrupoh arabella smiled whatever i may do is certainly not done for a remuneration and such a service as this at least you need not speak of mrs chumps evident surprise and doubt of the honesty of the change in her manner caused arabella very acutely to feel its dishonesty she looked at cornelia with envy the latter lady was leaning meditatively her arm on a side of her chair like a pensive queen with a ready mild embracing look for the company posture seemed always to triumph over action before quitting the room mrs chump asked mr pole whether he would be up early the next morning very earlyyou beat me if you can said he aware that the question was put as a test to his sincerity oh dear suppose its onnly a false alarrm of the bomunable mr paricleswhich annybodyd have listened toye know that said mrs chump going forth she stopped in the doorway and turned her head round sniffing in a very pronounced way oh its you she flashed on wilfrid its you my dear that smell so like poor chump oh if were not rooned wont we dine together just give me a kiss please the smell of yes comfortin wilfrid bent his cheek forward affecting to laugh though the subject was tragic to him oh perhaps ill sleep and not look in the mornin like that beastly tallow mr paricles says i spent such a lot of money on speculatorwhew i hate utand hemp too memartha chump do i want to hang myself and burn forty thousand pounds worth o candles round my corpse danglin there now there now is that sense and whatd pole want to buy me all that grease for and whered i keep ut ill ask ye and sure they wouldnt make me a bankrup on such a pretence as that for wheres the judge thats got the heart having apparently satisfied her reason with these interrogations mrs chump departed shaking her head at wilfrid ye smile so nice ye do by the way cornelia and adela then rose and wilfrid was left alone with his father it was natural that he should expect the moment for entire confidence between them to have come he crossed his legs leaning over the fireplace and waited the old man perceived him and made certain humming sounds as of preparation wilfrid was half tempted to think he wanted assistance and signified attention upon which mr pole became immediately absorbed in profound thought singular it is you know he said at last with a candid air people who know nothing about business have the oddest ideasno common sense in em after that he fell dead silent wilfrid knew that it would be hard for him to speak to encourage him he said you mean mrs chump sir oh silly womanabsurd no i mean all of you every man jack as marthad say you seem to thinkbut well there lets go to bed to bed cried wilfrid frowning why when its two or three oclock in the morning whats an old fellow to do my feet are cold and im queer in the backcant talk light my candle young gentlemanmy candle there dont you see it and you look none of the freshest a nap on your pillowll do you no harm i wanted to talk to you a little sir said wilfrid about as much perplexed as he was irritated now no talk of bankers books tonight rejoined his father i cant and wont no cheques written tween night and morning thats positive there theres two fingers shall have three tomorrow morninga pen in em perhaps with which wretched pleasantry the little merchant nodded to his son and snatching up his candle trotted to the door by the way give a look round my room upstairs to see all right when youre going to turn in yourself he said before disappearing the two fingers given him by his father to shake at parting had told wilfrid more than the words and yet how small were these troubles around him compared with what he himself was suffering he looked forward to the bittersweet hour verging upon dawn when he should be writing to emilia things to melt the vilest obduracy the excitement which had greeted him on his arrival at brookfield was to be thanked for its having made him partially forget his humiliation he had of course sufficient rational feeling to be chagrined by calamity but his dominant passion sucked sustaining juices from every passing event in obedience to his fathers request wilfrid went presently into the old mans bedroom to see that all was right the curtains of the bed were drawn close and the fire in the grate burnt steadily calm sleep seemed to fill the chamber wilfrid was retiring with a revived anger at his fathers want of natural confidence in him or cowardly secresy his name was called and he stopped short yes sir he said doors shut shut fast the voice buried in curtains came after a struggle youve done this wilfrid now dont answeri cant stand talk and you must undo it pericles can if he likes thats enough for you to know he can he wont see me you know why if he breaks with meits a common case in any businessim were involved together then followed a deep sigh the usual crisp brisk way of his speaking was resumed in hollow tones you must stop it now dont answer go to pericles tomorrow you must nothing wrong if you go at once but sir good heaven interposed wilfrid horrified by the thought of the penance here indicated the bed shook violently if not was uttered with a sort of muted vehemence theres another thing you can do go to the undertakers and order coffins for us all theregood night the bed shook again wilfrid stood eyeing the mysterious hangings as if some dark oracle had spoken from behind them in fear of irritating the old man and almost as much in fear of bringing on himself a revelation of the frightful crisis that could only be averted by his apologizing personally to the man he had struck wilfrid stole from the room chapter lv there is a man among our actors here who may not be known to you it had become the habit of sir purcell barrens mind to behold himself as under a peculiarly malign shadow very young men do the same if they are much afflicted but this is because they are still boys enough to have the natural sense to be ashamed of illluck even when they lack courage to struggle against it the reproaching of providence by a man of full growth comes to some extent from his meanness and chiefly from his pride he remembers that the old gods selected great heroes whom to persecute and it is his compensation for material losses to conceive himself a distinguished mark for the powers of air one who wraps himself in this delusion may have great qualities he cannot be of a very contemptible nature and in this place we will discriminate more closely than to call him fool had sir purcell sunk or bent under the thong that pursued him he might after a little healthy moaning have gone along as others do who knowsthough a much persecuted man he might have become so degraded as to have looked forward with cheerfulness to his daily dinner still despising if he pleased the soul that would invent a sauce i mean to say he would like the larger body of our sentimentalists have acquiesced in our simple humanity but without sacrificing a scruple to its grossness or going arminarm with it by any means sir purcell however never sank and never bent he was invariably erect before men and he did not console himself with a murmur in secret he had lived much alone eating alone thinking alone to complain of a father is to a delicate mind a delicate matter and sir purcell was a gentleman to all about him his chief affliction in his youth therefore kept him dumb a gentleman to all about him he unhappily forgot what was due to his own nature must we not speak under pressure of a grief little people should know that they must but then the primary task is to teach them that they are little people for if they repress the outcry of a constant irritation and the complaint against injustice they lock up a feeding devil in their hearts and they must have vast strength to crush him there strength they must have to kill him and freshness of spirit to live without him after he has once entertained them with his most comforting discourses have you listened to him ever he does thishe plays to you your music it is he who first teaches thousands that they have any music at all so guess what a dear devil he is and when he has played this ravishing melody he falls to upon a burlesque contrast of hurdygurdy and bagpipe squeal and bellow and drone which is meant for the music of the world how far sweeter was yours this charming devil sir purcell had nursed from childhood as a child between a flighty mother and a father verging to insanity from caprice he had grown up with ideas of filial duty perplexed and with a fitful love for either that was not attachment a baffled natural love that in teaching us to brood on the hardness of our lot lays the foundation for a perniciously mystical selflove he had waged precociously philosophic when still a junior his father had kept him by his side giving him no profession beyond that of the obedient expectant son and heir his first allusion to the youths dependency had provoked their first breach which had been widened by many an ostentatious forgiveness on the one hand and a dumblyprotesting submission on the other his mother died away from her husbands roof the old man then sought to obliterate her utterly she left her boy a little money and the injunction of his father was that he was never to touch it he inherited his taste for music from her and his father vowed that if ever he laid hand upon a musical instrument again he would be disinherited all these signs of a vehement spiteful antagonism to reason the young man might have treated more as his fathers misfortune than his own if he could only have brought himself to acknowledge that such a thing as madness stigmatized his family but the sentimental mind conceived it as monstrous impiety to bring this accusation against a parent who did not break windows or grin to deformity he behaved toward him as to a reasonable person and felt the rebellious rancour instead of the pity thus sentiment came in the way of pity by degrees sir purcell transferred all his fathers madness to the fates by whom he was persecuted there was evidently madness somewhere as his shuddering human nature told him it did not offend his sentiment to charge this upon the order of the universe against such a wildhitting madness or concentrated ire of the superior powers sir purcell stood up taking blow upon blow as organist of hillford church he brushed his garments and put a polish on his apparel with an energetic humility that looked like unconquerable patience as though he had said while life is left in me i will be seen for what i am we will vary itfor what i think myself in reality he fought no battle he had been deadbeaten from his boyhood like the old spanish governor the walls of whose fortress had been thrown down by an earthquake and who painted streets to deceive the enemy he was rendered safe enough by his astuteness except against a traitor from within one who goes on doggedly enduring doggedly doing his best must subsist on comfort of a kind that is likely to be black comfort the mere piping of the musical devil shall not suffice in sir purcells case it had long seemed a magnanimity to him that he should hold to a life so vindictively scourged and his comfort was that he had it at his own disposal to know so much to suffer and still to refrain flattered his pride the term of my misery is in my hand he said softened by the reflection it is our lowest philosophy but when the heart of a man so fashioned is stirred to love a woman it has a new vital force new health and cannot play these solemn pranks the flesh and all its fatality claims him when sir purcell became acquainted with cornelia he found the very woman his heart desired or certainly a most admirable picture of her it was perhaps still more to the ladys credit if she was only striving to be what he was learning to worship the beneficial change wrought in him made him enamoured of healthy thinking and doing had this as a result of sharp mental overhauling sprung from himself there would have been hope for him unhappily it was dependent on her who inspired it he resolved that life should be put on a fresh trial in her person and expecting that naturally to fail of which he had always entertained a base conception he was perforce brought to endow her with unexampled virtues in order to keep any degree of confidence tolerably steadfast in his mind the lady accepted the decorations thus bestowed on her with much grace and willingness she consented little aware of her heroism to shine forth as an ideal and to this he wantonly pinned his faith alas in our world where all things must move it becomes byandby manifest that an ideal or idol which you will has not been gifted with two legs what is then the duty of the worshipper to make as i should say some compromise between his superstitious reverence and his recognition of facts cornelia on her pedestal could not prefer such a request plainly but it would have afforded her exceeding gratification if the man who adored her had quietly taken her up and fixed her in a fresh post of his own choosing entirely in the new circles of changeing events far from doing that he appeared to be unaware that they went with the varying days through circles forming and reforming he walked rather as a man down a lengthened corridor whose light to which he turns is in one favourite corner visible till he reaches the end what cornelia was in the first flaming of his imagination around her she was always unaffected by circumstance to remain it was very hard the ideal did feel the wantif not of legsof a certain tolerant allowance for human laws on the part of her worshipper but he was remorselessly reverential both by instinct and of necessity women are never quite so mad in sentimentalism as men we have now looked into the hazy interior of their systemsour last halt i believe and last examination of machinery before emilia quits england about the time of the pairing of the birds and subsequent to the brookfield explosion cornelia received a letter from her lover bearing the tone of a summons she was to meet him by the decayed sallowthe fruitless tree as he termed it startled by this abruptness her difficulties made her take counsel of her dignity he knows that these clandestine meetings degrade me he is wanting in faith to require constant assurances he will not understand my position she remembered the day at besworth of which adela somewhat needlessly perhaps had told her that it had revealed two of the family in situations censurable before a gossiping world however intrinsically blameless that day had been to the ladies a lesson of deference to opinion it was true that cornelia had met her lover since but she was then unembarrassed she had now to share in the duties of the householdduties abnormal hideous incredible her incomprehensible father was absent in town daily wilfrid conducted adela thither on mysterious business and then mrs chump was left to arabella and herself in the lonely house numberless things had to be said for the quieting of this creature who every morning came downstairs with the exclamation that she could no longer endure her state of uncertainty and was off to a lawyer it was useless to attempt the posture of a reply words and energetic words the woman demanded not expostulationspetitions that she would be respectful to the house before the household yes occasionally so gross was she she had to be fed with lies arabella and cornelia heard one another mouthing these dreadful things with a wretched feeling of contemptuous compassion the trial was renewed daily and it was a task almost a physical task to hold the woman back from london till the hour of lunch came if they kept her away from her bonnet till then they were safe at this meal they had to drink champagne with her diplomatic wilfrid had issued the order with the object first of dazzling her vision and secondly to set the wheels of her brain in swift motion the effect was marvellous and had it not been for her determination never to drink alone the miserable ladies might have applauded it adela on the rare days when she was fortunate enough to reach brookfield in time for dinner was surprised to hear her sisters exclaim oh the hatefulness of that champagne she enjoyed it extremely she poor thing had again to go through a round of cabs and confectioners shops in london if they had said oh the hatefulness of those buns and cold chickens she thought to herself not objecting to champagne at lunch with any particular vehemence she was the less unwilling to tell her sisters what she had to do for wilfrid daily three times a week i go to see emilia at lady gosstres townhouse mr powys has gone to italy and miss ford remains looking if i can read her such a temper on the other days i am taken by wilfrid to the arcades or we hire a brougham to drive round the parkfor nothing but the chance of seeing that girl an instant dont tell me its to meet lady charlotte that lovely and obliging person it is certainly not my duty to undeceive shes now at stornley and speaks of our affairs to everybody i dare say twice a week wilfridoh quite casuallycalls on miss ford and is gratified i suppose for this is the picturethere sits emilia one finger in her cheek and the thumb under her chin and she keeps looking down so opposite is miss ford doing some workmaking lint for patriots probably then wilfrid addressing commonplaces to her and then emilias fathera personage i assure you up against the window with a violin i feel a bitter edge on my teeth still what do you think he does to please his daughter for one while hour he draws his fingersdoes nothing else she wont let him she wont hear a tuneup the strings in the most horrible caterwaul up and down it is really like a thousand lunatics questioning and answering and is enough to make you mad but there that girl sits listening exactly in this attitudeso she scarcely ever looks up my brother talks and occasionally steals a glance that way we passed one whole hour as i have described in the middle of it i happened to look at wilfrids face while the violin was wailing down i fancied i heard the despair of one of those huge masks in a pantomime i was almost choked when adela had related thus much she had to prevent downright revolt and spoil her own game by stating that wilfrid did not leave the house for his special pleasure and a word as to the efforts he was making to see mr pericles convinced the ladies that his situation was as pitiable as their own cornelia refused to obey her lovers mandate and wrote briefly she would not condescend to allude to the unutterable wretchedness afflicting her but spoke of her duty to her father being foremost in her prayers for strength sir purcell interpreted this as indicating the beginning of their alienation he chided her gravely in an otherwise pleasant letter she was wrong to base her whole reply upon the little sentence of reproach but selfjustification was necessary to her spirit indeed an involuntary comparison of her two suitors was forced on her and dry as was sir twickenhams mind she could not but acknowledge that he had behaved with an extraordinary courtesy amounting to chivalry in his suit on two occasions he had declined to let her be pressed to decide he came to the house and went like an ordinary visitor she was indebted to him for that splendid luxury of indecision which so few of the maids of earth enjoy for a lengthened term the rude shakings given her by sir purcell at a time when she needed all her power of dreaming to support the horror of accumulated facts was almost resented he as much as says he doubts me when this is what i endure she cried to herself as mrs chump ordered her champagneglass to be filled with now cornelia my dear if its bad luck were in for theres nothin cheats ut like champagne and she had to put the to her nauseous bubbles to her lips sir purcell had not been told of her tribulations and he had not expressed any doubt of her truth but sentimentalists can read one another with peculiar accuracy through their bewitching gauzes she read his unwritten doubt and therefore expected her unwritten misery to be read so it is when you play at life when you will not go straight you get into this twisting maze now he wrote coldly and she had to repress a feeling of resentment at that also she ascribed the changes of his tone fundamentally to want of faith in her and absolutely during the struggle she underwent she by this means somehow strengthened her idea of her own faithfulness she would have phrased her projected line of conduct thus i owe every appearance of assent to my poor fathers scheme that will spare his health i owe him everything save the positive sacrifice of my hand in fact she meant to do her duty to her father up to the last moment and then on the extreme verge to remember her duty to her lover but she could not write it down and tell her lover as much she knew instinctively that facing the eyes it would not look well perhaps at another season she would have acted and thought with less folly but the dull pain of her great uncertainty and the little stinging whips daily applied to her exaggerated her tendency to selfdeception who has ever had to bear so muchwhat slave she would exclaim as a refuge from the edge of his veiled irony for a slave has if not selection of what he will eat and drink the option of rejecting what is distasteful cornelia had not she had to act a part every day with mrs chump while all those she loved and respected and clung to were in the same conspiracy the consolation of hating or of despising her tormentress was denied the thought that the poor helpless creature had been possibly ruined by them chastened cornelias reflections mightily and taught her to walk very humbly through the duties of the day her powers of endurance were stretched to their utmost a sublime affliction would as she felt bitterly have enlarged her soul this sordid misery narrowed it why did not her lover if his love was passionate himself cut the knot claim her and put her to a quick decision she conceived that were he to bring on a supreme crisis her heart would declare itself but he appeared to be wanting in that form of courage does it become a beggar to act such valiant parts perhaps he was even then replying from his stuffy lodgings the spring was putting out primrosesthe first handwriting of the yearas sir purcell wrote to er prettily deire for fresh air and the neighbourhood of his beloved sent him on a journey down to hillford near the gates of the hillford station he passed wilfrid and adela hurrying to catch the uptrain and received no recognition his face scarcely changed colour but the birds on a sudden seemed to pipe far away from him he asked himself presently what were those black circular spots which flew chasing along the meadows and the lighted walks it was with an effort that he got the landscape close about his eyes and remembered familiar places he walked all day making occupation by directing his steps to divers eminences that gave a view of the brookfield chimneys after nightfall he found himself in the firwood approaching the fruitless tree he had leaned against it musingly for a time when he heard voices as of a couple confident in their privacy the footman gainsford was courting a maid of the tinleys and here being midway between the two houses they met he had to obtain pardon for tardiness by saying that dinner at brookfield had been delayed for the return of mr pole the damsels questions showed her far advanced in knowledge of affairs at brookfield and may account for laura tinleys gatherings of latest intelligence concerning those odd girls as she impudently called the three oh dont you listen was the comment pronounced on gainsfords stock of information but he told nothing signally new she wished to hear something new and striking because she said when i unpin miss laura at night im as likely as not to get a silk dress that aint been worn more than halfadozen timesif i manage when i told her that mr albert her brother had dined at your place last thursdaydemeaning of himself i do thinktherei got a pair of silk stockingsnot letting her see i knew what it was for of coursed and about mrs dumpstumpi cant recollect the womans name and her calling of your master a bankrupt right out and wanting her money of himthere if miss laura didnt give me a pair of lavender kidgloves out of her boxand i wish you would leave my hands alone when you know i shouldnt be so silly as to wear them in the dark and for you indeed but gainsford persisted upon which there was fooling all this was too childish for sir purcell to think it necessary to give warning of his presence they passed and when they had gone a short way the damsel cried well that is something and stopped married in a month she exclaimed and you dont know which one no returned gainsford master said one of you as they was at dinner just as i come into the room he was in jolly spirits and kept going so whats a month champagne gainsford and you should have sees mrsnot stump but chump shell be tipsy tonight and i shall bust if i have to carry of her upstairs well she is funshe dont mind handin you a fiveshilling piece when shes done tender but i have nearly lost my place two or three time along of that woman shed split logs with laughingno need of beetle and wedges och she sings out by the piperand miss cornelia sitting thereand arrahbother the womans irish thus gainsford gave up the effort at imitation with a spirited britons mild contempt for what he could not do she pointed out miss cornelia and said she was like the tinkers dogtheres the bone he wants himself and the bone he dont want anybody else to have aha aint it good oh the tinkers dog wont i remember that said the damsel she cant be such a fool well i dont know gainsford meditated critically she is and yet she aint if you understand me what i feel about her ishang it she makes ye laugh sir purcell moved from the shadow of the tree as noiselessly as he could so that this enamoured couple might not be disturbed he had already heard more than he quite excused himself for hearing in such a manner and having decided not to arrest the man and make him relate exactly what mr pole had spoken that evening at the brookfield dinnertable he hurried on his return to town it was not till he had sight of his poor home the solitary company of chairs the sofa looking bony and comfortless as an old female house drudge the table with his desk on it and through foldingdoors his cold and narrow bed not till then did the fact of his great loss stand before him and accuse him of living he seated himself methodically and wrote to cornelia his fancy pictured her now as sharp to every turn of language and fall of periods and to satisfy his imagined rigorous critic he wrote much in the style of a newspaper leading article no one would have thought that tragic meaning underlay those choice and sounding phrases on reperusing the composition he rejected it but only to produce one of a similar cast he could not get to nature in his tone he spoke aloud a little sentence now and then that had the ring of a despairing tenderness nothing of the sort inhabited his written words wherein a strained philosophy and ironic resignation went on stilts i should desire to see you once before i take a step that some have not considered more than commonly serious came toward the conclusion and the idea was toyed with till he signed his name a plunge into the deep is of little moment to one who has been stripped of all clothing is he not a wretch who stands and shivers still this letter ending with a short and not imperious or even urgent request for an interview on the morrow by the fruitless tree he sealed for delivery into cornelias hands some hours before the time appointed he then wrote a clear business letter to his lawyer and one of studied ambiguity to a cousin on his mothers side his fathers brother percival barrett to whom the estates had gone had offered him an annuity of five hundred pounds though he had as his nephew was aware a large family sir purcell had replied let me be the first to consider your family rejecting the benevolence he now addressed his cousin saying what would you think of one who accepts such a giftof me were you to hear that i had bowed my head and extended my hand think this if ever you hear of it that i have acceded for the sake of winning the highest prize humanity can bestow that i certainly would not have done it for aught less than the highest after that he went to his narrow bed his determination was to write to his uncle swallowing bitter pride and to live a pensioner if only cornelia came to her tryst the last he would ask of her as he told her once face to face with his beloved he had no doubt of his power and this feeling which he knew her to share made her reluctance to meet him more darkly suspicious as he lay in the little black room he thought of how she would look when a bride and of the peerless beauty towering over any shades of earthliness which she would present his heated fancy conjured up every device and charm of sacredness and adoring rapture about that white veiled shape until her march to the altar assumed the character of a religious processiona sight to awe mankind and where when she stood before the minister in her saintly humility grave and white and tallwhere was the man whose heart was now racing for that goal at her right hand he felt at the troubled heart and touched two fingers on the rib mockquietingly and smiled then with great deliberation he rose lit a candle unlocked a case of pocketpistols and loaded them but a second idea coming into his head he drew the bullet out of one and lay down again with a luxurious speculation on the choice any hand might possibly make of the lifesparing or deathgiving of those two weapons in his neat halfslumber he was twice startled by a report of firearms in a church when a crowd of veiled women and masked men rushed to the opening and a woman throwing up the veil from her face knelt to a corpse that she lifted without effort and weeping laid it in a grave where it rested and was at peace though multitudes hurried over it and new stars came and went and the winds were strange with new tongues the sleeper saw the morning upon that corpse when light struck his eyelids and he awoke like a man who knew no care his landladys little female scrubber was working at the grate in his sittingroom he had endured many a struggle to prevent service of this nature being done for him by one of the sexat least to prevent it within his hearing and sight he called to her to desist but she replied that she had her mistresss orders thereupon he maintained that the grate did not want scrubbing the girl took this to be a matter of opinion not a challenge to controversy and continued her work in silence irritated by the noise but anxious not to seem harsh he said what on earth are you about when there was no fire there yesterday there aint no stuff for afire now sir said she i tell you i did not light it its been and lit itself then she mumbled do you mean to say you found the fire burnt out when you entered the room this morning she answered that she had found it so and lots of burnt paper lying about the symbolism of this fire burnt out that had warmed and cheered none oppressed his fancy and he left the small maidofallwork to triumph with blacklead and brushes she sang out when she had done if you please sir missus have had a hamper up from the country and would you like a country aig which is quite fresh and new lay and missus say she cant trust the bloaters about here bein yarmouth but theres a soft roe in one sheve squeezed and am i to stop a watercress woman when the last one sold you them and all the leaves jellied behind em so as no washin could save you from swallowin some missus say sir purcell rolled over on his side is this going to be my epitaph he groaned for he was not a man particular in his diet or exacting in choice of roes or panting for freshness in an egg he wondered what his landlady could mean by sending up to him that morning of all others to tempt his appetite after her fashion i thought i remembered eating nothing but toast in this place he observed to himself a grunting answer had to be given to the little maid toast as usual she appeared satisfied but returned again when he was in his bath to ask whether he had said no toast today toast till the day of my deathtell your mistress that he replied and partly from shame at his unaccountable vehemence he paused in his sponging meditated and chilled an association of toast with spectral things grew in his mind when presently the girls voice was heard please sir did say youd have toast or not this morning it cost him an effort to answer simply yes that she should continue not sir appeared like perversity no aig was maddening well no never mind it this morning said he not this morning she repeated then it will not be till the day of your death as you said she is thinking that was the idea running in his brain and he was half ready to cry out stop and renew his order for toast that he might seem consecutive the childishness of the wish made him ask himself what it mattered i said not till the day so none today would mean that i have reached the day shivering with the wet on his pallid skin he thought this over his landlady had used her discretion and there was toast on the table a beam of springs morning sunlight illuminated the toastrack he sat and ate and munched the doubt whether not till included the final day or stopped short of it by this the state of his brain may be conceived a longing for beauty and a dark sense of an incapacity to thoroughly enjoy it tormented him he sent for his landladys canary and the ready shrill song of the bird persuaded him that much of the charm of music is wilfully swelled by ourselves and can be by ourselves withdrawn that is to say the great chasm and spell of sweet sounds is assisted by the force of our imaginations what is that forcethe heat and torrent of the blood when that exists no moreto one without hope for instancewhat is music or beauty intrinsically they are next to nothing he argued it out so and convinced himself of his own delusions till his hand being in the sunlight gave him a pleasant warmth thats something we all love he said glancing at the blue sky above the roofs but theres little enough of it in this climate he thought with an eye upon the darker corners of his room when he had eaten he sent word to his landlady to make up his weeks bill the week was not at an end and that good woman appeased before him astonished saying to be sure your habits is regular but theres little items one ill guess at and how make out a bill sir purcy and no items he nodded his head the country again she asked smilingly i am going down there he said and beautiful at this time of the year it is though for market gardening london beats any country i ever knew and if you like creature comforts i always say stop in london and then the policemen who really are the greatest comfort of all to us poor women and seem sent from above especially to protect our weakness i do assure you sir purcy i feel it and never knew a rightminded woman that did not and how on earth our grandmothers contrived to get about without them but there people who lived before us do seem like the most uncomfortable whenmy goodness we come to think there was some lived before tea why as i say over almost every cup i drink it aint to be realized it seems almost wicked to say it sir purcy but its my opinion there aint a christian woman whos not made more of a christian through her tea and a man who beats his wife my first question is do he take his tea regular for depend upon it that man is not a teadrinker at all he let her talk away feeling oddly pleased by this mundane chatter as was she to pour forth her inmost sentiments to a baronet when she said your fire shall be lighted tonight to welcome you the man looked up and was going to request that the trouble might be spared but he nodded his ghost saw the burning fire awaiting him or how if it sparkled merrily and he beheld it with his human eyes that night his beloved would then have touched him with her handyea brought the dead to life he jumped to his feet and dismissed the worthy dame on both sides of him yes and no seemed pressing like two hostile powers that battled for his body they shrieked in his ears plucked at his fingers he heard them hushing deeply as he went to his pistolcase and drew forth onehe knew not which chapter lvi on a wild april morning emilia rose from her bed and called to mind a day of the last years spring when she had watched the cloud streaming up and felt that it was the curtain of an unknown glory but now it wore the aspect of her life itself with nothing hidden behind those stormy folds save peace southwestward she gazed eyeing eagerly the struggle of twisting vapour long flying edges of silver went by and mounds of faint crimson and here and there a closing space of blue swift as a thought of home to a soldier in action the heavens were like a battlefield emilia shut her lips hard to check an impulse of prayer for merthyr fighting in italy for he was in italy and she once more among the monmouth hills he was in italy fighting and she chained here to her miserable promise three days after she had given the promise to wilfrid merthyr left shaking her hand like any common friend georgiana remained by his desire to protect her emilia had written to wilfrid for release but being no apt letterwriter and hating the task she was soon involved by him in a complication of bewildering sentiments some of which she supposed she was bound to feel while perhaps one or two she did feel at the summons the effect was that she lost the true wording of her blunt petition for release she could no longer put it bluntly but her heart revolted the more and gave her sharp eyes to see into his selfishness the purgatory of her days with georgiana when the latter was kept back from her brother in his peril spurred emilia to renew her appeal but she found that all she said drew her into unexpected traps and pitfalls there was only one thing she could say plainly i want to go if she repeated this wilfrid was ready with citations from her letters wherein she had said this and that and many other phrases his epistolary power and skill in arguing his own case were creditable to him affected as emilia was by other sensations she could not combat the idea strenuously suggested by him that he had reason to complain of her behaviour he admitted his special faults but by distinctly tracing them to their origin he complacently hinted the excuse for them moreover and with artistic ability he painted such a sentimental halo round the sacredness of her pledged word that emilia could not resist a superstitious notion about it and about what the breaking of it would imply georgiana had removed her down to monmouth to be out of his way a constant flight of letters pursued them both for wilfrid was far too clever to allow letters in his handwriting to come for one alone of two women shut up in a countryhouse together he saw how the letterless one would sit speculating shrewdly and spitefully so he was careful to amuse his mystified dragon while he drew nearer and nearer to his gold apple another object was that by getting georgiana to consent to become in part his confidante he made it almost a point of honour for her to be secret with lady charlotte at last a morning came with no brookfield letter for either of them the letters stopped from that time it was almost as if a great buzzing had ceased in emilias ears and she now heard her own sensations clearly to georgianas surprise she manifested no apprehension or regret or else the lady thought she wears a mask to me and certainly it was a pale face that emilia was beginning to wear at last came april and its wild morning no little female hypocrisies passed between them when they met they shook hands at arms length by the breakfasttable then emilia said i am ready to go to italy i will go at once georgiana looked straight at her thinking this is a fit of indignation with wilfrid she answered italy i fancied you had forgotten there was such a country i dont forget my country and my friends said emilia at least i must ask the ground of so unexpected a resolution was rejoined do you remember what merthyr wrote in his letter from arona how long it takes to understand the meaning of some words he says that i should not follow an impulse that is not the impulse of all my naturemyself altogether yes i know what that means now and he tells me that my life is worth more than to be bound to the pledge of a silly moment it is he georgey unkind that you arehe does not distrust me but always advises and helps me merthyr waits for me i cannot be instantly ready for every meaning in the world what i want to do is to see wilfrid if not i will write to him i will tell him that i intend to break my promise a light of unaffected pride shone from the girls face as she threw down this gauntlet to sentimentalism and if he objects said georgiana if he objects what can happen if he objects by letter i am gone i shall not write for permission i shall write what my will is if i see him and he objects i can look into his eyes and say what i think right why i have lived like a frozen thing ever since i gave him my word i have felt at times like a snake hissing at my folly i think i have felt something like men when they swear georgianas features expressed a slight but perceptible disgust emilia continued humbly forgive me i wish you to know how i hate the word i gave that separates me from merthyr in my italy and makes you dislike your poor emilia you do i have pardoned it though it was twenty stabs a day but why if this promise was so hateful to you did you not break it before asked georgiana i had not the courage emilia stooped her head to confess and besides she added curiously halfclosing her eyelids as one does to look on a minute object i could not see through it before if suggested georgiana you break your word you release him from his no if he cannot see the difference cried emilia wildly then let him keep away from me for ever and he shall not have the name of friend is there no differencei wish you would let me cry out as they do in shakespeare georgey emilia laughed to cover her vehemence i want something more than our way of talking to witness that there is such a difference between us am i to live here till all my feelings are burnt out and my very soul is only a spark in a log of old wood and to keep him from murdering my countrymen or flogging the women of italy god knows what those austrians would make him do he changes he would easily become an austrian i have heard him once or twice and if i had shut my eyes i might have declared an austrian spoke i wanted to keep him here but it is not right that ii should be caged till i scarcely feel my fingerends or know that i breathe sensibly as you and others do i am with merthyr that is what i intend to tell him she smiled softly up to georgianas cold eyes to get a look of forgiveness for her fiery speaking so then you love my brother said georgiana emilia could have retorted cruel that you are the pain of having an unripe feeling plucked at without warning was bitter but she repressed any exclamation in her desire to maintain simple and unsensational relations always with those surrounding her he is my friend she said i think of something better than that other word oh that i were a man to call him my brotherinarms whats a girls love in return for his giving his money his heart and offering his life every day for italy as soon as georgiana could put faith in her intention to depart she gave her a friendly hand and embrace two days later they were at richford with lady gosstre the journals were full of the italian uprising there had been a collision between the imperial and patriotic forces near brescia from which the former had retired in some confusion great things were expected of piedmont though many who had reason to know him distrusted her king all lombardy awaited the signal from piedmont meanwhile blood was flowing in the excitement of her sudden rush from dead monotony to active life emilia let some time pass before she wrote to wilfrid her letter was in her hand when one was brought in to her from him it ran thus i have just returned home and what is this i hear are you utterly faithless can i not rely on you to keep the word you have solemnly pledged meet me at once name a place i am surrounded by misery and distraction i will tell you all when we meet i have trusted that you were firm write instantly i cannot ask you to come here the house is broken up there is no putting to paper what has happened my father lies helpless everything rests on me i thought that i could rely on you emilia tore up her first letter and replied come here at once or if you would wish to meet me elsewhere it shall be where you please but immediately if you have heard that i am going to italy it is true i break my promise i shall hope to have your forgiveness my heart bleeds for my dear cornelia and i am eager to see my sisters and embrace them and share their sorrow if i must not come tell them i kiss them adieu wilfrid replied i will be by richford park gates tomorrow at a quarter to nine you speak of your heart i suppose it is a habit be careful to put on a cloak or thick shawl we have touches of frost if i cannot amuse you perhaps the nightingales will do you remember those of last year i wonder whether we shall hear the samewe shall never hear the same this iteration whether cunningly devised or not had a charm for emilias ear she thought i had forgotten all about them when she was in her bedroom at night she threw up her window april was leaning close upon may and she had not to wait long before a dusky flutter of low notes appearing to issue from the great rhododendron bank across the lawn surprised her she listened and another little beginning was heard timorous shy and full of mystery for her the moon hung over branches some that showed young buds some still bare presently the long rich single notes cut the air and melted to their glad delicious chuckle the singer was answered from a farther bough and again from one it grew to be a circle of melody round emilia at the open window was it the same as last years the last years lay in her memory faint and wellnigh unawakened there was likewise a momentary sense of unreality in this still piping peacefulness while merthyr stood in a bloodystreaked field fronting death and yet the song was sweet emilia clasped her arms shut her eyes and drank it in not to think at all or even to brood on her sensations but to rest half animate and let those divine sounds find a way through her blood was medicine to her next day there were numerous visits to the house emilia was reserved and might have been thought sad but she welcomed tracy runningbrook gladly with oh my old friend and a tender squeeze of his hand true if you like hot if you like but i old cried tracy yes because i seem to have got to the other side of you i mean i know you and am always sure of you said emilia you dont care for music i dont care for poetry but were friends and i am quite certain of you and think you old friend always and i said tracy better up to the mark by this time i think of you you dear little woman that i ought to be grateful to you for by heaven you give me every time i see you the greatest temptation to be a fool and let me prove that im not altro altro a fool said emilia caressingly showing that his smart insinuation had slipped by her the tale of brookfield was told over again by tracy and emilia shuddered though merthyr and her country held her heart and imagination active and in suspense from moment to moment it helped mainly to discolour the young world to her eyes she was under the spell of an excitement too keen and quick to be subdued by the sombre terrors of a tragedy enacted in a house that she had known brookfield was in the talk of all who came to richford emilia got the vision of the wretched family seated in the library as usual when upon midnight they were about to part and a knock came at the outer door and two men entered the hall bearing a lifeless body with a red spot above the heart she saw cornelia fall to it she saw the palefaced family that had given her shelter and moaned for lack of a way of helping them and comforting them she reproached herself for feeling her own full physical life so warmly while others whom she had loved were weeping it was useless to resist the tide of fresh vitality in her veins and when her thoughts turned to their main attraction she was rejoicing at the great strength she felt coming to her gradually her face was smooth and impassive this new joy of strength came on her like the flowing of a sea to a landlocked water poor souls she sighed for her friends while irrepressible exultation filled her spirit that afternoon in the midst of packing and preparations for the journey at all of which lady gosstre smiled with a complacent bewilderment a card bearing the name of miss laura tinley was sent up to emilia she had forgotten this person and asked lady gosstre who it was arabellas rival presented herself most winningly for some time emilia listened to her with wonder that a tongue should be so glib on matters of no earthly interest at last laura said in an undertone i am the bearer of a message from mr pericles do you walk at all in the garden emilia read her look and rose her thoughts struck back on the creature that she was when she had last seen mr pericles and again by contrast on what she was now eager to hear of him or rather to divine the mystery in her bosom aroused by the unexpected mention of his name she was soon alone with laura in the garden oh those poor poles laura began you were going to say something of mr pericles said emilia yes indeed my dear but of course you have heard all the details of that dreadful night it cannot be called a comfort to us that it enables my brother albert to come forward in the most disinterestedi might venture to say generousmanner and prove the chivalry of his soul still as things are we are glad after such misunderstandings to prove to that sorelytried family who are their friends iyou would little think so from their treatment of mei was at school with them i knew them before they became unintelligible though they always had a turn for it to dress well to be refined to marry welli understand all that perfectly but who could understand them not they themselves i am certain and now penniless and not only that but lawyers you know that mrs chump has commenced an actionno oh yes but i shall have to tell you the whole story what is itthey want money said emilia i will tell you our poor gentlemanly organist whom you knew was really a baronets son and inherited the title emilia interrupted her oh do let me hear about them well my dear this unfortunatei may call him lover for if a man does not stamp the truth of his affection with a pistol what other means has he and just a word as to romance i have been sighing for itno one would think soall my life and who would have thought that these poor poles should have lived to convince me of the folly oh delicious humdrumthere is nothing like it but you are anxious naturally poor sir purcell barrenhe may or may not have been mad but when he was brought to the house at brookfieldquite by chancei mean his bodytwo labouring men found him by a treei dont know whether you remembered a pollardwillow that stood all white and rotten by the water in the firwoodwell as i said mad or not no sooner did poor cornelia see him than she shrieked that she was the cause of his death he was laid in the hallwhich i have so often trod and there cornelia sat by his poor dead body and accused wilfrid and her father of every unkindness they say that the scene was terrible wilfridbut i need not tell you his character he flutters from flower to flower but he has feeling now comes the worst of allin one sense that is looking on it as people of the world and being in the world we must take a worldly view occasionally mr poleyou remember how he behaved once at besworth or no you were not there but he used your name his mania was as everybody could see to marry his children grandly i dont blame him in any way still he was not justified in living beyond his means to that end speculating rashly and concealing his actual circumstances well mr pericles and he were involved together that is mr pericles is mr pericles near us now said emilia quickly we will come to him laura resumed with the complacency of one who saw a goodly portion of the festival she was enjoying still before her i was going to say mr pericles had poor mr pole in his power has him would be the correcter tense and wilfrid as you may have heard had really grossly insulted him even to the extent of maltreating hima poor foreignerrich foreigner if you like but not capable of standing against a strong young man in wrath however now there can be little doubt that wilfrid repents he had been trying ever since to see mr pericles and the very morning of that day i believe he saw him and humbled himself to make an apology this had put mr pole in good spirits and in the eveninghe and mrs chump were very fond of their wine after dinnerhe was heard that very evening to name a day for his union with her for that had been quite understood and he had asked his daughters and got their consent the sight of sir purcells corpse and the cries of cornelia must have turned him childish i cannot conceive a situation so harrowing as that of those poor children hearing their father declare himself an impostor a beggar a peculator he cried poor unhappy man real tears the truth was that his nerves suddenly gave way for just beforeonly just before he was smiling and talking largely he wished to go on his knees to every one of them and kept telling them of his lovethe servants all awake and listening and more gossiping servants than the poles always by the most extraordinary inadvertence managed to get you never heard of nothing would stop him from humiliating himself no one paid any attention to mrs chump until she started from her chair they say that some of the servants who were crying outside positively were compelled to laugh when they heard her first outbursts and poor mr pole confessed that he had touched her money he could not tell her how much fancy such a scene with a dead man in the house imagination almost refuses to conjure it up not to dwell on it too longfor i have never endured such a shock as it has given memrs chump left the house and the next thing received from her was a lawyers letter business men say she is not to blame women may cherish their own opinion but oh miss belloni is it not terrible you are pale emilia behind what she felt for her friends had a dim comprehension of the meaning of their old disgust at laura during this narration but hearing the word of pity she did not stop to be critical can you do nothing for them she said abruptly the thought in lauras shocked grey eyes was they have done little enough for you ie toward making you a lady oh she cried i can you teach me what to do i must be extremely delicate and calculate upon what they would accept from me forso i hearthey used toand may stillnourish awhat i calledsillythough not in unkindnesshostility to our familyme and perhaps now natural delicacy may render it difficult for them to in short to accept an alms from laura tinley so said her pleading look for an interpretation you know mr pericles said emilia he can do the mischiefcan he not stop him laura laughed one might almost say that you do not know him miss belloni what is my influence i have neither a voice nor can i play on any instrument i wouldindeed i willdo my best my utmost only how even to introduce the subject to him are not you the person he speaks of you constantly he has consulted doctors with regard to your voice and the only excuse dear miss belloni for my visit to you today is my desire that any misunderstanding between you may be cleared because i have just heardmiss belloni will forgive methe origin of it and tidings coming that you were in the neighbourhood i thoughthoped that i might be the means of reuniting two evidently destined to be of essential service to one another and really life means that does it not emilia was becoming more critical of this tone the more she listened she declared her immediate willingness to meet mr pericles with which and emilias assurance that she would write and herself make the appointment laura retired in high glee at the prospect of winning the gratitude of the inscrutable millionaire it was true that the absence of any rivalry for the possession of the man took much of his sweetness from him she seemed to be plucking him from the hands of the dead and half recognized that victory over uncontesting rivals claps the laurelwreath rather rudely upon our heads emilia lost no time in running straight to georgiana who was busy at her writingdesk she related what she had just heard ending breathlessly georgey my dear will you help them in what possible way can i do so said georgiana tomorrow night we shall have left england but today we are here emilia pressed a hand to her bosom my heart feels hollow and my friends cry out in it i cannot let him suffer she looked into georgianas eyes will you not help themthey want money the lady reddened is it not preposterous to suppose that i can offer them assistance of such a kind not you returned emilia sighing and in an underbreath mewill you lend it to me merthyr would i shall repay it i cannot tell what fills me with this delight but i know i am able to repay any sum two thousand pounds would help them i thinki think my voice has come back have you tried it said georgiana to produce a diversion from the other topic no but believe me when i tell you it must be i scarcely feel the floor no misery touches me i am only sorry for my friends not down on the ground with them believe me and i have been studying all this while i have not lost an hour i would accept a part and step on the boards within a week and be certain to succeed i am just as willing to go to the conservatorio and submit to discipline only dear friend believe me that i ask for money now because i am sure i can repay it i want to send it immediately and then goodbye to england georgiana closed her desk she had been suspicious at first of another sentiment in the background but was now quite convinced of the simplicity of emilias design she said i will tell you exactly how i am placed i do not know that under any circumstances i could have given into your hands so large a sum as this that you ask for my brother has a fortune and i have also a little property when i say my brother has a fortune he has the remains of one all that has gone has been devoted to relieve your countrymen and further the interests he has nearest at heart what is left to him i believe he has now thrown into the gulf you have heard lady charlotte call him a fanatic emilias lip quivered you must not blame her for that georgiana continued lady gosstre thinks much the same the world thinks with them i love him and prove my love by trusting him and wish to prove my love by aiding him and being always at hand to succour as i should be now but that i obeyed his dearest wish in resting here to watch over you i am his other self i have taught him to feel that so that in his devotion to this cause he may follow every impulse he has and still there is his sister to fall back on my child see what i have been doing i have been calculating here georgiana took a scroll from her desk and laid it under emilias eyes i have reckoned our expenses as far as turin and have only consented to take lady gosstres valet for courier just to please her i know that he will make the cost double and i feel like a miser about money if merthyr is ruined he will require every farthing that i have for our common subsistence now do you understand i can hardly put the case more plainly it is out of my power to do what you ask me to do emilia sighed lightly and seemed not much cast down by the refusal she perceived that it was necessarily positive and like all minds framed to resolve to action there was an instantaneous change of the current of her thoughts in another direction then my darling my one prayer she said postpone our going for a week i will try to get help for them elsewhere georgiana was pleased by emilias manner of taking the rebuff but it required an altercation before she consented to this postponement she nodded her head finally in anger chapter lvii by the parkgates that evening wilfrid received a letter from the hands of tracy runningbrook it said i am not able to see you now when i tell you that i will see you before i leave england i insist upon your believing me i have no head for seeing anybody now emiliawas the simple signature perused over and over again by this maddened lover under the flitting gatelamp after tracy had left him the coldness of emilias name so briefly given concentrated every fire in his heart what was it but miserable cowardice he thought that prevented him from getting the peace poor barrett had found intolerable anguish weakened his limbs he flung himself on a wayside bank grovelling to rise again calm and quite ready for society upon the proper application of the clothesbrush indeed he patted his shoulder and elbow to remove the soil of his short contact with earth and tried a cigar but the first taste of the smoke sickened his lips then he stood for a moment as a man in a new world this strange sensation of disgust with familiar comforting habits fixed him in perplexity till a rushing of wild thoughts and hopes from brain to heart heart to brain gave him insight and he perceived his state and that for all he held to in our life he was dependent upon another which is virtually the curse of love and he passed along the road adds the philosopher a weaker man a stronger lover not that love should diminish manliness or gains by so doing but travelling to love by the ways of sentiment attaining to the passion bit by bit does full surely take from us the strength of our nature as if which is probable at every step we paid fee to move forward wilfrid had just enough of the coin to pay his footing he was verily fining himself down you are tempted to ask what the value of him will be by the time that he turns out pure metal i reply something considerable if by great sacrifice he gets to truthgets to that oneness of feeling which is the truthful impulse at last he will stand high above them that have not suffered the rejection of his cigar this wages too absurd at the risk of breaking our partnership for ever i intervene my philosophers meaning is plain and as usual good but not even i who have less reason to laugh at him than anybody can gravely accept the juxtaposition of suffering and cigars and moreover there is a little piece of action in store wilfrid had walked half way to brookfield when the longing to look upon the richford chamberwindows stirred so hotly within him that he returned to the gates he saw captain gambier issuing on horseback from under the lamp the captain remarked that it was a fine night and prepared to ride off but wilfrid requested him to dismount and his voice had the unmistakeable ring in it by which a man knows that there must be no trifling the captain leaned forward to look at him before he obeyed the summons all selfcontrol had abandoned wilfrid in the rage he felt at gambiers having seen emilia and the jealous suspicion that she had failed to keep her appointment for the like reason why do you come here he said hoarsely by jove thats an odd question said the captain at once taking his ground am i to understand that youve been playing with my sister as you do with every other woman captain gambier murmured quietly every other woman and smoothed his horses neck theyre not so easily played with my dear fellow you speak like a youngster i am the only protector of my sisters reputation said wilfrid and by heaven if you have cast her over to be the common talk you shall meet me the captain turned to his horse saying oh well being mounted he observed my dear pole you might have sung out all you had to say go to your sister and if she complains of my behaviour ill meet you oh yes ill meet you i have no objection to excitement youre in the hands of an infernally clever woman who does me the honour to wish to see my blood on the carpet i believe but if this is her scheme its not worthy of her ability she began pretty well she arranged the preliminaries capitally why look here he relinquished his ordinary drawl ill tell you something which you may put down in my favour or notjust as you like that woman did her best to compromise your sister with me on board the yacht i cant tell you how and wont of course i wouldnt if i could but i have sense enough to admire a very charming person and i did the only honourable thing in my power its your sister my good fellow who gave me my dismissal we had a little common sense conversationin which she shines i envy the man that marries her but she denies me such luck there if you want to shoot me for my share in that transaction ill give you your chance and if you do my dear pole either you must be a tremendous fool or that womans ten times cleverer than i thought you know where to find me good night the captain gave heel to his horse hearing no more adela confirmed to wilfrid what gambier had spoken and that it was she who had given him his dismissal she called him by his name augustus in a kindly tone remarking that lady charlotte had persecuted him dreadfully poor augustus his entire reputation for evil is owing to her black paintbrush there is no man so easily hooked as mrs bayruffle would say as he though he has but eight hundred a year barely enough to live on it would have been cruel of me to keep him for if he is in love its with emilia wilfrid here took upon himself to reproach her for a certain negligence of worldly interests she laughed and blushed with humorous satisfaction and on second thoughts he changed his opinion telling her that he wished he could win his freedom as she had done wilfrid she said suddenly will you persuade cornelia not to wear black yes if you wish it he replied you will positively then listen dear i dont like the prospect of your alliance with lady charlotte wilfrid could not repress a despondent shrug but you can get released she cried and ultimately counselled him mention the name of lord eltham before her once when you are alone watch the result only dont be clumsy but i need not tell you that for hours he cudgelled his brains to know why she desired cornelia not to wear black and when the light broke in on him he laughed like a jolly youth for an instant the reason why was in a web so complicated that to have divined what hung on cornelias wearing of black showed a rare sagacity and perception of character on the little ladys part as thussir twickenham pryme is the most sensitive of men to ridicule and vulgar tattle he has continued to visit the house learning by degrees to prefer me but still too chivalrous to withdraw his claim to cornelia notwithstanding that he has seen indications of her not too absolute devotion towards himi have let him become aware that i have broken with captain gambier whose income is eight hundred a year merely for the sake of a higher attachment now since the catastrophe he can with ease make it appear to the world that i was his choice from the first seeing that cornelia will assuredly make no manner of objectionbut if she with foolish sentimental persistence assumes the garb of sorrow then sir twickenhams ears will tingle he will retire altogether he will not dare to place himself in a position which will lend a colour to the gossip that jilted by one sister he flew for consolation to the other jilted too for the mere memory of a dead man an additional insult exquisite intricacy wilfrid worked through all the intervolutions and nearly forgot his wretchedness in admiration of his sisters mental endowments he was the more willing to magnify them inasmuch as he thereby strengthened his hope that liberty would follow the speaking of the talismanic name of eltham to lady charlotte alone he had come to look upon her as the real barrier between himself and emilia i think we have brains he said softly on his pillow upon a review of the beggared aspect of his family and he went to sleep with a smile on his face chapter lviii a sharp breath of air had passed along the dews and all the young green of the fresh season shone in white jewels the sky set with very dim distant stars was in grey light round a small brilliant moon every space of earth lifted clear to her the woodland listened and in the bright silence the nightingales sang loud emilia and tracy runningbrook were threading their way toward a lane over which great oak branches intervolved thence under larches all with glittering sleeves and among spiky brambles with the purple leaf and the crimson frosted the frost on the edges of the brownleaved bracken gave a faint colour here and there intense silver dazzled their eyes as they advanced amid the icy hush so hard and instant was the ring of the earth under them their steps sounded as if expected this night seems made for me said emilia tracy had no knowledge of the object of the expedition he was her squire simply had pitched on a sudden into an enamoured condition and walked beside her caring little whither he was led so that she left him not they came upon a clearing in the wood where a tournament of knights might have been held ranged on two sides were rows of larches and forward fit to plume a dais a clump of tall firs stood with a flowing silver fir to right and left and the white stems of the birchtree shining from among them this fair woodland court had three broad oaks as for gateways and the moon was above it moss and the frosted brown fern were its flooring emilia said eagerly this way and ran under one of the oaks she turned to tracy following there is no doubt of it her hand was lying softly on her throat your voice tracy divined her she nodded but frowned lovingly at the shout he raised and he understood that there was haply some plot to be worked out the open space was quite luminous in the middle of those three deep walls of shadow emilia enjoined him to rest where he was and wait for her on that spot like a faithful sentinel whatsoever ensued coaxing his promise she entered the square of white light alone presently she stood upon a low mound so that her whole figure was distinct while the moon made her features visible expectancy sharpened the stillness to tracys ears a nightingale began the charm he was answered by another many were soon in song till even the pauses were sweet with them tracy had the thought that they were calling for emilia to commence that it was nature preluding the divine human voice weaving her spell for it he was seized by a thirst to hear the adorable girl who stood there patiently with her face lifted soft in moonlight and then the blood thrilled along his veins as if one more than mortal had touched him it seemed to him long before he knew that emilias voice was in the air in such a place at such a time there is no wizardry like a womans voice emilia had gained in force and fulness she sang with a stately fervour letting the notes flow from her breast while both her arms hung loose and not a gesture escaped her tracys fiery imagination set him throbbing as to the voice of the verified spirit of the place he heard nothing but emilia and scarce felt that it was she or that tears were on his eyelids till her voice sank richly deep into the bosom of the woods then the stillness like one folding up a precious jewel seemed to pant audibly shes not alone this was human speech at his elbow uttered in some stupefied amazement in an extremity of wrath tracy turned about to curse the intruder and discerned wilfrid eagerly bent forward on the other side of the oak by which he leaned advancing toward emilia two figures were seen mr pericles in his bearskin was easily to be distinguished his companion was laura tinley the greek moved at rapid strides and coming near upon emilia raised his hands as in exclamation at once he disencumbered his shoulders of the enormous wrapper held it aloft imperiously and by main force extinguished emilia lauras shrill laugh resounded oh beastly bathos tracy groaned in his heart here we are down in avernus in a twinkling there was evidently quick talk going on among the three after which emilia heavily weighted walked a little apart with mr pericles who looked lean and lank beside her and gesticulated in his wildest manner tracy glanced about for wilfrid the latter was not visible but stepping up the bank of sand and moss appeared a lady in shawl and hat in whom he recognized lady charlotte he went up to her and saluted ah tracy she said i saw you leave the drawing room and expected to find you here so the little woman has got her voice again but why on earth couldnt she make the display at richford its very pretty and i dare say you highly approve of this kind of romantic interlude signor poet but it strikes me as being rather senseless but are you alone what on earth brings you here asked tracy oh the lady shrugged ive a guard to the rear i told her i would come she said i should hear something tonight if i did i fancied naturally the appointment had to do with her voice and wished to please her its only five minutes from the westpostern of the park is she going to sing any more theres company apparently shall we go and declare ourselves im on duty and cant replied tracy and twisting his body in an ecstasy added did you hear her lady charlotte laughed softly you speak as if you had taken a hurt my dear boy this sort of scene is dangerous to poets but i thought you slighted music i dont know whether im breathing yet tracy rejoined shes a goddess to me from this moment not like music am i a dolt she would raise me from the dead if she sang over me put me in a boat and let her sing on and all may end i could die into colour hearing her thats the voice they hear in heaven when they are good i suppose the irreverent lady appended whats that and she held her head to listen emilias mortal tones were calling wilfrids name the lady became grave as with keen eyes she watched the open space and to a second call wilfrid presented himself in a leisurely way from under cover of the trees stepping into the square towards the three as one equal to all occasions and specially prepared for this he was observed to bow to mr pericles and the two men extended hands laura tinley standing decently away from them lady charlotte could not contain her mystification what does it mean she said wilfrid was to be in town at the ambassadors tonight he wrote to me at five oclock from his club is he insane has he lost every sense of selfinterest he cant have made up his mind to miss his opportunity when all the introductions are there run like a good creature tracy and see if that is wilfrid and come back and tell me but dont sag i am here desert my post tracy hugged his arms tight together not if i freeze here the doubt in lady charlottes eyes was transient she dropped her glass visible adieux were being waved between mr pericles and laura tinley on the one hand and wilfrid and emilia on the other after which and at a quick pace manifestly shivering mr pericles drew laura into the shadows and emilia clad in the immense bearskin as with a trailing black barbaric robe walked toward the oaks wilfrids head was stooped to a level with emilias into whose face he was looking obliviously while the hot words sprang from his lips they neared the oak and emilia slanted her direction so as to avoid the neighbourhood of the tree tracy felt a sudden grasp of his arm it was momentary coming simultaneously with a burst of wilfrids voice do i know what i love you ask i love your footprints everything you have touched is like fire to me emilia emilia then came the clear reply you do not love lady charlotte love her he shouted scornfully and subdued his voice to add she has a good heart and whatever scandal is talked of her and lord eltham she is a wellmeaning friend but love her you you i love theatrical business lady charlotte murmured and imagined she had expected it when she promised emilia she would step out into the night air as possibly she had the lady walked straight up to them well little one she addressed emilia i am glad you have recovered your voice you play the game of titfortat remarkably well we will now sheath our battledores there is my hand the unconquerable aplomb in lady charlotte which wilfrid always artistically admired and which always mastered him the sight of her pale face and courageous eyes and her choice of the moment to come forward and declare her presenceall fell upon the furnace of wilfrids heart like a quenching flood in a stupefaction he confessed to himself that he could say actually nothing he could hardly look up emilia turned her eyes from the outstretched hand to the ladys face what will it mean she said that we are quits i presume and that we bear no malice at any rate that i relinquish the field i like a hand that can deal a good stroke i conceived you to be a mere little romantic person and correct my mistake you win the prize you see you would have made him an austrian and he is now safe from that i win nothing more said emilia when tracy and emilia stood alone he cried out in a rapture of praise now i know what a power you have you may bid me live or die the recent scene concerned chiefly the actors who had moved onward it had touched emilia but lightly and him not at all but while he magnified the glory of her singing the imperishable note she had sounded this night and the power and the triumph that would be hers emilias bosom began to heave and she checked him with a storm of tears triumph yes what is this i have done oh merthyr my true hero he praises me and knows nothing of how false i have been to you i am a slave i have sold myselfsold myself she dropped her face in her hands broken with grief he fights she pursued he fights for my country i feel his bloodit seems to run from my body as it runs from his not if he is dyingi dare not go to him if he is dying i am in chains i have sworn it for money see what a different man merthyr is from any on earth would he shoot himself for a woman would he grow meaner the more he loved her my hero my hero and tracy my friend what is my grief now merthyr is my hero but i hear himi hear him speaking it into my ears with his own lips that i do not love him and it is true i never should have sold myself for three weary years away from him if i had loved him i know it now it is done i thought more of my poor friends and wilfrid than of merthyr who bleeds for my country and he will not spurn me when we meet yes if he lives he will come to me gentle as a ghost that has seen god she abandoned herself to weeping tracy in a tender reverence for one who could speak such solemn matter spontaneously supported her and felt her tears as a rain of flame on his heart the nightingales were mute not a sound was heard from bough or brake chapter lix a wreck from the last lombard revolt landed upon our shores in june his right arm was in a sling and his italian servant following him kept close by his side with a ready hand as if fearing that at any moment the wounded gentlemans steps might fail there was no public war going on just then for which reason he was eyed suspiciously by the rest of the passengers making their way up the beach who seemed to entertain an impression that he had no business at such a moment to be crippled and might be put down as one of those foreign fools who stand out for a trifle as targets to fools a little luckier than themselves here within our salt girdle flourishes common sense we cherish life we abhor bloodshed we have no sympathy with your juvenile points of honour we are in short a civilized people and seeing that success has made us what we are we advise other nations to succeed or be quiet of all of which the gravelysmiling gentleman appeared well aware for with an eye that courted none and a perfectly calm face he passed through the crowd only once availing himself of his brownfaced beppos spontaneously depressed shoulder when a twinge of pain shooting from his torn foot took his strength away while he remained in sight some speculation as to his nationality continued he had been heard to speak nothing but italian and yet the flower of english cultivation was signally manifest in his style and bearing the purchase of that days journal giving information that the lombard revolt was fully it was thought finally crushed out and the insurgents scattered hanged or shot suggested to a young lady in a group melancholy with luggage that the wounded gentleman was one who had escaped from the austrians only he is english if he is he deserves what hes got a stout briton delivered this sentence and gave in addition a sermon on meddling short emphatic and not uncheerful apparently if estimated by the hearty laugh that closed it though a lady remarked oh dear me you are very sweeping by george maam cried the briton holding out his newspaper heres a leader on the identical subject with all my views in it yes those italians are absurd they never were a people never agreed egad the only place theyre fit for is the stage art if you like they know all about colouring canvas and sculpturing i dont deny em their merits and i dont mind listening to their squalling now and then though ill tell you what have you ever noticed the calves of those singersi mean the men perhaps notfor they ve got none theyre sticks not legs who can think much of fellows with such legs now the next time you go to the italian opera notice em ha hawell that would sound queer told at secondhand but just look at their legs maam and ask yourself whether theres much chance for a country that stands on legs like those let them paint and carve blocks and sing theyre not fit for much else as far as i can see thus in the pride of his manliness the male briton a shrill cry drew the attention of this group once more to the person who had just kindly furnished a topic he had been met on his way by a lady unmistakeably foreign in her appearance marini was the word of the cry and the lady stood with her head bent and her hands stiffened rigidly lost her husband i dare say the briton murmured perhaps hes one of the hanged or shot in the list here hanged shot ask those austrians to be merciful and thats their reply why good god its like the grunt of a savage beast hanged shotcount how many

so shall my daughters so we will all down to the baby merthyrs name was shouted first on his return to england by mrs chump he was waiting on the platform of the london station for the train to take him to richford when oh mr pows mr pows resounded and mrs chump fluttered before him she was on her way to brookfield she said and it was she added her firm belief that heaven had sent him to her sad

on the shore merthyr looked impatiently out of the window his wounds throbbed and his forehead was moist with mr pericles he queried while mrs chump was giving him the reasons for the immediate visit to brookfield theyre captal friends again ye know mr pows mr paricles and pole and poles quite set up and yesterday mornin sends me two thousand poundsnot a penny less and yell believe me i was in a

the station whichll be grander to go in and impose on em ye know pray sir i entreat ye the tears burst from her eyes and her hot hand clung to his imploringly merthyr was a witness of the return of mrs chump to brookfield in that erewhile abode of fine shades the nice feelings had foundered the circle of a year beginning so fairly for them enfolded the ladies and their first great scheme of life emilia had been a touchstone to this family they could not know it in their deep affliction but in manger they had much improved their welcome of mrs chump was an admirable seasoning of stateliness with kindness cornelia and arabella took her hand listening with an incomparable soft smile to her first protestations which they quieted and then led her to mr pole of whom it may be said that an accomplished coquette could not in his situation have behaved with a finer skill so that albeit received back into the house mrs chump had yet to discover what her footing there was to be and trembled like the meanest of culprits mr pole shook her hand warmly tenderly almost tearfully and said to the melted woman youre right martha its much better for us to examine accounts in a friendly way than to have strangers and lawyers and what notpeople who cant possibly know the whole history dont you seemeddling and making a scandal and im much obliged to you for coming vainly mrs chump employed alternately innuendo and outcry to make him perceive that her coming involved a softer business and that to money she having it now she gave not a thought he assured her that in future she must that such was his express desire that it was her duty to herself and others and while saying this which seemed to indicate that widowhood would be her state as far as he was concerned he pressed her hand with extreme sweetness and his birdseyes twinkled obligingly it is to be feared that mr pole had passed the age of improvement save in his peculiar art after a time nature stops and says to us thou art now what thou wilt be cornelia was in black from neck to foot she joined the conversation as the others did and indeed more flowingly than adela whose visage was soured it was cornelia to whom merthyr explained his temporary subjection to the piteous appeals of mrs chump she smiled humorously to reassure him of her perfect comprehension of the apology for his visit and of his welcome and they talked argued a little differed until the terrible thought that he talked and even looked like some one else drew the blood from her lips and robbed her pulses of their play she spoke of emilia saying plainly and humbly all we have is owing to her arabella spoke of emilia likewise but with a shade of the foregone tone of patronage she will always be our dear little sister adela continued silent as with ears awake for the opening of a door was it in everthwarted anticipation of the coming of sir twickenham merthyrs inquiry after wilfrid produced a momentary hesitation on cornelias parthe has gone to verona we have an uncle in the austrian service she said and merthyr bowed what was this tale of emilia that grew more and more perplexing as he heard it bit by bit the explanation awaited him at richford there when georgiana had clasped her brother in one last jealous embrace she gave him the following letter straightway to save him haply from the false shame of that eager demand for one which she saw ready to leap to words in his eyes he read it sitting in the richford library alone while the great rhododendron bloomed outside above the shaven sunny sward looking like a monstrous tropic bird alighted to brood an hour in full sunlight my friend i would say my beloved i will not write it for it would be false i have read of the defeat why was a battle risked at that cruel place here are we to be again for so many years before we can win god to be on our side and ido you not know we used to talk of iti never can think it the devil who has got the upper hand what succeeds i always think should succeedwas meant to because the sky looks clear over it this knocks a blow at my heart and keeps it silent and only just beating i feel that you are safe that i am thankful for if you were not god would warn me and not let me mock him with thanks when i pray i pray till my eyelids burn on purpose to get a warning if there is any black messenger to be sent to me i do not believe it for three years i am a prisoner i go to the conservatorio in milan with mr pericles and my poor little mother who cries asking me where she will be among such a people until i wonder she should be my mother my voice has returned oh merthyr my dear calm friend to keep calling you friend and friend puts me to sleep softlyyes i have my voice i felt i had it like some one in a room with us when we will not open our eyes there was misery everywhere and yet i was glad i kept it secret i began to feel myself above the world i dreamed of what i would do for everybody i thought of you least i tell you so and take a scourge and scourge myself for it is true that in her new joy this miserable creature that i am thought of you least now i have the punishment my friend the poles were at the mercy of mr pericles wilfrid had struck him mr pericles was angry and full of mischief those dear people had been kind to me and i heard they were poor i felt money in my breast in my throat that only wanted coining i went to georgiana and oh how truly she proved to me that she loves you better than i do she refused to part with money that you might soon want i laid a scheme for mr pericles to hear me sing he heard me and my scheme succeeded if italy knew as well as i she would never let her voice be heard till she is sure of ityes from foot to head i knew it was impossible to fail if a country means to be free the fire must run through it and make it feel that certainty thenaway the whitecoat i sang and the man twisted as if i had bent him in my hand he rushed to me and offered me any terms i pleased if for three years i would go to the conservatorio at milan and learn submissively it is a little grief to me that i think this man loves music more deeply than i do in the two things i love best the love of others exceeds mine i named a sum of moneyimmense and i desired that mr pericles should assist mr pole in his business he consented at once to everything the next day he gave me the money and i signed my name and pledged my honour to an engagement my friends were relieved it was then i began to think of you i had not to study the matter long to learn that i did not love you and i will not trust my own feelings as they come to me now i judge myself by my acts or merthyr i should sink to the ground like a dead body when i think of separation from you for three years but what am i i am a raw girl i command nothing but raw and flighty hearts of men are they worth anything let me study three years without any talk of hearts at all it commenced too early and has left nothing to me but a dreadful knowledge of the weakness in most peoplenot in you if i might call you my beloved and so chain myself to you i think i should have all your firmness and double my strength i will not for i will not have what i do not deserve i think of you reading this till i try to get to you my heart is like a bird caught in the hands of a cruel boy by what i have done i know i do not love you must we halfdespise a man to love him may no dear woman that i know ever marry the man she first loves my misery now is gladness is like raindrops on rising wings if i say to myself free free emilia i am bound for three years but i smile at such a bondage to my body evviva my soul is free three years of freedom and no sounding of myselfthree years of growing and studying three years of idle heartmerthyr i throb to think that those three yearstrue man my hero i may call youthose three years may make me worthy of you and if you have given all to italy that a daughter of italy should help to return it seems my friend so tenderly sweethere is the first drop from my eyes i would break what you call a sentiment i broke my word to wilfrid but this sight of money has a meaning that i cannot conquer i know you would not wish me to for your own pleasure and therefore i go i hope to be growing i fly like a seed to italy let me drill and take sharp words and fret at trifles i lift my face to that prospect as if i smelt new air i am changeingi have no dreams of italy no longings but go to see her like a machine ready to do my work whoever speaks to me i feel that i look at them and know them i see the faults of my countryoh beloved breseians not yours florentines nor yours dear venice we will be silent when they speak of the milanese till italy can say to them that conduct is not italian my children i see the faults nothing vexes me addio my friend we will speak english in dear england tell all that i shall never forget england my english merthyr the blood you have shed is not for a woman the blood that you have shed laurels spring from it for a woman the blood spilt is sickly and poor and nourishes nothing i shudder at the thought of one we knew he makes love seem like a yellow light over a plaguespotted city like a painting i have seen goodbye to the name of love for three years my engagement to mr pericles is that i am not to write not to receive letters to you i say now trust me for three years merthyrs answer is already in my bosom belovedlet me say it oncewhen the answer to any noble thing i might ask of you is in my bosom instantly is not that as much as marriage but be under no deception see me as i am oh goodbye goodbye goodbye to you goodbye to england i am most humbly and affectionately your friend and her daughter by the mothers side emilia alessandra belloni etext editors bookmarks a plunge into the deep is of little moment a marriage without love is dishonour active despair is a passion that must be superseded am i ill i must be hungry and ladies if you will consent to be likened to a fruit and he passed along the road adds the philosopher bear in mind that we are sentimentaliststhe eye is our servant being heard at night in the nineteenth century beyond a plot of flowers a goldgreen meadow dipped to a ridge but love for a parent is not merely duty depreciating it after the fashion of chartered hypocrites emilia alone of the party was as a blot to her fine shades were still too dominant at brookfield had shakespeares grandmother three christian names he thinks that the country must be saved by its women as well his alien ideas were not unimpressed by the picture hushing together they agreed that it had been a false move i had to cross the park to give a lesson i cannot delay but i request you that are here privileged i had to make my father and mother live on potatoes i detest anything that has to do with gratitude i know that your father has been hearing tales told of me i am not ashamed it was as if she had been eyeing a golden door shut fast littlenesses of which women are accused love that shrieks at a mortal wound and bleeds humanly love discerns unerringly what is and what is not duty love the poor devil love with his accustomed cunning man who beats his wife my first question is do he take his tea my mistress my glorious stolen fruit my dark angel of love my voice i have my voice emilia had cried it out to herself my engagement to mr pericles is that i am not to write no nose to the hero no moral to the tale nor can a protest against coarseness be sweepingly interpreted oh beastly bathos on a wild april morning once my love said he not nowdoes it mean not now one of those men whose characters are read off at a glance our partner is our master passion does not inspire dark appetitedainty innocence does passion he says is noble strength on fire pleasure sat like an inextinguishable light on her face poor mortals are not in the habit of climbing olympus to ask revived for them so much of themselves she was perhaps a little the taller of the two she had great awe of the word business silence was their only protection to the nice feelings so it is when you play at life when you will not go straight solitude is pasturage for a suspicion the majority however had been snatched out of this bliss the circle which the ladies of brookfield were designing the woman follows the man and music fits to verse the sentimentalists are represented by them among the civilized the dismallylighted city wore a look of judgement terrible to see the sentimentalist goes on accumulating images the gallant cornet adored delicacy and a gilded refinement the philosopher i would keep him back if i could their way was down a green lane and across long meadowpaths they meantime who had a contempt for sleep they had all noticed seen and observed to know that you are in england breathing the same air with me true love excludes no natural duty victims of the modern feminine ideal we have now looked into the hazy interior of their systems we are in short a civilized people what was this tale of emilia that grew more and more perplexing wilfrid perceived that he had become an old man women are wonderfully quick scholars under ridicule you have not to be told that i desire your happiness above all
