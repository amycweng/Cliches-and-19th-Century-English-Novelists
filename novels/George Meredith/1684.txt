the egoist a comedy in narrative by george meredith prelude a chapter of which the last page only is of any importance comedy is a game played to throw reflections upon social life and it deals with human nature in the drawingroom of civilized men and women where we have no dust of the struggling outer world no mire no violent crashes to make the correctness of the representation convincing credulity is not wooed through the impressionable senses nor have we recourse to the small circular glow of the watchmakers eye to raise in bright relief minutest grains of evidence for the routing of incredulity the comic spirit conceives a definite situation for a number of characters and rejects all accessories in the exclusive pursuit of them and their speech for being a spirit he hunts the spirit in men vision and ardour constitute his merit he has not a thought of persuading you to believe in him follow and you will see but there is a question of the value of a run at his heels now the world is possessed of a certain big book the biggest book on earth that might indeed be called the book of earth whose title is the book of egoism and it is a book full of the worlds wisdom so full of it and of such dimensions is this book in which the generations have written ever since they took to writing that to be profitable to us the book needs a powerful compression who says the notable humourist in allusion to this book who can studiously travel through sheets of leaves now capable of a stretch from the lizard to the last few poor pulmonary snips and shreds of leagues dancing on their toes for cold explorers tell us and catching breath by good luck like dogs at bones about a table on the edge of the pole inordinate unvaried length sheer longinquity staggers the heart ages the very heart of us at a view and how if we manage finally to print one of our pages on the crowscalp of that solitary majestic outsider we may get him into the book yet the knowledge we want will not be more present with us than it was when the chapters hung their end over the cliff you ken of at dover where sits our great lord and master contemplating the seas without upon the reflex of that within in other words as i venture to translate him humourists are difficult it is a piece of their humour to puzzle our wits the inward mirror the embracing and condensing spirit is required to give us those interminable milepost piles of matter extending wellnigh to the very pole in essence in chosen samples digestibly i conceive him to indicate that the realistic method of a conscientious transcription of all the visible and a repetition of all the audible is mainly accountable for our present branfulness and that prolongation of the vasty and the noisy out of which as from an undrained fen steams the malady of sameness our modern malady we have the malady whatever may be the cure or the cause we drove in a body to science the other day for an antidote which was as if tired pedestrians should mount the enginebox of headlong trains and science introduced us to our oerhoary ancestrythem in the oriental posture whereupon we set up a primaeval chattering to rival the amazon forest nigh nightfall cured we fancied and before daybreak our disease was hanging on to us again with the extension of a tail we had it fore and aft we were the same and animals into the bargain that is all we got from science art is the specific we have little to learn of apes and they may be left the chief consideration for us is what particular practice of art in letters is the best for the perusal of the book of our common wisdom so that with clearer minds and livelier manners we may escape as it were into daylight and song from a land of foghorns shall we read it by the watchmakers eye in luminous rings eruptive of the infinitesimal or pointed with examples and types under the broad alpine survey of the spirit born of our united social intelligence which is the comic spirit wise men say the latter they tell us that there is a constant tendency in the book to accumulate excess of substance and such repleteness obscuring the glass it holds to mankind renders us inexact in the recognition of our individual countenances a perilous thing for civilization and these wise men are strong in their opinion that we should encourage the comic spirit who is after all our own offspring to relieve the book comedy they say is the true diversion as it is likewise the key of the great book the music of the book they tell us how it condenses whole sections of the book in a sentence volumes in a character so that a fair pan of a book outstripping thousands of leagues when unrolled may be compassed in one comic sitting for verily say they we must read what we can of it at least the page before us if we would be men one with an index on the book cries out in a style pardonable to his fervency the remedy of your frightful affliction is here through the stillatory of comedy and not in science nor yet in speed whose name is but another for voracity why to be alive to be quick in the soul there should be diversity in the companion throbs of your pulses interrogate them they lump along like the old loblegs of dobbin the horse or do their business like cudgels of carpetthwackers expelling dust or the cottageclock pendulum teaching the infant hour over midnight simple arithmetic this too in spite of bacchus and let them gallop let them gallop with the god bestriding them gallop to hymen gallop to hades they strike the same note monstrous monotonousness has enfolded us as with the arms of amphitrite we hear a shout of war for a diversioncomedy he pronounces to be our means of reading swiftly and comprehensively she it is who proposes the correcting of pretentiousness of inflation of dulness and of the vestiges of rawness and grossness to be found among us she is the ultimate civilizer the polisher a sweet cook if he says she watches over sentimentalism with a birchrod she is not opposed to romance you may love and warmly love so long as you are honest do not offend reason a lover pretending too much by one foots length of pretence will have that foot caught in her trap in comedy is the singular scene of charity issuing of disdain under the stroke of honourable laughter an ariel released by prosperos wand from the fetters of the damned witch sycorax and this laughter of reason refreshed is floriferous like the magical great gale of the shifty spring deciding for summer you hear it giving the delicate spirit his liberty listen for comparison to an unleavened society a low as of the udderful cow past milking hour o for a titled ecclesiastic to curse to excommunication that unholy thingso far an enthusiast perhaps but he should have a hearing concerning pathos no ship can now set sail without pathos and we are not totally deficient of pathos which is i do not accurately know what if not the ballast reducible to moisture by patent process on board our modern vessel for it can hardly be the cargo and the general water supply has other uses and ships well charged with it seem to sail the stiffestthere is a touch of pathos the egoist surely inspires pity he who would desire to clothe himself at everybodys expense and is of that desire condemned to strip himself stark naked he if pathos ever had a form might be taken for the actual person only he is not allowed to rush at you roll you over and squeeze your body for the briny drops there is the innovation you may as well know him out of hand as a gentleman of our time and country of wealth and station a not flexile figure do what we may with him the humour of whom scarcely dimples the surface and is distinguishable but by very penetrative very wicked imps whose fits of roaring below at some generally imperceptible stroke of his quality have first made the mild literary angels aware of something comic in him when they were one and all about to describe the gentleman on the heading of the records baldly where brevity is most complimentary as a gentleman of family and property an idol of a decorous island that admires the concrete imps have their freakish wickedness in them to kindle detective vision malignly do they love to uncover ridiculousness in imposing figures wherever they catch sight of egoism they pitch their camps they circle and squat and forthwith they trim their lanterns confident of the ludicrous to come so confident that their grip of an english gentleman in whom they have spied their game never relaxes until he begins insensibly to frolic and antic unknown to himself and comes out in the native steam which is their scent of the chase instantly off they scour egoist and imps they will it is known of them dog a great house for centuries and be at the birth of all the new heirs in succession diligently taking confirmatory notes to join hands and chime their chorus in one of their merry rings round the tottering pillar of the house when his turn arrives as if they had possibly they had smelt of old date a doomed colossus of egoism in that unborn unconceived inheritor of the stuff of the family they dare not be chuckling while egoism is valiant while sober while socially valuable nationally serviceable they wait aforetime a grand old egoism built the house it would appear that ever finer essences of it are demanded to sustain the structure but especially would it appear that a reversion to the gross original beneath a mask and in a vein of fineness is an earthquake at the foundations of the house better that it should not have consented to motion and have held stubbornly to all ancestral ways than have bred that anachronic spectre the sight however is one to make our squatting imps in circle grow restless on their haunches as they bend eyes instantly ears at full cock for the commencement of the comic drama of the suicide if this line of verse be not yet in our literature through very love of self himself he slew let it be admitted for his epitaph chapter i a minor incident showing an hereditary aptitude in the use of the knife there was an ominously anxious watch of eyes visible and invisible over the infancy of willoughby fifth in descent from simon patterne of patterne hall premier of this family a lawyer a man of solid acquirements and stout ambition who well understood the foundationwork of a house and was endowed with the power of saying no to those first agents of destruction besieging relatives he said it with the resonant emphasis of death to younger sons for if the oak is to become a stately tree we must provide against the crowding of timber also the tree beset with parasites prospers not a great house in its beginning lives we may truly say by the knife soil is easily got and so are bricks and a wife and children come of wishing for them but the vigorous use of the knife is a natural gift and points to growth pauper patternes were numerous when the fifth head of the race was the hope of his county a patterne was in the marines the country and the chief of this family were simultaneously informed of the existence of one lieutenant crossjay patterne of the corps of the famous hard fighters through an act of heroism of the unpretending cool sort which kindles british blood on the part of the modest young officer in the storming of some eastern riverain stronghold somewhere about the coast of china the officers youth was assumed on the strength of his rank perhaps likewise from the tale of his modesty he had only done his duty our willoughby was then at college emulous of the generous enthusiasm of his years and strangely impressed by the report and the printing of his name in the newspapers he thought over it for several months when coming to his title and heritage he sent lieutenant crossjay patterne a cheque for a sum of money amounting to the gallant fellows pay per annum at the same time showing his acquaintance with the first or chemical principles of generosity in the remark to friends at home that blood is thicker than water the man is a marine but he is a patterne how any patterne should have drifted into the marines is of the order of questions which are senselessly asked of the great dispensary in the complimentary letter accompanying his cheque the lieutenant was invited to present himself at the ancestral hall when convenient to him and he was assured that he had given his relative and friend a taste for a soldiers life young sir willoughby was fond of talking of his military namesake and distant cousin young patternethe marine it was funny and not less laughable was the description of his namesakes deed of valour with the rescued british sailor inebriate and the hauling off to captivity of the three braves of the black dragon on a yellow ground and the tying of them together back to back by their pigtails and driving of them into our lines upon a newly devised dyingtop style of march that inclined to the oblique like the astonished six eyes of the celestial prisoners for straight they could not go the humour of gentlemen at home is always highly excited by such cool feats we are a small island but you see what we do the ladies at the hall sir willoughbys mother and his aunts eleanor and isabel were more affected than he by the circumstance of their having a patterne in the marines but how then we english have ducal blood in business we have genealogists tell us royal blood in common trades for all our pride we are a queer people and you may be ordering butchers meat of a tudor sitting on the canebottom chairs of a plantagenet by and by you may but cherish your reverence young willoughby made a kind of shockhead or football hero of his gallant distant cousin and wondered occasionally that the fellow had been content to dispatch a letter of effusive thanks without availing himself of the invitation to partake of the hospitalities of patterne he was one afternoon parading between showers on the stately garden terrace of the hall in company with his affianced the beautiful and dashing constantia durham followed by knots of ladies and gentlemen vowed to fresh air before dinner while it was to be had chancing with his usual happy fortune we call these things dealt to us out of the great hidden dispensary chance to glance up the avenue of limes as he was in the act of turning on his heel at the end of the terrace and it should be added discoursing with passions privilege of the passion of love to miss durham sir willoughby who was anything but obtuse experienced a presentiment upon espying a thickset stumpy man crossing the gravel space from the avenue to the front steps of the hall decidedly not bearing the stamp of the gentleman on his hat his coat his feet or anything that was his willoughby subsequently observed to the ladies of his family in the scriptural style of gentlemen who do bear the stamp his brief sketch of the creature was repulsive the visitor carried a bag and his coatcollar was up his hat was melancholy he had the appearance of a bankrupt tradesman absconding no gloves no umbrella as to the incident we have to note it was very slight the card of lieutenant patterne was handed to sir willoughby who laid it on the salver saying to the footman not at home he had been disappointed in the age grossly deceived in the appearance of the man claiming to be his relative in this unseasonable fashion and his acute instinct advised him swiftly of the absurdity of introducing to his friends a heavy unpresentable senior as the celebrated gallant lieutenant of marines and the same as a member of his family he had talked of the man too much too enthusiastically to be able to do so a young subaltern even if passably vulgar in figure can be shuffled through by the aid of the heroical story humourously exaggerated in apology for his aspect nothing can be done with a mature and stumpy marine of that rank considerateness dismisses him on the spot without parley it was performed by a gentleman supremely advanced at a very early age in the art of cutting young sir willoughby spoke a word of the rejected visitor to miss durham in response to her startled look i shall drop him a cheque he said for she seemed personally wounded and had a face of crimson the young lady did not reply dating from the humble departure of lieutenant crossjay patterne up the limesavenue under a gathering raincloud the ring of imps in attendance on sir willoughby maintained their station with strict observation of his movements at all hours and were comparisons in quest the sympathetic eagerness of the eyes of caged monkeys for the hand about to feed them would supply one they perceived in him a fresh development and very subtle manifestation of the very old thing from which he had sprung chapter ii the young sir willoughby these little scoundrel imps who have attained to some respectability as the dogs and pets of the comic spirit had been curiously attentive three years earlier long before the public announcement of his engagement to the beautiful miss durham on the day of sir willoughbys majority when mrs mountstuart jenkinson said her word of him mrs mountstuart was a lady certain to say the remembered if not the right thing again and again was it confirmed on days of high celebration days of birth or bridal how sure she was to hit the mark that rang the bell and away her word went over the county and had she been an uncharitable woman she could have ruled the county with an iron rod of caricature so sharp was her touch a grain of malice would have sent county faces and characters awry into the currency she was wealthy and kindly and resembled our mother nature in her reasonable antipathies to one or two things which none can defend and her decided preference of persons that shone in the sun her word sprang out of her she looked at you and forth it came and it stuck to you as nothing laboured or literary could have adhered her saying of laetitia dale here she comes with a romantic tale on her eyelashes was a portrait of laetitia and that of vernon whitford he is a phoebus apollo turned fasting friar painted the sunken brilliancy of the lean longwalker and scholar at a stroke of the young sir willoughby her word was brief and there was the merit of it on a day when he was hearing from sunrise to the setting of the moon salutes in his honour songs of praise and ciceronian eulogy rich handsome courteous generous lord of the hall the feast and the dance he excited his guests of both sexes to a holiday of flattery and says mrs mountstuart while grand phrases were mouthing round about him you see he has a leg that you saw of course but after she had spoken you saw much more mrs mountstuart said it just as others utter empty nothings with never a hint of a stress her word was taken up and very soon from the extreme end of the long drawingroom the circulation of something of mrs mountstuarts was distinctly perceptible lady patterne sent a little hebe down skirting the dancers for an accurate report of it and even the inappreciative lips of a very young lady transmitting the word could not damp the impression of its weighty truthfulness it was perfect adulation of the young sir willoughbys beauty and wit and aristocratic bearing and mien and of his moral virtues was common welcome if you like as a form of homage but common almost vulgar beside mrs mountstuarts quiet little touch of nature in seeming to say infinitely less than others as miss isabel patterne pointed out to lady busshe mrs mountstuart comprised all that the others had said by showing the needlessness of allusions to the saliently evident she was the aristocrat reproving the provincial he is everything you have had the goodness to remark ladies and dear sirs he talks charmingly dances divinely rides with the air of a commanderinchief has the most natural grand pose possible without ceasing for a moment to be the young english gentleman he is alcibiades fresh from a louis iv perruquier could not surpass him whatever you please i could outdo you in sublime comparisons were i minded to pelt him have you noticed that he has a leg so might it be amplified a simpleseeming word of this import is the triumph of the spiritual and where it passes for coin of value the society has reached a high refinement arcadian by the aesthetic route observation of willoughby was not as miss eleanor patterne pointed out to lady culmer drawn down to the leg but directed to estimate him from the leg upward that however is prosaic dwell a short space on mrs mountstuarts word and whither into what fair region and with how decorously voluptuous a sensation do not we fly who have through mournful veneration of the martyr charles a coy attachment to the court of his merrie son where the leg was ribanded with loveknots and reigned oh it was a naughty court yet have we dreamed of it as the period when an english cavalier was grace incarnate far from the boor now hustling us in another sphere beautifully mannered every gesture dulcet and if the ladies were we will hope they have been traduced but if they were if they were too tender ah gentlemen were gentlemen thenworth perishing for there is this dream in the english country and it must be an aspiration after some form of melodious gentlemanliness which is imagined to have inhabited the island at one time as among our poets the dream of the period of a circle of chivalry here is encouraged for the pleasure of the imagination mrs mountstuart touched a thrilling chord in spite of mens hateful modern costume you see he has a leg that is the leg of the born cavalier is before you and obscure it as you will dress degenerately there it is for ladies who have eyes you see it or you see he has it miss isabel and miss eleanor disputed the incidence of the emphasis but surely though a slight difference of meaning may be heard either will do many with a good show of reason throw the accent upon leg and the ladies knew for a fact that willoughbys leg was exquisite he had a cavalier courtsuit in his wardrobe mrs mountstuart signified that the leg was to be seen because it was a burning leg there it is and it will shine through he has the leg of rochester buckingham dorset suckling the leg that smiles that winks is obsequious to you yet perforce of beauty selfsatisfied that twinkles to a tender midway between imperiousness and seductiveness audacity and discretion between you shall worship me and i am devoted to you is your lord your slave alternately and in one it is a leg of ebb and flow and hightide ripples such a leg when it has done with pretending to retire will walk straight into the hearts of women nothing so fatal to them selfsatisfied it must be humbleness does not win multitudes or the sex it must be vain to have a sheen captivating melodies to prove to you the unavoidableness of selfsatisfaction when you know that you have hit perfection listen to them closely have an inner pipe of that conceit almost ludicrous when you detect the chirp and you need not be reminded that he has the leg without the naughtiness you see eminent in him what we would fain have brought about in a nation that has lost its leg in gaining a possibly cleaner morality and that is often contested but there is no doubt of the loss of the leg well footmen and courtiers and scottish highlanders and the corps de ballet draymen too have legs and staring legs shapely enough but what are they not the modulated instrument we meansimply legs for legwork dumb as the brutes our cavaliers is the poetic leg a portent a valiance he has it as cicero had a tongue it is a lute to scatter songs to his mistress a rapier is she obdurate in sooth a leg with brains in it soul and its shadows are an ambush its lights a surprise it blushes it pales can whisper exclaim it is a peep a part revelation just sufferable of the olympian godjove playing carpetknight for the young sir willoughbys family and his thoughtful admirers it is not too much to say that mrs mountstuarts little word fetched an epoch of our history to colour the evening of his arrival at mans estate he was all that merrie charless court should have been subtracting not a sparkle from what it was under this light he danced and you may consider the effect of it on his company he had received the domestic education of a prince little princes abound in a land of heaped riches where they have not to yield military service to an imperial master they are necessarily here and there dainty during youth sometimes unmanageable and as they are bound in no personal duty to the state each is for himself with full present and what is more luxurious prospective leisure for the practice of that allegiance they are sometimes enervated by it that must be in continental countries happily our climate and our brave blood precipitate the greater number upon the huntingfield to do the public service of heading the chase of the fox with benefit to their constitutions hence a manly as well as useful race of little princes and willoughby was as manly as any he cultivated himself he would not be outdone in popular accomplishments had the standard of the public taste been set in philosophy and the national enthusiasm centred in philosophers he would at least have worked at books he did work at science and had a laboratory his admirable passion to excel however was chiefly directed in his youth upon sport and so great was the passion in him that it was commonly the presence of rivals which led him to the declaration of love he knew himself nevertheless to be the most constant of men in his attachment to the sex he had never discouraged laetitia dales devotion to him and even when he followed in the sweeping tide of the beautiful constantia durham whom mrs mountstuart called the racing cutter he thought of laetitia and looked at her she was a shy violet willoughbys comportment while the showers of adulation drenched him might be likened to the composure of indian gods undergoing worship but unlike them he reposed upon no seat of amplitude to preserve him from a betrayal of intoxication he had to continue tripping dancing exactly balancing himself head to right head to left addressing his idolaters in phrases of perfect choiceness this is only to say that it is easier to be a wooden idol than one in the flesh yet willoughby was equal to his task the little princes education teaches him that he is other than you and by virtue of the instruction he receives and also something we know not what within he is enabled to maintain his posture where you would be tottering urchins upon whose curly pates grave seniors lay their hands with conventional encomium and speculation look older than they are immediately and willoughby looked older than his years not for want of freshness but because he felt that he had to stand eminently and correctly poised hearing of mrs mountstuarts word on him he smiled and said it is at her service the speech was communicated to her and she proposed to attach a dedicatory strip of silk and then they came together and there was wit and repartee suitable to the electrical atmosphere of the dancingroom on the march to a magical hall of supper willoughby conducted mrs mountstuart to the suppertable were i said she twenty years younger i think i would marry you to cure my infatuation then let me tell you in advance madam said he that i will do everything to obtain a new lease of it except divorce you they were infinitely wittier but so much was heard and may be reported it makes the business of choosing a wife for him superhumanly difficult mrs mountstuart observed after listening to the praises she had set going again when the ladies were weeded of us in lady patternes indian room and could converse unhampered upon their own ethereal themes willoughby will choose a wife for himself said his mother chapter iii constantia durham the great question for the county was debated in many households daughterthronged and daughterless long subsequent to the memorable day of willoughbys coming of age lady busshe was for constantia durham she laughed at mrs mountstuart jenkinsons notion of laetitia dale she was a little older than mrs mountstuart and had known willoughbys father whose marriage into the wealthiest branch of the whitford family had been strictly sagacious patternes marry money they are not romantic people she said miss durham had money and she had health and beauty three mighty qualifications for a patterne bride her father sir john durham was a large landowner in the western division of the county a pompous gentleman the picture of a fatherinlaw for willoughby the father of miss dale was a battered army surgeon from india tenant of one of sir willoughbys cottages bordering patterne park his girl was portionless and a poetess her writing of the song in celebration of the young baronets birthday was thought a clever venture bold as only your timid creatures can be bold she let the cat out of her bag of verse before the multitude she almost proposed to her hero in her rhymes she was pretty her eyelashes were long and dark her eyes darkblue and her soul was ready to shoot like a rocket out of them at a look from willoughby and he looked he certainly looked though he did not dance with her once that night and danced repeatedly with miss durham he gave laetitia to vernon whitford for the final dance of the night and he may have looked at her so much in pity of an elegant girl allied to such a partner the phoebus apollo turned fasting friar had entirely forgotten his musical gifts in motion he crossed himself and crossed his bewildered lady and crossed everybody in the figure extorting shouts of cordial laughter from his cousin willoughby be it said that the hour was four in the morning when dancers must laugh at somebody if only to refresh their feet and the wit of the hour administers to the wildest laughter vernon was likened to theseus in the maze entirely dependent upon his ariadne to a fly released from a jampot to a salvage or green man caught in a web of nymphs and made to go the paces willoughby was inexhaustible in the happy similes he poured out to miss durham across the lines of sir roger de coverley and they were not forgotten they procured him a reputation as a convivial sparkler rumour went the round that he intended to give laetitia to vernon for good when he could decide to take miss durham to himself his generosity was famous but that decision though the rope was in the form of a knot seemed reluctant for the conclusive close haul it preferred the state of slackness and if he courted laetitia on behalf of his cousin his cousinly love must have been greater than his passion one had to suppose he was generous enough for it or for marrying the portionless girl himself there was a story of a brilliant young widow of our aristocracy who had very nearly snared him why should he object to marry into our aristocracy mrs mountstuart asked him and he replied that the girls of that class have no money and he doubted the quality of their blood he had his eyes awake his duty to his house was a foremost thought with him and for such a reason he may have been more anxious to give the slim and not robust laetitia to vernon than accede to his personal inclination the mention of the widow singularly offended him notwithstanding the high rank of the lady named a widow he said i he spoke to a widow an oldish one truly but his wrath at the suggestion of his union with a widow led him to be for the moment oblivious of the minor shades of good taste he desired mrs mountstuart to contradict the story in positive terms he repeated his desire he was urgent to have it contradicted and said again a widow straightening his whole figure to the erectness of the letter i she was a widow unmarried a second time and it has been known of the stedfast women who retain the name of their first husband or do not hamper his title with a little new squire at their skirts that they can partially approve the objections indicated by sir willoughby they are thinking of themselves when they do so and they will rarely say i might have married rarely within them will they avow that with their permission it might have been they can catch an idea of a gentlemans view of the widows cap but a niceness that could feel sharply wounded by the simple rumour of his alliance with the young relict of an earl was mystifying sir willoughby unbent his military letter i took a careless glance at itself lounging idly and proudly at ease in the glass of his mind decked with a wanton wreath as he dropped a hint generously vague just to show the origin of the rumour and the excellent basis it had for not being credited he was chidden mrs mountstuart read him a lecture she was however able to contradict the tale of the young countess there is no fear of his marrying her my dears meanwhile there was a fear that he would lose his chance of marrying the beautiful miss durham the dilemmas of little princes are often grave they should be dwelt on now and then for an example to poor struggling commoners of the slings and arrows assailing fortunes most favoured men that we may preach contentment to the wretch who cannot muster wherewithal to marry a wife or has done it and trots the streets packladen to maintain the dame and troops of children painfully reared to fill subordinate stations according to our reading a moral is always welcome in a moral country and especially so when silly envy is to be chastised by it the restless craving for change rebuked young sir willoughby then stood in this dilemmaa lady was at either hand of him the only two that had ever apart from metropolitan conquests not to be recited touched his emotions susceptible to beauty he had never seen so beautiful a girl as constantia durham equally susceptible to admiration of himself he considered laetitia dale a paragon of cleverness he stood between the queenly rose and the modest violet one he bowed to the other bowed to him he could not have both it is the law governing princes and pedestrians alike but which could he forfeit his growing acquaintance with the world taught him to put an increasing price on the sentiments of miss dale still constantias beauty was of a kind to send away beholders aching she had the glory of the racing cutter full sail on a whining breeze and she did not court to win him she flew in his more reflective hour the attractiveness of that lady which held the mirror to his features was paramount but he had passionate snatches when the magnetism of the flyer drew him in her wake further to add to the complexity he loved his liberty he was princelier free he had more subjects more slaves he ruled arrogantly in the world of women he was more himself his metropolitan experiences did not answer to his liking the particular question do we bind the woman down to us idolatrously by making a wife of her in the midst of his deliberations a report of the hot pursuit of miss durham casually mentioned to him by lady busshe drew an immediate proposal from sir willoughby she accepted him and they were engaged she had been nibbled at all but eaten up while he hung dubitative and though that was the cause of his winning her it offended his niceness she had not come to him out of cloistral purity out of perfect radiancy spiritually likewise was he a little prince a despotic prince he wished for her to have come to him out of an eggshell somewhat more astonished at things than a chicken but as completely enclosed before he tapped the shell and seeing him with her sexs eyes first of all men she talked frankly of her cousins and friends young males she could have replied to his bitter wish had you asked me on the night of your twentyfirst birthday willoughby since then she had been in the dust of the world and he conceived his peculiar antipathy destined to be so fatal to him from the earlier hours of his engagement he was quaintly incapable of a jealousy of individuals a young captain oxford had been foremost in the swarm pursuing constantia willoughby thought as little of captain oxford as he did of vernon whitford his enemy was the world the mass which confounds us in a lump which has breathed on her whom we have selected whom we cannot can never rub quite clear of her contact with the abominated crowd the pleasure of the world is to bowl down our soldierly letter i to encroach on our identity soil our niceness to begin to think is the beginning of disgust of the world as soon the engagement was published all the county said that there had not been a chance for laetitia and mrs mountstuart jenkinson humbly remarked in an attitude of penitence im not a witch lady busshe could claim to be one she had foretold the event laetitia was of the same opinion as the county she had looked up but not hopefully she had only looked up to the brightest and as he was the highest how could she have hoped she was the solitary companion of a sick father whose inveterate prognostic of her that she would live to rule at patterne hall tortured the poor girl in proportion as he seemed to derive comfort from it the noise of the engagement merely silenced him recluse invalids cling obstinately to their ideas he had observed sir willoughby in the society of his daughter when the young baronet revived to a sprightly boyishness immediately indeed as big boy and little girl they had played together of old willoughby had been a handsome fair boy the portrait of him at the hall in a hat leaning on his pony with crossed legs and long flaxen curls over his shoulders was the image of her souls most present angel and as a man he hadshe did not suppose intentionallysubjected her nature to bow to him so submissive was she that it was fuller happiness for her to think him right in all his actions than to imagine the circumstances different this may appear to resemble the ecstasy of the devotee of juggernaut it is a form of the passion inspired by little princes and we need not marvel that a conservative sex should assist to keep them in their lofty places what were there otherwise to look up to we should have no dazzling beaconlights if they were levelled and treated as clod earth and it is worth while for here and there a woman to be burned so long as womens general adoration of an ideal young man shall be preserved purity is our demand of them they may justly cry for attraction they cannot have it brighter than in the universal bearing of the eyes of their sisters upon a little prince one who has the ostensible virtues in his pay and can practise them without injuring himself to make himself unsightly let the races of men be byandby astonished at their gods if they please meantime they had better continue to worship laetitia did continue she saw miss durham at patterne on several occasions she admired the pair she had a wish to witness the bridal ceremony she was looking forward to the day with that mixture of eagerness and withholding which we have as we draw nigh the disenchanting termination of an enchanting romance when sir willoughby met her on a sunday morning as she crossed his park solitarily to church they were within ten days of the appointed ceremony he should have been away at miss durhams end of the county he had laetitia knew ridden over to her the day before but there he was and very unwontedly quite surprisingly he presented his arm to conduct laetitia to the churchdoor and talked and laughed in a way that reminded her of a hunting gentleman she had seen once rising to his feet staggering from an ugly fall across hedge and fence into one of the lanes of her short winter walks alls well all sound never better only a scratch the gentleman had said as he reeled and pressed a bleeding head sir willoughby chattered of his felicity in meeting her i am really wonderfully lucky he said and he said that and other things over and over incessantly talking and telling an anecdote of county occurrences and laughing at it with a mouth that would not widen he went on talking in the church porch and murmuring softly some steps up the aisle passing the pews of mrs mountstuart jenkinson and lady busshe of course he was entertaining but what a strangeness it was to laetitia his face would have been half under an antique bonnet it came very close to hers and the scrutiny he bent on her was most solicitous after the service he avoided the great ladies by sauntering up to within a yard or two of where she sat he craved her hand on his arm to lead her forth by the park entrance to the church all the while bending to her discoursing rapidly appearing radiantly interested in her quiet replies with fits of intentness that stared itself out into dim abstraction she hazarded the briefest replies for fear of not having understood him one question she asked miss durham is well i trust and he answered durham and said there is no miss durham to my knowledge the impression he left with her was that he might yesterday during his ride have had an accident and fallen on his head she would have asked that if she had not known him for so thorough an englishman in his dislike to have it thought that accidents could hurt even when they happened to him he called the next day to claim her for a walk he assured her she had promised it and he appealed to her father who could not testify to a promise he had not heard but begged her to leave him to have her walk so once more she was in the park with sir willoughby listening to his raptures over old days a word of assent from her sufficed him i am now myself was one of the remarks he repeated this day she dilated on the beauty of the park and the hall to gratify him he did not speak of miss durham and laetitia became afraid to mention her name at their parting willoughby promised laetitia that he would call on the morrow he did not come and she could well excuse him after her hearing of the tale it was a lamentable tale he had ridden to sir john durhams mansion a distance of thirty miles to hear on his arrival that constantia had quitted her fathers house two days previously on a visit to an aunt in london and had just sent word that she was the wife of captain oxford hussar and messmate of one of her brothers a letter from the bride awaited willoughby at the hall he had ridden back at night not caring how he used his horse in order to get swiftly home so forgetful of himself was he under the terrible blow that was the night of saturday on the day following being sunday he met laetitia in his park led her to church led her out of it and the day after that previous to his disappearance for some weeks was walking with her in full view of the carriages along the road he had indeed you see been very fortunately if not considerately liberated by miss durham he as a man of honour could not have taken the initiative but the frenzy of a jealous girl might urge her to such a course and how little he suffered from it had been shown to the world miss durham the story went was his mothers choice for him against his hearts inclinations which had finally subdued lady patterne consequently there was no longer an obstacle between sir willoughby and miss dale it was a pleasant and romantic story and it put most people in good humour with the countys favourite as his choice of a portionless girl of no position would not have done without the shock of astonishment at the conduct of miss durham and the desire to feel that so prevailing a gentleman was not in any degree pitiable constantia was called that mad thing laetitia broke forth in novel and abundant merits and one of the chief points of requisition in relation to patternea lady willoughby who would entertain well and animate the deadness of the hall became a certainty when her gentleness and liveliness and exceeding cleverness were considered she was often a visitor at the hall by lady patternes express invitation and sometimes on these occasions willoughby was there too superintending the filling up of his laboratory though he was not at home to the county it was not expected that he should be yet he had taken heartily to the pursuit of science and spoke of little else science he said was in our days the sole object worth a devoted pursuit but the sweeping remark could hardly apply to laetitia of whom he was the courteous quiet wooer you behold when a man has broken loose from an unhappy tangle to return to the lady of his first and strongest affections some months of homely courtship ensued and then the decent interval prescribed by the situation having elapsed sir willoughby patterne left his native land on a tour of the globe chapter iv laetitia dale that was another surprise to the county let us not inquire into the feelings of patiently starving women they must obtain some sustenance of their own since as you perceive they live evidently they are not in need of a great amount of nourishment and we may set them down for creatures with a rushlight of animal fire to warm them they cannot have much vitality who are so little exclamatory a corresponding sentiment of patient compassion akin to scorn is provoked by persons having the opportunity for pathos and declining to use it the public bosom was open to laetitia for several weeks and had she run to it to bewail herself she would have been cherished in thankfulness for a country drama there would have been a party against her cold people critical of her pretensions to rise from an unrecognized sphere to be mistress of patterne hall but there would also have been a party against sir willoughby composed of the two or three revolutionists tired of the yoke which are to be found in england when there is a stir a larger number of born sympathetics ever ready to yield the tear for the tear and here and there a samaritan soul prompt to succour poor humanity in distress the opportunity passed undramatized laetitia presented herself at church with a face mildly devout according to her custom and she accepted invitations to the hall she assisted at the reading of willoughbys letters to his family and fed on dry husks of him wherein her name was not mentioned never one note of the summoning call for pathos did this young lady blow so very soon the public bosom closed she had under the fresh interpretation of affairs too small a spirit to be lady willoughby of patterne she could not have entertained becomingly he must have seen that the girl was not the match for him in station and off he went to conquer the remainder of a troublesome first attachment no longer extremely disturbing to judge from the tenour of his letters really incomparable letters lady busshe and mrs mountstuart jenkinson enjoyed a perusal of them sir willoughby appeared as a splendid young representative island lord in these letters to his family despatched from the principal cities of the united states of america he would give them a sketch of our democratic cousins he said such cousins they might all have been in the marines he carried his english standard over that continent and by simply jotting down facts he left an idea of the results of the measurement to his family and friends at home he was an adept in the irony of incongruously grouping the nature of the equality under the stars and stripes was presented in this manner equality reflections came occasionally these cousins of ours are highly amusing i am among the descendants of the roundheads now and then an allusion to old domestic differences in perfect good temper we go on in our way they theirs in the apparent belief that republicanism operates remarkable changes in human nature vernon tries hard to think it does the upper ten of our cousins are the infernal of paris the rest of them is radical england as far as i am acquainted with that section of my countrywhere we compared they were absurd where we contrasted they were monstrous the contrast of vernons letters with willoughbys was just as extreme you could hardly have taken them for relatives travelling together or vernon whitford for a born and bred englishman the same scenes furnished by these two pens might have been sketched in different hemispheres vernon had no irony he had nothing of willoughbys epistolary creative power which causing his family and friends to exclaim how like him that is conjured them across the broad atlantic to behold and clap hands at his lordliness they saw him distinctly as with the naked eye a word a turn of the pen or a word unsaid offered the picture of him in america japan china australia nay the continent of europe holding an english review of his makers grotesques vernon seemed a sheepish fellow without stature abroad glad of a compliment grateful for a dinner endeavouring sadly to digest all he saw and heard but one was a patterne the other a whitford one had genius the other pottered after him with the title of student one was the english gentleman wherever he went the other was a new kind of thing nondescript produced in england of late and not likely to come to much good himself or do much good to the country vernons dancing in america was capitally described by willoughby adieu to our cousins the latter wrote on his voyage to japan i may possibly have had some vogue in their ballrooms and in showing them an english seat on horseback i must resign myself if i have not been popular among them i could not sing their national songif a congery of states be a nationand i must confess i listened with frigid politeness to their singing of it a great people no doubt adieu to them i have had to tear old vernon away he had serious thoughts of settling means to correspond with some of them on the whole forgetting two or more traits of insolence on the part of his hosts which he cited willoughby escaped pretty comfortably the president had been consciously or not uncivil but one knew his origin upon these interjections placable flicks of the lionly tail addressed to britannia the ruler who expected him in some mildish way to lash terga cauda in retiring sir willoughby patterne passed from a land of alien manners and ever after he spoke of america respectfully and pensively with a tail tucked in as it were his travels were profitable to himself the fact is that there are cousins who come to greatness and must be pacified or they will prove annoying heaven forefend a collision between cousins willoughby returned to his england after an absence of three years on a fair april morning the last of the month he drove along his park palings and by the luck of things laetitia was the first of his friends whom he met she was crossing from field to field with a band of schoolchildren gathering wild flowers for the morrow mayday he sprang to the ground and seized her hand laetitia dale he said he panted your name is sweet english music and you are well the anxious question permitted him to read deeply in her eyes he found the man he sought there squeezed him passionately and let her go saying i could not have prayed for a lovelier homescene to welcome me than you and these children flowergathering i dont believe in chance it was decreed that we should meet do not you think so laetitia breathed faintly of her gladness he begged her to distribute a gold coin among the little ones asked for the names of some of them and repeated mary susan charlotteonly the christian names pray well my dears you will bring your garlands to the hall tomorrow morning and mind early no slugabeds tomorrow i suppose i am browned laetitia he smiled in apology for the foreign sun and murmured with rapture the green of this english country is unsurpassed it is wonderful leave england and be baked if you would appreciate it you cant unless you taste exile as i have donefor how many years how many three said laetitia thirty said he it seems to me that length at least i am immensely older but looking at you i could think it less than three you have not changed you are absolutely unchanged i am bound to hope so i shall see you soon i have much to talk of much to tell you i shall hasten to call on your father i have specially to speak with him iwhat happiness this is laetitia but i must not forget i have a mother adieu for some hoursnot for many he pressed her hand again he was gone she dismissed the children to their homes plucking primroses was hard labour nowa dusty business she could have wished that her planet had not descended to earth his presence agitated her so but his enthusiastic patriotism was like a shower that in the spring season of the year sweeps against the hardbinding east and melts the air and brings out new colours makes life flow and her thoughts recurred in wonderment to the behaviour of constantia durham that was laetitias manner of taking up her weakness once more she could almost have reviled the woman who had given this beneficent magician this pathetic exile of the aristocratic sunburned visage and deeply scrutinizing eyes cause for grief how deeply his eyes could read the starveling of patience awoke to the idea of a feast the sense of hunger came with it and hope came and patience fled she would have rejected hope to keep patience nigh her but surely it can not always be winter said her reasoning blood and we must excuse her as best we can if she was assured by her restored warmth that willoughby came in the order of the revolving seasons marking a long winter past he had specially to speak with her father he had said what could that mean what butshe dared not phrase it or view it at their next meeting she was miss dale a week later he was closeted with her father mr dale in the evening of that pregnant day eulogized sir willoughby as a landlord a new lease of the cottage was to be granted him on the old terms he said except that sir willoughby had congratulated him in the possession of an excellent daughter their interview was one of landlord and tenant it appeared and laetitia said so we shall not have to leave the cottage in a tone of satisfaction while she quietly gave a wrench to the neck of the young hope in her breast at night her diary received the line this day i was a fool tomorrow tomorrow and many days afterwards there were dashes instead of words patience travelled back to her sullenly as we must have some kind of food and she had nothing else she took to that and found it dryer than of yore it is a composing but a lean dietary the dead are patient and we get a certain likeness to them in feeding on it unintermittingly overlong her hollowed cheeks with the fallen leaf in them pleaded against herself to justify her idol for not looking down on one like her she saw him when he was at the hall he did not notice any change he was exceedingly gentle and courteous more than once she discovered his eyes dwelling on her and then he looked hurriedly at his mother and laetitia had to shut her mind from thinking lest thinking should be a sin and hope a guilty spectre but had his mother objected to her she could not avoid asking herself his tour of the globe had been undertaken at his mothers desire she was an ambitious lady in failing health and she wished to have him living with her at patterne yet seemed to agree that he did wisely to reside in london one day sir willoughby in the quiet manner which was his humour informed her that he had become a country gentleman he had abandoned london he loathed it as the burialplace of the individual man he intended to sit down on his estates and have his cousin vernon whitford to assist him in managing them he said and very amusing was his description of his cousins shifts to live by literature and add enough to a beggarly income to get his usual two months of the year in the alps previous to his great tour willoughby had spoken of vernons judgement with derision nor was it entirely unknown that vernon had offended his family pride by some extravagant act but after their return he acknowledged vernons talents and seemed unable to do without him the new arrangement gave laetitia a companion for her walks pedestrianism was a sour business to willoughby whose exclamation of the word indicated a willingness for any amount of exercise on horseback but she had no horse and so while he hunted laetitia and vernon walked and the neighbourhood speculated on the circumstances until the ladies eleanor and isabel patterne engaged her more frequently for carriage exercise and sir willoughby was observed riding beside them a real and sunny pleasure befell laetitia in the establishment of young crossjay patterne under her roof the son of the lieutenant now captain of marines a boy of twelve with the sprights of twelve boys in him for whose board and lodgement vernon provided by arrangement with her father vernon was one of your men that have no occupation for their money no bills to pay for repair of their property and are insane to spend he had heard of captain patternes large family and proposed to have his eldest boy at the hall to teach him but willoughby declined to house the son of such a father predicting that the boys hair would be red his skin eruptive and his practices detestable so vernon having obtained mr dales consent to accommodate this youth stalked off to devonport and brought back a rosycheeked roundbodied rogue of a boy who fell upon meats and puddings and defeated them with a captivating simplicity in his confession that he had never had enough to eat in his life he had gone through a training for a plentiful table at first after a number of helps young crossjay would sit and sigh heavily in contemplation of the unfinished dish subsequently he told his host and hostess that he had two sisters above his own age and three brothers and two sisters younger than he all hungry said die boy his pathos was most comical it was a good month before he could see pudding taken away from table without a sigh of regret that he could not finish it as deputy for the devonport household the pranks of the little fellow and his revel in a country life and muddy wildness in it amused laetitia from morning to night she when she had caught him taught him in the morning vernon favoured by the chase in the afternoon young crossjay would have enlivened any household he was not only indolent he was opposed to the acquisition of knowledge through the medium of books and would say but i dont want to in a tone to make a logician thoughtful nature was very strong in him he had on each return of the hour for instruction to be plucked out of the earth rank of the soil like a root for the exercise of his big round headpiece on those tyrannous puzzles but the habits of birds and the place for their eggs and the management of rabbits and the tickling of fish and poaching joys with combative boys of the district and how to wheedle a cook for a luncheon for a whole day in the rain he soon knew of his great nature his passion for our naval service was a means of screwing his attention to lessons after he had begun to understand that the desert had to be traversed to attain midshipmans rank he boasted ardently of his fighting father and chancing to be near the hall as he was talking to vernon and laetitia of his father he propounded a question close to his heart and he put it in these words following my fathers the one to lead an army when he paused i say mr whitford sir willoughbys kind to me and gives me crownpieces why wouldnt he see my father and my father came here ten miles in the rain to see him and had to walk ten miles back and sleep at an inn the only answer to be given was that sir willoughby could not have been at home oh my father saw him and sir willoughby said he was not at home the boy replied producing an odd ring in the ear by his repetition of not at home in the same voice as the apology plainly innocent of malice vernon told laetitia however that the boy never asked an explanation of sir willoughby unlike the horse of the adage it was easier to compel young crossjay to drink of the waters of instruction than to get him to the brink his heart was not so antagonistic as his nature and by degrees owing to a proper mixture of discipline and cajolery he imbibed he was whistling at the cooks windows after a day of wicked truancy on an april night and reported adventures over the supper supplied to him laetitia entered the kitchen with a reproving forefinger he jumped to kiss her and went on chattering of a place fifteen miles distant where he had seen sir willoughby riding with a young lady the impossibility that the boy should have got so far on foot made laetitia doubtful of his veracity until she heard that a gentleman had taken him up on the road in a gig and had driven him to a farm to show him strings of birds eggs and stuffed birds of every english kind kingfishers yaffles black woodpeckers goatsucker owls more mouth than head with dusty darkspotted wings like moths all very circumstantial still in spite of his tea at the farm and ride back by rail at the gentlemans expense the tale seemed fictitious to laetitia until crossjay related how that he had stood to salute on the road to the railway and taken off his cap to sir willoughby and sir willoughby had passed him not noticing him though the young lady did and looked back and nodded the hue of truth was in that picture strange eclipse when the hue of truth comes shadowing over our bright ideal planet it will not seem the planets fault but truths reality is the offender delusion our treasure that we are robbed of then begins with us the term of wilful delusion and its necessary accompaniment of the disgust of reality exhausting the heart much more than patient endurance of starvation hints were dropping about the neighbourhood the hedgeways twittered the treetops cawed mrs mountstuart jenkinson was loud on the subject patterne is to have a mistress at last you say but there never was a doubt of his marryinghe must marry and so long as he does not marry a foreign woman we have no cause to complain he met her at cherriton both were struck at the same moment her father is i hear some sort of learned man money no land no house either i believe people who spend half their time on the continent they are now for a year at upton park the very girl to settle down and entertain when she does think of settling eighteen perfect manners you need not ask if a beauty sir willoughby will have his dues we must teach her to make amends to himbut dont listen to lady busshe he was too young at twentythree or twentyfour no young man is ever jilted he is allowed to escape a young man married is a fireeater bound over to keep the peace if he keeps it he worries it at thirtyone or thirtytwo he is ripe for his command because he knows how to bend and sir willoughby is a splendid creature only wanting a wife to complete him for a man like that to go on running about would never do soberlyno it would soon be getting ridiculous he has been no worse than other men probably betterinfinitely more excusable but now we have him and it was time we should i shall see her and study her sharply you may be sure though i fancy i can rely on his judgement in confirmation of the swelling buzz the rev dr middleton and his daughter paid a flying visit to the hall where they were seen only by the members of the patterne family young crossjay had a short conversation with miss middleton and ran to the cottage full of hershe loved the navy and had a merry face she had a smile of very pleasant humour according to vernon the young lady was outlined to laetitia as tall elegant lively and painted as carrying youth like a flag with her smile of very pleasant humour she could not but be winning vernon spoke more of her father a scholar of high repute happily a scholar of an independent fortune his maturer recollection of miss middleton grew poetic or he described her in an image to suit a poetic end she gives you an idea of the mountain echo doctor middleton has one of the grandest heads in england what is her christian name said laetitia he thought her christian name was clara laetitia went to bed and walked through the day conceiving the mountain echo the swift wild spirit clara by name sent fleeting on a far half circle by the voice it is roused to subserve sweeter than beautiful high above drawingroom beauties as the colours of the sky and if at the same time elegant and of loveable smiling could a man resist her to inspire the title of mountain echo in any mind a young lady must be singularly spiritualized her father doated on her vernon said who would not it seemed an additional cruelty that the grace of a poetical attractiveness should be round her for this was robbing laetitia of some of her own little fortune mystical though that might be but a man like sir willoughby had claims on poetry possessing as he did every manly grace and to think that miss middleton had won him by virtue of something native to her likewise though mystically touched laetitia with a faint sense of relationship to the chosen girl what is in me he sees on her it decked her pride to think so as a wreath on the gravestone she encouraged her imagination to brood over clara and invested her designedly with romantic charms in spite of pain the ascetic zealot hugs his share of heavenmost bitter most blessedin his hairshirt and scourge and laetitias happiness was to glorify clara through that chosen rival through her comprehension of the spirit of sir willoughbys choice of one such as clara she was linked to him yet her mood of ecstatic fidelity was a dangerous exaltation one that in a desert will distort the brain and in the world where the idol dwells will put him should he come nigh to its own furnacetest and get a clear brain out of a burnt heart she was frequently at the hall helping to nurse lady patterne sir willoughby had hitherto treated her as a dear insignificant friend to whom it was unnecessary that he should mention the object of his rides to upton park he had however in the contemplation of what he was gaining fallen into anxiety about what he might be losing she belonged to his brilliant youth her devotion was the bride of his youth he was a man who lived backward almost as intensely as in the present and notwithstanding laetitias praiseworthy zeal in attending on his mother he suspected some unfaithfulness hardly without cause she had not looked paler of late her eyes had not reproached him the secret of the old days between them had been as little concealed as it was exposed she might have buried it after the way of woman whose bosoms can be tombs if we and the world allow them to be absolutely sepulchres where you lie dead ghastly even if not dead and horrible to think of you may be lying cold somewhere in a corner even if embalmed you may not be much visited and how is the world to know you are embalmed you are no better than a rotting wretch to the world that does not have peeps of you in the womans breast and see lights burning and an occasional exhibition of the services of worship there are womentell us not of her of ephesusthat have embalmed you and have quitted the world to keep the tapers alight and a stranger comes and they who have your image before them will suddenly blow out the vestal flames and treat you as dust to fatten the garden of their bosoms for a fresh flower of love sir willoughby knew it he had experience of it in the form of the stranger and he knew the strangers feelings toward his predecessor and the lady he waylaid laetitia to talk of himself and his plans the project of a run to italy enviable yes but in england you live the higher moral life italy boasts of sensual beauty the spiritual is yours i know italy well i have often wished to act as a cicerone to you there as it is i suppose i shall be with those who know the land as well as i do and will not be particularly enthusiasticif you are what you were he was guilty of this perplexing twist from one person to another in a sentence more than once while he talked exclusively of himself it seemed to her a condescension in time he talked principally of her beginning with her admirable care of his mother and he wished to introduce a miss middleton to her he wanted her opinion of miss middleton he relied on her intuition of character had never known it err if i supposed it could err miss dale i should not be so certain of myself i am bound up in my good opinion of you you see and you must continue the same or where shall i be thus he was led to dwell upon friendship and the charm of the friendship of men and women platonism as it was called i have laughed at it in the world but not in the depth of my heart the worlds platonic attachments are laughable enough you have taught me that the ideal of friendship is possiblewhen we find two who are capable of a disinterested esteem the rest of life is duty duty to parents duty to country but friendship is the holiday of those who can be friends wives are plentiful friends are rare i know how rare laetitia swallowed her thoughts as they sprang up why was he torturing herto give himself a holiday she could bear to lose himshe was used to itand bear his indifference but not that he should disfigure himself it made her poor it was as if he required an oath of her when he said italy but i shall never see a day in italy to compare with the day of my return to england or know a pleasure so exquisite as your welcome of me will you be true to that may i look forward to just another such meeting he pressed her for an answer she gave the best she could he was dissatisfied and to her hearing it was hardly in the tone of manliness that he entreated her to reassure him he womanized his language she had to say i am afraid i can not undertake to make it an appointment sir willoughby before he recovered his alertness which he did for he was anything but obtuse with the reply you would keep it if you promised and freeze at your post so as accidents happen we must leave it to fate the wills the thing you know my detestation of changes at least i have you for my tenant and wherever i am i see your light at the end of my park neither my father nor i would willingly quit ivy cottage said laetitia so far then he murmured you will give me a long notice and it must be with my consent if you think of quitting i could almost engage to do that she said you love the place yes i am the most contented of cottagers i believe miss dale it would be well for my happiness were i a cottager that is the dream of the palace but to be one and not to wish to be other is quiet sleep in comparison you paint a cottage in colours that tempt one to run from big houses and households you would run back to them faster sir willoughby you may know me said he bowing and passing on contentedly he stopped but i am not ambitious perhaps you are too proud for ambition sir willoughby you hit me to the life he passed on regretfully clara middleton did not study and know him like laetitia dale laetitia was left to think it pleased him to play at cat and mouse she had not hit him to the life or she would have marvelled in acknowledging how sincere he was at her next sitting by the bedside of lady patterne she received a certain measure of insight that might have helped her to fathom him if only she could have kept her feelings down the old lady was affectionately confidential in talking of her one subject her son and here is another dashing girl my dear she has money and health and beauty and so has he and it appears a fortunate union i hope and pray it may be but we begin to read the world when our eyes grow dim because we read the plain lines and i ask myself whether money and health and beauty on both sides have not been the mutual attraction we tried it before and that girl durham was honest whatever we may call her i should have desired an appreciative thoughtful partner for him a woman of mind with another sort of wealth and beauty she was honest she ran away in time there was a worse thing possible than that and now we have the same chapter and the same kind of person who may not be quite as honest and i shall not see the end of it promise me you will always be good to him be my sons friend his egeria he names you be what you were to him when that girl broke his heart and no one not even his mother was allowed to see that he suffered anything comfort him in his sensitiveness willoughby has the most entire faith in you were that destroyedi shudder you are he says and he has often said his image of the constant woman laetitias hearing took in no more she repeated to herself for days his image of the constant woman now when he was a second time forsaking her his praise of her constancy wore the painful ludicrousness of the look of a whimper on the face chapter v clara middleton the great meeting of sir willoughby patterne and miss middleton had taken place at cherriton grange the seat of a county grandee where this young lady of eighteen was first seen rising above the horizon she had money and health and beauty the triune of perfect starriness which makes all men astronomers he looked on her expecting her to look at him but as soon as he looked he found that he must be in motion to win a look in return he was one of a pack many were ahead of him the whole of them were eager he had to debate within himself how best to communicate to her that he was willoughby patterne before her gloves were too much soiled to flatter his niceness for here and there all around she was yielding her hand to partnersobscurant males whose touch leaves a stain far too generally gracious was her starriness to please him the effect of it nevertheless was to hurry him with all his might into the heat of the chase while yet he knew no more of her than that he was competing for a prize and willoughby patterne was only one of dozens to the young lady a deeper student of science than his rivals he appreciated natures compliment in the fair ones choice of you we now scientifically know that in this department of the universal struggle success is awarded to the bettermost you spread a handsomer tail than your fellows you dress a finer topknot you pipe a newer note have a longer stride she reviews you in competition and selects you the superlative is magnetic to her she may be looking elsewhere and you will seethe superlative will simply have to beckon away she glides she cannot help herself it is her nature and her nature is the guarantee for the noblest races of men to come of her in complimenting you she is a promise of superior offspring science thusor it is better to sayan acquaintance with science facilitates the cultivation of aristocracy consequently a successful pursuit and a wresting of her from a body of competitors tells you that you are the best man what is more it tells the world so willoughby aired his amiable superlatives in the eye of miss middleton he had a leg he was the heir of successful competitors he had a style a tone an artist tailor an authority of manner he had in the hopeful ardour of the chase among a multitude a freshness that gave him advantage and together with his undeviating energy when there was a prize to be won and possessed these were scarce resistible he spared no pains for he was adust and athirst for the winningpost he courted her father aware that men likewise and parents preeminently have their preference for the larger offer the deeper pocket the broader lands the respectfuller consideration men after their fashion as well as women distinguish the bettermost and aid him to succeed as dr middleton certainly did in the crisis of the memorable question proposed to his daughter within a month of willoughbys reception at upton park the young lady was astonished at his whirlwind wooing of her and bent to it like a sapling she begged for time willoughby could barely wait she unhesitatingly owned that she liked no one better and he consented a calm examination of his position told him that it was unfair so long as he stood engaged and she did not she pleaded a desire to see a little of the world before she plighted herself she alarmed him he assumed the amazing god of love under the subtlest guise of the divinity willingly would he obey her behests resignedly languish were it not for his mothers desire to see the future lady of patterne established there before she died love shone cunningly through the mask of filial duty but the plea of urgency was reasonable dr middleton thought it reasonable supposing his daughter to have an inclination she had no disinclination though she had a maidenly desire to see a little of the worldgrace for one year she said willoughby reduced the year to six months and granted that term for which in gratitude she submitted to stand engaged and that was no light whispering of a word she was implored to enter the state of captivity by the pronunciation of vowsa private but a binding ceremonial she had health and beauty and money to gild these gifts not that he stipulated for money with his bride but it adds a lustre to dazzle the world and moreover the pack of rival pursuers hung close behind yelping and raising their dolorous throats to the moon captive she must be he made her engagement no light whispering matter it was a solemn plighting of a troth why not having said i am yours she could say i am wholly yours i am yours forever i swear it i will never swerve from it i am your wife in heart yours utterly our engagement is written above to this she considerately appended as far as i am concerned a piece of somewhat chilling generosity and he forced her to pass him through loves catechism in turn and came out with fervent answers that bound him to her too indissolubly to let her doubt of her being loved and i am loved she exclaimed to her hearts echoes in simple faith and wonderment hardly had she begun to think of love ere the apparition arose in her path she had not thought of love with any warmth and here it was she had only dreamed of love as one of the distant blessings of the mighty world lying somewhere in the worlds forests across wild seas veiled encompassed with beautiful perils a throbbing secrecy but too remote to quicken her bosoms throbs her chief idea of it was the enrichment of the world by love thus did miss middleton acquiesce in the principle of selection and then did the best man of a host blow his triumphant horn and loudly he looked the fittest he justified the dictum of science the survival of the patternes was assured i would he said to his admirer mrs mountstuart jenkinson have bargained for health above everything but she has everything besideslineage beauty breeding is what they call an heiress and is the most accomplished of her sex with a delicate art he conveyed to the ladys understanding that miss middleton had been snatched from a crowd without a breath of the crowd having offended his niceness he did it through sarcasm at your modern young women who run about the world nibbling and nibbled at until they know one sex as well as the other and are not a whit less cognizant of the market than men pure possibly it is not so easy to say innocent decidedly not our feminine ideal miss middleton was different she was the true ideal freshgathered morning fruit in a basket warranted by her bloom women do not defend their younger sisters for doing what they perhaps have donelifting a veil to be seen and peeping at a world where innocence is as poor a guarantee as a babes caul against shipwreck women of the world never think of attacking the sensual stipulation for perfect bloom silver purity which is redolent of the oriental origin of the lovepassion of their lords mrs mountstuart congratulated sir willoughby on the prize he had won in the fair westerneastern let me see her she said and miss middleton was introduced and critically observed she had the mouth that smiles in repose the lips met full on the centre of the bow and thinned along to a lifting dimple the eyelids also lifted slightly at the outer corners and seemed like the lip into the limpid cheek quickening up the temples as with a run of light or the ascension indicated off a shoot of colour her features were playfellows of one another none of them pretending to rigid correctness nor the nose to the ordinary dignity of governess among merry girls despite which the nose was of a fair design not acutely interrogative or inviting to gambols aspens imaged in water waiting for the breeze would offer a susceptible lover some suggestion of her face a pure smoothwhite face tenderly flushed in the cheeks where the gentle dints were faintly intermelting even during quietness her eyes were brown set well between mild lids often shadowed not unwakeful her hair of lighter brown swelling above her temples on the sweep to the knot imposed the triangle of the fabulous wild woodland visage from brow to mouth and chin evidently in agreement with her taste and the triangle suited her but her face was not significant of a tameless wildness or of weakness her equable shut mouth threw its long curve to guard the small round chin from that effect her eyes wavered only in humour they were steady when thoughtfulness was awakened and at such seasons the build of her winterbeechwood hair lost the touch of nymphlike and whimsical and strangely by mere outline added to her appearance of studious concentration observe the hawk on stretched wings over the prey he spies for an idea of this change in the look of a young lady whom vernon whitford could liken to the mountain echo and mrs mountstuart jenkinson pronounced to be a dainty rogue in porcelain vernons fancy of her must have sprung from her prompt and most musical responsiveness he preferred the society of her learned father to that of a girl under twenty engaged to his cousin but the charm of her ready tongue and her voice was to his intelligent understanding wit natural wit crystal wit as opposed to the pastesparkle of the wit of the town in his encomiums he did not quote miss middletons wit nevertheless he ventured to speak of it to mrs mountstuart causing that lady to say ah well i have not noticed the wit you may have the art of drawing it out no one had noticed the wit the corrupted hearing of people required a collision of sounds vernon supposed for his part to prove their excellence he recollected a great many of miss middletons remarks they came flying to him and so long as he forbore to speak them aloud they had a curious wealth of meaning it could not be all her manner however much his own manner might spoil them it might be to a certain degree her quickness at catching the hue and shade of evanescent conversation possibly by remembering the whole of a conversation wherein she had her place the wit was to be tested only how could any one retain the heavy portion as there was no use in being argumentative on a subject affording him personally and apparently solitarily refreshment and enjoyment vernon resolved to keep it to himself the eulogies of her beauty a possession in which he did not consider her so very conspicuous irritated him in consequence to flatter sir willoughby it was the fashion to exalt her as one of the types of beauty the one providentially selected to set off his masculine type she was compared to those delicate flowers the ladies of the court of china on ricepaper a little french dressing would make her at home on the sward by the fountain among the lutes and whispers of the bewitching silken shepherdesses who live though they never were lady busshe was reminded of the favourite lineaments of the women of leonardo the angels of luini lady culmer had seen crayon sketches of demoiselles of the french aristocracy resembling her some one mentioned an antique statue of a figure breathing into a flute and the mouth at the flutestop might have a distant semblance of the bend of her mouth but this comparison was repelled as grotesque for once mrs mountstuart jenkinson was unsuccessful her dainty rogue in porcelain displeased sir willoughby why rogue he said the ladys fame for hitting the mark fretted him and the grace of his brides fine bearing stood to support him in his objection clara was young healthy handsome she was therefore fitted to be his wife the mother of his children his companion picture certainly they looked well side by side in walking with her in drooping to her the whole man was made conscious of the female image of himself by her exquisite unlikeness she completed him added the softer lines wanting to his portrait before the world he had wooed her rageingly he courted her becomingly with the manly selfpossession enlivened by watchful tact which is pleasing to girls he never seemed to undervalue himself in valuing her a secret priceless in the courtship of young women that have heads the lover doubles their sense of personal worth through not forfeiting his own those were proud and happy days when he rode black norman over to upton park and his lady looked forth for him and knew him coming by the faster beating of her heart her mind too was receptive she took impressions of his characteristics and supplied him a feast she remembered his chance phrases noted his ways his peculiarities as no one of her sex had done he thanked his cousin vernon for saying she had wit she had it and of so high a flavour that the more he thought of the epigram launched at her the more he grew displeased with the wit to understand him and the heart to worship she had a dignity rarely seen in young ladies why rogue he insisted with mrs mountstuart i saidin porcelain she replied rogue perplexes me porcelain explains it she has the keenest sense of honour i am sure she is a paragon of rectitude she has a beautiful bearing the carriage of a young princess i find her perfect and still she may be a dainty rogue in porcelain are you judging by the mind or the person maam both and which is which theres no distinction rogue and mistress of patterne do not go together why not she will be a novelty to our neighbourhood and an animation of the hall to be frank rogue does not rightly match with me take her for a supplement you like her in love with her i can imagine lifelong amusement in her company attend to my advice prize the porcelain and play with the rogue sir willoughby nodded unilluminated there was nothing of rogue in himself so there could be nothing of it in his bride elfishness tricksiness freakishness were antipathetic to his nature and he argued that it was impossible he should have chosen for his complement a person deserving the title it would not have been sanctioned by his guardian genius his closer acquaintance with miss middleton squared with his first impressions you know that this is convincing the common jury justifies the presentation of the case to them by the grand jury and his original conclusion that she was essentially feminine in other words a parasite and a chalice claras conduct confirmed from day to day he began to instruct her in the knowledge of himself without reserve and she as she grew less timid with him became more reflective i judge by character he said to mrs mountstuart if you have caught the character of a girl said she i think i am not far off it so it was thought by the man who dived for the moon in a well how women despise their sex not a bit she has no character yet you are forming it and pray be advised and be merry the solid is your safest guide physiognomy and manners will give you more of a girls character than all the divings you can do she is a charming young woman only she is one of that sort of what sort sir willoughby asked impatiently rogues in porcelain i am persuaded i shall never comprehend it i cannot help you one bit further the word rogue it was dainty rogue brittle would you say i am quite unable to say an innocent naughtiness prettily moulded in a delicate substance you are thinking of some piece of dresden you suppose her to resemble i dare say artificial you would not have her natural i am heartily satisfied with her from head to foot my dear mrs mountstuart nothing could be better and sometimes she will lead and generally you will lead and everything will go well my dear sir willoughby like all rapid phrasers mrs mountstuart detested the analysis of her sentence it had an outline in vagueness and was flung out to be apprehended not dissected her directions for the reading of miss middletons character were the same that she practised in reading sir willoughbys whose physiognomy and manners bespoke him what she presumed him to be a splendidly proud gentleman with good reason mrs mountstuarts advice was wiser than her procedure for she stopped short where he declined to begin he dived below the surface without studying that indexpage he had won miss middletons hand he believed he had captured her heart but he was not so certain of his possession of her soul and he went after it our enamoured gentleman had therefore no tally of natures writing above to set beside his discoveries in the deeps now it is a dangerous accompaniment of this habit of driving that where we do not light on the discoveries we anticipate we fall to work sowing and planting which becomes a disturbance of the gentle bosom miss middletons features were legible as to the mainspring of her character he could have seen that she had a spirit with a natural love of liberty and required the next thing to liberty spaciousness if she was to own allegiance those features unhappily instead of serving for an introduction to the within were treated as the mirror of himself they were indeed of an amiable sweetness to tempt an accepted lover to angle for the first person in the second but he had made the discovery that their minds differed on one or two points and a difference of view in his bride was obnoxious to his repose he struck at it recurringly to show her error under various aspects he desired to shape her character to the feminine of his own and betrayed the surprise of a slight disappointment at her advocacy of her ideas she said immediately it is not too late willoughby and wounded him for he wanted her simply to be material in his hands for him to mould her he had no other thought he lectured her on the theme of the infinity of love how was it not too late they were plighted they were one eternally they could not be parted she listened gravely conceiving the infinity as a narrow dwelling where a voice droned and ceased not however she listened she became an attentive listener chapter vi his courtship the world was the principal topic of dissension between these lovers his opinion of the world affected her like a creature threatened with a deprivation of air he explained to his darling that lovers of necessity do loathe the world they live in the world they accept its benefits and assist it as well as they can in their hearts they must despise it shut it out that their love for one another may pour in a clear channel and with all the force they have they cannot enjoy the sense of security for their love unless they fence away the world it is you will allow gross it is a beast formally we thank it for the good we get of it only we two have an inner temple where the worship we conduct is actually if you would but see it an excommunication of the world we abhor that beast to adore that divinity this gives us our oneness our isolation our happiness this is to love with the soul do you see darling she shook her head she could not see it she would admit none of the notorious errors of the world its backbiting selfishness coarseness intrusiveness infectiousness she was young she might willoughby thought have let herself be led she was not docile she must be up in arms as a champion of the world and one saw she was hugging her dream of a romantic world nothing else she spoilt the secret bowersong he delighted to tell over to her and how powers of love is lovemaking to be pursued if we may not kick the world out of our bower and wash our hands of it love that does not spurn the world when lovers curtain themselves is a loveis it not sothat seems to the unwhipped scoffing world to go slinking into basiations obscurity instead of on a glorious march behind the screen our hero had a strong sentiment as to the policy of scorning the world for the sake of defending his personal pride and to his honour be it said his ladys delicacy the act of seeming put them both above the world said retro sathanas so much as a piece of tactics he was highly civilized in the second instance he knew it to be the world which must furnish the dry sticks for the bonfire of a womans worship he knew too that he was prescribing poetry to his betrothed practicable poetry she had a liking for poetry and sometimes quoted the stuff in defiance of his pursed mouth and pained murmur i am no poet but his poetry of the enclosed and fortified bower without nonsensical rhymes to catch the ears of women appeared incomprehensible to her if not adverse she would not burn the world for him she would not though a purer poetry is little imaginable reduce herself to ashes or incense or essence in honour of him and so by loves transmutation literally be the man she was to marry she preferred to be herself with the egoism of women she said it she said i must be myself to be of any value to you willoughby he was indefatigable in his lectures on the aesthetics of love frequently for an indemnification to her he had no desire that she should be a loser by ceasing to admire the world he dwelt on his own youthful ideas and his original fancies about the world were presented to her as a substitute for the theme miss middleton bore it well for she was sure that he meant well bearing so well what was distasteful to her she became less well able to bear what she had merely noted in observation before his view of scholarship his manner toward mr vernon whitford of whom her father spoke warmly the rumour concerning his treatment of a miss dale and the country tale of constantia durham sang itself to her in a new key he had no contempt for the worlds praises mr whitford wrote the letters to the county paper which gained him applause at various great houses and he accepted it and betrayed a tingling fright lest he should be the victim of a sneer of the world he contemned recollecting his remarks her mind was afflicted by the something illogical in him that we readily discover when our natures are no longer running free and then at once we yearn for a disputation she resolved that she would one day one distant day provoke itupon what the special point eluded her the world is too huge a client and too pervious too spotty for a girl to defend against a man that something illogical had stirred her feelings more than her intellect to revolt she could not constitute herself the advocate of mr whitford still she marked the disputation for an event to come meditating on it she fell to picturing sir willoughbys face at the first accents of his brides decided disagreement with him the picture once conjured up would not be laid he was handsome so correctly handsome that a slight unfriendly touch precipitated him into caricature his habitual air of happy pride of indignant contentment rather could easily be overdone surprise when he threw emphasis on it stretched him with the tall eyebrows of a masklimitless under the spell of caricature and in time whenever she was not pleased by her thoughts she had that and not his likeness for the vision of him and it was unjust contrary to her deeper feelings she rebuked herself and as much as her naughty spirit permitted she tried to look on him as the world did an effort inducing reflections upon the blessings of ignorance she seemed to herself beset by a circle of imps hardly responsible for her thoughts he outshone mr whitford in his behaviour to young crossjay she had seen him with the boy and he was amused indulgent almost frolicsome in contradistinction to mr whitfords tutorly sharpness he had the english fathers tone of a liberal allowance for boys tastes and pranks and he ministered to the partiality of the genus for pocketmoney he did not play the schoolmaster like bookworms who get poor little lads in their grasp mr whitford avoided her very much he came to upton park on a visit to her father and she was not particularly sorry that she saw him only at table he treated her by fits to a level scrutiny of deepset eyes unpleasantly penetrating she had liked his eyes they became unbearable they dwelt in the memory as if they had left a phosphorescent line she had been taken by playmate boys in her infancy to peep into hedgeleaves where the motherbird brooded on the nest and the eyes of the bird in that marvellous dark thickset home had sent her away with worlds of fancy mr whitfords gaze revived her susceptibility but not the old happy wondering she was glad of his absence after a certain hour that she passed with willoughby a wretched hour to remember mr whitford had left and willoughby came bringing bad news of his mothers health lady patterne was fast failing her son spoke of the loss she would be to him he spoke of the dreadfulness of death he alluded to his own death to come carelessly with a philosophical air all of us must go our time is short very she assented it sounded like want of feeling if you lose me clara but you are strong willoughby i may be cut off tomorrow do not talk in such a manner it is as well that it should be faced i cannot see what purpose it serves should you lose me my love willoughby oh the bitter pang of leaving you dear willoughby you are distressed your mother may recover let us hope she will i will help to nurse her i have offered you know i am ready most anxious i believe i am a good nurse it is this beliefthat one does not die with death that is our comfort when we love does it not promise that we meet again to walk the world and see you perhapswith another see mewhere here wedded to another you my bride whom i call mine and you are you would be stillin that horror but all things are possible women are women they swim in infidelity from wave to wave i know them willoughby do not torment yourself and me i beg you he meditated profoundly and asked her could you be such a saint among women i think i am a more than usually childish girl not to forget me oh no still to be mine i am yours to plight yourself it is done be mine beyond death married is married i think clara to dedicate your life to our love never one touch not one whisper not a thought not a dream could youit agonizes me to imagine be inviolate mine abovemine before all men though i am gonetrue to my dust tell me give me that assurance true to my nameoh i hear them his relict buzzings about lady patterne the widow if you knew their talk of widows shut your ears my angel but if she holds them off and keeps her path they are forced to respect her the dead husband is not the dishonoured wretch they fancied him because he was out of their way he lives in the heart of his wife clara my clara as i live in yours whether here or away whether you are a wife or widow there is no distinction for lovei am your husbandsay iteternally i must have peace i cannot endure the pain depressed yes i have cause to be but it has haunted me ever since we joined hands to have youto lose you is it not possible that i may be the first to die said miss middleton and lose you with the thought that you lovely as you are and the dogs of the world barking round you might is it any wonder that i have my feeling for the world this handthe thought is horrible you would be surrounded men are brutes the scent of unfaithfulness excites them overjoys them and i helpless the thought is maddening i see a ring of monkeys grinning there is your beauty and mans delight in desecrating you would be worried night and day to quit my name to i feel the blow now you would have no rest for them nothing to cling to without your oath an oath said miss middleton it is no delusion my love when i tell you that with this thought upon me i see a ring of monkey faces grinning at me they haunt me but you do swear it once and i will never trouble you on the subject again my weakness if you like you will learn that it is love a mans love stronger than death an oath she said and moved her lips to recall what she might have said and forgotten to what what oath that you will be true to me dead as well as living whisper it willoughby i shall be true to my vows at the altar to me me it will be to you to my soul no heaven can be for mei see none only torture unless i have your word clara i trust it i will trust it implicitly my confidence in you is absolute then you need not be troubled it is for you my love that you may be armed and strong when i am not by to protect you our views of the world are opposed willoughby consent gratify me swear it say beyond death whisper it i ask for nothing more women think the husbands grave breaks the bond cuts the tie sets them loose they wed the fleshpah what i call on you for is nobility the transcendent nobility of faithfulness beyond death his widow let them say a saint in widowhood my vows at the altar must suffice you will not clara i am plighted to you not a worda simple promise but you love me i have given you the best proof of it that i can consider how utterly i place confidence in you i hope it is well placed i could kneel to you to worship you if you would clara kneel to heaven not to me willoughby i ami wish i were able to tell what i am i may be inconstant i do not know myself think question yourself whether i am really the person you should marry your wife should have great qualities of mind and soul i will consent to hear that i do not possess them and abide by the verdict you do you do possess them willoughby cried when you know better what the world is you will understand my anxiety alive i am strong to shield you from it dead helplessthat is all you would be clad in mail steelproof inviolable if you would but try to enter into my mind think with me feel with me when you have once comprehended the intensity of the love of a man like me you will not require asking it is the difference of the elect and the vulgar of the ideal of love from the coupling of the herds we will let it drop at least i have your hand as long as i live i have your hand ought i not to be satisfied i am only i see further than most men and feel more deeply and now i must ride to my mothers bedside she dies lady patterne it might have been that she but she is a woman of women with a fatherinlaw just heaven could i have stood by her then with the same feelings of reverence a very little my love and everything gained for us by civilization crumbles we fall back to the first mortarbowl we were bruised and stirred in my thoughts when i take my stand to watch by her come to this conclusion that especially in women distinction is the thing to be aimed at otherwise we are a weltering human mass women must teach us to venerate them or we may as well be bleating and barking and bellowing so now enough you have but to think a little i must be off it may have happened during my absence i will write i shall hear from you come and see me mount black norman my respects to your father i have no time to pay them in person one he took the oneloves mystical numberfrom which commonly spring multitudes but on the present occasion it was a single one and cold she watched him riding away on his gallant horse as handsome a cavalier as the world could show and the contrast of his recent language and his fine figure was a riddle that froze her blood speech so foreign to her ears unnatural in tone unmanlike even for a lover who is allowed a softer dialect set her vainly sounding for the source and drift of it she was glad of not having to encounter eyes like mr vernon whitfords on behalf of sir willoughby it is to be said that his mother without infringing on the degree of respect for his decisions and sentiments exacted by him had talked to him of miss middleton suggesting a volatility of temperament in the young lady that struck him as consentaneous with mrs mountstuarts rogue in porcelain and alarmed him as the independent observations of two worldwise women nor was it incumbent upon him personally to credit the volatility in order as far as he could to effect the soulinsurance of his bride that he might hold the security of the policy the desire for it was in him his mother had merely tolled a warning bell that he had put in motion before clara was not a constantia but she was a woman and he had been deceived by women as a man fostering his high ideal of them will surely be the strain he adopted was quite natural to his passion and his theme the language of the primitive sentiments of men is of the same expression at all times minus the primitive colours when a modern gentleman addresses his lady lady patterne died in the winter season of the new year in april dr middleton had to quit upton park and he had not found a place of residence nor did he quite know what to do with himself in the prospect of his daughters marriage and desertion of him sir willoughby proposed to find him a house within a circuit of the neighbourhood of patterne moreover he invited the rev doctor and his daughter to come to patterne from upton for a month and make acquaintance with his aunts the ladies eleanor and isabel patterne so that it might not be so strange to clara to have them as her housemates after her marriage dr middleton omitted to consult his daughter before accepting the invitation and it appeared when he did speak to her that it should have been done but she said mildly very well papa sir willoughby had to visit the metropolis and an estate in another county whence he wrote to his betrothed daily he returned to patterne in time to arrange for the welcome of his guests too late however to ride over to them and meanwhile during his absence miss middleton had bethought herself that she ought to have given her last days of freedom to her friends after the weeks to be passed at patterne very few weeks were left to her and she had a wish to run to switzerland or tyrol and see the alps a quaint idea her father thought she repeated it seriously and dr middleton perceived a feminine shuttle of indecision at work in her head frightful to him considering that they signified hesitation between the excellent library and capital winecellar of patterne hall together with the society of that promising young scholar mr vernon whitford on the one side and a career of hotelsequivalent to being rammed into monster artillery with a crowd every night and shot off on a days journey through space every morningon the other you will have your travelling and your alps after the ceremony he said i think i would rather stay at home said she dr middleton rejoined i would but i am not married yet papa as good my dear a little change of scene i thought we have accepted willoughbys invitation and he helps me to a house near you you wish to be near me papa proximateat a remove communicable why should we separate for the reason my dear that you exchange a father for a husband if i do not want to exchange to purchase you must pay my child husbands are not given for nothing no but i should have you papa should they have not yet parted us dear papa what does that mean he asked fussily he was in a gentle stew already apprehensive of a disturbance of the serenity precious to scholars by postponements of the ceremony and a prolongation of a fathers worries oh the common meaning papa she said seeing how it was with him ah said he nodding and blinking gradually back to a state of composure glad to be appeased on any terms for mutability is but another name for the sex and it is the enemy of the scholar she suggested that two weeks of patterne would offer plenty of time to inspect the empty houses of the district and should be sufficient considering the claims of friends and the necessity of going the round of london shops two or three weeks he agreed hurriedly by way of compromise with that fearful prospect chapter vii the betrothed during the drive from upton to patterne miss middleton hoped she partly believed that there was to be a change in sir willoughbys manner of courtship he had been so different a wooer she remembered with some halfconscious desperation of fervour what she had thought of him at his first approaches and in accepting him had she seen him with the eyes of the world thinking they were her own that look of his the look of indignant contentment had then been a most noble conquering look splendid as a generals plume at the gallop it could not have altered was it that her eyes had altered the spirit of those days rose up within her to reproach her and whisper of their renewal she remembered her rosy dreams and the image she had of him her throbbing pride in him her choking richness of happiness and also her vain attempting to be very humble usually ending in a carol quaint to think of not without charm but quaint puzzling now men whose incomes have been restricted to the extent that they must live on their capital soon grow relieved of the forethoughtful anguish wasting them by the hilarious comforts of the lap upon which they have sunk back insomuch that they are apt to solace themselves for their intolerable anticipations of famine in the household by giving loose to one fit or more of reckless lavishness lovers in like manner live on their capital from failure of income they too for the sake of stifling apprehension and piping to the present hour are lavish of their stock so as rapidly to attenuate it they have their fits of intoxication in view of coming famine they force memory into play love retrospectively enter the old house of the past and ravage the larder and would gladly even resolutely continue in illusion if it were possible for the broadest honeystore of reminiscences to hold out for a length of time against a mortal appetite which in good sooth stands on the alternative of a consumption of the hive or of the creature it is for nourishing here do lovers show that they are perishable more than the poor clay world they need fresh supplies right wholesome juices as it were life in the burst of the bud fruits yet on the tree rather than potted provender the latter is excellent for byandby when there will be a vast deal more to remember and appetite shall have but one tooth remaining should their minds perchance have been saturated by their first impressions and have retained them loving by the accountable light of reason they may have fair harvests as in the early time but that case is rare in other words love is an affair of two and is only for two that can be as quick as constant in intercommunication as are sun and earth through the cloud or face to face they take their breath of life from one another in signs of affection proofs of faithfulness incentives to admiration thus it is with men and women in loves good season but a solitary soul dragging a log must make the log a god to rejoice in the burden that is not love clara was the least fitted of all women to drag a log few girls would be so rapid in exhausting capital she was feminine indeed but she wanted comradeship a living and frank exchange of the best in both with the deeper feelings untroubled to be fixed at the mouth of a mine and to have to descend it daily and not to discover great opulence below on the contrary to be chilled in subterranean sunlessness without any substantial quality that she could grasp only the mystery of the inefficient tallowlight in those caverns of the complacenttalking man this appeared to her too extreme a probation for two or three weeks how of a lifetime of it she was compelled by her nature to hope expect and believe that sir willoughby would again be the man she had known when she accepted him very singularly to show her simple spirit at the time she was unaware of any physical coldness to him she knew of nothing but her mind at work objecting to this and that desiring changes she did not dream of being on the giddy ridge of the passive or negative sentiment of love where one step to the wrong side precipitates us into the state of repulsion her eyes were lively at their meetingso were his she liked to see him on the steps with young crossjay under his arm sir willoughby told her in his pleasantest humour of the boys having got into the laboratory that morning to escape his taskmaster and blown out the windows she administered a chiding to the delinquent in the same spirit while sir willoughby led her on his arm across the threshold whispering soon for good in reply to the whisper she begged for more of the story of young crossjay come into the laboratory said he a little less laughingly than softly and clara begged her father to come and see young crossjays latest pranks sir willoughby whispered to her of the length of their separation and his joy to welcome her to the house where she would reign as mistress very won he numbered the weeks he whispered come in the hurry of the moment she did not examine a lightning terror that shot through her it passed and was no more than the shadow which bends the summer grasses leaving a ruffle of her ideas in wonder of her having feared herself for something her father was with them she and willoughby were not yet alone young crossjay had not accomplished so fine a piece of destruction as sir willoughbys humour proclaimed of him he had connected a battery with a train of gunpowder shattering a windowframe and unsettling some bricks dr middleton asked if the youth was excluded from the library and rejoiced to hear that it was a sealed door to him thither they went vernon whitford was away on one of his long walks there papa you see he is not so very faithful to you said clara dr middleton stood frowning over ms notes on the table in vernons handwriting he flung up the hair from his forehead and dropped into a seat to inspect them closely he was now immoveable clara was obliged to leave him there she was led to think that willoughby had drawn them to the library with the design to be rid of her protector and she began to fear him she proposed to pay her respects to the ladies eleanor and isabel they were not seen and a footman reported in the drawingroom that they were out driving she grasped young crossjays hand sir willoughby dispatched him to mrs montague the housekeeper for a tea of cakes and jam off he said and the boy had to run clara saw herself without a shield and the garden she cried i love the garden i must go and see what flowers are up with you in spring i care most for wild flowers and if you will show me daffodils and crocuses and anemones my dearest clara my bride said he because they are vulgar flowers she asked him artlessly to account for his detaining her why would he not wait to deserve herno not deserveto reconcile her with her real position not reconcile but to repair the image of him in her mind before he claimed his apparent right he did not wait he pressed her to his bosom you are mine my clarautterly mine every thought every feeling we are one the world may do its worst i have been longing for you looking forward you save me from a thousand vexations one is perpetually crossed that is all outside us we two with you i am secure soon i could not tell you whether the worlds alive or dead my dearest she came out of it with the sensations of the frightened child that has had its dip in seawater sharpened to think that after all it was not so severe a trial such was her idea and she said to herself immediately what am i that i should complain two minutes earlier she would not have thought it but humiliated pride falls lower than humbleness she did not blame him she fell in her own esteem less because she was the betrothed clara middleton which was now palpable as a shot in the breast of a bird than that she was a captured woman of whom it is absolutely expected that she must submit and when she would rather be gazing at flowers clara had shame of her sex they cannot take a step without becoming bondwomen into what a slavery for herself her trial was over she thought as for herself she merely complained of a prematureness and crudity best unanalyzed in truth she could hardly be said to complain she did but criticize him and wonder that a man was unable to perceive or was not arrested by perceiving unwillingness discordance dull compliance the bondwomans due instead of the brides consent oh sharp distinction as between two spheres she meted him justice she admitted that he had spoken in a loverlike tone had it not been for the iteration of the world she would not have objected critically to his words though they were words of downright appropriation he had the right to use them since she was to be married to him but if he had only waited before playing the privileged lover sir willoughby was enraptured with her even so purely coldly statuelike dianlike would he have prescribed his brides reception of his caress the suffusion of crimson coming over her subsequently showing her divinely feminine in reflective bashfulness agreed with his highest definitions of female character let me conduct you to the garden my love he said she replied i think i would rather go to my room i will send you a wildflower posy flowers no i do not like them to be gathered i will wait for you on the lawn my head is rather heavy his deep concern and tenderness brought him close she assured him sparklingly that she was well she was ready to accompany him to the garden and stroll over the park headache it is not she added but she had to pay the fee for inviting a solicitous accepted gentlemans proximity this time she blamed herself and him and the world he abused and destiny into the bargain and she cared less about the probation but she craved for liberty with a frigidity that astonished her she marvelled at the act of kissing and at the obligation it forced upon an inanimate person to be an accomplice why was she not free by what strange right was it that she was treated as a possession i will try to walk off the heaviness she said my own girl must not fatigue herself oh no i shall not sit with me your willoughby is your devoted attendant i have a desire for the air then we will walk out she was horrified to think how far she had drawn away from him and now placed her hand on his arm to appease her selfaccusations and propitiate duty he spoke as she had wished his manner was what she had wished she was his bride almost his wife her conduct was a kind of madness she could not understand it good sense and duty counselled her to control her wayward spirit he fondled her hand and to that she grew accustomed her hand was at a distance and what is a hand leaving it where it was she treated it as a link between herself and dutiful goodness two months hence she was a bondwoman for life she regretted that she had not gone to her room to strengthen herself with a review of her situation and meet him thoroughly resigned to her fate she fancied she would have come down to him amicably it was his present respectfulness and easy conversation that tricked her burning nerves with the fancy five weeks of perfect liberty in the mountains she thought would have prepared her for the days of bells all that she required was a separation offering new scenes where she might reflect undisturbed feel clear again he led her about the flowerbeds too much as if he were giving a convalescent an airing she chafed at it and pricked herself with remorse in contrition she expatiated on the beauty of the garden all is yours my clara an oppressive load it seemed to her she passively yielded to the man in his form of attentive courtier his mansion estate and wealth overwhelmed her they suggested the price to be paid yet she recollected that on her last departure through the park she had been proud of the rolling green and spreading trees poison of some sort must be operating in her she had not come to him today with this feeling of sullen antagonism she had caught it here you have been well my clara quite not a hint of illness none my bride must have her health if all the doctors in the kingdom die for it my darling and tell me the dogs dogs and horses are in very good condition i am glad do you know i love those ancient french chateaux and farms in one where salon windows look on poultryyard and stalls i like that homeliness with beasts and peasants he bowed indulgently i am afraid we cant do it for you in england my clara no and i like the farm said he but i think our drawingrooms have a better atmosphere off the garden as to our peasantry we cannot i apprehend modify our class demarcations without risk of disintegrating the social structure perhaps i proposed nothing my love i would entreat you to propose if i were convinced that i could obey you are very good i find my merit nowhere but in your satisfaction although she was not thirsting for dulcet sayings the peacefulness of other than invitations to the exposition of his mysteries and of their isolation in oneness inspired her with such calm that she beat about in her brain as if it were in the brain for the specific injury he had committed sweeping from sensation to sensation the young whom sensations impel and distract can rarely date their disturbance from a particular one unless it be some great villain injury that has been done and clara had not felt an individual shame in his caress the shame of her sex was but a passing protest that left no stamp so she conceived she had been behaving cruelly and said willoughby because she was aware of the omission of his name in her previous remarks his whole attention was given to her she had to invent the sequel i was going to beg you willoughby do not seek to spoil me you compliment me compliments are not suited to me you think too highly of me it is nearly as bad as to be slighted i am i am a but she could not follow his example even as far as she had gone her prim little sketch of herself set beside her real ugly earnest feelings rang of a mincing simplicity and was a step in falseness how could she display what she was do i not know you he said the melodious bass notes expressive of conviction on that point signified as well as the words that no answer was the right answer she could not dissent without turning his music to discord his complacency to amazement she held her tongue knowing that he did not know her and speculating on the division made bare by their degrees of the knowledge a deep cleft he alluded to friends in her neighbourhood and his own the bridesmaids were mentioned miss dale you will hear from my aunt eleanor declines on the plea of indifferent health she is rather a morbid person with all her really estimable qualities it will do no harm to have none but young ladies of your own age a bouquet of young buds though one blowing flower among them however she has decided my principal annoyance has been vernons refusal to act as my best man mr whitford refuses he half refuses i do not take no from him his pretext is a dislike to the ceremony i share it with him i sympathize with you if we might say the words and pass from sight there is a way of cutting off the world i have it at times completely i lose it again as if it were a cabalistic phrase one had to utter but with you you give it me for good it will be for ever eternally my clara nothing can harm nothing touch us we are one anothers let the world fight it out we have nothing to do with it if mr whitford should persist in refusing so entirely one that there never can be question of external influences i am we will say riding home from the hunt i see you awaiting me i read your heart as though you were beside me and i know that i am coming to the one who reads mine you have me you have me like an open book you and only you i am to be always at home clara said unheeded and relieved by his not hearing have you realized itthat we are invulnerable the world cannot hurt us it cannot touch us felicity is ours and we are impervious in the enjoyment of it something divine surely something divine on earth clarabeing to one another that between which the world can never interpose what i do is right what you do is right perfect to one another each new day we rise to study and delight in new secrets away with the crowd we have not even to say it we are in an atmosphere where the world cannot breathe oh the world clara partly carolled on a sigh that sunk deep hearing him talk as one exulting on the mountaintop when she knew him to be in the abyss was very strange provocative of scorn my letters he said incitingly i read them circumstances have imposed a long courtship on us my clara and i perhaps lamenting the laws of decorumi have done sostill felt the benefit of the gradual initiation it is not good for women to be surprised by a sudden revelation of mans character we also have things to learnthere is matter for learning everywhere some day you will tell me the difference of what you think of me now from what you thought when we first an impulse of doubleminded acquiescence caused clara to stammer as on a sob ii daresay i shall she added if it is necessary then she cried out why do you attack the world you always make me pity it he smiled at her youthfulness i have passed through that stage it leads to my sentiment pity it by all means no said she but pity it side with it not consider it so bad the world has faults glaciers have crevices mountains have chasms but is not the effect of the whole sublime not to admire the mountain and the glacier because they can be cruel seems to me and the world is beautiful the world of nature yes the world of men yes my love i suspect you to be thinking of the world of ballrooms i am thinking of the world that contains real and great generosity true heroism we see it round us we read of it the world of the romance writer no the living world i am sure it is our duty to love it i am sure we weaken ourselves if we do not if i did not i should be looking on mist hearing a perpetual boom instead of music i remember hearing mr whitford say that cynicism is intellectual dandyism without the coxcombs feathers and it seems to me that cynics are only happy in making the world as barren to others as they have made it for themselves old vernon ejaculated sir willoughby with a countenance rather uneasy as if it had been flicked with a glove he strings his phrases by the dozen papa contradicts that and says he is very clever and very simple as to cynics my dear clara oh certainly certainly you are right they are laughable contemptible but understand me i mean we cannot feel or if we feel we cannot so intensely feel our oneness except by dividing ourselves from the world is it an art if you like it is our poetry but does not love shun the world two that love must have their sustenance in isolation no they will be eating themselves up the purer the beauty the more it will be out of the world but not opposed put it in this way willoughby condescended has experience the same opinion of the world as ignorance it should have more charity does virtue feel at home in the world where it should be an example to my idea is the world agreeable to holiness then are you in favour of monasteries he poured a little runlet of half laughter over her head of the sound assumed by genial compassion it is irritating to hear that when we imagine we have spoken to the point now in my letters clara i have no memory willoughby you will however have observed that i am not completely myself in my letters in your letters to men you may be the remark threw a pause across his thoughts he was of a sensitiveness terribly tender a single stroke on it reverberated swellingly within the man and most and infuriately searching at the spots where he had been wounded especially where he feared the world might have guessed the wound did she imply that he had no hand for loveletters was it her meaning that women would not have much taste for his epistolary correspondence she had spoken in the plural with an accent on men had she heard of constantia had she formed her own judgement about the creature the supernatural sensitiveness of sir willoughby shrieked a peal of affirmatives he had often meditated on the moral obligation of his unfolding to clara the whole truth of his conduct to constantia for whom as for other suicides there were excuses he at least was bound to supply them she had behaved badly but had he not given her some cause if so manliness was bound to confess it supposing clara heard the worlds version first men whose pride is their backbone suffer convulsions where other men are barely aware of a shock and sir willoughby was taken with galvanic jumpings of the spirit within him at the idea of the world whispering to clara that he had been jilted my letters to men you say my love your letters of business completely myself in my letters of business he stared indeed she relaxed the tension of his figure by remarking you are able to express yourself to men as your meaning dictates in writing to to us it is i suppose more difficult true my love i will not exactly say difficult i can acknowledge no difficulty language i should say is not fitted to express emotion passion rejects it for dumbshow and pantomime no but the writing of it coldly ah coldly my letters disappoint you i have not implied that they do my feelings dearest are too strong for transcription i feel pen in hand like the mythological titan at war with jove strong enough to hurl mountains and finding nothing but pebbles the simile is a good one you must not judge of me by my letters i do not i like them said clara she blushed eyed him hurriedly and seeing him complacent resumed i prefer the pebble to the mountain but if you read poetry you would not think human speech incapable of my love i detest artifice poetry is a profession our poets would prove to you as i have often observed clara i am no poet i have not accused you willoughby no poet and with no wish to be a poet were i one my life would supply material i can assure you my love my conscience is not entirely at rest perhaps the heaviest matter troubling it is that in which i was least wilfully guilty you have heard of a miss durham i have heardyesof her she may be happy i trust she is if she is not i cannot escape some blame an instance of the difference between myself and the world now the world charges it upon her i have interceded to exonerate her that was generous willoughby stay i fear i was the primary offender but i clara i under a sense of honour acting under a sense of honour would have carried my engagement through what had you done the story is long dating from an early day in the downy antiquity of my youth as vernon says mr whitford says that one of old vernons odd sayings its a story of an early fascination papa tells me mr whitford speaks at times with wise humour family considerationsthe ladys health among other things her position in the calculations of relativesintervened still there was the fascination i have to own it grounds for feminine jealousy is it at an end now with you my darling clara indeed at an end or could i have opened my inmost heart to you could i have spoken of myself so unreservedly that in part you know me as i know myself oh but would it have been possible to enclose you with myself in that intimate union so secret unassailable you did not speak to her as you speak to me in no degree what could have clara checked the murmured exclamation sir willoughbys expoundings on his latest of texts would have poured forth had not a footman stepped across the lawn to inform him that his builder was in the laboratory and requested permission to consult with him claras plea of a horror of the talk of bricks and joists excused her from accompanying him he had hardly been satisfied by her manner he knew not why he left her convinced that he must do and say more to reach down to her female intelligence she saw young crossjay springing with pots of jam in him join his patron at a bound and taking a lift of arms fly aloft clapping heels her reflections were confused sir willoughby was admirable with the lad is he two men she thought and the thought ensued am i unjust she headed a run with young crossjay to divert her mind chapter viii a run with the truant a walk with the master the sight of miss middleton running inflamed young crossjay with the passion of the game of hare and hounds he shouted a viewhalloo and flung up his legs she was fleet she ran as though a hundred little feet were bearing her onward smooth as water over the lawn and the sweeps of grass of the park so swiftly did the hidden pair multiply one another to speed her so sweet was she in her flowing pace that the boy as became his age translated admiration into a dogged frenzy of pursuit and continued pounding along when far outstripped determined to run her down or die suddenly her flight wound to an end in a dozen twittering steps and she sank young crossjay attained her with just breath enough to say you are a runner i forgot you had been having your tea my poor boy said she and you dont pant a bit was his encomium dear me no not more than a bird you might as well try to catch a bird young crossjay gave a knowing nod wait till i get my second wind now you must confess that girls run faster than boys they may at the start they do everything better theyre flashinthepans they learn their lessons you cant make soldiers or sailors of them though and that is untrue have you never read of mary ambree and mistress hannah snell of pondicherry and there was the bride of the celebrated william taylor and what do you say to joan of arc what do you say to boadicea i suppose you have never heard of the amazons they werent english then it is your own countrywomen you decry sir young crossjay betrayed anxiety about his false position and begged for the stories of mary ambree and the others who were english see you will not read for yourself you hide and play truant with mr whitford and the consequence is you are ignorant of your countrys history miss middleton rebuked him enjoying his wriggle between a perception of her fun and an acknowledgment of his peccancy she commanded him to tell her which was the glorious valentines day of our naval annals the name of the hero of the day and the name of his ship to these questions his answers were as ready as the guns of the good ship captain for the spanish fourdecker and that you owe to mr whitford said miss middleton he bought me the books young crossjay growled and plucked at grass blades and bit them foreseeing dimly but certainly the termination of all this miss middleton lay back on the grass and said are you going to be fond of me crossjay the boy sat blinking his desire was to prove to her that lie was immoderately fond of her already and he might have flown at her neck had she been sitting up but her recumbency and eyelids half closed excited wonder in him and awe his young heart beat fast because my dear boy she said leaning on her elbow you are a very nice boy but an ungrateful boy and there is no telling whether you will not punish any one who cares for you come along with me pluck me some of these cowslips and the speedwells near them i think we both love wildflowers she rose and took his arm you shall row me on the lake while i talk to you seriously it was she however who took the sculls at the boathouse for she had been a playfellow with boys and knew that one of them engaged in a manly exercise is not likely to listen to a woman now crossjay she said dense gloom overcame him like a cowl she bent across her hands to laugh as if i were going to lecture you you silly boy he began to brighten dubiously i used to be as fond of birdsnesting as you are i like brave boys and i like you for wanting to enter the royal navy only how can you if you do not learn you must get the captains to pass you you know somebody spoils you miss dale or mr whitford do they sung out young crossjay sir willoughby does i dont know about spoil i can come round him i am sure he is very kind to you i dare say you think mr whitford rather severe you should remember he has to teach you so that you may pass for the navy you must not dislike him because he makes you work supposing you had blown yourself up today you would have thought it better to have been working with mr whitford sir willoughby says when hes married you wont let me hide ah it is wrong to pet a big boy like you does not he what you call tip you crossjay generally halfcrown pieces ive had a crownpiece ive had sovereigns and for that you do as he bids you and he indulges you because you well but though mr whitford does not give you money he gives you his time he tries to get you into the navy he pays for me what do you say my keep and as for liking him if he were at the bottom of the water here id go down after him i mean to learn were both of us here at six oclock in the morning when its light and have a swim he taught me only i never cared for schoolbooks are you quite certain that mr whitford pays for you my father told me he did and i must obey him he heard my father was poor with a family he went down to see my father my father came here once and sir willoughby wouldnt see him i know mr whitford does and miss dale told me he did my mother says she thinks he does it to make up to us for my fathers long walk in the rain and the cold he caught coming here to patterne so you see you should not vex him crossjay he is a good friend to your father and to you you ought to love him i like him and i like his face why his face its not like those faces miss dale and i talk about him she thinks that sir willoughby is the bestlooking man ever born were you not speaking of mr whitford yes old vernon thats what sir willoughby calls him young crossjay excused himself to her look of surprise do you know what he makes me think ofhis eyes i mean he makes me think of robinson crusoes old goat in the cavern i like him because hes always the same and youre not positive about some people miss middleton if you look on at cricket in comes a safe man for ten runs he may get more and he never gets less and you should hear the old farmers talk of him in the booth thats just my feeling miss middleton understood that some illustration from the cricketingfield was intended to throw light on the boys feeling for mr whitford young crossjay was evidently warming to speak from his heart but the sun was low she had to dress for the dinnertable and she landed him with regret as at a holiday over before they parted he offered to swim across the lake in his clothes or dive to the bed for anything she pleased to throw declaring solemnly that it should not be lost she walked back at a slow pace and sung to herself above her darkerflowing thoughts like the reedwarbler on the branch beside the nightstream a simple song of a lighthearted sound independent of the shifting black and grey of the flood underneath a step was at her heels i see you have been petting my scapegrace mr whitford yes not petting i hope i tried to give him a lecture hes a dear lad but i fancy trying she was in fine sunset colour unable to arrest the mounting tide she had been rowing she said and as he directed his eyes according to his wont penetratingly she defended herself by fixing her mind on robinson crusoes old goat in the recess of the cavern i must have him away from here very soon said vernon here hes quite spoiled speak of him to willoughby i cant guess at his ideas of the boys future but the chance of passing for the navy wont bear trifling with and if ever there was a lad made for the navy its crossjay the incident of the explosion in the laboratory was new to vernon and willoughby laughed he said there are seaport crammers who stuff young fellows for examination and we shall have to pack off the boy at once to the best one of the lot we can find i would rather have had him under me up to the last three months and have made sure of some roots to what is knocked into his head but hes ruined here and i am going so i shall not trouble him for many weeks longer dr middleton is well my father is well yes he pounced like a falcon on your notes in the library vernon came out with a chuckle they were left to attract him i am in for a controversy papa will not spare you to judge from his look i know the look have you walked far today nine and a half hours my flibbertigibbet is too much for me at times and i had to walk off my temper she cast her eyes on him thinking of the pleasure of dealing with a temper honestly coltish and manfully open to a specific all those hours were required not quite so long you are training for your alpine tour its doubtful whether i shall get to the alps this year i leave the hall and shall probably be in london with a pen to sell willoughby knows that you leave him as much as mont blanc knows that he is going to be climbed by a party below he sees a speck or two in the valley he has not spoken of it he would attribute it to changes vernon did not conclude the sentence she became breathless without emotion but checked by the barrier confronting an impulse to ask what changes she stooped to pluck a cowslip i saw daffodils lower down the park she said one or two theyre nearly over we are well off for wild flowers here he answered do not leave him mr whitford he will not want me you are devoted to him i cant pretend that then it is the changes you imagine you foresee if any occur why should they drive you away well im two and thirty and have never been in the fray a kind of nondescript half scholar and by nature half billman or bowman or musketeer if im worth anything londons the field for me but thats what i have to try papa will not like your serving with your pen in london he will say you are worth too much for that good men are at it i should not care to be ranked above them they are wasted he says error if they have their private ambition they may suppose they are wasted but the value to the world of a private ambition i do not clearly understand you have not an evil opinion of the world said miss middleton sick at heart as she spoke with the sensation of having invited herself to take a drop of poison he replied one might as well have an evil opinion of a river here its muddy there its clear one day troubled another at rest we have to treat it with common sense love it in the sense of serving it not think it beautiful part of it is part of it the reverse papa would quote the mulier formosa except that fish is too good for the black extremity woman is excellent for the upper how do you say thatnot cynically i believe your view commends itself to my reason she was grateful to him for not stating it in ideal contrast with sir willoughbys view if he had so intensely did her youthful blood desire to be enamoured of the world that she felt he would have lifted her off her feet for a moment a gulf beneath had been threatening when she said love it a little enthusiasm would have wafted her into space fierily as wine but the sober in the sense of serving it entered her brain and was matter for reflection upon it and him she could think of him in pleasant liberty uncorrected by her womans instinct of peril he had neither arts nor graces nothing of his cousins easy social frontface she had once witnessed the military precision of his dancing and had to learn to like him before she ceased to pray that she might never be the victim of it as his partner he walked heroically his pedestrian vigour being famous but that means one who walks away from the sex not excelling in the recreations where men and women join hands he was not much of a horseman either sir willoughby enjoyed seeing him on horseback and he could scarcely be said to shine in a drawingroom unless when seated beside a person ready for real talk even more than his merits his demerits pointed him out as a man to be a friend to a young woman who wanted one his way of life pictured to her troubled spirit an enviable smoothness and his having achieved that smooth way she considered a sign of strength and she wished to lean in idea upon some friendly strength his reputation for indifference to the frivolous charms of girls clothed him with a noble coldness and gave him the distinction of a farseen solitary iceberg in southern waters the popular notion of hereditary titled aristocracy resembles her sentiment for a man that would not flatter and could not be flattered by her sex he appeared superior almost to awfulness she was young but she had received much flattery in her ears and by it she had been snared and he disdaining to practise the fowlers arts or to cast a thought on small fowls appeared to her to have a pride founded on natural loftiness they had not spoken for awhile when vernon said abruptly the boys future rather depends on you miss middleton i mean to leave as soon as possible and i do not like his being here without me though you will look after him i have no doubt but you may not at first see where the spoiling hurts him he should be packed off at once to the crammer before you are lady patterne use your influence willoughby will support the lad at your request the cost cannot be great there are strong grounds against my having him in london even if i could manage it may i count on you i will mention it i will do my best said miss middleton strangely dejected they were now on the lawn where sir willoughby was walking with the ladies eleanor and isabel his maiden aunts you seem to have coursed the hare and captured the hart he said to his bride started the truant and run down the paedagogue said vernon ay you wont listen to me about the management of that boy sir willoughby retorted the ladies embraced miss middleton one offered up an ejaculation in eulogy of her looks the other of her healthfulness then both remarked that with indulgence young crossjay could be induced to do anything clara wondered whether inclination or sir willoughby had disciplined their individuality out of them and made them his shadows his echoes she gazed from them to him and feared him but as yet she had not experienced the power in him which could threaten and wrestle to subject the members of his household to the state of satellites though she had in fact been giving battle to it for several months she had held her own too well to perceive definitely the character of the spirit opposing her she said to the ladies ah no mr whitford has chosen the only method for teaching a boy like crossjay i propose to make a man of him said sir willoughby what is to become of him if he learns nothing if he pleases me he will be provided for i have never abandoned a dependent clara let her eyes rest on his and without turning or dropping shut them the effect was discomforting to him he was very sensitive to the intentions of eyes and tones which was one secret of his rigid grasp of the dwellers in his household they were taught that they had to render agreement under sharp scrutiny studious eyes devoid of warmth devoid of the shyness of sex that suddenly closed on their look signified a want of comprehension of some kind it might be hostility of understanding was it possible he did not possess her utterly he frowned up clara saw the lift of his brows and thought my mind is my own married or not it was the point in dispute chapter ix clara and laetitia meet they are compared an hour before the time for lessons next morning young crossjay was on the lawn with a big bunch of wild flowers he left them at the hall door for miss middleton and vanished into bushes these vulgar weeds were about to be dismissed to the dustheap by the great officials of the household but as it happened that miss middleton had seen them from the window in crossjays hands the discovery was made that they were indeed his presentationbouquet and a footman received orders to place them before her she was very pleased the arrangement of the flowers bore witness to fairer fingers than the boys own in the disposition of the rings of colour red campion and anemone cowslip and speedwell primroses and woodhyacinths and rising out of the blue was a branch bearing thick white blossom so thick and of so pure a whiteness that miss middleton while praising crossjay for soliciting the aid of miss dale was at a loss to name the tree it is a gardeners improvement on the vestal of the forest the wild cherry said dr middleton and in this case we may admit the gardeners claim to be valid though i believe that with his gift of double blossom he has improved away the fruit call this the vestal of civilization then he has at least done something to vindicate the beauty of the office as well as the justness of the title it is vernons holy tree the young rascal has been despoiling said sir willoughby merrily miss middleton was informed that this doubleblossom wild cherrytree was worshipped by mr whitford sir willoughby promised he would conduct her to it you he said to her can bear the trial few complexions can it is to most ladies a crueller test than snow miss dale for example becomes old lace within a dozen yards of it i should like to place her under the tree beside you dear me though but that is investing the hamadryad with novel and terrible functions exclaimed dr middleton clara said miss dale could drag me into a superior court to show me fading beside her in gifts more valuable than a complexion she has a fine ability said vernon all the world knew so clara knew of miss dales romantic admiration of sir willoughby she was curious to see miss dale and study the nature of a devotion that might be within reason imitablefor a man who could speak with such steely coldness of the poor lady he had fascinated well perhaps it was good for the hearts of women to be beneath a frost to be schooled restrained turned inward on their dreams yes then his coldness was desireable it encouraged an ideal of him it suggested and seemed to propose to claras mind the divineness of separation instead of the deadly accuracy of an intimate perusal she tried to look on him as miss dale might look and while partly despising her for the dupery she envied and more than criticizing him for the inhuman numbness of sentiment which offered up his worshipper to point a complimentary comparison she was able to imagine a distance whence it would be possible to observe him uncritically kindly admiringly as the moon a handsome mortal for example in the midst of her thoughts she surprised herself by saying i certainly was difficult to instruct i might see things clearer if i had a fine ability i never remember to have been perfectly pleased with my immediate lesson she stopped wondering whither her tongue was leading her then added to save herself and that may be why i feel for poor crossjay mr whitford apparently did not think it remarkable that she should have been set off gabbling of a fine ability though the eulogistic phrase had been pronounced by him with an impressiveness to make his ear aware of an echo sir willoughby dispersed her vapourish confusion exactly he said i have insisted with vernon i dont know how often that you must have the lad by his affections he wont bear driving it had no effect on me boys of spirit kick at it i think i know boys clara he found himself addressing eyes that regarded him as though he were a small speck a pins head in the circle of their remote contemplation they were wide they closed she opened them to gaze elsewhere he was very sensitive even then when knowingly wounding him or because of it she was trying to climb back to that altitude of the thin division of neutral ground from which we see a lovers faults and are above them pure surveyors she climbed unsuccessfully it is true soon despairing and using the effort as a pretext to fall back lower dr middleton withdrew sir willoughbys attention from the imperceptible annoyance no sir no the birch the birch boys of spirit commonly turn into solid men and the solider the men the more surely do they vote for busby for me i pray he may be immortal in great britain seaair nor mountainair is half so bracing i venture to say that the power to take a licking is better worth having than the power to administer one horse him and birch him if crossjay runs from his books it is your opinion sir his host bowed to him affably shocked on behalf of the ladies so positively so sir that i will undertake without knowledge of their antecedents to lay my finger on the men in public life who have not had early busby they are illbalanced men their seat of reason is not a concrete they wont take rough and smooth as they come they make bad blood cant forgive sniff right and left for approbation and are excited to anger if an east wind does not flatter them why sir when they have grown to be seniors you find these men mixed up with the nonsense of their youth you see they are unthrashed we english beat the world because we take a licking well i hold it for a surety of a proper sweetness of blood the smile of sir willoughby waxed ever softer as the shakes of his head increased in contradictoriness and yet said he with the air of conceding a little after having answered the rev doctor and convicted him of error jack requires it to keep him in order on board ship your argument may apply not i suspect among gentlemen no goodnight to you gentlemen said dr middleton clara heard miss eleanor and miss isabel interchange remarks willoughby would not have suffered it it would entirely have altered him she sighed and put a tooth on her underlip the gift of humourous fancy is in women fenced round with forbidding placards they have to choke it if they perceive a piece of humour for instance the young willoughby grasped by his masterand his horrified relatives rigid at the sight of preparations for the seed of sacrilege they have to blindfold the minds eye they are societys harddrilled soldiery prussians that must both march and think in step it is for the advantage of the civilized world if you like since men have decreed it or matrons have so read the decree but here and there a younger woman haply an uncorrected insurgent of the sex matured here and there feels that her lot was cast with her head in a narrower pit than her limbs clara speculated as to whether miss dale might be perchance a person of a certain liberty of mind she asked for some little only some little free play of mind in a house that seemed to wear as it were a cap of iron sir willoughby not merely ruled he throned he inspired and how she had noticed an irascible sensitiveness in him alert against a shadow of disagreement and as he was kind when perfectly appeased the sop was offered by him for submission she noticed that even mr whitford forbore to alarm the sentiment of authority in his cousin if he did not breathe sir willoughby like the ladies eleanor and isabel he would either acquiesce in a syllable or be silent he never strongly dissented the habit of the house with its iron cap was on him as it was on the servants and would be oh shudders of the shipwrecked that see their end in drowning on the wife when do i meet miss dale she inquired this very evening at dinner replied sir willoughby then thought she there is that to look forward to she indulged her morbid fit and shut up her senses that she might live in the anticipation of meeting miss dale and long before the approach of the hour her hope of encountering any other than another dull adherent of sir willoughby had fled so she was languid for two of the three minutes when she sat alone with laetitia in the drawingroom before the rest had assembled it is miss middleton laetitia said advancing to her my jealousy tells me for you have won my boy crossjays heart and done more to bring him to obedience in a few minutes than we have been able to do in months his wild flowers were so welcome to me said clara he was very modest over them and i mention it because boys of his age usually thrust their gifts in our faces fresh as they pluck them and you were to be treated quite differently we saw his good fairys hand she resigns her office but i pray you not to love him too well in return for he ought to be away reading with one of those men who get boys through their examinations he is we all think a born sailor and his place is in the navy but miss dale i love him so well that i shall consult his interests and not my own selfishness and if i have influence he will not be a week with you longer it should have been spoke of today i must have been in some dream i thought of it i know i will not forget to do what may be in my power claras heart sank at the renewed engagement and plighting of herself involved in her asking a favour urging any sort of petition the cause was good besides she was plighted already sir willoughby is really fond of the boy she said he is fond of exciting fondness in the boy said miss dale he has not dealt much with children i am sure he likes crossjay he could not otherwise be so forbearing it is wonderful what he endures and laughs at sir willoughby entered the presence of miss dale illuminated him as the burning taper lights up consecrated plate deeply respecting her for her constancy esteeming her for a model of taste he was never in her society without that happy consciousness of shining which calls forth the treasures of the man and these it is no exaggeration to term unbounded when all that comes from him is taken for gold the effect of the evening on clara was to render her distrustful of her later antagonism she had unknowingly passed into the spirit of miss dale sir willoughby aiding for she could sympathize with the view of his constant admirer on seeing him so cordially and smoothly gay as one may say domestically witty the most agreeable form of wit mrs mountstuart jenkinson discerned that he had a leg of physical perfection miss dale distinguished it in him in the vital essence and before either of these ladies he was not simply a radiant he was a productive creature so true it is that praise is our fructifying sun he had even a touch of the romantic air which clara remembered as her first impression of the favourite of the county and strange she found it to observe this resuscitated idea confronting her experience what if she had been captious inconsiderate oh blissful revival of the sense of peace the happiness of pain departing was all that she looked for and her conception of liberty was to learn to love her chains provided that he would spare her the caress in this mood she sternly condemned constantia we must try to do good we must not be thinking of ourselves we must make the best of our path in life she revolved these infantile precepts with humble earnestness and not to be tardy in her striving to do good with a remote but pleasurable glimpse of mr whitford hearing of it she took the opportunity to speak to sir willoughby on the subject of young crossjay at a moment when alighting from horseback he had shown himself to advantage among a gallant cantering company he showed to great advantage on horseback among men being invariably the best mounted and he had a cavalierly style possibly cultivated but effective on foot his raised head and halfdropped eyelids too palpably assumed superiority willoughby i want to speak she said and shrank as she spoke lest he should immediately grant everything in the mood of courtship and invade her respite i want to speak of that dear boy crossjay you are fond of him he is rather an idle boy here and wasting time now you are here and when you are here for good my love for good he fluttered away in loverliness forgetful of crossjay whom he presently took up the boy recognizes his most sovereign lady and will do your bidding though you should order him to learn his lessons who would not obey your beauty alone commands but what is there beyonda grace a hue divine that sets you not so much above as apart severed from the world clara produced an active smile in duty and pursued if crossjay were sent at once to some house where men prepare boys to pass for the navy he would have his chance and the navy is distinctly his profession his father is a brave man and he inherits bravery and he has a passion for a sailors life only he must be able to pass his examination and he has not much time sir willoughby gave a slight laugh in sad amusement my dear clara you adore the world and i suppose you have to learn that there is not a question in this wrangling world about which we have not disputes and contests ad nauseam i have my notions concerning crossjay vernon has his i should wish to make a gentleman of him vernon marks him for a sailor but vernon is the lads protector i am not vernon took him from his father to instruct him and he has a right to say what shall be done with him i do not interfere only i cant prevent the lad from liking me old vernon seems to feel it i assure you i hold entirely aloof if i am asked in spite of my disapproval of vernons plans for the boy to subscribe to his departure i can but shrug because as you see i have never opposed old vernon pays for him he is the master he decides and if crossjay is blown from the masthead in a gale the blame does not fall on me these my dear are matters of reason i would not venture to intrude on them said clara if i had not suspected that money yes cried willoughby and it is a part and let old vernon surrender the boy to me i will immediately relieve him of the burden on his purse can i do that my dear for the furtherance of a scheme i condemn the point is thus latterly i have invited captain patterne to visit me just previous to his departure for the african coast where government despatches marines when there is no other way of killing them i sent him a special invitation he thanked me and curtly declined the man i may almost say is my pensioner well he calls himself a patterne he is undoubtedly a man of courage he has elements of our blood and the name i think i am to be approved for desiring to make a better gentleman of the son than i behold in the father and seeing that life from an early age on board ship has anything but made a gentleman of the father i hold that i am right in shaping another course for the son naval officers clara suggested some said willoughby but they must be men of birth coming out of homes of good breeding strip them of the halo of the title of naval officers and i fear you would not often say gentlemen when they step into a drawingroom i went so far as to fancy i had some claim to make young crossjay something different it can be done the patterne comes out in his behaviour to you my love it can be done but if i take him i claim undisputed sway over him i cannot make a gentleman of the fellow if i am to compete with this person and that in fine he must look up to me he must have one model would you then provide for him subsequently according to his behaviour would not that be precarious for him more so than the profession you appear inclined to choose for him but there he would be under clear regulations with me he would have to respond to affection would you secure to him a settled income for an idle gentleman is bad enough a penniless gentleman he has only to please me my dear and he will be launched and protected but if he does not succeed in pleasing you is it so difficult oh clara fretted you see my love i answer you said sir willoughby he resumed but let old vernon have his trial with the lad he has his own ideas let him carry them out i shall watch the experiment clara was for abandoning her task in sheer faintness is not the question one of money she said shyly knowing mr whitford to be poor old vernon chooses to spend his money that way replied sir willoughby if it saves him from breaking his shins and risking his neck on his alps we may consider it well employed yes claras voice occupied a pause she seized her languor as it were a curling snake and cast it off but i understand that mr whitford wants your assistance is he notnot rich when he leaves the hall to try his fortune in literature in london he may not be so well able to support crossjay and obtain the instruction necessary for the boy and it would be generous to help him leaves the hall exclaimed willoughby i have not heard a word of it he made a bad start at the beginning and i should have thought that would have tamed him had to throw over his fellowship ahem then he received a small legacy some time back and wanted to be off to push his luck in literature rank gambling as i told him londonizing can do him no good i thought that nonsense of his was over years ago what is it he has from meabout a hundred and fifty a year and it might be doubled for the asking and all the books he requires and these writers and scholars no sooner think of a book than they must have it and do not suppose me to complain i am a man who will not have a single shilling expended by those who serve immediately about my person i confess to exacting that kind of dependency feudalism is not an objectionable thing if you can be sure of the lord you know clara and you should know me in my weakness too i do not claim servitude i stipulate for affection i claim to be surrounded by persons loving me and with one dearest so that we two can shut out the world we live what is the dream of others nothing imaginable can be sweeter it is a veritable heaven on earth to be the possessor of the whole of you your thoughts hopes all sir willoughby intensified his imagination to conceive more he could not or could not express it and pursued but what is this talk of vernons leaving me he cannot leave he has barely a hundred a year of his own you see i consider him i do not speak of the ingratitude of the wish to leave you know my dear i have a deadly abhorrence of partings and such like as far as i can i surround myself with healthy people specially to guard myself from having my feelings wrung and excepting miss dale whom you likemy darling does like herthe answer satisfied him with that one exception i am not aware of a case that threatens to torment me and here is a man under no compulsion talking of leaving the hall in the name of goodness why but why am i to imagine that the sight of perfect felicity distresses him we are told that the world is desperately wicked i do not like to think it of my friends yet otherwise their conduct is often hard to account for if it were true you would not punish crossjay clara feebly interposed i should certainly take crossjay and make a man of him after my own model my dear but who spoke to you of this mr whitford himself and let me give you my opinion willoughby that he will take crossjay with him rather than leave him if there is a fear of the boys missing his chance of the navy marines appear to be in the ascendant said sir willoughby astonished at the locution and pleading in the interests of a son of one then crossjay he must take i cannot accept half the boy i am he laughed the legitimate claimant in the application for judgement before the wise king besides the boy has a dose of my blood in him he has none of vernons not one drop ah you see my love oh i do see yes i put forth no pretensions to perfection sir willoughby continued i can bear a considerable amount of provocation still i can be offended and i am unforgiving when i have been offended speak to vernon if a natural occasion should spring up i shall of course have to speak to him you may clara have observed a man who passed me on the road as we were cantering home without a hint of a touch to his hat that man is a tenant of mine farming six hundred acres hoppner by name a man bound to remember that i have independently of my position obliged him frequently his lease of my ground has five years to run i must say i detest the churlishness of our country population and where it comes across me i chastise it vernon is a different matter he will only require to be spoken to one would fancy the old fellow laboured now and then under a magnetic attraction to beggary my love he bent to her and checked their pacing up and down you are tired i am very tired today said clara his arm was offered she laid two fingers on it and they dropped when he attempted to press them to his rib he did not insist to walk beside her was to share in the stateliness of her walking he placed himself at a corner of the doorway for her to pass him into the house and doated on her cheek her ear and the softly dusky nape of her neck where this way and that the little lightercoloured irreclaimable curls running truant from the comb and the knotcurls halfcurls rootcurls vineringlets weddingrings fledgling feathers tufts of down blown wispswaved or fell waved over or up or involutedly or strayed loose and downward in the form of small silken paws hardly any of them much thicker than a crayon shading cunninger than long round locks of gold to trick the heart laetitia had nothing to show resembling such beauty chapter x in which sir willoughby chances to supply the title for himself now vernon was useful to his cousin he was the accomplished secretary of a man who governed his estate shrewdly and diligently but had been once or twice unlucky in his judgements pronounced from the magisterial bench as a justice of the peace on which occasions a half column of trenchant english supported by an apposite classical quotation impressed sir willoughby with the value of such a secretary in a controversy he had no fear of that fiery dragon of scorching breaththe newspaper presswhile vernon was his right hand man and as he intended to enter parliament he foresaw the greater need of him furthermore he liked his cousin to date his own controversial writings on classical subjects from patterne hall it caused his house to shine in a foreign field proved the service of scholarship by giving it a flavour of a bookish aristocracy that though not so well worth having and indeed in itself contemptible is above the material and titular one cannot quite say how there however is the flavour dainty sauces are the life the nobility of famous dishes taken alone the former would be nauseating the latter plebeian it is thus or somewhat so when you have a poet still better a scholar attached to your household sir willoughby deserved to have him for he was above his county friends in his apprehension of the flavour bestowed by the man and having him he had made them conscious of their deficiency his cook m dehors pupil of the great godefroy was not the only french cook in the county but his cousin and secretary the rising scholar the elegant essayist was an unparalleled decoration of his kind of course personally we laugh at him you had better not unless you are fain to show that the higher world of polite literature is unknown to you sir willoughby could create an abject silence at a county dinnertable by an allusion to vernon at work at home upon his etruscans or his dorians and he paused a moment to let the allusion sink laughed audibly to himself over his eccentric cousin and let him rest in addition sir willoughby abhorred the loss of a familiar face in his domestic circle he thought ill of servants who could accept their dismissal without petitioning to stay with him a servant that gave warning partook of a certain fiendishness vernons project of leaving the hall offended and alarmed the sensitive gentleman i shall have to hand letty dale to him at last he thought yielding in bitter generosity to the conditions imposed on him by the ungenerousness of another for since his engagement to miss middleton his electrically forethoughtful mind had seen in miss dale if she stayed in the neighbourhood and remained unmarried the governess of his infant children often consulting with him but here was a prospect dashed out the two then may marry and live in a cottage on the borders of his park and vernon can retain his post and laetitia her devotion the risk of her casting it of had to be faced marriage has been known to have such an effect on the most faithful of women that a great passion fades to naught in their volatile bosoms when they have taken a husband we see in women especially the triumph of the animal over the spiritual nevertheless risks must be run for a purpose in view having no taste for a discussion with vernon whom it was his habit to confound by breaking away from him abruptly when he had delivered his opinion he left it to both the persons interesting themselves in young crossjay to imagine that he was meditating on the question of the lad and to imagine that it would be wise to leave him to meditate for he could be preternaturally acute in reading any of his fellowcreatures if they crossed the current of his feelings and meanwhile he instructed the ladies eleanor and isabel to bring laetitia dale on a visit to the hall where dinnerparties were soon to be given and a pleasing talker would be wanted where also a woman of intellect steeped in a splendid sentiment hitherto a miracle of female constancy might stir a younger woman to some emulation definitely to resolve to bestow laetitia upon vernon was more than he could do enough that he held the card regarding clara his genius for perusing the heart which was not in perfect harmony with him through the series of responsive movements to his own informed him of a something in her character that might have suggested to mrs mountstuart jenkinson her indefensible absurd rogue in porcelain idea there was none in that phrase yet if you looked on clara as a delicately inimitable porcelain beauty the suspicion of a delicately inimitable ripple over her features touched a thought of innocent roguery wildwood roguery the likeness to the costly and lovely substance appeared to admit a fitness in the dubious epithet he detested but was haunted by the phrase she certainly had at times the look of the nymph that has gazed too long on the faun and has unwittingly copied his lurking lip and long sliding eye her play with young crossjay resembled a return of the lady to the cat she flung herself into it as if her real vitality had been in suspense till she saw the boy sir willoughby by no means disapproved of a physical liveliness that promised him health in his mate but he began to feel in their conversations that she did not sufficiently think of making herself a nest for him steely points were opposed to him when he figuratively bared his bosom to be taken to the softest and fairest she reasoned in other words armed her ignorance she reasoned against him publicly and lured vernon to support her influence is to be counted for power and her influence over vernon was displayed in her persuading him to dance one evening at lady culmers after his melancholy exhibitions of himself in the art and not only did she persuade him to stand up fronting her she manoeuvred him through the dance like a clever boy cajoling a top to come to him without reeling both to vernons contentment and to sir willoughbys for he was the last man to object to a manifestation of power in his bride considering her influence with vernon he renewed the discourse upon young crossjay and as he was addicted to system he took her into his confidence that she might be taught to look to him and act for him old vernon has not spoken to you again of that lad he said yes mr whitford has asked me he does not ask me my dear he may fancy me of greater aid than i am you see my love if he puts crossjay on me he will be off he has this craze for enlisting his pen in london as he calls it and i am accustomed to him i dont like to think of him as a hack scribe writing nonsense from dictation to earn a pitiful subsistence i want him here and supposing he goes he offends me he loses a friend and it will not be the first time that a friend has tried me too far but if he offends me he is extinct is what cried clara with a look of fright he becomes to me at once as if he had never been he is extinct in spite of your affection on account of it i might say our nature is mysterious and mine as much so as any whatever my regrets he goes out this is not a language i talk to the world i do the man no harm i am not to be named unchristian but sir willoughby mildly shrugged and indicated a spreading out of the arms but do do talk to me as you talk to the world willoughby give me some relief my own clara we are one you should know me at my worst we will say if you like as well as at my best should i speak too what could you have to confess she hung silent the wave of an insane resolution swelled in her bosom and subsided before she said cowardice incapacity to speak women said he we do not expect so much of women the heroic virtues as little as the vices they have not to unfold the scroll of character he resumed and by his tone she understood that she was now in the inner temple of him i tell you these things i quite acknowledge they do not elevate me they help to constitute my character i tell you most humbly that i have in me muchtoo much of the fallen archangels pride clara bowed her head over a sustained indrawn breath it must be pride he said in a reverie superinduced by her thoughtfulness over the revelation and glorying in the black flames demoniacal wherewith he crowned himself can you not correct it said she he replied profoundly vexed by disappointment i am what i am it might be demonstrated to you mathematically that it is corrected by equivalents or substitutions in my character if it be a failingassuming that it seems one to me so cruelly to punish mr whitford for seeking to improve his fortunes he reflects on my share in his fortunes he has had but to apply to me for his honorarium to be doubled he wishes for independence independence of me liberty at my expense oh willoughby ay but this is the world and i know it my love and beautiful as your incredulity may be you will find it more comforting to confide in my knowledge of the selfishness of the world my sweetest you willyou do for a breath of difference between us is intolerable do you not feel how it breaks our magic ring one small fissure and we have the world with its muddy delugebut my subject was old vernon yes i pay for crossjay if vernon consents to stay i waive my own scheme for the lad though i think it the better one now then to induce vernon to stay he has his ideas about staying under a mistress of the household and therefore not to contest ithe is a man of no argument a sort of lunatic determination takes the place of it with old vernonlet him settle close by me in one of my cottages very well and to settle him we must marry him who is there said clara beating for the lady in her mind women said willoughby are born matchmakers and the most persuasive is a young bride with a manand a man like old vernonshe is irresistible it is my wish and that arms you it is your wish that subjugates him if he goes he goes for good if he stays he is my friend i deal simply with him as with every one it is the secret of authority now miss dale will soon lose her father he exists on a pension she has the prospect of having to leave the neighbourhood of the hall unless she is established near us her whole heart is in this region it is the poor souls passion count on her agreeing but she will require a little wooing and old vernon wooing picture the scene to yourself my love his notion of wooing i suspect will be to treat the lady like a lexicon and turn over the leaves for the word and fly through the leaves for another word and so get a sentence dont frown at the poor old fellow my clara some have the language on their tongues and some have not some are very dry sticks manly men honest fellows but so cut away so polished away from the sex that they are in absolute want of outsiders to supply the silken filaments to attach them actually sir willoughby laughed in claras face to relax the dreamy stoniness of her look but i can assure you my dearest i have seen it vernon does not know how to speakas we speak he has or he had what is called a sneaking affection for miss dale it was the most amusing thing possible his courtshipthe air of a dog with an uneasy conscience trying to reconcile himself with his master we were all in fits of laughter of course it came to nothing will mr whitford said clara offend you to extinction if he declines willoughby breathed an affectionate tush to her silliness we bring them together as we best can you see clara i desire and i will make some sacrifices to detain him but what do you sacrificea cottage said clara combative at all points an ideal perhaps i lay no stress on sacrifice i strongly object to separations and therefore you will say i prepare the ground for unions put your influence to good service my love i believe you could persuade him to give us the highland fling on the drawingroom table there is nothing to say to him of crossjay we hold crossjay in reserve it is urgent trust me i have my ideas i am not idle that boy bids fair for a capital horseman eventualities might sir willoughby murmured to himself and addressing his bride the cavalry if we put him into the cavalry we might make a gentleman of himnot be ashamed of him or under certain eventualities the guards think it over my love de craye who will i suppose act best man for me supposing old vernon to pull at the collar is a lieutenantcolonel in the guards a thorough gentlemanof the brainless class if you like but an elegant fellow an irishman you will see him and i should like to set a naval lieutenant beside him in a drawingroom for you to compare them and consider the model you would choose for a boy you are interested in horace is grace and gallantry incarnate fatuous probably i have always been too friendly with him to examine closely he made himself one of my dogs though my elder and seemed to like to be at my heels one of the few mens faces i can call admirably handsomewith nothing behind it perhaps as vernon says a nothing picked by the vultures and bleached by the desert not a bad talker if you are satisfied with keeping up the ball he will amuse you old horace does not know how amusing he is did mr whitford say that of colonel de craye i forget the person of whom he said it so you have noticed old vernons foible quote him one of his epigrams and he is in motion head and heels it is an infallible receipt for tuning him if i want to have him in good temper i have only to remark as you said i straighten his back instantly i said clara have noticed chiefly his anxiety concerning the boy for which i admire him creditable if not particularly farsighted and sagacious well then my dear attack him at once lead him to the subject of our fair neighbour she is to be our guest for a week or so and the whole affair might be concluded far enough to fix him before she leaves she is at present awaiting the arrival of a cousin to attend on her father a little gentle pushing will precipitate old vernon on his knees as far as he ever can unbend them but when a lady is made ready to expect a declaration you know why she does notdoes shedemand the entire formulathough some beautiful fortresses he enfolded her clara was growing hardened to it to this she was fated and not seeing any way to escape she invoked a friendly frost to strike her blood and passed through the minute unfeelingly having passed it she reproached herself for making so much of it thinking it a lesser endurance than to listen to him what could she doshe was caged by her word of honour as she at one time thought by her cowardice at another and dimly sensible that the latter was a stronger lock than the former she mused on the abstract question whether a womans cowardice can be so absolute as to cast her into the jaws of her aversion is it to be conceived is there not a moment when it stands at bay but haggardvisaged honour then starts up claiming to be dealt with in turn for having courage restored to her she must have the courage to break with honour she must dare to be faithless and not merely say i will be brave but be brave enough to be dishonourable the cage of a plighted woman hungering for her disengagement has two keepers a noble and a vile where on earth is creature so dreadfully enclosed it lies with her to overcome what degrades her that she may win to liberty by overcoming what exalts contemplating her situation this idea or vapour of youth taking the godlike semblance of an idea sprang born of her present sickness in claras mind that it must be an illconstructed tumbling world where the hour of ignorance is made the creator of our destiny by being forced to the decisive elections upon which lifes main issues hang her teacher had brought her to contemplate his view of the world she thought likewise how must a man despise women who can expose himself as he does to me miss middleton owed it to sir willoughby patterne that she ceased to think like a girl when had the great change begun glancing back she could imagine that it was near the period we call in love the firstalmost from the first and she was led to imagine it through having become barred from imagining her own emotions of that season they were so dead as not to arise even under the form of shadows in fancy without imputing blame to him for she was reasonable so far she deemed herself a person entrapped in a dream somehow she had committed herself to a lifelong imprisonment and oh terror not in a quiet dungeon the barren walls closed round her talked called for ardour expected admiration she was unable to say why she could not give it why she retreated more and more inwardly why she invoked the frost to kill her tenderest feelings she was in revolt until a whisper of the day of bells reduced her to blank submission out of which a breath of peace drew her to revolt again in gradual rapid stages and once more the aspect of that singular day of merry blackness felled her to earth it was alive it advanced it had a mouth it had a song she received letters of bridesmaids writing of it and felt them as waves that hurl a log of wreck to shore following which afflicting sense of antagonism to the whole circle sweeping on with her she considered the possibility of her being in a commencement of madness otherwise might she not be accused of a capriciousness quite as deplorable to consider she had written to certain of these young ladies not very long since of this gentlemanhowin what tone and was it her madness thenher recovery now it seemed to her that to have written of him enthusiastically resembled madness more than to shudder away from the union but standing alone opposing all she has consented to set in motion is too strange to a girl for perfect justification to be found in reason when she seeks it sir willoughby was destined himself to supply her with that key of special insight which revealed and stamped him in a title to fortify her spirit of revolt consecrate it almost the popular physician of the county and famous anecdotal wit dr corney had been a guest at dinner overnight and the next day there was talk of him and of the resources of his art displayed by armand dehors on his hearing that he was to minister to the tastes of a gathering of hommes desprit sir willoughby glanced at dehors with his customary benevolent irony in speaking of the persons great in their way who served him why he cannot give us daily so good a dinner one must i suppose go to french nature to learn the french are in the habit of making up for all their deficiencies with enthusiasm they have no reverence if i had said to him i want something particularly excellent dehors i should have had a commonplace dinner but they have enthusiasm on draught and that is what we must pull at know one frenchman and you know france i have had dehors under my eye two years and i can mount his enthusiasm at a word he took hommes desprit to denote men of letters frenchmen have destroyed their nobility so for the sake of excitement they put up the literary mannot to worship him that they cant do its to put themselves in a state of effervescence they will not have real greatness above them so they have sham that they may justly call it equality perhaps ay for all your shake of the head my good vernon you see human nature comes round again try as we may to upset it and the french only differ from us in wading through blood to discover that they are at their old trick once more i am your equal sir your born equal oh you are a man of letters allow me to be in a bubble about you yes vernon and i believe the fellow looks up to you as the head of the establishment i am not jealous provided he attends to his functions theres a french philosopher whos for naming the days of the year after the birthdays of french men of letters voltaireday rousseauday racineday so on perhaps vernon will inform us who takes april st a few trifling errors are of no consequence when you are in the vein of satire said vernon be satisfied with knowing a nation in the person of a cook they may be reading us english off in a jockey said dr middleton i believe that jockeys are the exchange we make for cooks and our neighbours do not get the best of the bargain no but my dear good vernon its nonsensical said sir willoughby why be bawling every day the name of men of letters philosophers well philosophers of all countries and times and they are the benefactors of humanity bene sir willoughbys derisive laugh broke the word theres a pretension in all that irreconcilable with english sound sense surely you see it we might said vernon if you like give alternative titles to the days or have alternating days devoted to our great families that performed meritorious deeds upon such a day the rebel clara delighting in his banter was heard can we furnish sufficient a poet or two could help us perhaps a statesman she suggested a pugilist if wanted for blowy days observed dr middleton and hastily in penitence picked up the conversation he had unintentionally prostrated with a general remark on newfangled notions and a word aside to vernon which created the blissful suspicion in clara that her father was indisposed to second sir willoughbys opinions even when sharing them sir willoughby had led the conversation displeased that the lead should be withdrawn from him he turned to clara and related one of the afterdinner anecdotes of dr corney and another with a vast deal of human nature in it concerning a valetudinarian gentleman whose wife chanced to be desperately ill and he went to the physicians assembled in consultation outside the sickroom imploring them by all he valued and in tears to save the poor patient for him saying she is everything to me everything and if she dies i am compelled to run the risks of marrying again i must marry again for she has accustomed me so to the little attentions of a wife that in truth i cant i cant lose her she must be saved and the loving husband of any devoted wife wrung his hands now there clara there you have the egoist added sir willoughby that is the perfect egoist you see what he comes toand his wife the man was utterly unconscious of giving vent to the grossest selfishness an egoist said clara beware of marrying an egoist my dear he bowed gallantly and so blindly fatuous did he appear to her that she could hardly believe him guilty of uttering the words she had heard from him and kept her eyes on him vacantly till she came to a sudden full stop in the thoughts directing her gaze she looked at vernon she looked at her father and at the ladies eleanor and isabel none of them saw the man in the word none noticed the word yet this word was her medical herb her illuminating lamp the key of him and alas but she thought it by feeling her need of one the advocate pleading in apology for her egoist she beheld himunfortunate selfdesignated man that he wasin his good qualities as well as bad under the implacable lamp and his good were drenched in his first person singular his generosity roared of i louder than the rest conceive him at the age of dr corneys hero pray save my wife for me i shall positively have to get another if i lose her and one who may not love me half so well or understand the peculiarities of my character and appreciate my attitudes he was in his thirtysecond year therefore a young man strong and healthy yet his garrulous return to his principal theme his emphasis on i and me lent him the seeming of an old man spotted with decaying youth beware of marrying an egoist would he help her to escape the idea of the scene ensuing upon her petition for release and the being dragged round the walls of his egoism and having her head knocked against the corners alarmed her with sensations of sickness there was the example of constantia but that desperate young lady had been assisted by a gallant loving gentleman she had met a captain oxford clara brooded on those two until they seemed heroic she questioned herself could she were one to come she shut her eyes in languor leaning the wrong way of her wishes yet unable to say no sir willoughby had positively said beware marrying him would be a deed committed in spite of his express warning she went so far as to conceive him subsequently saying i warned you she conceived the state of marriage with him as that of a woman tied not to a man of heart but to an obelisk lettered all over with hieroglyphics and everlastingly hearing him expound them relishing renewing his lectures on them full surely this immovable stoneman would not release her this petrifaction of egoism would from amazedly to austerely refuse the petition his pride would debar him from understanding her desire to be released and if she resolved on it without doing it straightway in constantias manner the miserable bewilderment of her father for whom such a complication would be a tragic dilemma had to be thought of her father with all his tenderness for his child would make a stand on the point of honour though certain to yield to her he would be distressed in a tempest of worry and dr middleton thus afflicted threw up his arms he shunned books shunned speech and resembled a castaway on the ocean with nothing between himself and his calamity as for the world it would be barking at her heels she might call the man she wrenched her hand from egoist jilt the world would call her she dwelt bitterly on her agreement with sir willoughby regarding the world laying it to his charge that her garden had become a place of nettles her horizon an unlighted fourth side of a square clara passed from person to person visiting the hall there was universal and as she was compelled to see honest admiration of the host not a soul had a suspicion of his cloaked nature her agony of hypocrisy in accepting their compliments as the bride of sir willoughby patterne was poorly moderated by contempt of them for their infatuation she tried to cheat herself with the thought that they were right and that she was the foolish and wicked inconstant in her anxiety to strangle the rebelliousness which had been communicated from her mind to her blood and was present with her whether her mind was in action or not she encouraged the ladies eleanor and isabel to magnify the fictitious man of their idolatry hoping that she might enter into them imaginatively that she might to some degree subdue herself to the necessity of her position if she partly succeeded in stupefying her antagonism five minutes of him undid the work he requested her to wear the patterne pearls for a dinnerparty of grand ladies telling her that he would commission miss isabel to take them to her clara begged leave to decline them on the plea of having no right to wear them he laughed at her modish modesty but really it might almost be classed with affectation said he i give you the right virtually you are my wife no before heaven no we are not married as my betrothed will you wear them to please me i would rather not i cannot wear borrowed jewels these i cannot wear forgive me i cannot and willoughby she said scorning herself for want of fortitude in not keeping to the simply blunt provocative refusal does one not look like a victim decked for the sacrificethe garlanded heifer you see on greek vases in that array of jewellery my dear clara exclaimed the astonished lover how can you term them borrowed when they are the patterne jewels our family heirloom pearls unmatched i venture to affirm decidedly in my county and many others and passing to the use of the mistress of the house in the natural course of things they are yours they are not mine prospectively they are yours it would be to anticipate the fact to wear them with my consent my approval at my request i am not yet i never may be my wife he laughed triumphantly and silenced her by manly smothering her scruple was perhaps an honourable one he said perhaps the jewels were safer in their iron box he had merely intended a surprise and gratification to her courage was coming to enable her to speak more plainly when his discontinuing to insist on her wearing the jewels under an appearance of deference of her wishes disarmed her by touching her sympathies she said however i fear we do not often agree willoughby when you are a little older was the irritating answer it would then be too late to make the discovery the discovery i apprehend is not imperative my love it seems to me that our minds are opposed i should said he have been awake to it at a single indication be sure but i know she pursued i have learned that the ideal of conduct for women is to subject their minds to the part of an accompaniment for women my love my wife will be in natural harmony with me ah she compressed her lips the yawn would come i am sleepier here than anywhere ours my clara is the finest air of the kingdom it has the effect of seaair but if i am always asleep here we shall have to make a public exhibition of the beauty this dash of his liveliness defeated her she left him feeling the contempt of the brain feverishly quickened and finepointed for the brain chewing the cud in the happy pastures of unawakedness so violent was the fever so keen her introspection that she spared few and vernon was not among them young crossjay whom she considered the least able of all to act as an ally was the only one she courted with a real desire to please him he was the one she affectionately envied he was the youngest the freest he had the world before him and he did not know how horrible the world was or could be made to look she loved the boy from expecting nothing of him others vernon whitford for instance could help and moved no hand he read her case a scrutiny so penetrating under its air of abstract thoughtfulness though his eyes did but rest on her a second or two signified that he read her line by line and to the endexcepting what she thought of him for probing her with that sharp steel of insight without a purpose she knew her minds injustice it was her case her lamentable casethe impatient panicstricken nerves of a captured wild creature which cried for help she exaggerated her sufferings to get strength to throw them off and lost it in the recognition that they were exaggerated and out of the conflict issued recklessness with a cry as wild as any coming of madness for she did not blush in saying to herself if some one loved me before hearing of constantia she had mused upon liberty as a virgin goddessmen were out of her thoughts even the figure of a rescuer if one dawned in her mind was more angel than hero that fair childish maidenliness had ceased with her body straining in her dragons grasp with the savour of loathing unable to contend unable to speak aloud she began to speak to herself and all the health of her nature made her outcry womanly if i were lovednot for the sake of love but for free breathing and her utterance of it was to insure life and enduringness to the wish as the yearning of a mother on a drowning ship is to get her infant to shore if some noble gentleman could see me as i am and not disdain to aid me oh to be caught up out of this prison of thorns and brambles i cannot tear my own way out i am a coward my cry for help confesses that a beckoning of a finger would change me i believe i could fly bleeding and through hootings to a comrade oh a comrade i do not want a lover i should find another egoist not so bad but enough to make me take a breath like death i could follow a soldier like poor sally or molly he stakes his life for his country and a woman may be proud of the worst of men who do that constantia met a soldier perhaps she prayed and her prayer was answered she did ill but oh how i love her for it his name was harry oxford papa would call him her perseus she must have felt that there was no explaining what she suffered she had only to act to plunge first she fixed her mind on harry oxford to be able to speak his name and see him awaiting her must have been relief a reprieve she did not waver she cut the links she signed herself over oh brave girl what do you think of me but i have no harry whitford i am alone let anything be said against women we must be very bad to have such bad things written of us only say this that to ask them to sign themselves over by oath and ceremony because of an ignorant promise to the man they have been mistaken in is it is the sudden consciousness that she had put another name for oxford struck her a buffet drowning her in crimson chapter xi the doubleblossom wild cherrytree sir willoughby chose a moment when clara was with him and he had a good retreat through foldingwindows to the lawn in case of cogency on the enemys part to attack his cousin regarding the preposterous plot to upset the family by a scamper to london by the way vernon what is this youve been mumbling to everybody save me about leaving us to pitch yourself into the stewpot and be made broth of london is no better and you are fit for considerably better dont i beg you continue to annoy me take a run abroad if you are restless take two or three months and join us as we are travelling home and then think of settling pray follow my example if you like you can have one of my cottages or a place built for you anything to keep a man from destroying the sense of stability about one in london my dear old fellow you lose your identity what are you there i ask you what one has the feeling of the house crumbling when a man is perpetually for shifting and cannot fix himself here you are known you can study at your ease up in london you are nobody i tell you honestly i feel it myself a week of london literally drives me home to discover the individual where i left him be advised you dont mean to go i have the intention said vernon why ive mentioned it to you to my face over your shoulder is generally the only chance you give me you have not mentioned it to me to my knowledge as to the reason i might hear a dozen of your reasons and i should not understand one its against your interests and against my wishes come friend i am not the only one you distress why vernon you yourself have said that the english would be very perfect jews if they could manage to live on the patriarchal system you said it yes you said itbut i recollect it clearly oh as for your doublemeanings you said the thing and you jeered at the incapacity of english families to live together on account of bad temper and now you are the first to break up our union i decidedly do not profess to be a perfect jew but i do sir willoughby caught signs of a probably smiling commerce between his bride and his cousin he raised his face appeared to be consulting his eyelids and resolved to laugh well i own it i do like the idea of living patriarchally he turned to clara the rev doctor one of us my father she said why not papas habits are those of a scholar that you might not be separated from him my dear clara thanked sir willoughby for the kindness of thinking of her father mentally analysing the kindness in which at least she found no unkindness scarcely egoism though she knew it to be there we might propose it said he as a compliment if he would condescend to accept it as a compliment these great scholars and if vernon goes our inducement for dr middleton to stay but it is too absurd for discussion oh vernon about master crossjay i will see to it he was about to give vernon his shoulder and step into the garden when clara said you will have crossjay trained for the navy willoughby there is not a day to lose yes yes i will see to it depend on me for holding the young rascal in view he presented his hand to her to lead her over the step to the gravel surprised to behold how flushed she was she responded to the invitation by putting her hand forth from a bent elbow with hesitating fingers it should not be postponed willoughby her attitude suggested a stipulation before she touched him its an affair of money as you know willoughby said vernon if im in london i cant well provide for the boy for some time to come or its not certain that i can why on earth should you go thats another matter i want you to take my place with him in which case the circumstances are changed i am responsible for him and i have a right to bring him up according to my own prescription we are likely to have one idle lout the more i guarantee to make a gentleman of him we have too many of your gentlemen already you cant have enough my good vernon theyre the national apology for indolence training a penniless boy to be one of them is nearly as bad as an education in a thieves den he will be just as much at war with society if not game for the police vernon have you seen crossjays father the now captain of marines i think you have hes a good man and a very gallant officer and in spite of his qualities hes a cub and an old cub he is a captain now but he takes that rank very late you will own there you have what you call a good man undoubtedly a gallant officer neutralized by the fact that he is not a gentleman holding intercourse with him is out of the question no wonder government declines to advance him rapidly young crossjay does not bear your name he bears mine and on that point alone i should have a voice in the settlement of his career and i say emphatically that a drawingroom approval of a young man is the best certificate for his general chances in life i know of a city of london merchant of some sort and i know a firm of lawyers who will have none but university men at their office at least they have the preference crossjay has a bullet head fit neither for the university nor the drawingroom said vernon equal to fighting and dying for you and thats all sir willoughby contented himself with replying the lad is a favourite of mine his anxiety to escape a rejoinder caused him to step into the garden leaving clara behind him my love said he in apology as he turned to her she could not look stern but she had a look without a dimple to soften it and her eyes shone for she had wagered in her heart that the dialogue she provoked upon crossjay would expose the egoist and there were other motives wrapped up and intertwisted unrecognizable sufficient to strike her with worse than the flush of her selfknowledge of wickedness when she detained him to speak of crossjay before vernon at last it had been seen that she was conscious of suffering in her association with this egoist vernon stood for the world taken into her confidence the world then would not think so ill of her she thought hopefully at the same time that she thought most evilly of herself but selfaccusations were for the day of reckoning she would and must have the world with her or the belief that it was coming to her in the terrible struggle she foresaw within her horizon of self now her utter boundary she needed it for the inevitable conflict little sacrifices of her honesty might be made considering how weak she was how solitary how dismally entangled daily disgraced beyond the power of any veiling to conceal from her fiery sensations a little hypocrisy was a poor girls natural weapon she crushed her conscientious mind with the assurance that it was magnifying trifles not entirely unaware that she was thereby preparing it for a convenient blindness in the presence of dread alternatives but the pride of laying such stress on small sins gave her purity a blush of pleasure and overcame the inner warning in truth she dared not think evilly of herself for long sailing into battle as she was nuns and anchorites may they have leisure she regretted the forfeits she had to pay for selfassistance and if it might be won the worlds regretted felt the peril of the loss and took them up and flung them you see old vernon has no argument willoughby said to her he drew her hand more securely on his arm to make her sensible that she leaned on a pillar of strength whenever the little brain is in doubt perplexed undecided which course to adopt she will come to me will she not i shall always listen he resumed soothingly my own and i to you when the world vexes me so we round our completeness you will know me you will know me in good time i am not a mystery to those to whom i unfold myself i do not pretend to mystery yet i will confess your homeyour heartswilloughby is not exactly identical with the willoughby before the world one must be armed against that rough beast certain is the vengeance of the young upon monotony nothing more certain they do not scheme it but sameness is a poison to their systems and vengeance is their heartier breathing their stretch of the limbs run in the fields nature avenges them when does colonel de craye arrive said clara horace in two or three days you wish him to be on the spot to learn his part my love she had not flown forward to the thought of colonel de crayes arrival she knew not why she had mentioned him but now she flew back shocked first into shadowy subterfuge and then into the criminals dock i do not wish him to be here i do not know that he has a part to learn i have no wish willoughby did you not say i should come to you and you would listenwill you listen i am so commonplace that i shall not be understood by you unless you take my words for the very meaning of the words i am unworthy i am volatile i love my liberty i want to be free flitch he called it sounded necromantic pardon me my love he said the man you see yonder violates my express injunction that he is not to come on my grounds and here i find him on the borders of my garden sir willoughby waved his hand to the abject figure of a man standing to intercept him volatile unworthy libertymy dearest he bent to her when the man had appeased him by departing you are at liberty within the law like all good women i shall control and direct your volatility and your sense of worthiness must be reestablished when we are more intimate it is timidity the sense of unworthiness is a guarantee of worthiness ensuing i believe i am in the vein of a sermon whose the fault the sight of that man was annoying flitch was a stableboy groom and coachman like his father before him at the hall thirty years his father died in our service mr flitch had not a single grievance here only one day the demon seizes him with the notion of bettering himself he wants his independence and he presents himself to me with a story of a shop in our county townflitch remember if you go you go for goodoh he quite comprehendedvery well goodbye flitchthe man was respectful he looked the fool he was very soon to turn out to be since then within a period of several years i have had him against my express injunctions ten times on my grounds its curious to calculate of course the shop failed and flitchs independence consists in walking about with his hands in his empty pockets and looking at the hall from some elevation near is he married has he children said clara nine and a wife that cannot cook or sew or wash linen you could not give him employment after his having dismissed himself it might be overlooked here he was happy he decided to go elsewhere to be freeof course of my yoke he quitted my service against my warning flitch we will say emigrated with his wife and children and the ship foundered he returns but his place is filled he is a ghost here and i object to ghosts some work might be found for him it will be the same with old vernon my dear if he goes he goes for good it is the vital principle of my authority to insist on that a dead leaf might as reasonably demand to return to the tree once off off for all eternity i am sorry but such was your decision my friend i have you see clara elements in me dreadful exert your persuasive powers with vernon you can do wellnigh what you will with the old fellow we have miss dale this evening for a week or two lead him to some ideas of herelements in me i was remarking which will no more bear to be handled carelessly than gunpowder at the same time there is no reason why they should not be respected managed with some degree of regard for me and attention to consequences those who have not done so have repented you do not speak to others of the elements in you said clara i certainly do not i have but one bride was his handsome reply is it fair to me that you should show me the worst of you all myself my own his ingratiating droop and familiar smile rendered all myself so affectionately meaningful in its happy reliance upon her excess of love that at last she understood she was expected to worship him and uphold him for whatsoever he might be without any estimation of qualities as indeed love does or young love does as she perhaps did once before he chilled her senses that was before her little brain had become active and had turned her senses to revolt it was on the full river of love that sir willoughby supposed the whole floating bulk of his personality to be securely sustained and therefore it was that believing himself swimming at his ease he discoursed of himself she went straight away from that idea with her mental exclamation why does he not paint himself in brighter colours to me and the question has he no ideal of generosity and chivalry but the unfortunate gentleman imagined himself to be loved on loves very bosom he fancied that everything relating to himself excited maidenly curiosity womanly reverence ardours to know more of him which he was ever willing to satisfy by repeating the same things his notion of women was the primitive black and white there are good women bad women and he possessed a good one his high opinion of himself fortified the belief that providence as a matter of justice and fitness must necessarily select a good one for himor what are we to think of providence and this female shaped by that informing hand would naturally be in harmony with him from the centre of his profound identity to the raying circle of his variations know the centre you know the circle and you discover that the variations are simply characteristics but you must travel on the rays from the circle to get to the centre consequently sir willoughby put miss middleton on one or other of these converging lines from time to time us too he drags into the deeps but when we have harpooned a whale and are attached to the rope down we must go the miracle is to see us rise again women of mixed essences shading off the divine to the considerably lower were outside his vision of woman his mind could as little admit an angel in pottery as a rogue in porcelain for him they were what they were when fashioned at the beginning many cracked many stained here and there a perfect specimen designed for the elect of men at a whisper of the world he shut the prudes door on them with a slam himself would have branded them with the letters in the hue of fire privately he did so and he was constituted by his extreme sensitiveness and taste for ultrafeminine refinement to be a severe critic of them during the carnival of egoism the loveseason constantia can it be told she had been be it said a fair and frank young merchant with him in that season she was of a nature to be a mother of heroes she met the salute almost halfway ingenuously unlike the coming mothers of the regiments of marionettes who retire in vapours downcast as by convention ladies most flattering to the egoistical gentleman for they proclaim him the first constantias offence had been no greater but it was not that dramatic performance of purity which he desired of an affianced lady and so the offence was great the loveseason is the carnival of egoism and it brings the touchstone to our natures i speak of love not the mask and not of the flutings upon the theme of love but of the passion a flame having like our mortality death in it as well as life that may or may not be lasting applied to sir willoughby as to thousands of civilized males the touchstone found him requiring to be dealt with by his betrothed as an original savage she was required to play incessantly on the first reclaiming chord which led our ancestral satyr to the measures of the dance the threading of the maze and the setting conformably to his partner before it was accorded to him to spin her with both hands and a chirrup of his frisky heels to keep him in awe and hold him enchained there are things she must never do dare never say must not think she must be cloistral now strange and awful though it be to hear women perceive this requirement of them in the spirit of the man they perceive too and it may be gratefully that they address their performances less to the taming of the green and prankish monsieur of the forest than to the pacification of a voracious aesthetic gluttony craving them insatiably through all the tenses with shrieks of the lamentable letter i for their purity whether they see that it has its foundation in the sensual and distinguish the ultrarefined but lineally greatgrandson of the hoof in this vast and dainty exacting appetite is uncertain they probably do not the more the damage for in the appeasement of the glutton they have to practise much simulation they are in their way losers like their ancient mothers it is the palpable and material of them still which they are tempted to flourish wherewith to invite and allay pursuit a condition under which the spiritual wherein their hope lies languishes the capaciously strong in soul among women will ultimately detect an infinite grossness in the demand for purity infinite spotless bloom earlier or later they see they have been victims of the singular egoist have worn a mask of ignorance to be named innocent have turned themselves into market produce for his delight and have really abandoned the commodity in ministering to the lust for it suffered themselves to be dragged ages back in playing upon the fleshly innocence of happy accident to gratify his jealous greed of possession when it should have been their task to set the soul above the fairest fortune and the gift of strength in women beyond ornamental whiteness are they not of nature warriors like menmens mates to bear them heroes instead of puppets but the devouring male egoist prefers them as inanimate overwrought polished pure metal precious vessels fresh from the hands of the artificer for him to walk away with hugging call all his own drink of and fill and drink of and forget that he stole them this running off on a byroad is no deviation from sir willoughby patterne and miss clara middleton he a fairly intelligent man and very sensitive was blinded to what was going on within her visibly enough by her production of the article he demanded of her sex he had to leave the fair young lady to ride to his countytown and his design was to conduct her through the covert of a group of laurels there to revel in her soft confusion she resisted nay resolutely returned to the lawnsward he contrasted her with constantia in the amorous time and rejoiced in his disappointment he saw the goddess modesty guarding purity and one would be bold to say that he did not hear the precepts puritys aged grannams maternal and paternal cawing approval of her over their munching gums and if you ask whether a man sensitive and a lover can be so blinded you are condemned to reperuse the foregoing paragraph miss middleton was not sufficiently instructed in the position of her sex to know that she had plunged herself in the thick of the strife of one of their great battles her personal position however was instilling knowledge rapidly as a disease in the frame teaches us what we are and have to contend with could she marry this man he was evidently manageable could she condescend to the use of arts in managing him to obtain a placable lifea horror of swampy flatness so vividly did the sight of that dead heaven over an unvarying level earth swim on her fancy that she shut her eyes in angry exclusion of it as if it were outside assailing her and she nearly stumbled upon young crossjay oh have i hurt you he cried no said she it was my fault lead me somewhere away from everybody the boy took her hand and she resumed her thoughts and pressing his fingers and feeling warm to him both for his presence and silence so does the blood in youth lead the mind even cool and innocent blood even with a touch that she said to herself and if i marry and then where will honour be then i marry him to be true to my word of honour and if then an intolerable languor caused her to sigh profoundly it is written as she thought it she thought in blanks as girls do and some women a shadow of the male egoist is in the chamber of their brains overawing them were i to marry and to run there is the thought she is offered up to your mercy we are dealing with a girl feeling herself desperately situated and not a fool im sure youre dead tired though said crossjay no i am not what makes you think so said clara i do think so but why do you think so youre so hot what makes you think that youre so red so are you crossjay im only red in the middle of the cheeks except when ive been running and then you talk to yourself just as boys do when they are blown do they they say i know i could have kept up longer or my buckle broke all to themselves when they break down running and you have noticed that and miss middleton i dont wish you were a boy but i should like to live near you all my life and be a gentleman im coming with miss dale this evening to stay at the hall and be looked after instead of stopping with her cousin who takes care of her father perhaps you and ill play chess at night at night you will go to bed crossjay not if i have sir willoughby to catch hold of he says im an authority on birds eggs i can manage rabbits and poultry isnt a farmer a happy man but he doesnt marry ladies a cavalry officer has the best chance but you are going to be a naval officer i dont know its not positive i shall bring my two dormice and make them perform gymnastics on the dinnertable theyre such dear little things naval officers are not like sir willoughby no they are not said clara they give their lives to their country and then theyre dead said crossjay clara wished sir willoughby were confronting her she could have spoken she asked the boy where mr whitford was crossjay pointed very secretly in the direction of the doubleblossom wildcherry coming within gaze of the stem she beheld vernon stretched at length reading she supposed asleep she discovered his finger in the leaves of a book and what book she had a curiosity to know the title of the book he would read beneath these boughs and grasping crossjays hand fast she craned her neck as one timorous of a fall in peeping over chasms for a glimpse of the page but immediately and still with a bent head she turned her face to where the load of virginal blossom whiter than summercloud on the sky showered and drooped and clustered so thick as to claim colour and seem like higher alpine snows in noonsunlight a flush of white from deep to deeper heavens of white her eyes perched and soared wonder lived in her happiness in the beauty of the tree pressed to supplant it and was more mortal and narrower reflection came contracting her vision and weighing her to earth her reflection was he must be good who loves to be and sleep beneath the branches of this tree she would rather have clung to her first impression wonder so divine so unbounded was like soaring into homes of angelcrowded space sweeping through folded and on to folded white fountainbow of wings in innumerable columns but the thought of it was no recovery of it she might as well have striven to be a child the sensation of happiness promised to be less shortlived in memory and would have been had not her present disease of the longing for happiness ravaged every corner of it for the secret of its existence the reflection took root he must be good that reflection vowed to endure poor by comparison with what it displaced it presented itself to her as conferring something on him and she would not have had it absent though it robbed her she looked down vernon was dreamily looking up she plucked crossjay hurriedly away whispering that he had better not wake mr whitford and then she proposed to reverse their previous chase and she be the hound and he the hare crossjay fetched a magnificent start on his glancing behind he saw miss middleton walking listlessly with a hand at her side theres a regular girl said he in some disgust for his theory was that girls always have something the matter with them to spoil a game chapter xii miss middleton and mr vernon whitford looking upward not quite awakened out of a transient doze at a fair head circled in dazzling blossom one may temporize awhile with common sense and take it for a vision after the eyes have regained direction of the mind vernon did so until the plastic vision interwound with reality alarmingly this is the embrace of a melusine who will soon have the brain if she is encouraged slight dalliance with her makes the very diminutive seem as big as life he jumped to his feet rattled his throat planted firmness on his brows and mouth and attacked the dreamgiving earth with tremendous long strides that his blood might be lively at the throne of understanding miss middleton and young crossjay were within hail it was her face he had seen and still the idea of a vision chased from his reasonable wits knocked hard and again for readmission there was little for a man of humble mind toward the sex to think of in the fact of a young ladys bending rather low to peep at him asleep except that the poise of her slender figure between an air of spying and of listening vividly recalled his likening of her to the mountain echo man or maid sleeping in the open air provokes your tiptoe curiosity men it is known have in that state cruelly been kissed and no rights are bestowed on them they are teased by a vapourish rapture what has happened to them the poor fellows barely divine they have a crazy step from that day but a vision is not so distracting it is our own we can put it aside and return to it play at rich and poor with it and are not to be summoned before your laws and rules for secreting it in our treasury besides it is the golden key of all the possible new worlds expand beneath the dawn it brings us just outside reality it illumines enriches and softens real thingsand to desire it in preference to the simple fact is a damning proof of enervation such was vernons winding up of his brief drama of fantasy he was aware of the fantastical element in him and soon had it under which of us who is of any worth is without it he had not much vanity to trouble him and passion was quiet so his task was not gigantic especially be it remarked that he was a man of quick pace the sovereign remedy for the dispersing of the mental fenmist he had tried it and knew that nonsense is to be walked off near the end of the park young crossjay overtook him and after acting the pumped one a trifle more than needful cried i say mr whitford theres miss middleton with her handkerchief out what for my lad said vernon im sure i dont know all of a sudden she bumped down and look what fellows girls arehere she comes as if nothing had happened and i saw her feel at her side clara was shaking her head to express a denial i am not at all unwell she said when she came near i guessed crossjays business in running up to you hes a goodfornothing officious boy i was tired and rested for a moment crossjay peered at her eyelids vernon looked away and said are you too tired for a stroll not now shall it be brisk you have the lead he led at a swing of the legs that accelerated young crossjays to the double but she with her short swift equal steps glided along easily on a fine by his shoulder and he groaned to think that of all the girls of earth this one should have been chosen for the position of fine lady you wont tire me said she in answer to his look you remind me of the little piedmontese bersaglieri on the march i have seen them trotting into como from milan they cover a quantity of ground in a day if the grounds flat you want another sort of step for the mountains i should not attempt to dance up they soon tame romantic notions of them the mountains tame luxurious dreams you mean i see how they are conquered i can plod anything to be high up well there you have the secret of good work to plod on and still keep the passion fresh yes when we have an aim in view we always have one captives have more than the rest of us ignorant man what of wives miserably wedded what aim in view have these most woeful captives horror shrouds it and shame reddens through the folds to tell of innermost horror take me back to the mountains if you please mr whitford miss middleton said fallen out of sympathy with him captives have death in view but that is not an aim why may not captives expect a release hardly from a tyrant if you are thinking of tyrants it may be so say the tyrant dies the prisongates are unlocked and out comes a skeleton but why will you talk of skeletons the very name of mountain seems life in comparison with any other subject i assure you said vernon with the fervour of a man lighting on an actual truth in his conversation with a young lady its not the first time i have thought you would be at home in the alps you would walk and climb as well as you dance she liked to hear clara middleton talked of and of her having been thought of and giving him friendly eyes barely noticing that he was in a glow she said if you speak so encouragingly i shall fancy we are near an ascent i wish we were said he we can realize it by dwelling on it dont you think we can begin climbing oh she squeezed herself shadowily which mountain shall it be said vernon in the right real earnest tone miss middleton suggested a ladys mountain first for a trial and then if you think well enough of meif i have not stumbled more than twice or asked more than ten times how far it is from the top i should like to be promoted to scale a giant they went up to some of the lesser heights of switzerland and styria and settled in south tyrol the young lady preferring this district for the strenuous exercise of her climbing powers because she loved italian colour and it seemed an exceedingly good reason to the genial imagination she had awakened in mr whitford though said he abruptly you are not so much italian as french she hoped she was english she remarked of course you are english yes he moderated his ascent with the halting affirmative she inquired wonderingly why he spoke in apparent hesitation well you have french feet for example french wits french impatience he lowered his voice and charm and love of compliments possibly i was not conscious of paying them and a disposition to rebel to challenge authority at least that is a dreadful character at all events it is a character fit for an alpine comrade for the best of comrades anywhere it is not a piece of drawingroom sculpture that is the most one can say for it she dropped a dramatic sigh had he been willing she would have continued the theme for the pleasure a poor creature long gnawing her sensations finds in seeing herself from the outside it fell away after a silence she could not renew it and he was evidently indifferent having to his own satisfaction dissected and stamped her a foreigner with it passed her holiday she had forgotten sir willoughby she remembered him and said you knew miss durham mr whitford he answered briefly i did was she some hotfaced inquiry peered forth and withdrew very handsome said vernon english yes the dashing style of english very courageous i dare say she had a kind of courage she did very wrong i wont say no she discovered a man more of a match with herself luckily not too late were at the mercy was she not unpardonable i should be sorry to think that of any one but you agree that she did wrong i suppose i do she made a mistake and she corrected it if she had not she would have made a greater mistake the manner that was badas far as we know the world has not much right to judge a false start must now and then be made its better not to take notice of it i think what is it we are at the mercy of currents of feeling our natures i am the last man to preach on the subject young ladies are enigmas to me i fancy they must have a natural perception of the husband suitable to them and the reverse and if they have a certain degree of courage it follows that they please themselves they are not to reflect on the harm they do said miss middleton by all means let them reflect they hurt nobody by doing that but a breach of faith if the faith can be kept through life alls well and then there is the cruelty the injury i really think that if a young lady came to me to inform me she must break our engagementi have never been put to the proof but to suppose iti should not think her cruel then she would not be much of a loss and i should not think so for this reason that it is impossible for a girl to come to such a resolution without previously showing signs of it to her the man she is engaged to i think it unfair to engage a girl for longer than a week or two just time enough for her preparations and publications if he is always intent on himself signs are likely to be unheeded by him said miss middleton he did not answer and she said quickly it must always be a cruelty the world will think so it is an act of inconstancy if they knew one another well before they were engaged are you not singularly tolerant said she to which vernon replied with airy cordiality in some cases it is right to judge by results well leave severity to the historian who is bound to be a professional moralist and put pleas of human nature out of the scales the lady in question may have been to blame but no hearts were broken and here we have four happy instead of two miserable his persecuting geniality of countenance appealed to her to confirm this judgement by results and she nodded and said four as the awestricken speak from that moment until young crossjay fell into the greenrutted lane from a tree and was got on his legs half stunned with a hanging lip and a face like the inside of a flayed eelskin she might have been walking in the desert and alone for the pleasure she had in society they led the fated lad home between them singularly drawn together by their joint ministrations to him in which her delicacy had to stand fire and sweet goodnature made naught of any trial they were hand in hand with the little fellow as physician and professional nurse chapter xiii the first effort after freedom crossjays accident was only another proof as vernon told miss dale that the boy was but half monkey something fresh she exclaimed on seeing him brought into the hall where she had just arrived simply a continuation said vernon he is not so prehensile as he should be he probably in extremity relies on the tail that has been docked are you a man crossjay i should think i was crossjay replied with an old mans voice and a ghastly twitch for a smile overwhelmed the compassionate ladies miss dale took possession of him you err in the other direction she remarked to vernon but a little bracing roughness is better than spoiling him said miss middleton she did not receive an answer and she thought whatever willoughby does is right to this lady claras impression was renewed when sir willoughby sat beside miss dale in the evening and certainly she had never seen him shine so picturesquely as in his bearing with miss dale the sprightly sallies of the two their rallyings their laughter and her fine eyes and his handsome gestures won attention like a fencing match of a couple keen with the foils to display the mutual skill and it was his design that she should admire the display he was anything but obtuse enjoying the match as he did and necessarily did to act so excellent a part in it he meant the observer to see the man he was with a lady not of raw understanding so it went on from day to day for three days she fancied once that she detected the agreeable stirring of the brood of jealousy and found it neither in her heart nor in her mind but in the book of wishes well known to the young where they write matter which may sometimes be independent of both those volcanic albums jealousy would have been a relief to her a dear devils aid she studied the complexion of jealousy to delude herself with the sense of the spirit being in her and all the while she laughed as at a vile theatre whereof the imperfection of the stage machinery rather than the performance is the wretched source of amusement vernon had deeply depressed her she was hunted by the figure four happy instead of two miserable he had said it involving her among the four and so it must be she considered and she must be as happy as she could for not only was he incapable of perceiving her state he was unable to imagine other circumstances to surround her how to be just to him were they imaginable by him or any one her horrible isolation of secrecy in a world amiable in unsuspectingness frightened her to fling away her secret to conform to be unrebellious uncritical submissive became an impatient desire and the task did not appear so difficult since miss dales arrival endearments had been rare more formal living bodily untroubled and unashamed and as she phrased it having no one to care for her she turned insensibly in the direction where she was due she slightly imitated miss dales colloquial responsiveness to tell truth she felt vivacious in a moderate way with willoughby after seeing him with miss dale liberty wore the aspect of a towering prisonwall the desperate undertaking of climbing one side and dropping to the other was more than she unaided could resolve on consequently as no one cared for her a worthless creature might as well cease dreaming and stipulating for the fulfilment of her dreams she might as well yield to her fate nay make the best of it sir willoughby was flattered and satisfied claras adopted vivacity proved his thorough knowledge of feminine nature nor did her feebleness in sustaining it displease him a steady look of hers had of late perplexed the man and he was comforted by signs of her inefficiency where he excelled the effort and the failure were both of good omen but she could not continue the effort he had overweighted her too much for the mimicry of a sentiment to harden and have an apparently natural place among her impulses and now an idea came to her that he might it might be hoped possibly see in miss dale by present contrast the mate he sought by contrast with an unanswering creature like herself he might perhaps realize in miss dales greater accomplishments and her devotion to him the merit of suitability he might be induced to do her justice dim as the loophole was clara fixed her mind on it till it gathered light and as a prelude to action she plunged herself into a state of such profound humility that to accuse it of being simulated would be venturesome though it was not positive the tempers of the young are liquid fires in isles of quicksand the precious metals not yet cooled in a solid earth her compassion for laetitia was less forced but really she was almost as earnest in her selfabasement for she had not latterly been brilliant not even adequate to the ordinary requirements of conversation she had no courage no wit no diligence nothing that she could distinguish save discontentment like a corroding acid and she went so far in sincerity as with a curious shift of feeling to pity the man plighted to her if it suited her purpose to pity sir willoughby she was not moved by policy be assured her needs were her nature her moods her mind she had the capacity to make anything serve her by passing into it with the glance which discerned its usefulness and this is how it is that the young when they are in trouble without approaching the elevation of scientific hypocrites can teach that able class lessons in hypocrisy why should not willoughby be happy she said and the exclamation was pushed forth by the second thought then i shall be free still that thought came second the desire for the happiness of willoughby was fervent on his behalf and wafted her far from friends and letters to a narrow tyrolean valley where a shallow river ran with the indentations of a remotely seen army of winding ranks in column topaz over the pebbles to hollows of ravishing emerald there sat liberty after her fearful leap over the prisonwall at peace to watch the water and the falls of sunshine on the mountain above between descending pinestem shadows claras wish for his happiness as soon as she had housed herself in the imagination of her freedom was of a purity that made it seem exceedingly easy for her to speak to him the opportunity was offered by sir willoughby every morning after breakfast miss dale walked across the park to see her father and on this occasion sir willoughby and miss middleton went with her as far as the lake all three discoursing of the beauty of various trees birches aspens poplars beeches then in their new green miss dale loved the aspen miss middleton the beech sir willoughby the birch and pretty things were said by each in praise of the favoured object particularly by miss dale so much so that when she had gone on he recalled one of her remarks and said i believe if the whole place were swept away tomorrow laetitia dale could reconstruct it and put those aspens on the north of the lake in number and situation correctly where you have them now i would guarantee her description of it in absence correct why should she be absent said clara palpitating well why returned sir willoughby as you say there is no reason why the art of life and mine will be principally a country lifetown is not life but a tornado whirling atomsthe art is to associate a group of sympathetic friends in our neighbourhood and it is a fact worth noting that if ever i feel tired of the place a short talk with laetitia dale refreshes it more than a month or two on the continent she has the well of enthusiasm and there is a great advantage in having a cultivated person at command with whom one can chat of any topic under the sun i repeat you have no need of town if you have friends like laetitia dale within call my mother esteemed her highly willoughby she is not obliged to go i hope not and my love i rejoice that you have taken to her her fathers health is poor she would be a young spinster to live alone in a country cottage what of your scheme old vernon is a very foolish fellow he has declined not a word on the subject i have only to propose it to be snubbed i know you may not be aware how you throw him into the shade with her nothing seems to teach him the art of dialogue with ladies are not gentlemen shy when they see themselves outshone he hasnt it my love vernon is deficient in the ladys tongue i respect him for that outshone you say i do not know of any shiningsave to one who lights me path and person the identity of the one was conveyed to her in a bow and a soft pressure not only has he not the ladys tongue which i hold to be a mans proper accomplishment continued sir willoughby he cannot turn his advantages to account here has miss dale been with him now four days in the house they are exactly on the same footing as when she entered it you ask i will tell you it is this it is want of warmth old vernon is a scholarand a fish well perhaps he has cause to be shy of matrimony but he is a fish you are reconciled to his leaving you false alarm the resolution to do anything unaccustomed is quite beyond old vernon but if mr oxfordwhitford your swans coming sailing up the lake how beautiful they look when they are indignant i was going to ask you surely men witnessing a marked admiration for some one else will naturally be discouraged sir willoughby stiffened with sudden enlightenment though the word jealousy had not been spoken the drift of her observations was clear smiling inwardly he said and the sentences were not enigmas to her surely too young ladies a littletoo far but an old friendship about the same as the fitting of an old glove to a hand hand and glove have only to meet where there is natural harmony you would not have discord ay but you have it if you check the harmony my dear girl you child he had actually in this parabolic and commendable obscureness for which she thanked him in her soul struck the very point she had not named and did not wish to hear named but wished him to strike he was anything but obtuse his exultation of the compressed sort was extreme on hearing her cry out young ladies may be oh not i not i i can convince you not that believe me willoughby i do not know what it is to feel that or anything like it i cannot conceive a claim on any ones lifeas a claim or the continuation of an engagement not founded on perfect perfect sympathy how should i feel it then it is as you say of mr oxwhitford beyond me sir willoughby caught up the oxwhitford bursting with laughter in his joyful pride he called it a portrait of old vernon in society for she thought a trifle too highly of vernon as here and there a raw young lady does think of the friends of her plighted man which is waste of substance properly belonging to him as it were in the loftier sense an expenditure in genuflexions to wayside idols of the reverence she should bring intact to the temple derision instructs her of the other subjecther jealousyhe had no desire to hear more she had winced the woman had been touched to smarting in the girl enough she attempted the subject once but faintly and his careless parrying threw her out clara could have bitten her tongue for that reiterated stupid slip on the name of whitford and because she was innocent at heart she persisted in asking herself how she could be guilty of it you both know the botanic titles of these wild flowers she said who he inquired you and miss dale sir willoughby shrugged he was amused no woman on earth will grace a barouche so exquisitely as my clara where said she during our annual two months in london i drive a barouche there and venture to prophesy that my equipage will create the greatest excitement of any in london i see old horace de craye gazing she sighed she could not drag him to the word or a hint of it necessary to her subject but there it was she saw it she had nearly let it go and blushed at being obliged to name it jealousy do you mean willoughby the people in london would be jealouscolonel de craye how strange that is a sentiment i cannot understand sir willoughby gesticulated the of course not of an established assurance to the contrary indeed willoughby i do not certainly not he was now in her trap and he was imagining himself to be anatomizing her feminine nature can i give you a proof willoughby i am so utterly incapable of it thatlisten to mewere you to come to me to tell me as you might how much better suited to you miss dale has appeared than i amand i fear i am not it should be spoken plainly unsuited altogether perhapsi would i beseech you to believeyou must believe megive you give you your freedom instantly most truly and engage to speak of you as i should think of you willoughby you would have no one to praise you in public and in private as i should for you would be to me the most honest truthful chivalrous gentleman alive and in that case i would undertake to declare that she would not admire you more than i miss dale would not she would not admire you more than i not even miss dale this her first direct leap for liberty set clara panting and so much had she to say that the nervous and the intellectual halves of her dashed like cymbals dazing and stunning her with the appositeness of things to be said and dividing her in indecision as to the cunningest to move him of the many pressing the condition of feminine jealousy stood revealed he had driven her farther than he intended come let me allay these he soothed her with hand and voice while seeking for his phrase these magnified pinpoints now my clara on my honour and when i put it forward in attestation my honour has the most serious meaning speech can have ordinarily my word has to suffice for bonds promises or asseverations on my honour not merely is there my poor child no ground of suspicion i assure you i declare to you the fact of the case is the very reverse now mark me of her sentiments i cannot pretend to speak i did not to my knowledge originate i am not responsible for them and i am before the law as we will say ignorant of them that is i have never heard a declaration of them and i am therefore under pain of the stigma of excessive fatuity bound to be noncognizant but as to myself i can speak for myself and on my honour clarato be as direct as possible even to baldness and you know i loathe iti could not i repeat i could not marry laetitia dale let me impress it on you no flatterieswe are all susceptible more or lessno conceivable condition could bring it about no amount of admiration she and i are excellent friends we cannot be more when you see us together the natural concord of our minds is of course misleading she is a woman of genius i do not conceal i profess my admiration of her there are times when i confess i require a laetitia dale to bring me out give and take i am indebted to her for the enjoyment of the duet few know few can accord with fewer still are allowed the privilege of playing with a human being i am indebted i own and i feel deep gratitude i own to a lively friendship for miss dale but if she is displeasing in the sight of my bride by by the breadth of an eyelash then sir willoughbys arm waved miss dale off away into outer darkness in the wilderness clara shut her eyes and rolled her eyeballs in a frenzy of unuttered revolt from the egoist but she was not engaged in the colloquy to be an advocate of miss dale or of common humanity ah she said simply determining that the subject should not drop and ah he mocked her tenderly true though and who knows better than my clara that i require youth health beauty and the other undefinable attributes fitting with mine and beseeming the station of the lady called to preside over my household and represent me what says my other self my fairer but you are my love you are understand my nature rightly and you i do i do interposed clara if i did not by this time i should be idiotic let me assure you i understand it oh listen to me one moment miss dale regards me as the happiest woman on earth willoughby if i possessed her good qualities her heart and mind no doubt i should be it is my wishyou must hear me hear me outmy wish my earnest wish my burning prayer my wish to make way for her she appreciates you i do notto my shame i do not she worships you i do not i cannot you are the rising sun to her it has been so for years no one can account for love i daresay not for the impossibility of loving loving where we should all love bewilders me i was not created to understand it but she loves you she has pined i believe it has destroyed the health you demand as one item in your list but you willoughby can restore that travelling and and your society the pleasure of your society would certainly restore it you look so handsome together she has unbounded devotion as for me i cannot idolize i see faults i see them daily they astonish and wound me your pride would not bear to hear them spoken of least of all by your wife you warned me to bewarethat is you said you said something her busy brain missed the subterfuge to cover her slip of the tongue sir willoughby struck in and when i say that the entire concatenation is based on an erroneous observation of facts and an erroneous deduction from that erroneous observation no no have confidence in me i propose it to you in this instance purely to save you from deception you are cold my love you shivered i am not cold said clara some one i suppose was walking over my grave the gulf of a caress hove in view like an enormous billow hollowing under the curled ridge she stooped to a buttercup the monster swept by your grave he exclaimed over her head my own girl is not the orchid naturally a stranger in ground so far away from the chalk willoughby i am incompetent to pronounce an opinion on such important matters my mother had a passion for every description of flower i fancy i have some recollection of her scattering the flower you mention over the park if she were living now we should be happy in the blessing of the most estimable of women my clara she would have listened to me she would have realized what i mean indeed clarapoor soul he murmured to himself aloud indeed you are absolutely in error if i have seemedbut i repeat you are deceived the idea of fitness is a total hallucination supposing youi do it even in play painfullyentirely out of the way unthought of extinct clara said low nonexistent for me he selected a preferable term suppose it i should still in spite of an admiration i have never thought it incumbent on me to conceal still bei speak emphaticallyutterly incapable of the offer of my hand to miss dale it may be that she is embedded in my mind as a friend and nothing but a friend i received the stamp in early youth people have noticed itwe do it seems bring one another out reflecting counterreflecting she glanced up at him with a shrewd satisfaction to see that her wicked shaft had stuck you do it is a common remark she said the instantaneous difference when she comes near any one might notice my love he opened the iron gate into the garden you encourage the naughty little suspicion but it is a beautiful sight willoughby i like to see you together i like it as i like to see colours match very well there is no harm then we shall often be together i like my fair friend but the instantyou have only to express a sentiment of disapprobation and you dismiss her i dismiss her that is as to the word i constitute myself your echo to clear any vestige of suspicion she goes that is a case of a person doomed to extinction without offending not without for whoever offends my bride my wife my sovereign lady offends me very deeply offends me then the caprices of your wife clara stamped her foot imperceptibly on the lawnsward which was irresponsively soft to her fretfulness she broke from the inconsequent meaningless mild tone of irony and said willoughby women have their honour to swear by equally with mengirls have they have to swear an oath at the altar may i to you now take it for uttered when i tell you that nothing would make me happier than your union with miss dale i have spoken as much as i can tell me you release me with the wellknown screwsmile of duty upholding weariness worn to inanition he rejoined allow me once more to reiterate that it is repulsive inconceivable that i should ever under any mortal conditions bring myself to the point of taking miss dale for my wife you reduce me to this perfectly childish protestationpitiably childish but my love have i to remind you that you and i are plighted and that i am an honourable man i know it i feel itrelease me cried clara sir willoughby severely reprehended his shortsightedness for seeing but the one proximate object in the particular attention he had bestowed on miss dale he could not disavow that they had been marked and with an object and he was distressed by the unwonted want of wisdom through which he had been drawn to overshoot his object his design to excite a touch of the insane emotion in claras bosom was too successful and i was not thinking of her he said to himself in his candour contrite she cried again will you not willoughbyrelease me he begged her to take his arm to consent to touch him while petitioning for a detachment appeared discordant to clara but if she expected him to accede it was right that she should do as much as she could and she surrendered her hand at arms length disdaining the imprisoned fingers he pressed them and said dr middleton is in the library i see vernon is at work with crossjay in the westroomthe boy has had sufficient for the day now is it not like old vernon to drive his books at a cracked head before its half mended he signalled to young crossjay who was up and out through the folding windows in a twinkling and you will go in and talk to vernon of the lady in question sir willoughby whispered to clara use your best persuasions in our joint names you have my warrant for saying that money is no consideration house and income are assured you can hardly have taken me seriously when i requested you to undertake vernon before i was quite in earnest then as now i prepare miss dale i will not have a wedding on our weddingday but either before or after it i gladly speed their alliance i think now i give you the best proof possible and though i know that with women a delusion may be seen to be groundless and still be cherished i rely on your good sense vernon was at the window and stood aside for her to enter sir willoughby used a gentle insistence with her she bent her head as if she were stepping into a cave so frigid was she that a ridiculous dread of calling mr whitford mr oxford was her only present anxiety when sir willoughby had closed the window on them chapter xiv sir willoughby and laetitia i prepare miss dale sir willoughby thought of his promise to clara he trifled awhile with young crossjay and then sent the boy flying and wrapped himself in meditation so shall you see standing many a statue of statesmen who have died in harness for their country in the hundred and fourth chapter of the thirteenth volume of the book of egoism it is written possession without obligation to the object possessed approaches felicity it is the rarest condition of ownership for example the possession of land is not without obligation both to the soil and the taxcollector the possession of fine clothing is oppressed by obligation gold jewelry works of art enviable household furniture are positive fetters the possession of a wife we find surcharged with obligation in all these cases possession is a gentle term for enslavement bestowing the sort of felicity attained to by the helot drunk you can have the joy the pride the intoxication of possession you can have no free soul but there is one instance of possession and that the most perfect which leaves us free under not a shadow of obligation receiving ever never giving or if giving giving only of our waste as it were sauf votre respect by form of perspiration radiation if you like unconscious poral bountifulness and it is a beneficent process for the system our possession of an adoring females worship is this instance the soft cherishable parsee is hardly at any season other than prostrate she craves nothing save that you continue in beingher sun which is your firm constitutional endeavour and thus you have a most exact alliance she supplying spirit to your matter while at the same time presenting matter to your spirit verily a comfortable apposition the gods do bless it that they do so indeed is evident in the men they select for such a felicitous crown and aureole weak men would be rendered nervous by the flattery of a womans worship or they would be for returning it at least partially as though it could be bandied to and fro without emulgence of the poetry or they would be pitiful and quite spoil the thing some would be for transforming the beautiful solitary vestal flame by the first effort of the multiplicationtable into your hearthfire of slippered affection so these men are not they whom the gods have ever selected but rather men of a pattern with themselves very high and very solid men who maintain the crown by holding divinely independent of the great emotion they have sown even for them a pass of danger is ahead as we shall see in our sample of one among the highest of them a clear approach to felicity had long been the portion of sir willoughby patterne in his relations with laetitia dale she belonged to him he was quite unshackled by her she was everything that is good in a parasite nothing that is bad his dedicated critic she was reviewing him with a favour equal to perfect efficiency in her office and whatever the world might say of him to her the happy gentleman could constantly turn for his refreshing balsamic bath she flew to the soul in him pleasingly arousing sensations of that inhabitant and he allowed her the right to fly in the manner of kings as we have heard consenting to the privileges acted on by cats these may not address their majesties but they may stare nor will it be contested that the attentive circular eyes of the humble domestic creatures are an embellishment to royal pomp and grandeur such truly as should one day gain for them an inweaving and figurementin the place of bees ermine tufts and their various present decorationsupon the august great robes backflowing and foaming over the gaspy pageboys further to quote from the same volume of the book there is pain in the surrendering of that we are fain to relinquish the idea is too exquisitely attenuate as are those of the whole bodyguard of the heart of egoism and will slip through you unless you shall have made a study of the gross of volumes of the first and second sections of the book and that will take you up to senility or you must make a personal entry into the pages perchance or an escape out of them there was once a venerable gentleman for whom a white hair grew on the cop of his nose laughing at removals he resigned himself to it in the end and lastingly contemplated the apparition it does not concern us what effect was produced on his countenance and his mind enough that he saw a fine thing but not so fine as the idea cited above which has been between the two eyes of humanity ever since women were sought in marriage with yonder old gentleman it may have been a ghostly hair or a disease of the optic nerves but for us it is a real growth and humanity might profitably imitate him in his patient speculation upon it sir willoughby patterne though ready in the pursuit of duty and policy an oftunited couple to cast miss dale away had to consider that he was not simply so to speak casting her over a hedge he was casting her for a man to catch her and this was a much greater trial than it had been on the previous occasion when she went over bump to the ground in the arms of a husband there was no knowing how soon she might forget her souls fidelity it had not hurt him to sketch the project of the conjunction benevolence assisted him but he winced and smarted on seeing it take shape it sullied his idea of laetitia still if in spite of so great a change in her fortune her spirit could be guaranteed changeless he for the sake of pacifying his bride and to keep two serviceable persons near him at command might resolve to join them the vision of his resolution brought with it a certain pallid contempt of the physically faithless woman no wonder he betook himself to the book and opened it on the scorching chapters treating of the sex and the execrable wiles of that foremost creature of the chase who runs for life she is not spared in the biggest of books but close it the writing in it having been done chiefly by men men naturally receive their fortification from its wisdom and half a dozen of the popular sentences for the confusion of women cut in brass worn to a polish like sombre gold refreshed sir willoughby for his undertaking an examination of laetitias faded complexion braced him very cordially his clara jealous of this poor leaf he could have desired the transfusion of a quality or two from laetitia to his bride but you cannot as in cookery obtain a mixture of the essences of these creatures and if as it is possible to do and as he had been doing recently with the pair of them at the hall you stew them in one pot you are far likelier to intensify their little birthmarks of individuality had they a tendency to excellence it might be otherwise they might then make the exchanges we wish for or scientifically concocted in a harem for a sufficient length of time by a sultan anything but obtuse they might it is however fruitless to dwell on what was only a glimpse of a wild regret like the crossing of two express trains along the rails in sir willoughbys head the ladies eleanor and isabel were sitting with miss dale all three at work on embroideries he had merely to look at miss eleanor she rose she looked at miss isabel and rattled her chatelaine to account for her departure after a decent interval miss isabel glided out such was the perfect discipline of the household sir willoughby played an air on the knee of his crossed leg laetitia grew conscious of a meaning in the silence she said you have not been vexed by affairs today affairs he replied must be peculiarly vexatious to trouble me concerning the country or my personal affairs i fancy i was alluding to the country i trust i am as good a patriot as any man living said he but i am used to the follies of my countrymen and we are on board a stout ship at the worst its no worse than a rise in rates and taxes soup at the hall gates perhaps license to fell timber in one of the outer copses or some dozen loads of coal you hit my feudalism the knight in armour has gone said laetitia and the castle with the drawbridge immunity for our island has gone too since we took to commerce we bartered independence for commerce you hit our old controversy ay but we do not want this overgrown population however we will put politics and sociology and the pack of their modern barbarous words aside you read me intuitively i have been i will not say annoyed but ruffled i have much to do and going into parliament would make me almost helpless if i lose vernon you know of some absurd notion he hasliterary fame and bachelors chambers and a chophouse and the rest of it she knew and thinking differently in the matter of literary fame she flushed and ashamed of the flush frowned he bent over to her with the perusing earnestness of a gentleman about to trifle you cannot intend that frown did i frown you do now fiercely oh will you smile to reassure me willingly as well as i can a gloom overcame him with no woman on earth did he shine so as to recall to himself seigneur and dame of the old french court as he did with laetitia dale he did not wish the period revived but reserved it as a garden to stray into when he was in the mood for displaying elegance and brightness in the society of a lady and in speech laetitia helped him to the nice delusion she was not devoid of grace of bearing either would she preserve her beautiful responsiveness to his ascendency hitherto she had and for years and quite fresh but how of her as a married woman our souls are hideously subject to the conditions of our animal nature a wife possibly mother it was within sober calculation that there would be great changes in her and the hint of any change appeared a total change to one of the lofty order who when they are called on to relinquish possession instead of aspiring to it say all or nothing well but if there was danger of the marriagetie effecting the slightest alteration of her character or habit of mind wherefore press it upon a tolerably hardened spinster besides though he did once put her hand in vernons for the dance he remembered acutely that the injury then done by his generosity to his tender sensitiveness had sickened and tarnished the effulgence of two or three successive anniversaries of his coming of age nor had he altogether yet got over the passion of greed for the whole group of the wellfavoured of the fair sex which in his early youth had made it bitter for him to submit to the fickleness not to say the modest fickleness of any handsome one of them in yielding her hand to a man and suffering herself to be led away ladies whom he had only heard of as ladies of some beauty incurred his wrath for having lovers or taking husbands he was of a vast embrace and do not exclaim in covetousnessfor well he knew that even under moslem law he could not have them allbut as the enamoured custodian of the sexs purity that blushes at such big spots as lovers and husbands and it was unbearable to see it sacrificed for others without their purity what are theywhat are fruiterers plumsunsaleable o for the bloom on them as i said i lose my right hand in vernon he resumed and i am it seems inevitably to lose him unless we contrive to fasten him down here i think my dear miss dale you have my character at least i should recommend my future biographer to youwith a caution of course you would have to write selfishness with a dash under it i cannot endure to lose a member of my householdnot under any circumstances and a change of feeling toward me on the part of any of my friends because of marriage i think hard i would ask you how can it be for vernons good to quit an easy pleasant home for the wretched profession of literaturewretchedly paying i mean he bowed to the authoress let him leave the house if he imagines he will not harmonize with its young mistress he is queer though a good fellow but he ought in that event to have an establishment and my scheme for vernonmen miss dale do not change to their old friends when they marrymy scheme which would cause the alteration in his system of life to be barely perceptible is to build him a poetical little cottage large enough for a couple on the borders of my park i have the spot in my eye the point is can he live alone there men i say do not change how is it that we cannot say the same of women laetitia remarked the generic woman appears to have an extraordinary faculty for swallowing the individual as to the individual as to a particular person i may be wrong precisely because it is her case i think of my strong friendship inspires the fear unworthy of both no doubt but trace it to the source even pure friendship such is the taint in us knows a kind of jealousy though i would gladly see her established and near me happy and contributing to my happiness with her incomparable social charm her i do not estimate generically be sure if you do me the honour to allude to me sir willoughby said laetitia i am my fathers housemate what wooer would take that for a refusal he would beg to be a third in the house and sharer of your affectionate burden honestly why not and i may be arguing against my own happiness it may be the end of me the end old friends are captious exacting no not the end yet if my friend is not the same to me it is the end to that form of friendship not to the degree possibly but when one is used to the form and do you in its application to friendship scorn the word use we are creatures of custom i am i confess a poltroon in my affections i dread changes the shadow of the tenth of an inch in the customary elevation of an eyelidto give you an idea of my susceptibility and my dear miss dale i throw myself on your charity with all my weakness bare let me add as i could do to none but you consider then if i lose you the fear is due to my pusillanimity entirely highsouled women may be wives mothers and still reserve that home for their friend they can and will conquer the viler conditions of human life our states i have always contended our various phases have to be passed through and there is no disgrace in it so long as they do not levy toll on the quintessential the spiritual element you understand me i am no adept in these abstract elucidations you explain yourself clearly said laetitia i have never pretended that psychology was my forte said he feeling overshadowed by her cold commendation he was not less acutely sensitive to the fractional divisions of tones than of eyelids being as it were a melody with which everything was out of tune that did not modestly or mutely accord and to bear about a melody in your person is incomparably more searching than the best of touchstones and talismans ever invented your fathers health has improved latterly he did not complain of his health when i saw him this morning my cousin amelia is with him and she is an excellent nurse he has a liking for vernon he has a great respect for mr whitford you have oh yes i have it equally for a foundation that is the surest i would have the friends dearest to me begin on that the headlong match ishow can we describe it by its finale i am afraid vernons abilities are really to be respected his shyness is his malady i suppose he reflected that he was not a capitalist he might one would think have addressed himself to me my purse is not locked no sir willoughby laetitia said warmly for his donations in charity were famous her eyes gave him the food he enjoyed and basking in them he continued vernons income would at once have been regulated commensurately with a new position requiring an increase this money money money but the world will have it so happily i have inherited habits of business and personal economy vernon is a man who would do fifty times more with a companion appreciating his abilities and making light of his little deficiencies they are palpable small enough he has always been aware of my wisheswhen perhaps the fulfilment might have sent me off on another tour of the world homebird though i am when was it that our friendship commenced in my boyhood i know very many years back i am in my thirtieth year said laetitia surprised and pained by a baldness resembling the deeds of ladies they have been known either through absence of mind or mania to displace a wig in the deadly intimacy which slaughters poetic admiration sir willoughby punished her by deliberately reckoning that she did not look less genius he observed is unacquainted with wrinkles hardly one of his prettiest speeches but he had been wounded and he never could recover immediately coming on him in a mood of sentiment the wound was sharp he could very well have calculated the ladys age it was the jarring clash of her brazen declaration of it upon his low rich flutenotes that shocked him he glanced at the gold cathedralclock on the mantelpiece and proposed a stroll on the lawn before dinner laetitia gathered up her embroidery work as a rule he said authoresses are not needlewomen i shall resign the needle or the pen if it stamps me an exception she replied he attempted a compliment on her truly exceptional character as when the players finger rests in distraction on the organ it was without measure and disgusted his own hearing nevertheless she had been so good as to diminish his apprehension that the marriage of a lady in her thirtieth year with his cousin vernon would be so much of a loss to him hence while parading the lawn now and then casting an eye at the window of the room where his clara and vernon were in council the schemes he indulged for his prospective comfort and his feelings of the moment were in such striving harmony as that to which we hear orchestral musicians bringing their instruments under the process called tuning it is not perfect but it promises to be so soon we are not angels which have their dulcimers ever on the choral pitch we are mortals attaining the celestial accord with effort through a stage of pain some degree of pain was necessary to sir willoughby otherwise he would not have seen his generosity confronting him he grew therefore tenderly inclined to laetitia once more so far as to say within himself for conversation she would be a valuable wife and this valuable wife he was presenting to his cousin apparently considering the duration of the conference of his clara and vernon his cousin required strong persuasion to accept the present chapter xv the petition for a release neither clara nor vernon appeared at the midday table dr middleton talked with miss dale on classical matters like a goodnatured giant giving a child the jump from stone to stone across a brawling mountain ford so that an unedified audience might really suppose upon seeing her over the difficulty she had done something for herself sir willoughby was proud of her and therefore anxious to settle her business while he was in the humour to lose her he hoped to finish it by shooting a word or two at vernon before dinner claras petition to be set free released from him had vaguely frightened even more than it offended his pride miss isabel quitted the room she came back saying they decline to lunch then we may rise remarked sir willoughby she was weeping miss isabel murmured to him girlish enough he said the two elderly ladies went away together miss dale pursuing her theme with the rev doctor was invited by him to a course in the library sir willoughby walked up and down the lawn taking a glance at the westroom as he swung round on the turn of his leg growing impatient he looked in at the window and found the room vacant nothing was to be seen of clara and vernon during the afternoon near the dinnerhour the ladies were informed by miss middletons maid that her mistress was lying down on her bed too unwell with headache to be present young crossjay brought a message from vernon delayed by birds eggs in the delivery to say that he was off over the hills and thought of dining with dr corney sir willoughby despatched condolences to his bride he was not well able to employ his mind on its customary topic being like the dome of a bell a man of so pervading a ring within himself concerning himself that the recollection of a doubtful speech or unpleasant circumstance touching him closely deranged his inward peace and as dubious and unpleasant things will often occur he had great need of a worshipper and was often compelled to appeal to her for signs of antidotal idolatry in this instance when the need of a worshipper was sharply felt he obtained no signs at all the rev doctor had fascinated miss dale so that both within and without sir willoughby was uncomforted his themes in public were those of an english gentleman horses dogs game sport intrigue scandal politics wines the manly themes with a condescension to ladies tattle and approbation of a racy anecdote what interest could he possibly take in the athenian theatre and the girl whose fluteplaying behind the scenes imitating the nightingale enraptured a greek audience he would have suspected a motive in miss dales eager attentiveness if the motive could have been conceived besides the ancients were not decorous they did not as we make our moderns do write for ladies he ventured at the dinnertable to interrupt dr middleton once miss dale will do wisely i think sir by confining herself to your present edition of the classics that replied dr middleton is the observation of a student of the dictionary of classical mythology in the english tongue the theatre is a matter of climate sir you will grant me that if quick wits come of climate it is as you say sir with us it seems a matter of painful fostering or the need of it said miss dale with a question to dr middleton excluding sir willoughby as though he had been a temporary disturbance of the flow of their dialogue the ladies eleanor and isabel previously excellent listeners to the learned talk saw the necessity of coming to his rescue but you cannot converse with your aunts inmates of your house on general subjects at table the attempt increased his discomposure he considered that he had illchosen his fatherinlaw that scholars are an impolite race that young or youngish women are devotees of power in any form and will be absorbed by a scholar for a variation of a man concluding that he must have a round of dinnerparties to friends especially ladies appreciating him during the doctors visit claras headache above and dr middletons unmannerliness below affected his instincts in a way to make him apprehend that a stroke of misfortune was impending thunder was in the air still he learned something by which he was to profit subsequently the topic of wine withdrew the doctor from his classics it was magical on him a strong fraternity of taste was discovered in the sentiments of host and guest upon particular wines and vintages they kindled one another by naming great years of the grape and if sir willoughby had to sacrifice the ladies to the topic he much regretted a condition of things that compelled him to sin against his habit for the sake of being in the conversation and probing an elderly gentlemans foible late at night he heard the housebell and meeting vernon in the hall invited him to enter the laboratory and tell him dr corneys last vernon was brief corney had not let fly a single anecdote he said and lighted his candle by the way vernon you had a talk with miss middleton she will speak to you tomorrow at twelve tomorrow at twelve it gives her fourandtwenty hours sir willoughby determined that his perplexity should be seen but vernon said goodnight to him and was shooting up the stairs before the dramatic exhibition of surprise had yielded to speech thunder was in the air and a blow coming sir willoughbys instincts were awake to the many signs nor though silenced were they hushed by his harping on the frantic excesses to which women are driven by the passion of jealousy he believed in claras jealousy because he really had intended to rouse it under the form of emulation feebly he could not suppose she had spoken of it to vernon and as for the seriousness of her desire to be released from her engagement that was little credible still the fixing of an hour for her to speak to him after an interval of fourandtwenty hours left an opening for the incredible to add its weight to the suspicious mass and who would have fancied clara middleton so wild a victim of the intemperate passion he muttered to himself several assuaging observations to excuse a young lady half demented and rejected them in a lump for their nonsensical inapplicability to clara in order to obtain some sleep he consented to blame himself slightly in the style of the enamoured historian of erring beauties alluding to their peccadilloes he had done it to edify her sleep however failed him that an inordinate jealousy argued an overpowering love solved his problem until he tried to fit the proposition to claras character he had discerned nothing southern in her latterly with the blushing day in prospect she had contracted and frozen there was no reading either of her or of the mystery in the morning at the breakfasttable a confession of sleeplessness was general excepting miss dale and dr middleton none had slept a wink i sir the doctor replied to sir willoughby slept like a lexicon in your library when mr whitford and i are out of it vernon incidentally mentioned that he had been writing through the night you fellows kill yourselves sir willoughby reproved him for my part i make it a principle to get through my work without selfslaughter clara watched her father for a symptom of ridicule he gazed mildly on the systematic worker she was unable to guess whether she would have in him an ally or a judge the latter she feared now that she had embraced the strife she saw the division of the line where she stood from that one where the world places girls who are affianced wives her father could hardly be with her it had gone too far he loved her but he would certainly take her to be moved by a maddish whim he would not try to understand her case the scholars detestation of a disarrangement of human affairs that had been by miracle contrived to run smoothly would of itself rank him against her and with the world to back his view of her he might behave like a despotic father how could she defend herself before him at one thought of sir willoughby her tongue made ready and feminine craft was alert to prompt it but to her father she could imagine herself opposing only dumbness and obstinacy it is not exactly the same kind of work she said dr middleton rewarded her with a bushy eyebrows beam of his revolting humour at the baronets notion of work so little was needed to quicken her that she sunned herself in the beam coaxing her fathers eyes to stay with hers as long as she could and beginning to hope he might be won to her side if she confessed she had been more in the wrong than she felt owned to him that is her error in not earlier disturbing his peace i do not say it is the same observed sir willoughby bowing to their alliance of opinion my poor work is for the day and vernons no doubt for the day to come i contend nevertheless for the preservation of health as the chief implement of work of continued work there i agree with you said dr middleton cordially claras heart sunk so little was needed to deaden her accuse her of an overweening antagonism to her betrothed yet remember that though the words had not been uttered to give her good reason for it nature reads nature captives may be stript of everything save that power to read their tyrant remember also that she was not as she well knew blameless her rage at him was partly against herself the rising from table left her to sir willoughby she swam away after miss dale exclaiming the laboratory will you have me for a companion on your walk to see your father one breathes earth and heaven today out of doors isnt it summer with a spring breeze i will wander about your garden and not hurry your visit i promise i shall be very happy indeed but i am going immediately said laetitia seeing sir willoughby hovering to snap up his bride yes and a gardenhat and i am on the march i will wait for you on the terrace you will not have to wait five minutes at the most sir willoughby said to laetitia and she passed out leaving them alone together well and my love he addressed his bride almost huggingly and what is the story and how did you succeed with old vernon yesterday he will and he wont hes a very woman in these affairs i cant forgive him for giving you a headache you were found weeping yes i cried said clara and now tell me about it you know my dear girl whether he does or doesnt our keeping him somewhere in the neighbourhoodperhaps not in the housethat is the material point it can hardly be necessary in these days to urge marriages on im sure the country is over most marriages ought to be celebrated with the funeral knell i think so said clara it will come to this that marriages of consequence and none but those will be hailed with joyful peals do not say such things in public willoughby only to you to you dont think me likely to expose myself to the world well and i sounded miss dale and there will be no violent obstacle and now about vernon i will speak to you willoughby when i return from my walk with miss dale soon after twelve twelve said he i name an hour it seems childish i can explain it but it is named i cannot deny because i am a rather childish person perhaps and have it prescribed to me to delay my speaking for a certain length of time i may tell you at once that mr whitford is not to be persuaded by me and the breaking of our engagement would not induce him to remain vernon used those words it was i the breaking of our engagement come into the laboratory my love i shall not have time time shall stop rather than interfere with our conversation the breaking but its a sort of sacrilege to speak of it that i feel yet it has to be spoken of sometimes why i cant conceive the occasion you know to me clara plighted faith the affiancing of two lovers is a piece of religion i rank it as holy as marriage nay to me it is holier i really cannot tell you how i can only appeal to you in your bosom to understand me we read of divorces with comparative indifference they occur between couples who have rubbed off all romance she could have asked him in her fit of ironic iciness on hearing him thus blindly challenge her to speak out whether the romance might be his piece of religion he propitiated the more unwarlike sentiments in her by ejaculating poor souls let them go their several ways married people no longer lovers are in the category of the unnameable but the hint of the breaking of an engagementour engagementbetween us oh oh clara came out with a swans note swelling over mechanical imitation of him to dolorousness illimitable oh she breathed short let it be now do not speak till you have heard me my head may not be clear byandby and two scenestwice will be beyond my endurance i am penitent for the wrong i have done you i grieve for you all the blame is mine willoughby you must release me do not let me hear a word of that word jealousy is unknown to me happy if i could call you friend and see you with a worthier than i who might byandby call me friend you have my plighted troth given in ignorance of my feelings reprobate a weak and foolish girls ignorance i have thought of it and i cannot see wickedness though the blame is great shameful you have none you are without any blame you will not suffer as i do you will be generous to me i have no respect for myself when i beg you to be generous and release me but was this the willoughby preserved his calmness this then the subject of your interview with vernon i have spoken to him i did my commission and i spoke to him of me of myself i see how i hurt you i could not avoid it yes of you as far as we are related i said i believed you would release me i said i could be true to my plighted word but that you would not insist could a gentleman insist but not a step beyond not love i have none and willoughby treat me as one perfectly worthless i am i should have known it a year back i was deceived in myself there should be love should be willoughbys tone was a pungent comment on her love then i find i have not i think i am antagonistic to it what people say of it i have not experienced i find i was mistaken it is lightly said but very painful you understand me that my prayer is for liberty that i may not be tied if you can release and pardon me or promise ultimately to pardon me or say some kind word i shall know it is because i am beneath you utterly that i have been unable to give you the love you should have with a wife only say to me go it is you who break the match discovering my want of a heart what people think of me matters little my anxiety will be to save you annoyance she waited for him he seemed on the verge of speaking he perceived her expectation he had nothing but clownish tumult within and his dignity counselled him to disappoint her swaying his head like the oriental palm whose shade is a blessing to the perfervid wanderer below smiling gravely he was indirectly asking his dignity what he could say to maintain it and deal this mad young woman a bitterly compassionate rebuke what to think hung remoter the thing to do struck him first he squeezed both her hands threw the door wide open and said with countless blinkings in the laboratory we are uninterrupted i was at a loss to guess where that most unpleasant effect on the senses came from they are always guessing through the nose i mean the remainder of breakfast here perhaps i satirized them too smartlyif you know the letters when they are not calculating more offensive than debris of a midnight banquet an american tour is instructive though not so romantic not so romantic as italy i mean let us escape she held back from his arm she had scattered his brains it was pitiable but she was in the torrent and could not suffer a pause or a change of place it must be here one minute morei cannot go elsewhere to begin again speak to me here answer my request once one word if you forgive me it will be superhuman but release me seriously he rejoined teacups and coffeecups breadcrumbs eggshells caviare butter beef bacon can we the room reeks then i will go for my walk with miss dale and you will speak to me when i return at all seasons you shall go with miss dale but my dear my love seriously where are we one hears of lovers quarrels now i never quarrel it is a characteristic of mine and you speak of me to my cousin vernon seriously plighted faith signifies plighted faith as much as an ironcable is iron to hold by some little twist of the mind to vernon of all men tush she has been dreaming of a hero of perfection and the comparison is unfavourable to her willoughby but my clara when i say to you that bride is bride and you are mine mine willoughby you mentioned themthose separations of two married you said if they do not love oh say is it not betterinstead of later he took advantage of her modesty in speaking to exclaim where are we now bride is bride and wife is wife and affianced is in honour wedded you cannot be released we are united recognize it united there is no possibility of releasing a wife not if she ran this was too direct to be histrionically misunderstood he had driven her to the extremity of more distinctly imagining the circumstance she had cited and with that cleared view the desperate creature gloried in launching such a bolt at the mans real or assumed insensibility as must by shivering it waken him but in a moment she stood in burning rose with dimmed eyesight she saw his horror and seeing shared it shared just then only by seeing it which led her to rejoice with the deepest of sighs that some shame was left in her ran ran ran he said as rapidly as he blinked how where what idea close was he upon an explosion that would have sullied his conception of the purity of the younger members of the sex hauntingly that she a young lady maiden of strictest education should and without his teaching know that wives ranknow that by running they compelled their husbands to abandon pursuit surrender possessionand that she should suggest it of herself as a wifethat she should speak of running his ideal the common male egoist ideal of a waxwork sex would have been shocked to fragments had she spoken further to fill in the outlines of these awful interjections she was tempted for during the last few minutes the fire of her situation had enlightened her understanding upon a subject far from her as the icefields of the north a short while before and the prospect offered to her courage if she would only outstare shame and seem at home in the doings of wickedness was his loathing and dreading so vile a young woman she restrained herself chiefly after the first bridling of maidenly timidity because she could not bear to lower the idea of her sex even in his esteem the door was open she had thoughts of flying out to breathe in an interval of truce she reflected on her situation hurriedly askance if one must go through this to be disentangled from an engagement what must it be to poor women seeking to be free of a marriage had she spoken it sir willoughby might have learned that she was not so iniquitously wise of the things of this world as her mere sexs instinct roused to the intemperateness of a creature struggling with fetters had made her appear in her dash to seize a weapon indicated moreover by him clara took up the old broken vow of women to vow it afresh never to any man will i give my hand she replied to sir willoughby i have said all i cannot explain what i have said she had heard a step in the passage vernon entered perceiving them he stated his mission in apology doctor middleton left a book in this room i see it its a heinsius ha by the way a book books would not be left here if they were not brought here with my compliments to doctor middleton who may do as he pleases though seriously order is order said sir willoughby come away to the laboratory clara its a comment on human beings that wherever they have been theres a mess and you admirers of them he divided a sickly nod between vernon and the stale breakfasttable must make what you can of it come clara clara protested that she was engaged to walk with miss dale miss dale is waiting in the hall said vernon miss dale is waiting said clara walk with miss dale walk with miss dale sir willoughby remarked pressingly i will beg her to wait another two minutes you shall find her in the hall when you come down he rang the bell and went out take miss dale into your confidence she is quite trustworthy vernon said to clara i have not advanced one step she replied recollect that you are in a position of your own choosing and if after thinking over it you mean to escape you must make up your mind to pitched battles and not be dejected if you are beaten in all of them there is your only chance not my choosing do not say choosing mr whitford i did not choose i was incapable of really choosing i consented its the same in fact but be sure of what you wish yes she assented taking it for her just punishment that she should be supposed not quite to know her wishes your advice has helped me today did i advise do you regret advising i should certainly regret a word that intruded between you and him but you will not leave the hall yet you will not leave me without a friend if papa and i were to leave tomorrow i foresee endless correspondence i have to stay at least some days and wear through it and then if i have to speak to my poor father you can imagine the effect on him sir willoughby came striding in to correct the error of his going out miss dale awaits you my dear you have bonnet hatno have you forgotten your appointment to walk with her i am ready said clara departing the two gentlemen behind her separated in the passage they had not spoken she had read of the reproach upon women that they divide the friendships of men she reproached herself but she was in action driven by necessity between sea and rock dreadful to think of she was one of the creatures who are written about chapter xvi clara and laetitia in spite of his honourable caution vernon had said things to render miss middleton more angrily determined than she had been in the scene with sir willoughby his counting on pitched battles and a defeat for her in all of them made her previous feelings appear slack in comparison with the energy of combat now animating her and she could vehemently declare that she had not chosen she was too young too ignorant to choose he had wrongly used that word it sounded malicious and to call consenting the same in fact as choosing was wilfully unjust mr whitford meant well he was conscientious very conscientious but he was not the hero descending from heaven brightsworded to smite a womans fetters of her limbs and deliver her from the yawning mouthabyss his logical coolness of expostulation with her when she cast aside the silly mission entrusted to her by sir willoughby and wept for herself was unheroic in proportion to its praiseworthiness he had left it to her to do everything she wished done stipulating simply that there should be a pause of fourandtwenty hours for her to consider of it before she proceeded in the attempt to extricate herself of consolation there had not been a word said he i am the last man to give advice in such a case yet she had by no means astonished him when her confession came out it came out she knew not how it was led up to by his declining the idea of marriage and her congratulating him on his exemption from the prospect of the yoke but memory was too dull to revive the one or two fiery minutes of broken language when she had been guilty of her dire misconduct this gentleman was no flatterer scarcely a friend he could look on her grief without soothing her supposing he had soothed her warmly all her sentiments collected in her bosom to dash in reprobation of him at the thought she nevertheless condemned him for his excessive coolness his transparent anxiety not to be compromised by a syllable his air of saying i guessed as much but why plead your case to me and his recommendation to her to be quite sure she did know what she meant was a little insulting she exonerated him from the intention he treated her as a girl by what he said of miss dale he proposed that lady for imitation i must be myself or i shall be playing hypocrite to dig my own pitfall she said to herself while taking counsel with laetitia as to the route for their walk and admiring a becoming curve in her companions hat sir willoughby with many protestations of regret that letters of business debarred him from the pleasure of accompanying them remarked upon the path proposed by miss dale in that case you must have a footman then we adopt the other said clara and they set forth sir willoughby miss dale said to her is always in alarm about our unprotectedness clara glanced up at the clouds and closed her parasol she replied it inspires timidity there was that in the accent and character of the answer which warned laetitia to expect the reverse of a quiet chatter with miss middleton you are fond of walking she chose a peaceful topic walking or riding yes of walking said clara the difficulty is to find companions we shall lose mr whitford next week he goes he will be a great loss to me for i do not ride laetitia replied to the offhand inquiry ah miss middleton did not fan conversation when she simply breathed her voice laetitia tried another neutral theme the weather today suits our country she said england or patterne park i am so devoted to mountains that i have no enthusiasm for flat land do you call our country flat miss middleton we have undulations hills and we have sufficient diversity meadows rivers copses brooks and good roads and pretty bypaths the prettiness is overwhelming it is very pretty to see but to live with i think i prefer ugliness i can imagine learning to love ugliness its honest however young you are you cannot be deceived by it these parks of rich people are a part of the prettiness i would rather have fields commons the parks give us delightful green walks paths through beautiful woods if there is a rightofway for the public there should be said miss dale wondering and clara cried i chafe at restraint hedges and palings everywhere i should have to travel ten years to sit down contented among these fortifications of course i can read of this rich kind of english country with pleasure in poetry but it seems to me to require poetry what would you say of human beings requiring it that they are not so companionable but that the haze of distance improves the view then you do know that you are the wisest laetitia raised her dark eyelashes she sought to understand she could only fancy she did and if she did it meant that miss middleton thought her wise in remaining single clara was full of a sombre preconception that her jealousy had been hinted to miss dale you knew miss durham she said not intimately as well as you know me not so well but you saw more of her she was more reserved with me oh miss dale i would not be reserved with you the thrill of the voice caused laetitia to steal a look claras eyes were bright and she had the readiness to run to volubility of the feverstricken otherwise she did not betray excitement you will never allow any of these noble trees to be felled miss middleton the axe is better than decay do you not think i think your influence will be great and always used to good purpose my influence miss dale i have begged a favour this morning and can not obtain the grant it was lightly said but claras face was more significant and what leaped from laetitias lips before she could excuse herself clara had answered my liberty in another and higher tone laetitia said what and she looked round on her companion she looked in the doubt that is open to conviction by a narrow aperture and slowly and painfully yields access clara saw the vacancy of her expression gradually filling with woefulness i have begged him to release me from my engagement miss dale sir willoughby it is incredible to you he refuses you see i have no influence miss middleton it is terrible to be dragged to the marriage service against ones will yes oh miss middleton do you not think so that cannot be your meaning you do not suspect me of trifling you know i would not i am as much in earnest as a mouse in a trap no you will not misunderstand me miss middleton such a blow to sir willoughby would be shocking most cruel he is devoted to you he was devoted to miss durham not so deeply differently was he not very much courted at that time he is now not so much he is not so young but my reason for speaking of miss durham was to exclaim at the strangeness of a girl winning her freedom to plunge into wedlock is it comprehensible to you she flies from one dungeon into another these are the acts which astonish men at our conduct and cause them to ridicule and i dare say despise us but miss middleton for sir willoughby to grant such a request if it was made it was made and by me and will be made again i throw it all on my unworthiness miss dale so the county will think of me and quite justly i would rather defend him than myself he requires a different wife from anything i can be that is my discovery unhappily a late one the blame is all mine the world cannot be too hard on me but i must be free if i am to be kind in my judgements even of the gentleman i have injured so noble a gentleman laetitia sighed i will subscribe to any eulogy of him said clara with a penetrating thought as to the possibility of a lady experienced in him like laetitia taking him for noble he has a noble air i say it sincerely that your appreciation of him proves his nobility her feeling of opposition to sir willoughby pushed her to this extravagance gravely perplexing laetitia and it is added clara as if to support what she had said a withering rebuke to me i know him less at least have not had so long an experience of him laetitia pondered on an obscurity in these words which would have accused her thick intelligence but for a glimmer it threw on another most obscure communication she feared it might be strange though it seemed jealousy a shade of jealousy affecting miss middleton as had been vaguely intimated by sir willoughby when they were waiting in the hall a little feminine ailment a want of comprehension of a perfect friendship those were his words to her and he suggested vaguely that care must be taken in the eulogy of her friend she resolved to be explicit i have not said that i think him beyond criticism miss middleton noble he has faults when we have known a person for years the faults come out but custom makes light of them and i suppose we feel flattered by seeing what it would be difficult to be blind to a very little flatters us now do you not admire that view it is my favourite clara gazed over rolling richness of foliage wood and water and a churchspire a town and horizon hills there sung a skylark not even the bird that does not fly away she said meaning she had no heart for the bird satisfied to rise and descend in this place laetitia travelled to some notion dim and immense of miss middletons fever of distaste she shrunk from it in a kind of dread lest it might be contagious and rob her of her one everfresh possession of the homely picturesque but clara melted her by saying for your sake i could love it in time or some dear old english scene since since this this change in me i find i cannot separate landscape from associations now i learn how youth goes i have grown years older in a weekmiss dale if he were to give me my freedom if he were to cast me off if he stood alone i should pity him himnot me oh right i hoped you would i knew you would laetitias attempt to shift with miss middletons shiftiness was vain for now she seemed really listening to the language of jealousyjealous of the ancient letty daleand immediately before the tone was quite void of it yes she said but you make me feel myself in the dark and when i do i have the habit of throwing myself for guidance upon such light as i have within you shall know me if you will as well as i know myself and do not think me far from the point when i say i have a feeble health i am what the doctors call anaemic a rather bloodless creature the blood is life so i have not much life ten years backeleven if i must be precise i thought of conquering the world with a pen the result is that i am glad of a fireside and not sure of always having one and that is my achievement my days are monotonous but if i have a dread it is that there will be an alteration in them my father has very little money we subsist on what private income he has and his pension he was an army doctor i may byandby have to live in a town for pupils i could be grateful to any one who would save me from that i should be astonished at his choosing to have me burden his household as wellhave i now explained the nature of my pity it would be the pity of common sympathy pure lymph of pity as nearly disembodied as can be last years sheddings from the tree do not form an attractive garland their merit is that they have not the ambition i am like them now miss middleton i cannot make myself more bare to you i hope you see my sincerity i do see it clara said with the second heaving of her heart she cried see it and envy you that humility proud if i could ape it oh how proud if i could speak so truthfully trueyou would not have spoken so to me without some good feeling out of which friends are made that i am sure of to be very truthful to a person one must have a liking so i judge by myself do i presume too much kindness was on laetitias face but now said clara swimming on the wave in her bosom i tax you with the silliest suspicion ever entertained by one of your rank lady you have deemed me capable of the meanest of our viceshold this hand laetitia my friend will you something is going on in me laetitia took her hand and saw and felt that something was going on clara said you are a woman it was her effort to account for the something she swam for a brilliant instant on tears and yielded to the overflow when they had fallen she remarked upon her first long breath quite coolly an encouraging picture of a rebel is it not her companion murmured to soothe her its little its nothing said clara pained to keep her lips in line they walked forward holding hands deephearted to one another i like this country better now the shaken girl resumed i could lie down in it and ask only for sleep i should like to think of you here how nobly selfrespecting you must be to speak as you did our dreams of heroes and heroines are cold glitter beside the reality i have been lately thinking of myself as an outcast of my sex and to have a good woman liking me a little loving oh laetitia my friend i should have kissed you and not made this exhibition of myselfand if you call it hysterics woe to you for i bit my tongue to keep it off when i had hardly strength to bring my teeth togetherif that idea of jealousy had not been in your head you had it from him i have not alluded to it in any word that i can recollect he can imagine no other cause for my wish to be released i have noticed it is his instinct to reckon on women as constant by their nature they are the needles and he the magnet jealousy of you miss dale laetitia may i speak say everything you please i could wishdo you know my baptismal name clara at last i could wish that is if it were your wish yes i could wish that next to independence my wish would be that i risk offending you do not let your delicacy take arms against me i wish him happy in the only way that he can be made happy there is my jealousy was it what you were going to say just now no i thought not i was going to sayand i believe the rack would not make me truthful like you laetitiawell has it ever struck you remember i do see his merits i speak to his faithfullest friend and i acknowledge he is attractive he has manly tastes and habits but has it never struck you i have no right to ask i know that men must have faults i do not expect them to be saints i am not one i wish i were has it never struck me laetitia prompted her that very few women are able to be straightforwardly sincere in their speech however much they may desire to be they are differently educated great misfortune brings it to them i am sure your answer is correct have you ever known a woman who was entirely an egoist personally known one we are not better than men i do not pretend that we are i have latterly become an egoist thinking of no one but myself scheming to make use of every soul i meet but then women are in the position of inferiors they are hardly out of the nursery when a lasso is round their necks and if they have beauty no wonder they turn it to a weapon and make as many captives as they can i do not wonder my sense of shame at my natural weakness and the arrogance of men would urge me to make hundreds captive if that is being a coquette i should not have compassion for those lofty birds the hawks to see them with their wings clipped would amuse me is there any other way of punishing them consider what you lose in punishing them i consider what they gain if we do not laetitia supposed she was listening to discursive observations upon the inequality in the relations of the sexes a suspicion of a drift to a closer meaning had been lulled and the colour flooded her swiftly when clara said here is the difference i see i see it i am certain of it women who are called coquettes make their conquests not of the best of men but men who are egoists have good women for their victims women on whose devoted constancy they feed they drink it like blood i am sure i am not taking the merely feminine view they punish themselves too by passing over the one suitable to them who could really give them what they crave to have and they go where they clara stopped i have not your power to express ideas she said miss middleton you have a dreadful power said laetitia clara smiled affectionately i am not aware of any whose cottage is this my fathers will you not come in into the garden clara took note of ivied windows and roses in the porch she thanked laetitia and said i will call for you in an hour are you walking on the road alone said laetitia incredulously with an eye to sir willoughbys dismay i put my trust in the highroad clara replied and turned away but turned back to laetitia and offered her face to be kissed the dreadful power of this young lady had fervently impressed laetitia and in kissing her she marvelled at her gentleness and girlishness clara walked on unconscious of her possession of power of any kind chapter xvii the porcelain vase during the term of claras walk with laetitia sir willoughbys shrunken selfesteem like a garment hung to the fire after exposure to tempestuous weather recovered some of the sleekness of its velvet pile in the society of mrs mountstuart jenkinson who represented to him the world he feared and tried to keep sunny for himself by all the arts he could exercise she expected him to be the gay sir willoughby and her look being as good as an incantation summons he produced the accustomed sprite giving her sally for sally queens govern the polite popularity with men serviceable as it is for winning favouritism with women is of poor value to a sensitive gentleman anxious even to prognostic apprehension on behalf of his pride his comfort and his prevalence and men are grossly purchasable good wines have them good cigars a goodfellow air they are never quite worth their salt even then you can make head against their ill looks but the looks of women will at one blow work on you the downright difference which is between the cock of lordly plume and the moulting happily they may be gained a clever tongue will gain them a leg they are with you to a certainty if nature is with you if you are elegant and discreet if the sun is on you and they see you shining in it or if they have seen you wellstationed and handsome in the sun and once gained they are your mirrors for life and far more constant than the glass that tale of their caprice is absurd hit their imaginations once they are your slaves only demanding common courtier service of you they will deny that you are ageing they will cover you from scandal they will refuse to see you ridiculous sir willoughbys instinct or skin or outfloating feelers told him of these mysteries of the influence of the sex he had as little need to study them as a lady breathed on he had some need to know them in fact and with him the need of a protection for himself called it forth he was intuitively a conjurer in selfdefence longsighted wanting no directions to the herb he was to suck at when fighting a serpent his dulness of vision into the heart of his enemy was compensated by the agile sensitiveness obscuring but rendering him miraculously active and without supposing his need immediate he deemed it politic to fascinate mrs mountstuart and anticipate ghastly possibilities in the future by dropping a hint not of claras fickleness you may be sure of his own rather or more justly of an altered view of claras character he touched on the rogue in porcelain set gently laughing by his relishing humour i get nearer to it he said remember im in love with her said mrs mountstuart that is our penalty a pleasant one for you he assented is the rogue to be eliminated ask when shes a mother my dear sir willoughby this is how i read you i shall accept any interpretation that is complimentary not one will satisfy me of being sufficiently so and so i leave it to the character to fill out the epigram do what hurry is there and dont be misled by your objection to rogue which would be reasonable if you had not secured her the door of a hollow chamber of horrible reverberation was opened within him by this remark he tried to say in jest that it was not always a passionate admiration that held the rogue fast but he muddled it in the thick of his conscious thunder and mrs mountstuart smiled to see him shot from the smoothflowing dialogue into the cataracts by one simple reminder to the lover of his luck necessarily after a fall the pitch of their conversation relaxed miss dale is looking well he said fairly she ought to marry said mrs mountstuart he shook his head persuade her she nodded example may have some effect he looked extremely abstracted yes it is time where is the man you could recommend for her complement she has now what was missing before a ripe intelligence in addition to her happy dispositionromantic you would say i cant think women the worse for that a dash of it she calls it leafage very pretty and have you relented about your horse achmet i dont sell him under four hundred poor johnny busshe you forget that his wife doles him out his money youre a hard bargainer sir willoughby i mean the price to be prohibitive very well and leafage is good for hideandseek especially when there is no rogue in ambush and thats the worst i can say of laetitia dale an exaggerated devotion is the scandal of our sex they say youre the hardest man of business in the county too and i can believe it for at home and abroad your aim is to get the best of everybody you see ive no leafage i am perfectly matteroffact bald nevertheless my dear mrs mountstuart i can assure you that conversing with you has much the same exhilarating effect on me as conversing with miss dale but leafage leafage you hard bargainers have no compassion for devoted spinsters i tell you my sentiments absolutely and you have mine moderately expressed she recollected the purpose of her mornings visit which was to engage dr middleton to dine with her and sir willoughby conducted her to the librarydoor insist he said awaiting her reappearance the refreshment of the talk he had sustained not without point assisted him to distinguish in its complete abhorrent orb the offence committed against him by his bride and this he did through projecting it more and more away from him so that in the outer distance it involved his personal emotions less while observation was enabled to compass its vastness and as it were perceive the whole spherical mass of the wretched girls guilt impudently turning on its axis thus to detach an injury done to us and plant it in space for mathematical measurement of its weight and bulk is an art it may also be an instinct of selfpreservation otherwise as when mountains crumble adjacent villages are crushed men of feeling may at any moment be killed outright by the iniquitous and the callous but as an art it should be known to those who are for practising an art so beneficent that circumstances must lend their aid sir willoughbys instinct even had sat dull and crushed before his conversation with mrs mountstuart she lifted him to one of his ideals of himself among gentlemen he was the english gentleman with ladies his aim was the gallican courtier of any period from louis treize to louis quinze he could doat on those who led him to talk in that characterbacked by english solidity you understand roast beef stood eminent behind the souffle and champagne an english squire excelling his fellows at hazardous leaps in public he was additionally a polished whisperer a lively dialoguer one for witty bouts with something in himcapacity for a drive and dig or twobeyond mere wit as they soon learned who called up his reserves and had a bosom for pinking so much for his ideal of himself now clara not only never evoked never responded to it she repelled it there was no flourishing of it near her he considerately overlooked these facts in his ordinary calculations he was a man of honour and she was a girl of beauty but the accidental blooming of his ideal with mrs mountstuart on the very heels of claras offence restored him to full command of his art of detachment and he thrust her out quite apart from himself to contemplate her disgraceful revolutions deeply read in the book of egoism that he was he knew the wisdom of the sentence an injured pride that strikes not out will strike home what was he to strike with ten years younger laetitia might have been the instrument to think of her now was preposterous beside clara she had the hue of winter under the springing bough he tossed her away vexed to the very soul by an ostentatious decay that shrank from comparison with the blooming creature he had to scourge in selfdefence by some agency or other mrs mountstuart was on the step of her carriage when the silken parasols of the young ladies were descried on a slope of the park where the yellow green of mayclothed beeches flowed over the brown ground of last years leaves whos the cavalier she inquired a gentleman escorted them vernon no hes pegging at crossjay quoth willoughby vernon and crossjay came out for the boys halfhours run before his dinner crossjay spied miss middleton and was off to meet her at a bound vernon followed him leisurely the rogue has no cousin has she said mrs mountstuart its a family of one son or one daughter for generations replied willoughby and letty dale cousin he exclaimed as if wealth had been imputed to miss dale adding no male cousin a railway station fly drove out of the avenue on the circle to the hallentrance flitch was driver he had no right to be there he was doing wrong but he was doing it under cover of an office to support his wife and young ones and his deprecating touches of the hat spoke of these apologies to his former master with doglike pathos sir willoughby beckoned to him to approach so you are here he said you have luggage flitch jumped from the box and read one of the labels aloud lieutenantcolonel h de craye and the colonel met the ladies overtook them here seemed to come dismal matter for flitch to relate he began upon the abstract origin of it he had lost his place in sir willoughbys establishment and was obliged to look about for work where it was to be got and though he knew he had no right to be where he was he hoped to be forgiven because of the mouths he had to feed as a flyman attached to the railway station where this gentleman the colonel hired him and he believed sir willoughby would excuse him for driving a friend which the colonel was he recollected well and the colonel recollected him and he said not noticing how he was rigged what flitch back in your old place am i expected and he told the colonel his unfortunate situation not back colonel no such luck for me and colonel de craye was a very kindhearted gentleman as he always had been and asked kindly after his family and it might be that such poor work as he was doing now he might be deprived of such is misfortune when it once harpoons a man you may dive and you may fly but it sticks in you once do a foolish thing may i humbly beg of you if youll be so good sir willoughby said flitch passing to evidence of the sad mishap he opened the door of the fly displaying fragments of broken porcelain but what what whats the story of this cried sir willoughby what is it said mrs mountstuart pricking up her ears it was a vaws flitch replied in elegy a porcelain vase interpreted sir willoughby china mrs mountstuart faintly shrieked one of the pieces was handed to her inspection she held it close she held it distant she sighed horribly the man had better have hanged himself said she flitch bestirred his misfortunesodden features and members for a continuation of the doleful narrative how did this occur sir willoughby peremptorily asked him flitch appealed to his former master for testimony that he was a good and a careful driver sir willoughby thundered i tell you to tell me how this occurred not a drop my lady not since my supper last night if theres any truth in me flitch implored succour of mrs mountstuart drive straight she said and braced him his narrative was then direct near pipers mill where the wicker brook crossed the rebdon road one of hoppners wagons overloaded as usual was forcing the horses uphill when flitch drove down at an easy pace and saw himself between hoppners cart come to a stand and a young lady advancing and just then the carter smacks his whip the horses pull half mad the young lady starts behind the cart and up jumps the colonel and to save the young lady flitch dashed ahead and did save her he thanked heaven for it and more when he came to see who the young lady was she was alone said sir willoughby in tragic amazement staring at flitch very well you saved her and you upset the fly mountstuart jogged him on bardett our old headkeeper was a witness my lady had to drive half up the bank and its trueover the fly did go and the vaws it shoots out against the twelfth milestone just as though there was the chance for it for nobody else was injured and knocked against anything else it never would have flown all to pieces so that it took bardett and me ten minutes to collect every one down to the smallest piece there was and he said and i cant help thinking myself there was a providence in it for we all come together so as you might say we was made to do as we did so then horace adopted the prudent course of walking on with the ladies instead of trusting his limbs again to this capsizing fly sir willoughby said to mrs mountstuart and she rejoined lucky that no one was hurt both of them eyed the nose of poor flitch and simultaneously they delivered a verdict in humph mrs mountstuart handed the wretch a halfcrown from her purse sir willoughby directed the footman in attendance to unload the fly and gather up the fragments of porcelain carefully bidding flitch be quick in his departing the colonels weddingpresent i shall call tomorrow mrs mountstuart waved her adieu come every dayyes i suppose we may guess the destination of the vase he bowed her off and she cried well now the gift can be shared if youre either of you for a division in the crash of the carriagewheels he heard at any rate there was a rogue in that porcelain these are the slaps we get from a heedless world as for the vase it was horace de crayes loss weddingpresent he would have to produce and decidedly not in chips it had the look of a costly vase but that was no question for the momentwhat was meant by clara being seen walking on the highroad alonewhat snare traceable ad inferas had ever induced willoughby patterne to make her the repository and fortress of his honour chapter xviii colonel de craye clara came along chatting and laughing with colonel de craye young crossjays hand under one of her arms and her parasol flashing a dazzling offender as if she wished to compel the spectator to recognize the dainty rogue in porcelain really insufferably fair perfect in height and grace of movement exquisitely tressed redlipped the colour striking out to a distance from her ivory skin a sight to set the woodland dancing and turn the heads of the town though beautiful a jury of art critics might pronounce her not to be irregular features are condemned in beauty beautiful figure they could say a description of her figure and her walking would have won her any praises and she wore a dress cunning to embrace the shape and flutter loose about it in the spirit of a summers day calypsoclad dr middleton would have called her see the silver birch in a breeze here it swells there it scatters and it is puffed to a round and it streams like a pennon and now gives the glimpse and shine of the white stems line within now hurries over it denying that it was visible with a chatter along the sweeping folds while still the white peeps through she had the wonderful art of dressing to suit the season and the sky today the art was ravishingly companionable with her sweetlighted face too sweet too vividly meaningful for pretty if not of the strict severity for beautiful millinery would tell us that she wore a fichu of thin white muslin crossed in front on a dress of the same light stuff trimmed with deep rose she carried a greysilk parasol traced at the borders with green creepers and across the arm devoted to crossjay a length of trailing ivy and in that hand a bunch of the first long grasses these hues of red rose and pale green ruffled and pouted in the billowy white of the dress ballooning and valleying softly like a yacht before the sail bends low but she walked not like one blown against resembling rather the day of the southwest driving the clouds gallantly firm in commotion interfusing colour and varying in her features from laugh to smile and look of settled pleasure like the heavens above the breeze sir willoughby as he frequently had occasion to protest to clara was no poet he was a more than commonly candid english gentleman in his avowed dislike of the poets nonsense verbiage verse not one of those latterly terrorized by the noise made about the fellow into silent contempt a sentiment that may sleep and has not to be defended he loathed the fellow fought the fellow but he was one with the poet upon that prevailing theme of verse the charms of women he was to his illluck intensely susceptible and where he led men after him to admire his admiration became a fury he could see at a glance that horace de craye admired miss middleton horace was a man of taste could hardly could not do other than admire but how curious that in the setting forth of clara and miss dale to his own contemplation and comparison of them sir willoughby had given but a nodding approbation of his brides appearance he had not attached weight to it recently her conduct and foremost if not chiefly her having been discovered positively met by his friend horace walking on the highroad without companion or attendant increased a sense of pain so very unusual with him that he had cause to be indignant coming on this condition his admiration of the girl who wounded him was as bitter a thing as a man could feel resentment fed from the main springs of his nature turned it to wormwood and not a whit the less was it admiration when he resolved to chastise her with a formal indication of his disdain her present gaiety sounded to him like laughter heard in the shadow of the pulpit you have escaped he said to her while shaking the hand of his friend horace and cordially welcoming him my dear fellow and by the way you had a squeak for it i hear from flitch i willoughby not a bit said the colonel we get into a fly to get out of it and flitch helped me out as well as in good fellow just dusting my coat as he did it the only bit of bad management was that miss middleton had to step aside a trifle hurriedly you knew miss middleton at once flitch did me the favour to introduce me he first precipitated me at miss middletons feet and then he introduced me in old oriental fashion to my sovereign sir willoughbys countenance was enough for his friend horace quarterwheeling to clara he said tis the place im to occupy for life miss middleton though one is not always fortunate to have a bright excuse for taking it at the commencement clara said happily you were not hurt colonel de craye i was in the hands of the loves not the graces im afraid ive an image of myself dear no my dear willoughby you never made such a headlong declaration as that it would have looked like a magnificent impulse if the posture had only been choicer and miss middleton didnt laugh at least i saw nothing but pity you did not write said willoughby because it was a tossup of a run to ireland or here and i came here not to go there and by the way fetched a jug with me to offer up to the gods of illluck and they accepted the propitiation wasnt it packed in a box no it was wrapped in paper to show its elegant form i caught sight of it in the shop yesterday and carried it off this morning and presented it to miss middleton at noon without any form at all willoughby knew his friend horaces mood when the irish tongue in him threatened to wag you see what may happen he said to clara as far as i am in fault i regret it she answered flitch says the accident occurred through his driving up the bank to save you from the wheels flitch may go and whisper that down the neck of his empty whiskyflask said horace de craye and then let him cork it the consequence is that we have a porcelain vase broken you should not walk on the road alone clara you ought to have a companion always it is the rule here i had left miss dale at the cottage you ought to have had the dogs would they have been any protection to the vase horace de craye crowed cordially im afraid not miss middleton one must go to the witches for protection to vases and theyre all in the air now having their own way with us which accounts for the confusion in politics and society and the rise in the price of broomsticks to prove it true as they tell us that every nook and corner wants a mighty sweeping miss dale looks beaming said de craye wishing to divert willoughby from his anger with sense as well as nonsense you have not been visiting ireland recently said sir willoughby no nor making acquaintance with an actor in an irish part in a drama cast in the green island tis flitch my dear willoughby has been and stirred the native in me and well present him to you for the like good office when we hear after a number of years that youve not wrinkled your forehead once at your liege lady take the poor old dog back home will you hes crazed to be at the hall i say willoughby it would be a good bit of work to take him back think of it youll do the popular thing im sure ive a superstition that flitch ought to drive you from the churchdoor if i were in luck id have him drive me the mans a drunkard horace he fuddles his poor nose tis merely unction to the exile sober struggles below he drinks to rock his heart because he has one now let me intercede for poor flitch not a word of him he threw up his place to try his fortune in the world as the best of us do though livery runs after us to tell us theres no being an independent gentleman and comes a cold day we haul on the metalbutton coat again with a good ha of satisfaction youll do the popular thing miss middleton joins in the pleading no pleading when ive vowed upon my eloquence willoughby id bring you to pardon the poor dog not a word of him just one sir willoughby battled with himself to repress a state of temper that put him to marked disadvantage beside his friend horace in high spirits ordinarily he enjoyed these fits of irish of him which were horaces fun and play at times involuntary and then they indicated a recklessness that might embrace mischief de craye as willoughby had often reminded him was properly norman the blood of two or three irish mothers in his line however was enough to dance him and if his fine profile spoke of the stiffer race his eyes and the quick run of the lip in the cheek and a number of his qualities were evidence of the maternal legacy my word has been said about the man willoughby replied but ive wagered on your heart against your word and cant afford to lose and theres a double reason for revoking for you i dont see either of them here are the ladies youll think of the poor beast willoughby i hope for better occupation if he drives a wheelbarrow at the hall hell be happier than on board a chariot at large hes brokenhearted hes too much in the way of breakages my dear horace oh the vase the bit of porcelain sung de craye well well talk him over by and by if it pleases you but my rules are never amended inalterable are theylike those of an ancient people who might as well have worn a jacket of lead for the comfort they had of their boast the beauty of laws for human creatures is their adaptability to new stitchings colonel de craye walked at the heels of his leader to make his bow to the ladies eleanor and isabel sir willoughby had guessed the person who inspired his friend horace to plead so pertinaciously and inopportunely for the man flitch and it had not improved his temper or the pose of his rejoinders he had winced under the contrast of his friend horaces easy laughing sparkling musical air and manner with his own stiffness and he had seen claras face too scanning the contrasthe was fatally driven to exaggerate his discontentment which did not restore him to serenity he would have learned more from what his abrupt swing round of the shoulder precluded his beholding there was an interchange between colonel de craye and miss middleton spontaneous on both sides his was a look that said you were right hers i knew it her look was calmer and after the first instant clouded as by wearifulness of sameness his was brilliant astonished speculative and admiring pitiful a look that poised over a revelation called up the hosts of wonder to question strange fact it had passed unseen by sir willoughby the observer was the one who could also supply the key of the secret miss dale had found colonel de craye in company with miss middleton at her gateway they were laughing and talking together like friends of old standing de craye as irish as he could be and the irish tongue and gentlemanly manner are an irresistible challenge to the opening steps of familiarity when accident has broken the ice flitch was their theme and oh but if we go tip to willoughby hand in hand and bob a courtesy to m and beg his pardon for mister flitch wont he melt to such a pair of suppliants of course he will miss middleton said he would not colonel de craye wagered he would he knew willoughby best miss middleton looked simply grave a way of asserting the contrary opinion that tells of rueful experience well see said the colonel they chatted like a couple unexpectedly discovering in one another a common dialect among strangers can there be an end to it when those two meet they prattle they fill the minutes as though they were violently to be torn asunder at a coming signal and must have it out while they can it is a meeting of mountain brooks not a colloquy but a chasing impossible to say which flies which follows or what the topic so interlinguistic are they and rapidly counterchanging after their conversation of an hour before laetitia watched miss middleton in surprise at her lightness of mind clara bathed in mirth a boy in a summer stream shows not heartier refreshment of his whole being laetitia could now understand vernons idea of her wit and it seemed that she also had irish blood speaking of ireland miss middleton said she had cousins there her only relatives the laugh told me that said colonel de craye laetitia and vernon paced up and down the lawn colonel de craye was talking with english sedateness to the ladies eleanor and isabel clara and young crossjay strayed if i might advise i would say do not leave the hall immediately not yet laetitia said to vernon you know then i cannot understand why it was that i was taken into her confidence i counselled it but it was done without an object that i can see the speaking did her good but how capricious how changeful better now than later surely she has only to ask to be releasedto ask earnestly if it is her wish you are mistaken why does she not make a confidant of her father that she will have to do she wished to spare him he cannot be spared if she is to break the engagement she thought of sparing him the annoyance now theres to be a tussle he must share in it or she thought he might not side with her she has not a single instinct of cunning you judge her harshly she moved me on the walk out coming home i felt differently vernon glanced at colonel de craye she wants good guidance continued laetitia she has not an idea of treachery you think so it may be true but she seems one born devoid of patience easily made reckless there is a wildness i judge by her way of speaking that at least appeared sincere she does not practise concealment he will naturally find it almost incredible the change in her so sudden so wayward is unintelligible to me to me it is the conduct of a creature untamed he may hold her to her word and be justified let him look out if he does is not that harsher than anything i have said of her im not appointed to praise her i fancy i read the case and its a case of opposition of temperaments we never can tell the person quite suited to us it strikes us in a flash that they are not suited to us oh no that comes by degrees yes but the accumulation of evidence or sentience if you like is combustible we dont command the spark it may be late in falling and you argue in her favour consider her as a generous and impulsive girl outwearied at last by what by anything by his loftiness if you like he flies too high for her we will say sir willoughby an eagle she may be tired of his eyrie the sound of the word in vernons mouth smote on a consciousness she had of his full grasp of sir willoughby and her own timid knowledge though he was not a man who played on words if he had eased his heart in stressing the first syllable it was only temporary relief he was heavybrowed enough but i cannot conceive what she expects me to do by confiding her sense of her position to me said laetitia we none of us know what will be done we hang on willoughby who hangs on whatever it is that supports him and there we are in a swarm you see the wisdom of staying mr whitford it must be over in a day or two yes i stay she inclines to obey you i should be sorry to stake my authority on her obedience we must decide something about crossjay and get the money for his crammer if it is to be got if not i may get a man to trust me i mean to drag the boy away willoughby has been at him with the tune of gentleman and has laid hold of him by one ear when i say her obedience she is not in a situation nor in a condition to be led blindly by anybody she must rely on herself do everything herself its a knot that wont bear touching by any hand save hers i fear said laetitia have no such fear if it should come to his positively refusing he faces the consequences you do not think of her vernon looked at his companion chapter xix colonel de craye and clara middleton miss middleton finished her stroll with crossjay by winding her trailer of ivy in a wreath round his hat and sticking her bunch of grasses in the wreath she then commanded him to sit on the ground beside a big rhododendron there to await her return crossjay had informed her of a design he entertained to be off with a horde of boys nesting in high trees and marking spots where wasps and hornets were to be attacked in autumn she thought it a dangerous business and as the boys dinnerbell had very little restraint over him when he was in the flush of a scheme of this description she wished to make tolerably sure of him through the charm she not unreadily believed she could fling on lads of his age promise me you will not move from here until i come back and when i come i will give you a kiss crossjay promised she left him and forgot him seeing by her watch fifteen minutes to the ringing of the bell a sudden resolve that she would speak to her father without another minutes delay had prompted her like a superstitious impulse to abandon her aimless course and be direct she knew what was good for her she knew it now more clearly than in the morning to be taken away instantly was her cry there could be no further doubt had there been any before but she would not in the morning have suspected herself of a capacity for evil and of a pressing need to be saved from herself she was not pure of nature it may be that we breed saintly souls which are she was pure of will fire rather than ice and in beginning to see the elements she was made of she did not shuffle them to a heap with her sweet looks to front her she put to her account some strength much weakness she almost dared to gaze unblinking at a perilous evil tendency the glimpse of it drove her to her father he must take me away at once tomorrow she wished to spare her father so unsparing of herself was she that in her hesitation to speak to him of her change of feeling for sir willoughby she would not suffer it to be attributed in her own mind to a daughters anxious consideration about her fathers loneliness an idea she had indulged formerly acknowledging that it was imperative she should speak she understood that she had refrained even to the inflicting upon herself of such humiliation as to run dilating on her woes to others because of the silliest of human desires to preserve her reputation for consistency she had heard women abused for shallowness and flightiness she had heard her father denounce them as veering weathervanes and his oftrepeated quid femina possit for her sexs sake and also to appear an exception to her sex this reasoning creature desired to be thought consistent just on the instant of her addressing him saying father a note of seriousness in his ear it struck her that the occasion for saying all had not yet arrived and she quickly interposed papa and helped him to look lighter the petition to be taken away was uttered to london said dr middleton i dont know wholl take us in to france papa that means hotellife only for two or three weeks weeks i am under an engagement to dine with mrs mountstuart jenkinson five days hence that is on thursday could we not find an excuse break an engagement no my dear not even to escape drinking a widows wine does a word bind us why what else should i think i am not very well well call in that man we met at dinner here corney a capital doctor an oldfashioned anecdotal doctor how is it you are not well my love you look well i cannot conceive your not being well it is only that i want change of air papa there we area change semper eadem women will be wanting a change of air in paradise a change of angels too i might surmise a change from quarters like these to a french hotel would be a descentthis the seat this mournful gloom for that celestial light i am perfectly at home in the library here that excellent fellow whitford and i have real days and i like him for showing fight to his elder and better he is going to leave i know nothing of it and i shall append no credit to the tale until i do know he is headstrong but he answers to a rap claras bosom heaved the speechless insurrection threatened her eyes a southwest shower lashed the windowpanes and suggested to dr middleton shuddering visions of the channel passage on board a steamer corney shall see you he is a sparkling draught in person probably illiterate if i may judge from one interruption of my discourse when he sat opposite me but lettered enough to respect learning and write out his prescription i do not ask more of men or of physicians dr middleton said this rising glancing at the clock and at the back of his hands quod autem secundum litteras difficillimum esse artificium but what after letters is the more difficult practice ego puto medicum the medicus next to the scholar though i have not to my recollection required him next me nor ever expected child of mine to be crying for that milk daughter she isof the unexplained sex we will send a messenger for corney change my dear you will speedily have to satisfy the most craving of women if willoughby as i suppose is in the neoteric fashion of spending a honeymoon on a railway apt image exposition and perpetuation of the state of mania conducting to the institution in my time we lay by to brood on happiness we had no thought of chasing it over a continent mistaking hurlyburly clothed in dust for the divinity we sought a smaller generation sacrifices to excitement dust and hurlyburly must perforce be the issue and that is your modern world now my dear let us go and wash our hands middaybells expect immediate attention they know of no anteroom of assembly clara stood gathered up despairing at opportunity lost he had noticed her contracted shape and her eyes and had talked magisterially to smother and overbear the something disagreeable prefigured in her appearance you do not despise your girl father i do not i could not i love her i love my girl but you need not sing to me like a gnat to propound that question my dear then father tell willoughby today we have to leave tomorrow you shall return in time for mrs mountstuarts dinner friends will take us in the darletons the erpinghams we can go to oxford where you are sure of welcome a little will recover me do not mention doctors but you see i am nervous i am quite ashamed of it i am well enough to laugh at it only i cannot overcome it and i feel that a day or two will restore me say you will say it in firstlessonbook language anything above a primer splits my foolish head today dr middleton shrugged spreading out his arms the office of ambassador from you to willoughby clara you decree me to the part of ball between two bats the play being assured the prologue is a bladder of wind i seem to be instructed in one of the mysteries of erotic esotery yet on my word i am no wiser if willoughby is to hear anything from you he will hear it from your lips yes father yes we have differences i am not fit for contests at present my head is giddy i wish to avoid an illness he and i i accuse myself there is the bell ejaculated dr middleton ill debate on it with willoughby this afternoon somewhen before the dinnerbell i cannot tie myself to the minutehand of the clock my dear child and let me direct you for the next occasion when you shall bring the vowels i and a in verbally detached letters into collision that you do not fill the hiatus with so pronounced a y it is the vulgarization of our tongue of which i accuse you i do not like my girl to be guilty of it he smiled to moderate the severity of the correction and kissed her forehead she declared her inability to sit and eat she went to her room after begging him very earnestly to send her the assurance that he had spoken she had not shed a tear and she rejoiced in her selfcontrol it whispered to her of true courage when she had given herself such evidence of the reverse shower and sunshine alternated through the halfhours of the afternoon like a procession of dark and fair holding hands and passing the shadow came and she was chill the light yellow in moisture and she buried her face not to be caught up by cheerfulness believing that her head ached she afflicted herself with all the heavy symptoms and oppressed her mind so thoroughly that its occupation was to speculate on laetitia dales modest enthusiasm for rural pleasures for this place especially with its rich foliage and peeps of scenic peace the prospect of an escape from it inspired thoughts of a loveable round of life where the sun was not a naked ball of fire but a friend clothed in woodland where park and meadow swept to wellknown features east and west and distantly circling hills and the hearts of poor cottagers toosympathy with whom assured her of goodnesswere familiar homely to the dweller in the place morning and night and she had the love of wild flowers the watchful happiness in the seasons poets thrilled her books absorbed she dwelt strongly on that sincerity of feeling it gave her root in our earth she needed it as she pressed a hand on her eyeballs conscious of acting the invalid though the reasons she had for languishing under headache were so convincing that her brain refused to disbelieve in it and went some way to produce positive throbs otherwise she had no excuse for shutting herself in her room vernon whitford would be sceptical headache or none colonel de craye must be thinking strangely of her she had not shown him any sign of illness his laughter and his talk sung about her and dispersed the fiction he was the very seawind for bracing unstrung nerves her ideas reverted to sir willoughby and at once they had no more cohesion than the foam on a torrentwater but soon she was undergoing a variation of sentiment her maid barclay brought her this pencilled line from her father factum est laetus est amantium irae etc that it was done that willoughby had put on an air of glad acquiescence and that her father assumed the existence of a lovers quarrel was wonderful to her at first sight simple the succeeding minute willoughby indeed must be tired of her glad of her going he would know that it was not to return she was grateful to him for perhaps hinting at the amantium irae though she rejected the folly of the verse and she gazed over dear homely country through her windows now happy the lady of the place if happy she can be in her choice clara middleton envied her the doubleblossom wild cherrytree nothing else one sprig of it if it had not faded and gone to dustcolour like crusty alpine snow in the lower hollows and then she could depart bearing away a memory of the best here her fiction of the headache pained her no longer she changed her muslin dress for silk she was contented with the first bonnet barclay presented amicable toward every one in the house willoughby included she threw up her window breathed blessed mankind and she thought if willoughby would open his heart to nature he would be relieved of his wretched opinion of the world nature was then sparkling refreshed in the last drops of a sweeping raincurtain favourably disposed for a background to her joyful optimism a little nibble of hunger within real hunger unknown to her of late added to this healthy view without precipitating her to appease it she was more inclined to foster it for the sake of the sinewy activity of mind and limb it gave her and in the style of young ladies very light of heart she went downstairs like a cascade and like the meteor observed in its vanishing trace she alighted close to colonel de craye and entered one of the rooms off the hall he cocked an eye at the halfshut door now you have only to be reminded that it is the habit of the sportive gentleman of easy life bewildered as he would otherwise be by the tricks twists and windings of the hunted sex to parcel out fair women into classes and some are flyers and some are runners these birds are wild on the wing those exposed their bosoms to the shot for him there is no individual woman he grants her a characteristic only to enroll her in a class he is our immortal dunce at learning to distinguish her as a personal variety of a separate growth colonel de crayes cock of the eye at the door said that he had seen a rageing coquette go behind it he had his excuse for forming the judgement she had spoken strangely of the fall of his weddingpresent strangely of willoughby or there was a sound of strangeness in an allusion to her appointed husband and she had treated willoughby strangely when they met above all her word about flitch was curious and then that look of hers and subsequently she transferred her polite attentions to willoughbys friend after a charming colloquy the sweetest give and take rattle he had ever enjoyed with a girl she developed headache to avoid him and next she developed blindness for the same purpose he was feeling hurt but considered it preferable to feel challenged miss middleton came out of another door she had seen him when she had passed him and when it was too late to convey her recognition and now she addressed him with an air of having bowed as she went by no one she said am i alone in the house there is a figure naught said he but its as good as annihilated and no figure at all if you put yourself on the wrong side of it and wish to be alone in the house where is willoughby away on business riding achmet is the horse and pray dont let him be sold miss middleton i am deputed to attend on you i should like a stroll are you perfectly restored perfectly strong i was never better it was the answer of the ghost of the wicked old mans wife when she came to persuade him he had one chance remaining then says he ill believe in heaven if yell stop that bottle and hurls it and the bottle broke and he committed suicide not without suspicion of her laying a trap for him these showers curling away and leaving sweet scents are divine miss middleton i have the privilege of the christian name on the nuptialday this park of willoughbys is one of the best things in england theres a glimpse over the lake that smokes of a corner of killarney tempts the eye to dream i mean de craye wound his finger spirally upward like a smokewreath are you for irish scenery irish english scottish alls one so long as its beautiful yes you speak for me cosmopolitanism of races is a different affair i beg leave to doubt the true union of some irish and saxon for example let cupid be master of the ceremonies and the dwellingplace of the happy couple at the mouth of a cornucopia yet i have seen a flower of erin worn by a saxon gentleman proudly and the hibernian courting a rowena so well undo what i said and consider it cancelled are you of the rebel party colonel de craye i am protestant and conservative miss middleton i have not a head for politics the political heads i have seen would tempt me to that opinion did willoughby say when he would be back he named no particular time doctor middleton and mr whitford are in the library upon a battle of the books happy battle you are accustomed to scholars they are rather intolerant of us poor fellows of ignorance perhaps not of persons your father educated you himself i presume he gave me as much latin as i could take the fault is mine that it is little greek a little greek ah and you carry it like a feather because it is so light miss middleton i could sit down to be instructed old as i am when women beat us i verily believe we are the most beaten dogs in existence you like the theatre ours acting then good acting of course may i venture to say you would act admirably the venture is bold for i have never tried let me see there is miss dale and mr whitford you and i sufficient for a twoact piece the irishman in spain would do he bent to touch the grass as she stepped on it the lawn is wet she signified that she had no dread of wet and said english women afraid of the weather might as well be shut up de craye proceeded patrick oneill passes over from hibernia to iberia a disinherited son of a father in the claws of the lawyers with a letter of introduction to don beltran darragon a grandee of the first class who has a daughter dona seraphina miss middleton the proudest beauty of her day in the custody of a duenna miss dale and plighted to don fernan of the guzman family mr whitford there you have our dramatis personae you are patrick patrick himself and i lose my letter and i stand on the prado of madrid with the last portrait of britannia in the palm of my hand and crying in the purest brogue of my native land its all through dropping a letter im here in iberia instead of hibernia worse luck to the spelling but patrick will be sure to aspirate the initial letter of hibernia that is clever criticism upon my word miss middleton so he would and there we have two letters dropped but hed do it in a groan so that it wouldnt count for more than a ghost of one and everything goes on the stage since its only the laugh we want on the brink of the action besides you are to suppose the performance before a london audience who have a native opposite to the aspirate and wouldnt bear to hear him spoil a joke as if he were a lord or a constable its an instinct of the english democracy so with my bit of coin turning over and over in an undecided way whether it shall commit suicide to supply me a supper i behold a pair of spanish eyes like violet lightning in the black heavens of that favoured clime wont you have violet violet forbids my impersonation but the lustre on black is dark violet blue you remind me that i have no pretension to black colonel de craye permitted himself to take a flitting gaze at miss middletons eyes chestnut he said well and spain is the land of chestnuts then it follows that i am a daughter of spain clearly logically by positive deduction and do i behold patrick as one looks upon a beast of burden oh miss middletons exclamation was louder than the matter of the dialogue seemed to require she caught her hands up in the line of the outer extremity of the rhododendron screened from the house windows young crossjay lay at his length with his head resting on a doubled arm and his ivywreathed hat on his cheek just where she had left him commanding him to stay halfway toward him up the lawn she saw the poor boy and the spur of that pitiful sight set her gliding swiftly colonel de craye followed pulling an end of his moustache crossjay jumped to his feet my dear dear crossjay she addressed him and reproached him and how hungry you must be and you must be drenched this is really too had you told me to wait here said crossjay in shy selfdefence i did and you should not have done it foolish boy i told him to wait for me here before luncheon colonel de craye and the foolish foolish boyhe has had nothing to eat and he must have been wet through two or three timesbecause i did not come to him quite right and the lava might overflow him and take the mould of him like the sentinel at pompeii if hes of the true stuff he may have caught cold he may have a fever he was under your orders to stay i know and i cannot forgive myself run in crossjay and change your clothes oh run run to mrs montague and get her to give you a warm bath and tell her from me to prepare some dinner for you and change every garment you have this is unpardonable of me i saidnot for politicsi begin to think i have not a head for anything but could it be imagined that crossjay would not move for the dinnerbell through all that rain i forgot you crossjay i am so sorry so sorry you shall make me pay any forfeit you like remember i am deep deep in your debt and now let me see you run fast you shall come in to dessert this evening crossjay did not run he touched her hand you said something what did i say crossjay you promised what did i promise something name it my dear boy he mumbled kiss me clara plumped down on him enveloped him and kissed him the affectionately remorseful impulse was too quick for a conventional note of admonition to arrest her from paying that portion of her debt when she had sped him off to mrs montague she was in a blush dear dear crossjay she said sighing yes hes a good lad remarked the colonel the fellow may well be a faithful soldier and stick to his post if he receives promise of such a solde he is a great favourite with you he is you will do him a service by persuading willoughby to send him to one of those men who get boys through their naval examination and colonel de craye will you be kind enough to ask at the dinnertable that crossjay may come in to dessert certainly said he wondering and will you look after him while you are here see that no one spoils him if you could get him away before you leave it would be much to his advantage he is born for the navy and should be preparing to enter it now certainly certainly said de craye wondering more i thank you in advance shall i not be usurping no we leave tomorrow for a day for longer two it will be longer a week i shall not see you again i fear not colonel de craye controlled his astonishment he smothered a sensation of veritable pain and amiably said i feel a blow but i am sure you would not willingly strike we are all involved in the regrets miss middleton spoke of having to see mrs montague the housekeeper with reference to the bath for crossjay and stepped off the grass he bowed watched her a moment and for parallel reasons running close enough to hit one mark he commiserated his friend willoughby the winning or the losing of that young lady struck him as equally lamentable for willoughby chapter xx an aged and a great wine the leisurely promenade up and down the lawn with ladies and deferential gentlemen in anticipation of the dinnerbell was dr middletons evening pleasure he walked as one who had formerly danced in apollos time and the young god cupids elastic on the muscles of the calf and foot bearing his broad irongrey head in grand elevation the hard labour of the day approved the cooling exercise and the crowning refreshments of french cookery and wines of known vintages he was happy at that hour in dispensing wisdom or nugae to his hearers like the western sun whose habit it is when he is fairly treated to break out in quiet splendours which by no means exhaust his treasury blessed indeed above his fellows by the height of the bowwinged bird in a fair weather sunset sky above the pecking sparrow is he that ever in the recurrent evening of his day sees the best of it ahead and soon to come he has the rich reward of a youth and manhood of virtuous living dr middleton misdoubted the future as well as the past of the man who did not in becoming gravity exult to dine that man he deemed unfit for this world and the next an example of the good fruit of temperance he had a comfortable pride in his digestion and his political sentiments were attuned by his veneration of the powers rewarding virtue we must have a stable world where this is to be done the rev doctor was a fine old picture a specimen of art peculiarly english combining in himself piety and epicurism learning and gentlemanliness with good room for each and a seat at one anothers table for the rest a strong man an athlete in his youth a keen reader of facts and no reader of persons genial a giant at a task a steady worker besides but easily discomposed he loved his daughter and he feared her however much he liked her character the dread of her sex and age was constantly present to warn him that he was not tied to perfect sanity while the damsel clara remained unmarried her mother had been an amiable woman of the poetical temperament nevertheless too enthusiastic imaginative impulsive for the repose of a sober scholar an admirable woman still as you see a woman a firework the girl resembled her why should she wish to run away from patterne hall for a single hour simply because she was of the sex born mutable and explosive a husband was her proper custodian justly relieving a father with demagogues abroad and daughters at home philosophy is needed for us to keep erect let the girl be ciceros tullia well she dies the choicest of them will furnish us examples of a strange perversity miss dale was beside dr middleton clara came to them and took the other side i was telling miss dale that the signal for your subjection is my enfranchisement he said to her sighing and smiling we know the date the date of an event to come certifies to it as a fact to be counted on are you anxious to lose me clara faltered my dear you have planted me on a field where i am to expect the trumpet and when it blows i shall be quit of my nerves no more clara found nothing to seize on for a reply in these words she thought upon the silence of laetitia sir willoughby advanced appearing in a cordial mood i need not ask you whether you are better he said to clara sparkled to laetitia and raised a key to the level of dr middletons breast remarking i am going down to my inner cellar an inner cellar exclaimed the doctor sacred from the butler it is interdicted to stoneman shall i offer myself as guide to you my cellars are worth a visit cellars are not catacombs they are if rightly constructed rightly considered cloisters where the bottle meditates on joys to bestow not on dust misused have you anything great a wine aged ninety is it associated with your pedigree that you pronounce the age with such assurance my grandfather inherited it your grandfather sir willoughby had meritorious offspring not to speak of generous progenitors what would have happened had it fallen into the female line i shall be glad to accompany you port hermitage port ah we are in england there will just be time said sir willoughby inducing dr middleton to step out a chirrup was in the reverend doctors tone hocks too have compassed age i have tasted senior hocks their flavours are as a brook of many voices they have depth also senatorial port we say we cannot say that of any other wine port is deepsea deep it is in its flavour deep mark the difference it is like a classic tragedy organic in conception an ancient hermitage has the light of the antique the merit that it can grow to an extreme old age a merit neither of hermitage nor of hock can you say that it is the blood of those long years retaining the strength of youth with the wisdom of age to port for that port is our noblest legacy observe i do not compare the wines i distinguish the qualities let them live together for our enrichment they are not rivals like the idaean three were they rivals a fourth would challenge them burgundy has great genius it does wonders within its period it does all except to keep up in the race it is shortlived an aged burgundy runs with a beardless port i cherish the fancy that port speaks the sentences of wisdom burgundy sings the inspired ode or put it that port is the homeric hexameter burgundy the pindaric dithyramb what do you say the comparison is excellent sir the distinction you would remark pindar astounds but his elder brings us the more sustaining cup one is a fountain of prodigious ascent one is the unsounded purple sea of marching billows a very fine distinction i conceive you to be now commending the similes they pertain to the time of the first critics of those poets touch the greeks and you can nothing new all has been said graiis praeter laudem nullius avaris genius dedicated to fame is immortal we sir dedicate genius to the cloacaline floods we do not address the unforgetting gods but the popular stomach sir willoughby was patient he was about as accordantly coupled with dr middleton in discourse as a drum duetting with a bassviol and when he struck in he received correction from the paedagogueinstrument if he thumped affirmative or negative he was wrong however he knew scholars to be an unmannered species and the doctors learnedness would be a subject to dilate on in the cellar it was the turn for the drum dr middleton was tonguetied there sir willoughby gave the history of his wine in heads of chapters whence it came to the family originally and how it had come down to him in the quantity to be seen curiously my grandfather who inherited it was a waterdrinker my father died early indeed dear me the doctor ejaculated in astonishment and condolence the former glanced at the contrariety of man the latter embraced his melancholy destiny he was impressed with respect for the family this cool vaulted cellar and the central square block or enceinte where the thick darkness was not penetrated by the intruding lamp but rather took it as an eye bore witness to forethoughtful practical solidity in the man who had built the house on such foundations a house having a great wine stored below lives in our imaginations as a joyful house fast and splendidly rooted in the soil and imagination has a place for the heir of the house his grandfather a waterdrinker his father dying early present circumstances to us arguing predestination to an illustrious heirship and career dr middletons musings were coloured by the friendly vision of glasses of the great wine his mind was festive it pleased him and he chose to indulge in his whimsical robustious grandioseairy style of thinking from which the festive mind will sometimes take a certain print that we cannot obliterate immediately expectation is grateful you know in the mood of gratitude we are waxen and he was a selfhumouring gentleman he liked sir willoughbys tone in ordering the servant at his heels to take up those two bottles it prescribed without overdoing it a proper amount of caution and it named an agreeable number watching the mans hand keenly he said but here is the misfortune of a thing superexcellentnot more than one in twenty will do it justice sir willoughby replied very true sir and i think we may pass over the nineteen women for example and most men this wine would be a scaled book to them i believe it would it would be a grievous waste vernon is a claret man and so is horace de craye they are both below the mark of this wine they will join the ladies perhaps you and i sir might remain together with the utmost goodwill on my part i am anxious for your verdict sir you shall have it sir and not out of harmony with the chorus preceding me i can predict cool not frigid dr middleton summed the attributes of the cellar on quitting it north side and south no musty damp a pure air everything requisite one might lie down ones self and keep sweet here of all our venerable british of the two isles professing a suckling attachment to an ancient portwine lawyer doctor squire rosy admiral city merchant the classic scholar is he whose blood is most nuptial to the webbed bottle the reason must be that he is full of the old poets he has their spirit to sing with and the best that time has done on earth to feed it he may also perceive a resemblance in the wine to the studious mind which is the obverse of our mortality and throws off acids and crusty particles in the piling of the years until it is fulgent by clarity port hymns to his conservatism it is magical at one sip he is off swimming in the purple flood of the everyouthful antique by comparison then the enjoyment of others is brutish they have not the soul for it but he is worthy of the wine as are poets of beauty in truth these should be severally apportioned to them scholar and poet as his own good thing let it be so meanwhile dr middleton sipped after the departure of the ladies sir willoughby had practised a studied curtness upon vernon and horace you drink claret he remarked to them passing it round port i think doctor middleton the wine before you may serve for a preface we shall have your wine in five minutes the claret jug empty sir willoughby offered to send for more de craye was languid over the question vernon rose from the table we have a bottle of doctor middletons port coming in willoughby said to him mine you call it cried the doctor its a royal wine that wont suffer sharing said vernon well be with you if you go into the billiardroom vernon i shall hurry my drinking of good wine for no man said the rev doctor horace im beneath it ephemeral willoughby i am going to the ladies vernon and de craye retired upon the arrival of the wine and dr middleton sipped he sipped and looked at the owner of it some thirty dozen he said fifty the doctor nodded humbly i shall remember sir his host addressed him whenever i have the honour of entertaining you i am cellarer of that wine the rev doctor set down his glass you have sir in some sense an enviable post it is a responsible one if that be a blessing on you it devolves to retard the day of the last dozen your opinion of the wine is favourable sir i will say thisshallow souls run to rhapsodyi will say that i am consoled for not having lived ninety years back or at any period but the present by this one glass of your ancestral wine i am careful of it sir willoughby said modestly still its natural destination is to those who can appreciate it you do sir still my good friend still it is a charge it is a possession but part in trusteeship though we cannot declare it an entailed estate our consciences are in some sort pledged that it shall be a succession not too considerably diminished you will not object to drink it sir to the health of your grandchildren and may you live to toast them in it on their marriageday you colour the idea of a prolonged existence in seductive hues ha it is a wine for tithonus this wine would speed him to the rosy morningaha i will undertake to sit you through it up to morning said sir willoughby innocent of the bacchic nuptiality of the allusion dr middleton eyed the decanter there is a grief in gladness for a premonition of our mortal state the amount of wine in the decanter did not promise to sustain the starry roof of night and greet the dawn old wine my friend denies us the full bottle another bottle is to follow no it is ordered i protest it is uncorked i entreat it is decanted i submit but mark it must be honest partnership you are my worthy host sir on that stipulation note the superiority of wine over venusi may say the magnanimity of wine our jealousy turns on him that will not share but the corks willoughby the corks excite my amazement the corking is examined at regular intervals i remember the occurrence in my fathers time i have seen to it once it must be perilous as an operation for tracheotomy which i should assume it to resemble in surgical skill and firmness of hand not to mention the imminent gasp of the patient a fresh decanter was placed before the doctor he said i have but a girl to give he was melted sir willoughby replied i take her for the highest prize this world affords i have beaten some small stock of latin into her head and a note of greek she contains a savour of the classics i hoped once but she is a girl the nymph of the woods is in her still she will bring you her flowercup of hippocrene she has that aristocracythe noblest she is fair a beauty some have said who judge not by lines fair to me willoughby she is my sky there were applicants in italy she was besought of me she has no history you are the first heading of the chapter with you she will have her one tale as it should be mulier tum bene olet you know most fragrant she that smells of naught she goes to you from me from me alone from her father to her husband ut flos in septis secretus nascitur hortis he murmured on the lines to sic virgo dum i shall feel the parting she goes to one who will have my pride in her and more i will add who will be envied mr whitford must write you a carmen nuptiale the heart of the unfortunate gentleman listening to dr middleton set in for irregular leaps his offended temper broke away from the image of clara revealing her as he had seen her in the morning beside horace de craye distressingly sweet sweet with the breezy radiance of an english softbreathing day sweet with sharpness of young sap her eyes her lips her fluttering dress that played happy mother across her bosom giving peeps of the veiled twins and her laughter her slim figure peerless carriage all her terrible sweetness touched his wound to the smarting quick her wish to be free of him was his anguish in his pain he thought sincerely when the pain was easier he muffled himself in the idea of her jealousy of laetitia dale and deemed the wish a fiction but she had expressed it that was the wound he sought to comfort for the double reason that he could love her better after punishing her and that to meditate on doing so masked the fear of losing herthe dread abyss she had succeeded in forcing his nature to shudder at as a giddy edge possibly near in spite of his arts of selfdefence what i shall do tomorrow evening he exclaimed i do not care to fling a bottle to colonel de craye and vernon i cannot open one for myself to sit with the ladies will be sitting in the cold for me when do you bring me back my bride sir my dear willoughby the rev doctor puffed composed himself and sipped the expedition is an absurdity i am unable to see the aim of it she had a headache vapours they are over and she will show a return of good sense i have ever maintained that nonsense is not to be encouraged in girls i can put my foot on it my arrangements are for staying here a further ten days in the terms of your hospitable invitation and i stay i applaud your resolution sir will you prove firm i am never false to my engagement willoughby not under pressure under no pressure persuasion i should have said certainly not the weakness is in the yielding either to persuasion or to pressure the latter brings weight to bear on us the former blows at our want of it you gratify me doctor middleton and relieve me i cordially dislike a breach in good habits willoughby but i do rememberwas i wronginforming clara that you appeared lighthearted in regard to a departure or gap in a visit that was not i must confess to my liking simply my dear doctor your pleasure was my pleasure but make my pleasure yours and you remain to crack many a bottle with your soninlaw excellently said you have a courtly speech willoughby i can imagine you to conduct a lovers quarrel with a politeness to read a lesson to wellbred damsels aha spare me the futility of the quarrel alls well clara replied sir willoughby in dramatic epigram is perfection i rejoice the rev doctor responded taught thus to understand that the lovers quarrel between his daughter and his host was at an end he left the table a little after eleven oclock a short dialogue ensued upon the subject of the ladies they must have gone to bed why yes of course they must it is good that they should go to bed early to preserve their complexions for us ladies are creations glory but they are anticlimax following a wine of a century old they are anticlimax recoil crosscurrent morally they are repentance penance imagerially the frozen north on the young brown buds bursting to green what know they of a critic in the palate and a frame all revelry and mark you revelry in sobriety containment in exultation classic revelry can they dear though they be to us light up candelabras in the brain to illuminate all history and solve the secret of the destiny of man they cannot they cannot sympathize with them that can so therefore this division is between us yet are we not turbaned orientals nor are they inmates of the harem we are not moslem be assured of it in the contemplation of the tables decanter dr middleton said then i go straight to bed i will conduct you to your door sir said his host the piano was heard dr middleton laid his hand on the banisters and remarked the ladies must have gone to bed vernon came out of the library and was hailed fellowstudent he waved a goodnight to the doctor and said to willoughby the ladies are in the drawingroom i am on my way upstairs was the reply solitude and sleep after such a wine as that and forefend us human society the doctor shouted but willoughby sir one tomorrow you dispose of the cellar sir i am fitter to drive the horses of the sun i would rigidly counsel one and no more we have made a breach in the fiftieth dozen daily one will preserve us from having to name the fortieth quite so unseasonably the couple of bottles per diem prognosticates disintegration with its accompanying recklessness constitutionally let me add i bear three i speak for posterity during dr middletons allocution the ladies issued from the drawingroom clara foremost for she had heard her fathers voice and desired to ask him this in reference to their departure papa will you tell me the hour tomorrow she ran up the stairs to kiss him saying again when will you be ready tomorrow morning dr middleton announced a stoutly deliberative mind in the buglenotes of a repeated ahem he bethought him of replying in his doctorial tongue claras eager face admonished him to brevity it began to look starved intruding on his vision of the houris couched in the inner cellar to be the reward of valiant men it annoyed him his brows joined he said i shall not be ready tomorrow morning in the afternoon nor in the afternoon when my dear i am ready for bed at this moment and know of no other readiness ladies he bowed to the group in the hall below him may fair dreams pay court to you this night sir willoughby had hastily descended and shaken the hands of the ladies directed horace de craye to the laboratory for a smokingroom and returned to dr middleton vexed by the scene uncertain of his temper if he stayed with clara for whom he had arranged that her disappointment should take place on the morrow in his absence he said goodnight goodnight to her with due fervour bending over her flaccid fingertips then offered his arm to the rev doctor ay son willoughby in friendliness if you will though i am a man to bear my load the father of the stupefied girl addressed him candles i believe are on the first landing goodnight my love clara papa goodnight oh she lifted her breast with the interjection standing in shame of the curtained conspiracy and herself good night her father wound up the stairs she stepped down there was an understanding that papa and i should go to london tomorrow early she said unconcernedly to the ladies and her voice was clear but her face too legible de craye was heartily unhappy at the sight chapter xxi claras meditations two were sleepless that night miss middleton and colonel de craye she was in a fever lying like stone with her brain burning quick natures run out to calamity in any little shadow of it flung before terrors of apprehension drive them they stop not short of the uttermost when they are on the wings of dread a frown means tempest a wind wreck to see fire is to be seized by it when it is the approach of their loathing that they fear they are in the tragedy of the embrace at a breath and then is the wrestle between themselves and horror between themselves and evil which promises aid themselves and weakness which calls on evil themselves and the better part of them which whispers no beguilement the false course she had taken through sophistical cowardice appalled the girl she was lost the advantage taken of it by willoughby put on the form of strength and made her feel abject reptilious she was lost carried away on the flood of the cataract he had won her father for an ally strangely she knew not how he had succeeded in swaying her father who had previously not more than tolerated him son willoughby on her fathers lips meant something that scenes and scenes would have to struggle with to the outwearying of her father and herself she revolved the son willoughby through moods of stupefaction contempt revolt subjection it meant that she was vanquished it meant that her fathers esteem for her was forfeited she saw him a gigantic image of discomposure her recognition of her cowardly feebleness brought the brood of fatalism what was the right of so miserable a creature as she to excite disturbance let her fortunes be good or ill it would be quieter to float kinder to everybody thank heaven for the chances of a short life once in a net desperation is graceless we may be brutes in our earthly destinies in our endurance of them we need not be brutish she was now in the luxury of passivity when we throw our burden on the powers above and do not love them the need to love them drew her out of it that she might strive with the unbearable and by sheer striving even though she were graceless come to love them humbly it is here that the seed of good teaching supports a soul for the condition might be mapped and where kismet whispers us to shut eyes and instruction bids us look up is at a wellmarked crossroad of the contest quick of sensation but not courageously resolved she perceived how blunderingly she had acted for a punishment it seemed to her that she who had not known her mind must learn to conquer her nature and submit she had accepted willoughby therefore she accepted him the fact became a matter of the past past debating in the abstract this contemplation of circumstances went well a plain duty lay in her way and then a disembodied thought flew round her comparing her with vernon to her discredit he had for years borne much that was distasteful to him for the purpose of studying and with his poor income helping the poorer than himself she dwelt on him in pity and envy he had lived in this place and so must she and he had not been dishonoured by his modesty he had not failed of selfcontrol because he had a life within she was almost imagining she might imitate him when the clash of a sharp physical thought the difference the difference told her she was woman and never could submit can a woman have an inner life apart from him she is yoked to she tried to nestle deep away in herself in some corner where the abstract view had comforted her to flee from thinking as her feminine blood directed it was a vain effort the difference the cruel fate the defencelessness of women pursued her strung her to wild horses backs tossed her on savage wastes in her case duty was shame hence it could not be broadly duty that intolerable difference proscribed the word but the fire of a brain burning high and kindling everything lighted up herself against herselfwas one so volatile as she a person with a willwere they not a multitude of flitting wishes that she took for a will was she featherheaded that she was a person to make a stand on physical prideif she could yield her hand without reflection as she conceived she had done from incapacity to conceive herself doing it reflectively was she much better than purchaseable stuff that has nothing to say to the bargain furthermore said her incandescent reason she had not suspected such art of cunning in willoughby then might she not be deceived altogethermight she not have misread him stronger than she had fancied might he not be likewise more estimable the world was favourable to him he was prized by his friends she reviewed him it was all in one flash it was not much less intentionally favourable than the worlds review and that of his friends but beginning with the idea of them she recollectedheard willoughbys voice pronouncing his opinion of his friends and the world of vernon whitford and colonel de craye for example and of men and women an undefined agreement to have the same regard for him as his friends and the world had provided that he kept at the same distance from her was the termination of this phase occupying about a minute in time and reached through a series of intensely vivid pictureshis face at her petition to be released lowering behind them for a background and a comment i cannot i cannot she cried aloud and it struck her that her repulsion was a holy warning better be graceless than a loathing wife better appear inconsistent why should she not appear such as she was why we answer that question usually in angry reliance on certain superb qualities injured fine qualities of ours undiscovered by the world not much more than suspected by ourselves which are still our fortress where pride sits at home solitary and impervious as an octogenarian conservative but it is not possible to answer it so when the brain is rageing like a pinetorch and the devouring illumination leaves not a spot of our nature covert the aspect of her weakness was unrelieved and frightened her back to her loathing from her loathing as soon as her sensations had quickened to realize it she was hurled on her weakness she was graceless she was inconsistent she was volatile she was unprincipled she was worse than a prey to wickednesscapable of it she was only waiting to be misled nay the idea of being misled suffused her with languor for then the battle would be over and she a happy weed of the sea no longer suffering those tugs at the roots but leaving it to the sea to heave and contend she would be like constantia then like her in her fortunes never so brave she feared perhaps very like constantia in her fortunes poor troubled bodies waking up in the night to behold visually the spectre cast forth from the perplexed machinery inside them stare at it for a space till touching consciousness they dive down under the sheets with fishlike alacrity clara looked at her thought and suddenly headed downward in a crimson gulf she must have obtained absolution or else it was oblivion below soon after the plunge her first object of meditation was colonel de craye she thought of him calmly he seemed a refuge he was very nice he was a holiday character his lithe figure neat firm footing of the stag swift intelligent expression and his ready frolicsomeness pleasant humour cordial temper and his irishry whereon he was at liberty to play as on the emblem harp of the isle were soothing to think of the suspicion that she tricked herself with this calm observation of him was dismissed issuing out of torture her young nature eluded the irradiating brain in search of refreshment and she luxuriated at a feast in considering himshower on a parched land that he was he spread new air abroad she had no reason to suppose he was not a good man she could securely think of him besides he was bound by his prospective office in support of his friend willoughby to be quite harmless and besides you are not to expect logical sequences the showery refreshment in thinking of him lay in the sort of assurance it conveyed that the more she thought the less would he be likely to figure as an obnoxious officialthat is as the man to do by willoughby at the altar what her father would under the supposition be doing by her her mind reposed on colonel de craye his name was horace her father had worked with her at horace she knew most of the odes and some of the satires and epistles of the poet they reflected benevolent beams on the gentleman of the poets name he too was vivacious had fun common sense elegance loved rusticity he said sighed for a country life fancied retiring to canada to cultivate his own domain modus agri non ita magnus a delight and he too when in the country sighed for town there were strong features of resemblance he had hinted in fun at not being rich quae virtus et quanta sit vivere parvo but that quotation applied to and belonged to vernon whitford even so little disarranged her meditations she would have thought of vernon as her instinct of safety prompted had not his exactions been excessive he proposed to help her with advice only she was to do everything for herself do and dare everything decide upon everything he told her flatly that so would she learn to know her own mind and flatly that it was her penance she had gained nothing by breaking down and pouring herself out to him he would have her bring willoughby and her father face to face and be witness of their interviewherself the theme what alternative was thereobedience to the word she had pledged he talked of patience of selfexamination and patience but all of hershe was all marked urgent this house was a cage and the worldher brain was a cage until she could obtain her prospect of freedom as for the house she might leave it yonder was the dawn she went to her window to gaze at the first colour along the grey small satisfaction came of gazing at that or at herself she shunned glass and sky one and the other stamped her as a slave in a frame it seemed to her she had been so long in this place that she was fixed here it was her world and to imagine an alp was like seeking to get back to childhood unless a miracle intervened here she would have to pass her days men are so little chivalrous now that no miracle ever intervenes consequently she was doomed she took a pen and began a letter to a dear friend lucy darleton a promised bridesmaid bidding her countermand orders for her bridal dress and purposing a tour in switzerland she wrote of the mountain country with real abandonment to imagination it became a visioned loophole of escape she rose and clasped a shawl over her nightdress to ward off chillness and sitting to the table again could not produce a word the lines she had written were condemned they were ludicrously inefficient the letter was torn to pieces she stood very clearly doomed after a fall of tears upon looking at the scraps she dressed herself and sat by the window and watched the blackbird on the lawn as he hopped from shafts of dewy sunlight to the longstretched dewy treeshadows considering in her mind that dark dews are more meaningful than bright the beauty of the dews of woods more sweet than meadowdews it signified only that she was quieter she had gone through her crisis in the anticipation of it that is how quick natures will often be cold and hard or not much moved when the positive crisis arrives and why it is that they are prepared for astonishing leaps over the gradations which should render their conduct comprehensible to us if not excuseable she watched the blackbird throw up his head stiffly and peck to right and left dangling the worm on each side his orange beak specklebreasted thrushes were at work and a wagtail that ran as with claras own rapid little steps thrush and blackbird flew to the nest they had wings the lovely morning breathed of sweet earth into her open window and made it painful in the dense twitter chirp cheep and song of the air to resist the innocent intoxication o to love was not said by her but if she had sung as her nature prompted it would have been her war with willoughby sprang of a desire to love repelled by distaste her cry for freedom was a cry to be free to love she discovered it half shuddering to love oh nono shape of man nor impalpable nature either but to love unselfishness and helpfulness and planted strength in something then loving and being loved a little what strength would be hers she could utter all the words needed to willoughby and to her father locked in her love walking in this world living in that previously she had cried despairing if i were loved jealousy of constantias happiness envy of her escape ruled her then and she remembered the cry though not perfectly her plainspeaking to herself she chose to think she had meant if willoughby were capable of truly loving for now the fire of her brain had sunk and refuges and subterfuges were round about it the thought of personal love was encouraged she chose to think for the sake of the strength it lent her to carve her way to freedom she had just before felt rather the reverse but she could not exist with that feeling and it was true that freedom was not so indistinct in her fancy as the idea of love were men when they were known like him she knew too well the archtempters question to her was there she put it away wherever she turned it stood observing her she knew so much of one man nothing of the rest naturally she was curious vernon might be sworn to be unlike but he was exceptional what of the other in the house maidens are commonly reduced to read the masters of their destinies by their instincts and when these have been edged by overactivity they must hoodwink their maidenliness to suffer themselves to read and then they must dupe their minds else men would soon see they were gifted to discern total ignorance being their pledge of purity to men they have to expunge the writing of their perceptives on the tablets of the brain they have to know not when they do know the instinct of seeking to know crossed by the task of blotting knowledge out creates that conflict of the natural with the artificial creature to which their ultimately revealed doubleface complained of by everdissatisfied men is owing wonder in no degree that they indulge a craving to be fools or that many of them act the character jeer at them as little for not showing growth you have reared them to this pitch and at this pitch they have partly civilized you supposing you to want it done wholly you must yield just as many points in your requisitions as are needed to let the wits of young women reap their due harvest and be of good use to their souls you will then have a fair battle a braver with better results claras inner eye traversed colonel de craye at a shot she had immediately to blot out the vision of captain oxford in him the revelation of his laughing contempt for willoughby the view of mercurial principles the scribbled histories of light lovepassages she blotted it out kept it from her mind so she knew him knew him to be a sweeter and a variable willoughby a generous kind of willoughby a willoughbybutterfly without having the free mind to summarize him and picture him for a warning scattered features of him such as the instincts call up were not sufficiently impressive besides the clouded mind was opposed to her receiving impressions young crossjays voice in the still morning air came to her cars the dear guileless chatter of the boys voice why assuredly it was young crossjay who was the man she loved and he loved her and he was going to be an unselfish sustaining true strong man the man she longed for for anchorage oh the dear voice woodpecker and thrush in one he never ceased to chatter to vernon whitford walking beside him with a swinging stride off to the lake for their morning swim happy couple the morning gave them both a freshness and innocence above human they seemed to clara made of morning air and clear lake water crossjays voice ran up and down a diatonic scale with here and there a query in semitone and a laugh on a ringing note she wondered what he could have to talk of so incessantly and imagined all the dialogue he prattled of his yesterday today and tomorrow which did not imply past and future but his vivid present she felt like one vainly trying to fly in hearing him she felt old the consolation she arrived at was to feel maternal she wished to hug the boy trot and stride crossjay and vernon entered the park careless about wet grass not once looking at the house crossjay ranged ahead and picked flowers bounding back to show them claras heart beat at a fancy that her name was mentioned if those flowers were for her she would prize them the two bathers dipped over an undulation her loss of them rattled her chains deeply dwelling on their troubles has the effect upon the young of helping to forgetfulness for they cannot think without imagining their imaginations are saturated with their pleasures and the collision though they are unable to exchange sad for sweet distills an opiate am i solemnly engaged she asked herself she seemed to be awakening she glanced at her bed where she had passed the night of ineffectual moaning and out on the high wave of grass where crossjay and his good friend had vanished was the struggle all to be gone over again little by little her intelligence of her actual position crept up to submerge her heart i am in his house she said it resembled a discovery so strangely had her opiate and power of dreaming wrought through her tortures she said it gasping she was in his house his guest his betrothed sworn to him the fact stood out cut in steel on the pitiless daylight that consideration drove her to be an early wanderer in the wake of crossjay her station was among the beeches on the flank of the boys return and while waiting there the novelty of her waiting to waylay anyoneshe who had played the contrary parttold her more than it pleased her to think yet she could admit that she did desire to speak with vernon as with a counsellor harsh and curt but wholesome the bathers reappeared on the grassridge racing and flapping wet towels some one hailed them a sound of the galloping hoof drew her attention to the avenue she saw willoughby dash across the park level and dropping a word to vernon ride away then she allowed herself to be seen crossjay shouted willoughby turned his head but not his horses head the boy sprang up to clara he had swum across the lake and back he had raced mr whitfordand beaten him how he wished miss middleton had been able to be one of them clara listened to him enviously her thought was we women are nailed to our sex she said and you have just been talking to sir willoughby crossjay drew himself up to give an imitation of the baronets handmoving in adieu he would not have done that had he not smelled sympathy with the performance she declined to smile crossjay repeated it and laughed he made a broader exhibition of it to vernon approaching i say mr whitford whos this vernon doubled to catch him crossjay fled and resumed his magnificent air in the distance goodmorning miss middleton you are out early said vernon rather pale and stringy from his cold swim and rather hardeyed with the sharp exercise following it she had expected some of the kindness she wanted to reject for he could speak very kindly and she regarded him as her doctor of medicine who would at least present the futile drug good morning she replied willoughby will not be home till the evening you could not have had a finer morning for your bath no i will walk as fast as you like im perfectly warm but you prefer fast walking out ah yes that i understand the walk back why is willoughby away today he has business after several steps she said he makes very sure of papa not without reason you will find said vernon can it be i am bewildered i had papas promise to leave the hall for a day or two it would have been possibly but other heads are at work as well as yours if you had been in earnest about it you would have taken your father into your confidence at once that was the course i ventured to propose on the supposition in earnest i cannot imagine that you doubt it i wished to spare him this is a case in which he cant be spared if i had been bound to any other i did not know then who held me a prisoner i thought i had only to speak to him sincerely not many men would give up their prize for a word willoughby the last of any prize rang through her thrillingly from vernons mouth and soothed her degradation she would have liked to protest that she was very little of a prize a poor prize not one at all in general estimation only one to a man reckoning his property no prize in the true sense the importunity of pain saved her does he think i can change again am i treated as something won in a lottery to stay here is indeed more than i can bear and if he is calculatingmr whitford if he calculates on another change his plotting to keep me here is inconsiderate not very wise changes may occur in absence wise or not he has the right to scheme his best to keep you she looked on vernon with a shade of wondering reproach why what right the right you admit when you ask him to release you he has the right to think you deluded and to think you may come to a better mood if you remaina mood more agreeable to him i mean he has that right absolutely you are bound to remember also that you stand in the wrong you confess it when you appeal to his generosity and every man has the right to retain a treasure in his hand if he can look straight at these facts you expect me to be all reason try to be its the way to learn whether you are really in earnest i will try it will drive me to worse try honestly what is wisest now is in my opinion for you to resolve to stay i speak in the character of the person you sketched for yourself as requiring well then a friend repeats the same advice you might have gone with your father now you will only disturb him and annoy him the chances are he will refuse to go are women ever so changeable as men then papa consented he agreed he had some of my feeling i saw it that was yesterday and at night he spoke to each of us at night in a different tone from usual with me he was hardly affectionate but when you advise me to stay mr whitford you do not perhaps reflect that it would be at the sacrifice of all candour regard it as a probational term it has gone too far with me take the matter into the head try the case there are you not counselling me as if i were a woman of intellect the crystal ring in her voice told him that tears were near to flowing he shuddered slightly you have intellect he said nodded and crossed the lawn leaving her he had to dress she was not permitted to feel lonely for she was immediately joined by colonel de craye chapter xxii the ride crossjay darted up to her a nose ahead of the colonel i say miss middleton were to have the whole day to ourselves after morning lessons will you come and fish with me and see me birdsnest not for the satisfaction of beholding another cracked crown my son the colonel interposed and bowing to clara miss middleton is handed over to my exclusive charge for the day with her consent i scarcely know said she consulting a sensation of languor that seemed to contain some reminiscence if i am here my fathers plans are uncertain i will speak to him if i am here perhaps crossjay would like a ride in the afternoon oh yes cried the boy out over bournden through mewsey up to closharn beacon and down on aspenwell where theres a common for racing and ford the stream an inducement for you de craye said to her she smiled and squeezed the boys hand we wont go without you crossjay you dont carry a comb my man when you bathe at this remark of the colonels young crossjay conceived the appearance of his matted locks in the eyes of his adorable lady he gave her one dear look through his redness and fled i like that boy said de craye i love him said clara crossjays troubled eyelids in his honest young face became a picture for her after all miss middleton willoughbys notions about him are not so bad if we consider that you will be in the place of a mother to him i think them bad you are disinclined to calculate the good fortune of the boy in having more of you on land than he would have in crown and anchor buttons you have talked of him with willoughby we had a talk last night of how much thought she willoughby returns she said he dines here i know for he holds the key of the inner cellar and doctor middleton does him the honour to applaud his wine willoughby was good enough to tell me that he thought i might contribute to amuse you she was brooding in stupefaction on her father and the wine as she requested colonel de craye to persuade willoughby to take the general view of crossjays future and act on it he seems fond of the boy too said de craye musingly you speak in doubt not at all but is he notmen are queer fishmake allowance for usa trifle tyrannical pleasantly with those he is fond of if they look right and left it was meant for an interrogation it was not with the sound of one that the words dropped my dear crossjay she sighed i would willingly pay for him out of my own purse and i will do so rather than have him miss his chance i have not mustered resolution to propose it i may be mistaken miss middleton he talked of the boys fondness of him he would i suppose he is hardly peculiar in liking to play polestar he may not be for the rest your influence should be allpowerful it is not de craye looked with a wandering eye at the heavens we are having a spell of weather perfectly superb and the odd thing is that whenever we have splendid weather at home were all for rushing abroad im booked for a mediterranean cruisepostponed to give place to your ceremony that she could not control her accent what worthier she was guilty of a pause de craye saved it from an awkward length i have written half an essay on honeymoons miss middleton is that the same as a halfwritten essay colonel de craye just the same with the difference that its a whole essay written all on one side on which side the bachelors why does he trouble himself with such topics to warm himself for being left out in the cold does he feel envy he has to confess it he has liberty a commodity he cant tell the value of if theres no one to buy why should he wish to sell hes bent on completing his essay to make the reading dull there we touch the key of the subject for what is to rescue the pair from a monotony multiplied by two and so a bachelors recommendation when each has discovered the right sort of person to be dull with pushes them from the churchdoor on a round of adventures containing a spice of peril if tis to be had let them be in danger of their lives the first or second day a bachelors loneliness is a private affair of his own he hasnt to look into a face to be ashamed of feeling it and inflicting it at the same time tis his pillow he can punch it an he pleases and turn it over tother side if hes for a mighty variation theres a dream in it but our poor couple are staring wide awake all their dreamings done theyve emptied their bottle of elixir or broken it and she has a thirst for the use of the tongue and he to yawn with a crony and they may converse theyre not aware of it more than the desert that has drunk a shower so as soon as possible shes away to the ladies and he puts on his club thats what your bachelor sees and would like to spare them and if he didnt see something of the sort hed be off with a noose round his neck on his knees in the dew to the morning milkmaid the bachelor is happily warned and on his guard said clara diverted as he wished her to be sketch me a few of the adventures you propose i have a friend who rowed his bride from the houses of parliament up the thames to the severn on into north wales they shot some pretty weirs and rapids that was nice they had an infinity of adventures and the best proof of the benefit they derived is that they forgot everything about them except that the adventures occurred those two must have returned bright enough to please you they returned and shone like a wreckers beacon to the mariner you see miss middleton there was the landscape and the exercise and the occasional bit of danger i think its to be recommended the scene is always changing and not too fast and tis not too sublime like big mountains to tire them of their everlasting big ohs theres the difference between going into a howling wind and launching among zephyrs they have fresh air and movement and not in a railway carriage they can take in what they look on and she has the steering ropes and thats a wise commencement and my lord is all day making an exhibition of his manly strength bowing before her some sixty to the minute and she to help him just inclines when shes in the mood and theyre face to face in the nature of things and are not under the obligation of looking the unutterable because you see theres business in hand and the boats just the right sort of third party who never interferes but must be attended to and they feel theyre labouring together to get along all in the proper proportion and whether he has to labour in life or not he proves his ability what do you think of it miss middleton i think you have only to propose it colonel de craye and if they capsize why tis a natural ducking you forgot the ladys dressingbag the stain on the metal for a constant reminder of his prowess in saving it well and theres an alternative to that scheme and a finerthis then they read dramatic pieces during courtship to stop the saying of things over again till the drum of the car becomes nothing but a drum to the poor head and a little before they affix their signatures to the fatal registrybook of the vestry they enter into an engagement with a body of provincial actors to join the troop on the day of their nuptials and away they go in their coach and four and she is lady kitty caper for a month and he sir harry highflyer see the honeymoon spinning the marvel to me is that none of the young couples do it they could enjoy the world see life amuse the company and come back fresh to their own characters instead of giving themselves a dose of africa without a savage to diversify it an impression they never get over im told many a character of the happiest auspices has irreparable mischief done it by the ordinary honeymoon for my part i rather lean to the second plan of campaign clara was expected to reply and she said probably because you are fond of acting it would require capacity on both sides miss middleton i would undertake to breathe the enthusiasm for the stage and the adventure you are recommending it generally let my gentleman only have a fund of enthusiasm the lady will kindle she always does at a spark if he has not any then im afraid they must be mortally dull she allowed her silence to speak she knew that it did so too eloquently and could not control the personal adumbration she gave to the one point of light revealed in if he has not any her figure seemed immediately to wear a cap and cloak of dulness she was full of revolt and anger she was burning with her situation if sensible of shame now at anything that she did it turned to wrath and threw the burden on the author of her desperate distress the hour for blaming herself had gone by to be renewed ultimately perhaps in a season of freedom she was bereft of her insight within at present so blind to herself that while conscious of an accurate reading of willoughbys friend she thanked him in her heart for seeking simply to amuse her and slightly succeeding the afternoons ride with him and crossjay was an agreeable beguilement to her in prospect laetitia came to divide her from colonel de craye dr middleton was not seen before his appearance at the breakfasttable where a certain air of anxiety in his daughters presence produced the semblance of a raised map at intervals on his forehead few sights on earth are more deserving of our sympathy than a good man who has a troubled conscience thrust on him the rev doctors perturbation was observed the ladies eleanor and isabel seeing his daughter to be the cause of it blamed her and would have assisted him to escape but miss dale whom he courted with that object was of the opposite faction she made way for clara to lead her father out he called to vernon who merely nodded while leaving the room by the window with crossjay half an eye on dr middletons pathetic exit in captivity sufficed to tell colonel de craye that parties divided the house at first he thought how deplorable it would be to lose miss middleton for two days or three and it struck him that vernon whitford and laetitia dale were acting oddly in seconding her their aim not being discernible for he was of the order of gentlemen of the obscurelyclear in mind who have a predetermined acuteness in their watch upon the human play and mark men and women as pieces of a bad game of chess each pursuing an interested course his experience of a section of the world had educated himas gallant frank and manly a comrade as one could wish forup to this point but he soon abandoned speculations which may be compared to a shaking anemometer that will not let the troubled indicator take station reposing on his perceptions and his instincts he fixed his attention on the chief persons only glancing at the others to establish a postulate that where there are parties in a house the most bewitching person present is the origin of them it is ever helens achievement miss middleton appeared to him bewitching beyond mortal sunny in her laughter shadowy in her smiling a young lady shaped for perfect music with a lover she was that and no less to every mans eye on earth high breeding did not freeze her lovely girlishnessbut willoughby did this reflection intervened to blot luxurious picturings of her and made itself acceptable by leading him back to several instances of an evident want of harmony of the pair and now for purely undirected impulse all within us is not though we may be eyebandaged agents under direction it became necessary for an honourable gentleman to cast vehement rebukes at the fellow who did not comprehend the jewel he had won how could willoughby behave like so complete a donkey de craye knew him to be in his interior stiff strange exacting women had talked of him he had been too much for one womanthe dashing constantia he had worn one woman sacrificing far more for him than constantia to death still with such a prize as clara middleton willoughbys behaviour was past calculating in its contemptible absurdity and during courtship and courtship of that girl it was the way of a man ten years after marriage the idea drew him to picture her doatingly in her young matronly bloom ten years after marriage without a touch of age matronly wise womanly sweet perhaps with a couple of little ones to love never having known the love of a man to think of a girl like clara middleton never having at nineandtwenty and with two fair children known the love of a man or the loving of a man possibly became torture to the colonel for a pacification he had to reconsider that she was as yet only nineteen and unmarried but she was engaged and she was unloved one might swear to it that she was unloved and she was not a girl to be satisfied with a big house and a highnosed husband there was a rapid alteration of the sad history of clara the unloved matron solaced by two little ones a childless clara tragically loving and beloved flashed across the dark glass of the future either way her fate was cruel some astonishment moved de craye in the contemplation of the distance he had stepped in this morass of fancy he distinguished the choice open to him of forward or back and he selected forward but fancy was dead the poetry hovering about her grew invisible to him he stood in the morass that was all he knew and momently he plunged deeper and he was aware of an intense desire to see her face that he might study her features again he understood no more it was the clouding of the brain by the mans heart which had come to the knowledge that it was caught a certain measure of astonishment moved him still it had hitherto been his portion to do mischief to women and avoid the vengeance of the sex what was there in miss middletons face and air to ensnare a veteran handsome man of society numbering sixandthirty years nearly as many conquests each bullet has got its commission he was hit at last that accident effected by mr flitch had fired the shot clean through the heart does not tell us of our misfortune till the heart is asked to renew its natural beating it fell into the condition of the porcelain vase over a thought of miss middleton standing above his prostrate form on the road and walking beside him to the hall her words what have they been she had not uttered words she had shed meanings he did not for an instant conceive that he had charmed her the charm she had cast on him was too thrilling for coxcombry to lift a head still she had enjoyed his prattle in return for her touch upon the irish fountain in him he had manifestly given her relief and could not one see that so sprightly a girl would soon be deadened by a man like willoughby deadened she was she had not responded to a compliment on her approaching marriage an allusion to it killed her smiling the case of mr flitch with the half wager about his reinstation in the service of the hall was conclusive evidence of her opinion of willoughby it became again necessary that he should abuse willoughby for his folly why was the man worrying her in some way he was worrying her what if willoughby as well as miss middleton wished to be quit of the engagement for just a second the handsome womanflattered officer proved his mans heart more whole than he supposed it that great organ instead of leaping at the thought suffered a check bear in mind that his heart was not merely mans it was a conquerors he was of the race of amorous heroes who glory in pursuing overtaking subduing wresting the prize from a rival having her ripe from exquisitely feminine inward conflicts plucking her out of resistance in good old primitive fashion you win the creature in her delicious flutterings he liked her thus in cooler blood because of societys admiration of the capturer and somewhat because of the strife which always enhances the value of a prize and refreshes our vanity in recollection moreover he had been matched against willoughby the circumstance had occurred two or three times he could name a lady he had won a lady he had lost willoughbys large fortune and grandeur of style had given him advantages at the start but the start often means the racewith women and a bit of luck the gentle check upon the galloping heart of colonel de craye endured no longer than a seconda simple sideglance in a headlong pace claras enchantingness for a temperament like his which is to say for him specially in part through the testimony her conquest of himself presented as to her power of sway over the universal heart known as mans assured him she was worth winning even from a hand that dropped her he had now a double reason for exclaiming at the folly of willoughby willoughbys treatment of her showed either temper or weariness vanity and judgement led de craye to guess the former regarding her sentiments for willoughby he had come to his own conclusion the certainty of it caused him to assume that he possessed an absolute knowledge of her character she was an angel born supple she was a heavenly soul with half a dozen of the tricks of earth skittish filly was among his phrases but she had a bearing and a gaze that forbade the dip in the common gutter for wherewithal to paint the creature she was now then to see whether he was wrong for the first time in his life if not wrong he had a chance there could be nothing dishonourable in rescuing a girl from an engagement she detested an attempt to think it a service to willoughby faded midway de craye dismissed that chicanery it would be a service to willoughby in the end without question there was that to soothe his manly honour meanwhile he had to face the thought of willoughby as an antagonist and the world looking heavy on his honour as a friend such considerations drew him tenderly close to miss middleton it must however be confessed that the mental ardour of colonel de craye had been a little sobered by his glance at the possibility of both of the couple being of one mind on the subject of their betrothal desirable as it was that they should be united in disagreeing it reduced the romance to platitude and the third person in the drama to the appearance of a stick no man likes to play that part memoirs of the favourites of goddesses if we had them would confirm it of mens tastes in this respect though the divinest be the prize we behold what part they played de craye chanced to be crossing the hall from the laboratory to the stables when clara shut the librarydoor behind her he said something whimsical and did not stop nor did he look twice at the face he had been longing for what he had seen made him fear there would be no ride out with her that day their next meeting reassured him she was dressed in her ridinghabit and wore a countenance resolutely cheerful he gave himself the word of command to take his tone from her he was of a nature as quick as claras experience pushed him farther than she could go in fancy but experience laid a sobering finger on his practical steps and bade them hang upon her initiative she talked little young crossjay cantering ahead was her favourite subject she was very much changed since the early morning his liveliness essayed by him at a hazard was unsuccessful grave english pleased her best the descent from that was naturally to melancholy she mentioned a regret she had that the veil was interdicted to women in protestant countries de craye was fortunately silent he could think of no other veil than the moslem and when her meaning struck his witless head he admitted to himself that devout attendance on a young ladys mind stupefies mans intelligence half an hour later he was as foolish in supposing it a confidence he was again saved by silence in aspenwell village she drew a letter from her bosom and called to crossjay to post it the boy sang out miss lucy darleton what a nice name clara did not show that the name betrayed anything she said to de craye it proves he should not be here thinking of nice names her companion replied you may be right he added to avoid feeling too subservient boys will not if they have stern masters to teach them their daily lessons and some of the lessons of existence vernon whitford is not stern enough mr whitford has to contend with other influences here with willoughby not with willoughby he understood her she touched the delicate indication firmly the mans heart respected her for it not many girls could be so thoughtful or dare to be so direct he saw that she had become deeply serious and he felt her love of the boy to be maternal past maiden sentiment by this light of her seriousness the posting of her letter in a distant village not entrusting it to the hall postbox might have import not that she would apprehend the violation of her private correspondence but we like to see our letter of weighty meaning pass into the mouth of the public box consequently this letter was important it was to suppose a sequency in the conduct of a variable damsel coupled with her remark about the veil and with other things not words breathing from her which were the breath of her condition it was not unreasonably to be supposed she might even be a very consistent person if one only had the key of her she spoke once of an immediate visit to london supposing that she could induce her father to go de craye remembered the occurrence in the hall at night and her aspect of distress they raced along aspenwell common to the ford shallow to the chagrin of young crossjay between whom and themselves they left a fitting space for his rapture in leading his pony to splash up and down lord of the stream swiftness of motion so strikes the blood on the brain that our thoughts are lightnings the heart is master of them de craye was heated by his gallop to venture on the angling question am i to hear the names of the bridesmaids the pace had nerved clara to speak to it sharply there is no need have i no claim she was mute miss lucy darleton for instance whose name i am almost as much in love with as crossjay she will not be bridesmaid to me she declines add my petition i beg to all or to her do all the bridesmaids decline the scene is too ghastly a marriage girls have grown sick of it of weddings well overcome the sickness with some not with miss darleton you tempt my eloquence you wish it to win her consent certainly the scene do i wish that marriage exclaimed clara dashing into the ford fearful of her ungovernable wildness and of what it might have kindledyou father you have driven me to unmaidenlinessshe forgot willoughby in her father who would not quit a comfortable house for her all but prostrate beseeching would not bend his mind to her explanations answered her with the horrid iteration of such deaf misunderstanding as may be associated with a tolling bell de craye allowed her to catch crossjay by herself they entered a narrow lane mysterious with possible birds eggs in the maygreen hedges as there was not room for three abreast the colonel made up the rearguard and was consoled by having miss middletons figure to contemplate but the readiness of her joining in crossjays pastime of the nesthunt was not so pleasing to a man that she had wound to a pitch of excitement her scornful accent on marriage rang through him apparently she was beginning to do with him just as she liked herself entirely unconcerned she kept crossjay beside her till she dismounted and the colonel was left to the procession of elephantine ideas in his head whose ponderousness he took for natural weight we do not with impunity abandon the initiative men who have yielded it are like cavalry put on the defensive a very small force with an ictus will scatter them anxiety to recover lost ground reduced the dimensions of his ideas to a practical standard two ideas were opposed like duellists bent on the slaughter of one another either she amazed him by confirming the suspicions he had gathered of her sentiments for willoughby in the moments of his introduction to her or she amazed him as a model for coquettesthe married and the widow might apply to her for lessons these combatants exchanged shots but remained standing the encounter was undecided whatever the result no person so seductive as clara middleton had he ever met her cry of loathing marriage coming from a girl rang faintly clear of an ancient virginal aspiration of the sex to escape from their coil and bespoke a pure cold savage pride that transplanted his thirst for her to higher fields chapter xxiii treats of the union of temper and policy sir willoughby meanwhile was on a line of conduct suiting his appreciation of his duty to himself he had deluded himself with the simple notion that good fruit would come of the union of temper and policy no delusion is older none apparently so promising both parties being eager for the alliance yet the theorist upon human nature will say they are obviously of adverse disposition and this is true inasmuch as neither of them win submit to the yoke of an established union as soon as they have done their mischief they set to work tugging for a divorce but they have attractions the one for the other which precipitate them to embrace whenever they meet in a breast each is earnest with the owner of it to get him to officiate forthwith as weddingpriest and here is the reason temper to warrant its appearance desires to be thought as deliberative as policy and policy the sooner to prove its shrewdness is impatient for the quick blood of temper it will be well for men to resolve at the first approaches of the amorous but fickle pair upon interdicting even an accidental temporary junction for the astonishing sweetness of the couple when no more than the ghosts of them have come together in a projecting mind is an intoxication beyond fermented grapejuice or a witchs brewage and under the guise of active wits they will lead us to the parental meditation of antics compared with which a pagan saturnalia were less impious in the sight of sanity this is fullmouthed language but on our studious way through any human career we are subject to fits of moral elevation the theme inspires it and the sage residing in every civilized bosom approves it decide at the outset that temper is fatal to policy hold them with both hands in division one might add be doubtful of your policy and repress your temper it would be to suppose you wise you can however by incorporating two or three captains of the great army of truisms bequeathed to us by ancient wisdom fix in your service those veteran old standfasts to check you they will not be serviceless in their admonitions to your understanding and they will so contrive to reconcile with it the natural caperings of the wayward young sprig conduct that the latter who commonly learns to walk upright and straight from nothing softer than raps of a bludgeon on his crown shall foot soberly appearing at least wary of dangerous corners now willoughby had not to be taught that temper is fatal to policy he was beginning to see in addition that the temper he encouraged was particularly obnoxious to the policy he adopted and although his purpose in mounting horse after yesterday frowning on his bride was definite and might be deemed sagacious he bemoaned already the fatality pushing him ever farther from her in chase of a satisfaction impossible to grasp but the bare fact that her behaviour demanded a line of policy crossed the grain of his temper it was very offensive considering that she wounded him severely her reversal of their proper parts by taking the part belonging to him and requiring his watchfulness and the careful dealings he was accustomed to expect from others and had a right to exact of her was injuriously unjust the feelings of a man hereditarily sensitive to property accused her of a trespassing imprudence and knowing himself by testimony of his household his tenants and the neighbourhood and the world as well amiable when he received his dues he contemplated her with an air of stiffbacked illtreatment not devoid of a certain sanctification of martyrdom his bitterest enemy would hardly declare that it was he who was in the wrong clara herself had never been audacious enough to say that distaste of his person was inconceivable to the favourite of society the capricious creature probably wanted a whipping to bring her to the understanding of the principle called mastery which is in man but was he administering it if he retained a hold on her he could undoubtedly apply the scourge at leisure any kind of scourge he could shun her look on her frigidly unbend to her to find a warmer place for sarcasm pityingly smile ridicule pay court elsewhere he could do these things if he retained a hold on her and he could do them well because of the faith he had in his renowned amiability for in doing them he could feel that he was other than he seemed and his own cordial nature was there to comfort him while he bestowed punishment cordial indeed the chills he endured were flung from the world his heart was in that fiction half the hearts now beating have a mild form of it to keep them merry and the chastisement he desired to inflict was really no more than righteous vengeance for an offended goodness of heart clara figuratively absolutely perhaps on her knees he would raise her and forgive her he yearned for the situation to let her understand how little she had known him it would be worth the pain she had dealt to pour forth the stream of reestablished confidences to paint himself to her as he was as he was in the spirit not as he was to the world though the world had reason to do him honour first however she would have to be humbled something whispered that his hold on her was lost in such a case every blow he struck would set her flying farther till the breach between them would be past bridging determination not to let her go was the best finish to this perpetually revolving round which went like the same old wheelplanks of a water mill in his head at a review of the injury he sustained he had come to it before and he came to it again there was his vengeance it melted him she was so sweet she shone for him like the sunny breeze on water thinking of her caused a catch of his breath the dreadful young woman had a keener edge for the senses of men than sovereign beauty it would be madness to let her go she affected him like an outlook on the great patterne estate after an absence when his welcoming flag wept for pride above patterne hall it would be treason to let her go it would be cruelty to her he was bound to reflect that she was of tender age and the foolishness of the wretch was excusable to extreme youth we toss away a flower that we are tired of smelling and do not wish to carry but the roseyoung womanis not cast off with impunity a fiend in shape of man is always behind us to appropriate her he that touches that rejected thing is larcenous willoughby had been sensible of it in the person of laetitia and by all the more that claras charms exceeded the faded creatures he felt it now ten thousand furies thickened about him at a thought of her lying by the roadside without his having crushed all bloom and odour out of her which might tempt even the curiosity of the fiend man on the other hand supposing her to be there untouched universally declined by the sniffling sagacious dogfiend a miserable spinster for years he could conceive notions of his remorse a soft remorse may be adopted as an agreeable sensation within view of the wasted penitent whom we have struck a trifle too hard seeing her penitent he certainly would be willing to surround her with little offices of compromising kindness it would depend on her age supposing her still youngish there might be captivating passages between them as thus in a style not unfamiliar and was it my fault my poor girl am i to blame that you have passed a lonely unloved youth no willoughby the irreparable error was mine the blame is mine mine only i live to repent it i do not seek for i have not deserved your pardon had i it i should need my own selfesteem to presume to clasp it to a bosom ever unworthy of you i may have been impatient clara we are human never be it mine to accuse one on whom i laid so heavy a weight of forbearance still my old lovefor i am merely quoting history in naming you soi cannot have been perfectly blameless to me you were and are clara willoughby must i recognize the bitter truth that we two once nearly one so nearly one are eternally separated i have envisaged it my friendi may call you friend you have ever been my friend my best friend oh that eyes had been mine to know the friend i hadwilloughby in the darkness of night and during days that were as night to my soul i have seen the inexorable finger pointing my solitary way through the wilderness from a paradise forfeited by my most wilful my wanton sin we have met it is more than i have merited we part in mercy let it be for ever oh terrible word coined by the passions of our youth it comes to us for our sole riches when we are bankrupt of earthly treasures and is the passport given by abnegation unto woe that prays to quit this probationary sphere willoughby we part it is better so clara oneone onlyone lastone holy kiss if these poor lips that once were sweet to you the kiss to continue the language of the imaginative composition of his time favourite readings in which had inspired sir willoughby with a colloquy so pathetic was imprinted ay she had the kiss and no mean one it was intended to swallow every vestige of dwindling attractiveness out of her and there was a bit of scandal springing of it in the background that satisfactorily settled her business and left her enshrined in memory a divine recollection to him as his popular romances would say and have said for years unhappily the fancied salute of her lips encircled him with the breathing clara she rushed up from vacancy like a wind summoned to wreck a stately vessel his reverie had thrown him into severe commotion the slave of a passion thinks in a ring as hares run he will cease where he began her sweetness had set him off and he whirled back to her sweetness and that being incalculable and he insatiable you have the picture of his torments when you consider that her behaviour made her as a cloud to him riding slack horse and man in the likeness of those two ajog homeward from the miry hunt the horse pricked his cars and willoughby looked down from his road along the bills on the race headed by young crossjay with a short start over aspenwell common to the ford there was no mistaking who they were though they were wellnigh a mile distant below he noticed that they did not overtake the boy they drew rein at the ford talking not simply face to face but face in face willoughbys novel feeling of he knew not what drew them up to him enabling him to fancy them bathing in one anothers eyes then she sprang through the ford de craye following but not close afterand why not close she had flicked him with one of her peremptorily saucy speeches when she was bold with the gallop they were not unknown to willoughby they signified intimacy last night he had proposed to de craye to take miss middleton for a ride the next afternoon it never came to his mind then that he and his friend had formerly been rivals he wished clara to be amused policy dictated that every thread should be used to attach her to her residence at the hall until he could command his temper to talk to her calmly and overwhelm her as any man in earnest with command of temper and a point of vantage may be sure to whelm a young woman policy adulterated by temper yet policy it was that had sent him on his errand in the early morning to beat about for a house and garden suitable to dr middleton within a circuit of five six or seven miles of patterne hall if the rev doctor liked the house and took it and willoughby had seen the place to suit him the neighbourhood would be a chain upon clara and if the house did not please a gentleman rather hard to please except in a venerable wine an excuse would have been started for his visiting other houses and he had that response to his importunate daughter that he believed an excellent house was on view dr middleton had been prepared by numerous hints to meet claras black misreading of a lovers quarrel so that everything looked full of promise as far as willoughbys exercise of policy went but the strange pang traversing him now convicted him of a large adulteration of profitless temper with it the loyalty of de craye to a friend where a woman walked in the drama was notorious it was there and a most flexible thing it was and it soon resembled reason manipulated by the sophists not to have reckoned on his peculiar loyalty was proof of the blindness cast on us by temper and de craye had an irish tongue and he had it under control so that he could talk good sense and airy nonsense at discretion the strongest overboiling of english puritan contempt of a gabbler would not stop women from liking it evidently clara did like it and willoughby thundered on her sex unto such brainless things as these do we under the irony of circumstances confide our honour for he was no gabbler he remembered having rattled in earlier days he had rattled with an object to gain desiring to be taken for an easy careless vivacious charming fellow as any young gentleman may be who gaily wears the golden dish of fifty thousand pounds per annum nailed to the back of his very saintly young pate the growth of the critical spirit in him however had informed him that slang had been a principal component of his rattling and as he justly supposed it a betraying art for his race and for him he passed through the prim and the yawning phases of affected indifference to the pine puritanism of a leaden contempt of gabblers they snare women you seegirls how despicable the host of girlsat least that girl below there married women understood him widows did he placed an exceedingly handsome and flattering young widow of his acquaintance lady mary lewison beside clara for a comparison involuntarily and at once in a flash in despite of him he would rather it had been otherwise and in despite of lady marys high birth and connections as well the silver lustre of the maid sicklied the poor widow the effect of the luckless comparison was to produce an image of surpassingness in the features of clara that gave him the final or maceblow jealousy invaded him he had hitherto been free of it regarding jealousy as a foreign devil the accursed familiar of the vulgar luckless fellows might be victims of the disease he was not and neither captain oxford nor vernon nor de craye nor any of his compeers had given him one shrewd pinch the woman had not the man and she in quite a different fashion from his present wallowing anguish she had never pulled him to earths level where jealousy gnaws the grasses he had boasted himself above the humiliating visitation if that had been the case we should not have needed to trouble ourselves much about him a run or two with the pack of imps would have satisfied us but he desired clara middleton manfully enough at an intimation of rivalry to be jealous in a minute the foreign devil had him he was flame flaming verdigris one might almost dare to say for an exact illustration such was actually the colour but accept it as unsaid remember the poets upon jealousy it is to be haunted in the heaven of two by a third preceded or succeeded therefore surrounded embraced bugged by this infernal third it is loves bed of burning marl to see and taste the withering third in the bosom of sweetness to be dragged through the past and find the fair eden of it sulphurous to be dragged to the gates of the future and glory to behold them blood to adore the bitter creature trebly and with treble power to clutch her by the windpipe it is to be cheated derided shamed and abject and supplicating and consciously demoniacal in treacherousness and victoriously selfjustified in revenge and still there is no change in what men feel though in what they do the modern may be judicious you know the many paintings of man transformed to rageing beast by the curse and this the fieriest trial of our egoism worked in the egoist to produce division of himself from himself a concentration of his thoughts upon another object still himself but in another breast which had to be looked at and into for the discovery of him by the gaping jawchasm of his greed we may gather comprehension of his insatiate force of jealousy let her go not though he were to become a mark of public scorn in strangling her with the yoke his concentration was marvellous unused to the exercise of imaginative powers he nevertheless conjured her before him visually till his eyeballs ached he saw none but clara hated none loved none save the intolerable woman what logic was in him deduced her to be individual and most distinctive from the circumstance that only she had ever wrought these pangs she had made him ready for them as we know an idea of de craye being no stranger to her when he arrived at the hall dashed him at de craye for a second it might be or might not be that they had a secretclara was the spell so prodigiously did he love and hate that he had no permanent sense except for her the soul of him writhed under her eyes at one moment and the next it closed on her without mercy she was his possession escaping his own gliding away to the third there would be pangs for him too that third standing at the altar to see her fastbound soul and body to another would be good roasting fire it would be good roasting fire for her too should she be averse to conceive her aversion was to burn her and devour her she would then be hiswhat say you burned and devoured rivals would vanish then her reluctance to espouse the man she was plighted to would cease to be uttered cease to be felt at last he believed in her reluctance all that had been wanted to bring him to the belief was the scene on the common such a mere spark or an imagined spark but the presence of the third was necessary otherwise he would have had to suppose himself personally distasteful women have us back to the conditions of primitive man or they shoot us higher than the topmost star but it is as we please let them tell us what we are to them for us they are our back and front of life the poets lesbia the poets beatrice ours is the choice and were it proved that some of the bright things are in the pay of darkness with the stamp of his coin on their palms and that some are the very angels we hear sung of not the less might we say that they find us out they have us by our leanings they are to us what we hold of best or worst within by their state is our civilization judged and if it is hugely animal still that is because primitive men abound and will have their pasture since the lead is ours the leaders must bow their heads to the sentence jealousy of a woman is the primitive egoism seeking to refine in a blood gone to savagery under apprehension of an invasion of rights it is in action the tiger threatened by a rifle when his paw is rigid on quick flesh he tears the flesh for rage at the intruder the egoist who is our original male in giant form had no bleeding victim beneath his paw but there was the sex to mangle much as he prefers the wellbehaved among women who can worship and fawn and in whom terror can be inspired in his wrath he would make of beatrice a lesbia quadrantaria let women tell us of their side of the battle we are not so much the test of the egoist in them as they to us movements of similarity shown in crowned and undiademed ladies of intrepid independence suggest their occasional capacity to be like men when it is given to them to hunt at present they fly and there is the difference our manner of the chase informs them of the creature we are dimly as young women are informed they have a youthful ardour of detestation that renders them less tolerant of the egoist than their perceptive elder sisters what they do perceive however they have a redoubtable grasp of and claras behaviour would be indefensible if her detective feminine vision might not sanction her acting on its direction seeing him as she did she turned from him and shunned his house as the antre of an ogre she had posted her letter to lucy darleton otherwise if it had been open to her to dismiss colonel de craye she might with a warm kiss to vernons pupil have seriously thought of the next shrill steamwhistle across yonder hills for a travelling companion on the way to her friend lucy so abhorrent was to her the putting of her horses head toward the hall oh the breaking of bread there it had to be gone through for another day and more that is to say forty hours it might be sixandforty hours and no prospect of sleep to speed any of them on wings such were claras inward interjections while poor willoughby burned himself out with verdigris flame having the savour of bad metal till the hollow of his breast was not unlike to a corroded old cuirass found we will assume by criminal lanternbeams in a digging beside greenmantled pools of the sullen soil lumped with a strange adhesive concrete how else picture the sad manthe cavity felt empty to him and heavy sick of an ancient and mortal combat and burning deeply dinted too with the starry hole whence fled the soul very sore important for aught save sluggish agony a specimen and the issue of strife measurelessly to loathe was not sufficient to save him from pain he tried it nor to despise he went to a depth there also the fact that she was a healthy young woman returned to the surface of his thoughts like the murdered body pitched into the river which will not drown and calls upon the elements of dissolution to float it his grand hereditary desire to transmit his estates wealth and name to a solid posterity while it prompted him in his loathing and contempt of a nature mean and ephemeral compared with his attached him desperately to her splendid healthiness the council of elders whose descendant he was pointed to this young woman for his mate he had wooed her with the idea that they consented o she was healthy and he likewise but as if it had been a duel between two clearly designated by quality of blood to bid a house endure she was the first who taught him what it was to have sensations of his mortality he could not forgive her it seemed to him consequently politic to continue frigid and let her have a further taste of his shadow when it was his burning wish to strain her in his arms to a flatness provoking his compassion you have had your ride he addressed her politely in the general assembly on the lawn i have had my ride yes clara replied agreeable i trust very agreeable so it appeared oh blushless the next instant he was in conversation with laetitia questioning her upon a dejected droop of her eyelashes i am i think said she constitutionally melancholy he murmured to her i believe in the existence of specifics and not far to seek for all our ailments except those we bear at the hands of others she did not dissent de craye whose humour for being convinced that willoughby cared about as little for miss middleton as she for him was nourished by his immediate observation of them dilated on the beauty of the ride and his fair companions equestrian skill you should start a travelling circus willoughby rejoined but the ideas a worthy onetheres another alternative to the expedition i proposed miss middleton said de craye and i be clown i havent a scruple of objection i must read up books of jokes dont said willoughby id spoil my part but a natural clown wont keep up an artificial performance for an entire month you see which is the length of time we propose hell exhaust his nature in a day and be bowled over by the dullest regular donkeyengine with paint on his cheeks and a nodding topknot what is this expedition we propose de craye was advised in his heart to spare miss middleton any allusion to honeymoons merely a game to cure dulness ah willoughby acquiesced a month you said oned like it to last for years ah you are driving one of mr merrimans witticisms at me horace i am dense willoughby bowed to dr middleton and drew him from vernon filially taking his turn to talk with him closely de craye saw claras look as her father and willoughby went aside thus linked it lifted him over anxieties and casuistries concerning loyalty powder was in the look to make a warhorse breathe high and shiver for the signal chapter xxiv contains an instance of the generosity of willoughby observers of a gathering complication and a character in action commonly resemble gleaners who are intent only on picking up the cars of grain and huddling their store disinterestedly or interestedly they wax overeager for the little trifles and make too much of them observers should begin upon the precept that not all we see is worth hoarding and that the things we see are to be weighed in the scale with what we know of the situation before we commit ourselves to a measurement and they may be accurate observers without being good judges they do not think so and their bent is to glean hurriedly and form conclusions as hasty when their business should be sift at each step and question miss dale seconded vernon whitford in the occupation of counting looks and tones and noting scraps of dialogue she was quite disinterested he quite believed that he was to this degree they were competent for their post and neither of them imagined they could be personally involved in the dubious result of the scenes they witnessed they were but anxious observers diligently collecting she fancied clara susceptible to his advice he had fancied it and was considering it one of his vanities each mentally compared claras abruptness in taking them into her confidence with her abstention from any secret word since the arrival of colonel de craye sir willoughby requested laetitia to give miss middleton as much of her company as she could showing that he was on the alert another constantia durham seemed beating her wings for flight the suddenness of the evident intimacy between clara and colonel de craye shocked laetitia their acquaintance could be computed by hours yet at their first interview she had suspected the possibility of worse than she now supposed to be and she had begged vernon not immediately to quit the hall in consequence of that faint suspicion she had been led to it by meeting clara and de craye at her cottagegate and finding them as fluent and laughterbreathing in conversation as friends unable to realize the rapid advance to a familiarity more ostensible than actual of two lively natures after such an introduction as they had undergone and one of the two pining in a drought of liveliness laetitia listened to their wager of nothing at alla no against a yesin the case of poor flitch and claras willoughby will not forgive and de crayes oh hes human and the silence of clara and de crayes hearty cry flitch shall be a gentlemans coachman in his old seat or i havent a tongue to which there was a negative of claras head and it then struck laetitia that this young betrothed lady whose alienated heart acknowledged no lord an hour earlier had met her match and as the observer would have said her destiny she judged of the alarming possibility by the recent revelation to herself of miss middletons character and by claras having spoken to a man as well to vernon and previously that a young lady should speak on the subject of the inner holies to a man though he were vernon whitford was incredible to laetitia but it had to be accepted as one of the dread facts of our inexplicable life which drag our bodies at their wheels and leave our minds exclaiming then if clara could speak to vernon which laetitia would not have done for a mighty bribe she could speak to de craye laetitia thought deductively this being the logic of untrained heads opposed to the proceeding whereby their condemnatory deduction hangsclara must have spoken to de craye laetitia remembered how winning and prevailing miss middleton could be in her confidences a gentleman hearing her might forget his duty to his friend she thought for she had been strangely swayed by clara ideas of sir willoughby that she had never before imagined herself to entertain had been sown in her she thought not asking herself whether the searchingness of the young lady had struck them and bidden them rise from where they lay imbedded very gentle women take in that manner impressions of persons especially of the worshipped person wounding them like the new fortifications with embankments of soft earth where explosive missiles bury themselves harmlessly until they are plucked out and it may be a reason why those injured ladies outlive a clara middleton similarly battered vernon less than laetitia took into account that clara was in a state of fever scarcely reasonable her confidences to him he had excused as a piece of conduct in sympathy with her position he had not been greatly astonished by the circumstances confided and on the whole as she was excited and unhappy he excused her thoroughly he could have extolled her it was natural that she should come to him brave in her to speak so frankly a compliment that she should condescend to treat him as a friend her position excused her widely but she was not excused for making a confidential friend of de craye there was a difference well the difference was that de craye had not the smarting sense of honour with women which our meditator had an impartial judiciary it will be seen and he discriminated between himself and the other justly but sensation surging to his brain at the same instant he reproached miss middleton for not perceiving that difference as clearly before she betrayed her position to de craye which vernon assumed that she had done of course he did she had been guilty of it once why then in the mind of an offended friend she would be guilty of it twice there was evidence ladies fatally predestined to appeal to that from which they have to be guarded must expect severity when they run off their railed highroad justice is out of the question mans brains might his blood cannot administer it to them by chilling him to the bone they may get what they cry for but that is a method deadening to their point of appeal i the evening miss middleton and the colonel sang a duet she had of late declined to sing her voice was noticeably firm sir willoughby said to her you have recovered your richness of tone clara she smiled and appeared happy in pleasing him he named a french ballad she went to the musicrack and gave the song unasked he should have been satisfied for she said to him at the finish is that as you like it he broke from a murmur to miss dale admirable some one mentioned a tuscan popular canzone she waited for willoughbys approval and took his nod for a mandate traitress he could have bellowed he had read of this characteristic of caressing obedience of the women about to deceive he had in his time profited by it is it intuitively or by their experience that our neighbours across channel surpass us in the knowledge of your sex he said to miss dale and talked through claras apostrophe to the santissinia virgine maria still treating temper as a part of policy without any effect on clara and that was matter for sickly green reflections the lover who cannot wound has indeed lost anchorage he is woefully adrift he stabs air which is to stab himself her complacent proofarmour bids him know himself supplanted during the short conversational period before the ladies retired for the night miss eleanor alluded to the wedding by chance miss isabel replied to her and addressed an interrogation to clara de craye foiled it adroitly clara did not utter a syllable her bosom lifted to a wavering height and sank subsequently she looked at de craye vacantly like a person awakened but she looked she was astonished by his readiness and thankful for the succour her look was cold wide unfixed with nothing of gratitude or of personal in it the look however stood too long for willoughbys endurance ejaculating porcelain he uncrossed his legs a signal for the ladies eleanor and isabel to retire vernon bowed to clara as she was rising he had not been once in her eyes and he expected a partial recognition at the goodnight she said it turning her head to miss isabel who was condoling once more with colonel de craye over the ruins of his weddingpresent the porcelain vase which she supposed to have been in willoughbys mind when he displayed the signal vernon walked off to his room dark as one smitten blind bile tumet jecur her stroke of neglect hit him there where a blow sends thick obscuration upon eyeballs and brain alike clara saw that she was paining him and regretted it when they were separated that was her real friend but he prescribed too hard a task besides she had done everything he demanded of her except the consenting to stay where she was and wear out willoughby whose dexterity wearied her small stock of patience she had vainly tried remonstrance and supplication with her father hoodwinked by his host she refused to consider how through winethe thought was repulsive nevertheless she was drawn to the edge of it by the contemplation of her scheme of release if lucy darleton was at home if lucy invited her to come if she flew to lucy oh then her father would have cause for anger he would not remember that but for hateful wine what was there in this wine of great age which expelled reasonableness fatherliness he was her dear father she was his beloved child yet something divided them something closed her fathers ears to her and could it be that incomprehensible seduction of the wine her dutifulness cried violently no she bowed stupefied to his arguments for remaining awhile and rose clearheaded and rebellious with the reminiscence of the many strong reasons she had urged against them the strangeness of men young and old the little things she regarded a grand wine as a little thing twisting and changing them amazed her and these are they by whom women are abused for variability only the most imperious reasons never mean trifles move women thought she would women do an injury to one they loved for oceans of thatah pah and women must respect men they necessarily respect a father my dear dear father clara said in the solitude of her chamber musing on all his goodness and she endeavoured to reconcile the desperate sentiments of the position he forced her to sustain with those of a venerating daughter the blow which was to fall on him beat on her heavily in advance i have not one excuse she said glancing at numbers and a mighty one but the idea of her father suffering at her hands cast her down lower than selfjustification she sought to imagine herself sparing him it was too fictitious the sanctuary of her chamber the pure white room so homely to her maidenly feelings whispered peace only to follow the whisper with another that went through her swelling to a roar and leaving her as a suing of music unkindly smitten if she stayed in this house her chamber would no longer be a sanctuary dolorous bondage insolent death is not worse deaths worm we cannot keep away but when he has us we are numb to dishonour happily senseless youth weighed her eyelids to sleep though she was quivering and quivering she awoke to the sound of her name beneath her window i can love still for i love him she said as she luxuriated in young crossjays boys voice again envying him his bath in the lake waters which seemed to her to have the power to wash away grief and chains then it was that she resolved to let crossjay see the last of her in this place he should be made gleeful by doing her a piece of service he should escort her on her walk to the railway station next morning thence be sent flying for a long days truancy with a little note of apology on his behalf that she would write for him to deliver to vernon at night crossjay came running to her after his breakfast with mrs montague the housekeeper to tell her he had called her up you wont tomorrow i shall be up far ahead of you said she and musing on her father while crossjay vowed to be up the first she thought it her duty to plunge into another expostulation willoughby had need of vernon on private affairs dr middleton betook himself as usual to the library after answering i will ruin you yet to willoughbys liberal offer to despatch an order to london for any books he might want his fine unruffled air as of a mountain in still morning beams made clara not indisposed to a preliminary scene with willoughby that might save her from distressing him but she could not stop willoughby as little could she look an invitation he stood in the hall holding vernon by the arm she passed him he did not speak and she entered the library what now my dear what is it said dr middleton seeing that the door was shut on them nothing papa she replied calmly youve not locked the door my child you turned something there try the handle i assure you papa the door is not locked mr whitford will be here instantly we are engaged on tough matter women have not and opinion is universal that they never will have a conception of the value of time we are vain and shallow my dear papa no no not you clara but i suspect you to require to learn by having work in progress how important is is a quiet commencement of the days task there is not a scholar who will not tell you so we must have a retreat these invasionsso you intend to have another ride today they do you good tomorrow we dine with mrs mountstuart jenkinson an estimable person indeed though i do not perfectly understand our acceptingyou have not to accuse me of sitting over wine last night my clara i never do it unless i am appealed to for my judgement upon a wine i have come to entreat you to take me away papa in the midst of the storm aroused by this renewal of perplexity dr middleton replaced a book his elbow had knocked over in his haste to dash the hair off his forehead crying whither to what spot that reading of guidebooks and idle peoples notes of travel and picturesque correspondence in the newspapers unsettles man and maid my objection to the living in hotels is known i do not hesitate to say that i do cordially abhor it i have had penitentially to submit to it in your dear mothers time greek up to the full ten thousand times but will you not comprehend that to the older man his miseries are multiplied by his years but is it utterly useless to solicit your sympathy with an old man clara general darleton will take us in papa his table is detestable i say nothing of that but his wine is poison let that passi should rather say let it not passbut our political views are not in accord true we are not under the obligation to propound them in presence but we are destitute of an opinion in common we have no discourse military men have produced or diverged in noteworthy epicures they are often devout they have blossomed in lettered men they are gentlemen the country rightly holds them in honour but in fine i reject the proposal to go to general darletontears no papa i do hope not here we have everything man can desire without contest an excellent host you have your transitory teacup tempests which you magnify to hurricanes in the approved historic manner of the book of cupid and all the better i repeat it is the better that you should have them over in the infancy of the alliance come in dr middleton shouted cheerily in response to a knock at the door he feared the door was locked he had a fear that his daughter intended to keep it locked clara he cried she reluctantly turned the handle and the ladies eleanor and isabel came in apologizing with as much coherence as dr middleton ever expected from their sex they wished to speak to clara but they declined to take her away in vain the rev doctor assured them she was at their service they protested that they had very few words to say and would not intrude one moment further than to speak them like a shy deputation of young scholars before the master these very words to come were preceded by none at all a dismal and trying cause refreshing however to dr middleton who joyfully anticipated that the ladies could be induced to take away clara when they had finished we may appear to you a little formal miss isabel began and turned to her sister we have no intention to lay undue weight on our mission if mission it can be called said miss eleanor is it entrusted to you by willoughby said clara dear child that you may know it all the more earnest with us and our personal desire to contribute to your happiness therefore does willoughby entrust the speaking of it to us hereupon the sisters alternated in addressing clara and she gazed from one to the other piecing fragments of empty signification to get the full meaning when she might and in saying your happiness dear clara we have our willoughbys in view which is dependent on yours and we never could sanction that our own inclinations should stand in the way no we love the old place and if it were only our punishment for loving it too idolatrously we should deem it ground enough for our departure without really an idea of unkindness none not any young wives naturally prefer to be undisputed queens of their own establishment youth and age but i said clara have never mentioned never had a thought you have dear child a lover who in his solicitude for your happiness both sees what you desire and what is due to you and for us clara to recognize what is due to you is to act on it besides dear a seaside cottage has always been one of our dreams we have not to learn that we are a couple of old maids incongruous associates for a young wife in the government of a great house with our antiquated notions questions of domestic management might arise and with the best will in the world to be harmonious so dear clara consider it settled from time to time gladly shall we be your guests your guests dear not censorious critics and you think me such an egoistdear ladies the suggestion of so cruel a piece of selfishness wounds me i would not have had you leave the hall i like your society i respect you my complaint if i had one would be that you do not sufficiently assert yourselves i could have wished you to be here for an example to me i would not have allowed you to go what can he think of me did willoughby speak of it this morning it was hard to distinguish which was the completer dupe of these two echoes of one another in worship of a family idol willoughby miss eleanor presented herself to be stamped with the title hanging ready for the first that should open her lips our willoughby is observanthe is ever generousand he is not less forethoughtful his arrangement is for our good on all sides an index is enough said miss isabel appearing in her turn the monster dupe you will not have to leave dear ladies were i mistress here i should oppose it willoughby blames himself for not reassuring you before indeed we blame ourselves for not undertaking to go did he speak of it first this morning said clara but she could draw no reply to that from them they resumed the duet and she resigned herself to have her cars boxed with nonsense so it is understood said miss eleanor i see your kindness ladies and i am to be aunt eleanor again and i aunt isabel clara could have wrung her hands at the impediment which prohibited her delicacy from telling them why she could not name them so as she had done in the earlier days of willoughbys courtship she kissed them warmly ashamed of kissing though the warmth was real they retired with a flow of excuses to dr middleton for disturbing him he stood at the door to bow them out and holding the door for clara to wind up the procession discovered her at a far corner of the room he was debating upon the advisability of leaving her there when vernon whitford crossed the hall from the laboratory door a mirror of himself in his companion air of discomposure that was not important so long as vernon was a check on clara but the moment clara thus baffled moved to quit the library dr middleton felt the horror of having an uncomfortable face opposite no botheration i hope its the worst thing possible to work on where have you been i suspect your weak point is not to arm yourself in triple brass against bother and worry and no good work can you do unless you do you have come out of that laboratory i have sircan i get you any book vernon said to clara she thanked him promising to depart immediately now you are at the section of italian literature my love said dr middleton well mr whitford the laboratoryahwhere the amount of labour done within the space of a year would not stretch an electric current between this hall and the railway station say four miles which i presume the distance to be well sir and a dilettantism costly in time and machinery is as ornamental as foxes tails and deers horns to an independent gentleman whose fellows are contented with the latter decorations for their civic wreath willoughby let me remark has recently shown himself most considerate for my girl as far as i could gatheri have been listening to a dialogue of ladieshe is as generous as he is discreet there are certain combats in which to be the one to succumb is to claim the honoursand that is what women will not learn i doubt their seeing the glory of it i have heard of it i have been with willoughby vernon said hastily to shield clara from her fathers allusive attacks he wished to convey to her that his interview with willoughby had not been profitable in her interests and that she had better at once having him present to support her pour out her whole heart to her father but how was it to be conveyed she would not meet his eyes and he was too poor an intriguer to be ready on the instant to deal out the verbal obscurities which are transparencies to one i shall regret it if willoughby has annoyed you for he stands high in my favour said dr middleton clara dropped a book her father started higher than the nervous impulse warranted in his chair vernon tried to win a glance and she was conscious of his effort but her angry and guilty feelings prompting her resolution to follow her own counsel kept her eyelids on the defensive i dont say he annoys me sir i am here to give him my advice and if he does not accept it i have no right to be annoyed willoughby seems annoyed that colonel de craye should talk of going tomorrow or next day he likes his friends about him upon my word a man of a more genial heart you might march a day without finding but you have it on the forehead mr whitford oh no sir there dr middleton drew his finger along his brows vernon felt along his own and coined an excuse for their blackness not aware that the direction of his mind toward clara pushed him to a kind of clumsy double meaning while he satisfied an inward and craving wrath as he said by the way i have been racking my head i must apply to you sir i have a line and i am uncertain of the run of the line will this pass do you think in asinations tongue he asinates signifying that he excels any man of us at donkeydialect after a decent interval for the genius of criticism to seem to have been sitting under his frown dr middleton rejoined with sober jocularity no sir it will not pass and your uncertainty in regard to the run of the line would only be extended were the line centipedal our recommendation is that you erase it before the arrival of the ferule this might do in assignations name he assignats signifying that he preeminently flourishes hypothetical promises to pay by appointment that might pass but you will forbear to cite me for your authority the line would be acceptable if i could get it to apply said vernon or this dr middleton was offering a second suggestion but clara fled astonished at men as she never yet had been why in a burning world they would be exercising their minds in absurdities and those two were scholars learned men and both knew they were in the presence of a soul in a tragic fever a minute after she had closed the door they were deep in their work dr middleton forgot his alternative line nothing serious he said in reproof of the want of honourable clearness on vernons brows i trust not sir its a case for common sense and you call that not serious i take hermanns praise of the versus dochmiachus to be not only serious but unexaggerated said vernon dr middleton assented and entered on the voiceful ground of greek metres shoving your dry dusty world from his elbow chapter xxv the flight in wild weather the morning of lucy darletons letter of reply to her friend clara was fair before sunrise with luminous colours that are an omen to the husbandman clara had no weathereye for the rich eastern crimson nor a quiet space within her for the beauty she looked on it as her gate of promise and it set her throbbing with a revived belief in radiant things which she had once dreamed of to surround her life but her accelerated pulses narrowed her thoughts upon the machinery of her project she herself was metal pointing all to her one aim when in motion nothing came amiss to it everything was fuel fibs evasions the serene battalions of white lies parallel on the march with dainty rogue falsehoods she had delivered herself of many yesterday in her engagements for today pressure was put on her to engage herself and she did so liberally throwing the burden of deceitfulness on the extraordinary pressure i want the early part of the morning the rest of the day i shall be at liberty she said it to willoughby miss dale colonel de craye and only the third time was she aware of the delicious double meaning hence she associated it with the colonel your loudest outcry against the wretch who breaks your rules is in asking how a tolerably conscientious person could have done this and the other besides the main offence which you vow you could overlook but for the minor objections pertaining to conscience the incomprehensible and abominable lies for example or the brazen coolness of the lying yet you know that we live in an undisciplined world where in our seasons of activity we are servants of our design and that this comes of our passions and those of our position our design shapes us for the work in hand the passions man the ship the position is their apology and now should conscience be a passenger on board a merely seeming swiftness of our vessel will keep him dumb as the unwilling guest of a pirate captain scudding from the cruiser half in cloven brine through rocks and shoals to save his black flag beware the false position that is easy to say sometimes the tangle descends on us like a net of blight on a rosebush there is then an instant choice for us between courage to cut loose and desperation if we do not but not many men are trained to courage young women are trained to cowardice for them to front an evil with plain speech is to be guilty of effrontery and forfeit the waxen polish of purity and therewith their commanding place in the market they are trained to please mans taste for which purpose they soon learn to live out of themselves and look on themselves as he looks almost as little disturbed as he by the undiscovered without courage conscience is a sorry guest and if all goes well with the pirate captain conscience will be made to walk the plank for being of no service to either party claras fibs and evasions disturbed her not in the least that morning she had chosen desperation and she thought herself very brave because she was just brave enough to fly from her abhorrence she was lighthearted or more truly drunkenhearted her quick nature realized the out of prison as vividly and suddenly as it had sunk suddenly and leadenly under the sense of imprisonment vernon crossed her mind that was a friend yes and there was a guide but he would disapprove and even he thwarting her way to sacred liberty must be thrust aside what would he think they might never meet for her to know or one day in the alps they might meet a middleaged couple he famous she regretful only to have fallen below his lofty standard for mr whitford says she very earnestly i did wish at that time believe me or not to merit your approbation the brows of the phantom vernon whom she conjured up were stern as she had seen them yesterday in the library she gave herself a chiding for thinking of him when her mind should be intent on that which he was opposed to it was a livelier relaxation to think of young crossjays shamefaced confession presently that he had been a laggard in bed while she swept the dews she laughed at him and immediately crossjay popped out on her from behind a tree causing her to clap hand to heart and stand fast a conspirator is not of the stuff to bear surprises he feared he had hurt her and was manly in his efforts to soothe he had been up hours he said and had watched her coming along the avenue and did not mean to startle her it was the kind of fun he played with fellows and if he had hurt her she might do anything to him she liked and she would see if he could not stand to be punished he was urgent with her to inflict corporal punishment on him i shall leave it to the boatswain to do that when youre in the navy said clara the boatswain darent strike an officer so now you see what you know of the navy said crossjay but you could not have been out before me you naughty boy for i found all the locks and bolts when i went to the door but you didnt go to the back door and sir willoughbys private door you came out by the hall door and i know what you want miss middleton you want not to pay what youve lost what have i lost crossjay your wager what was that you know speak a kiss nothing of the sort but dear boy i dont love you less for not kissing you all that is nonsense you have to think only of learning and to be truthful never tell a story suffer anything rather than be dishonest she was particularly impressive upon the silliness and wickedness of falsehood and added do you hear yes but you kissed me when i had been out in the rain that day because i promised and miss middleton you betted a kiss yesterday i am sure crossjayno i will not say i am sure but can you say you are sure you were out first this morning well will you say you are sure that when you left the house you did not see me in the avenue you cant ah miss middleton i do really believe i was dressed first always be truthful my dear boy and then you may feel that clara middleton will always love you but miss middleton when youre married you wont be clara middleton i certainly shall crossjay no you wont because im so fond of your name she considered and said you have warned me crossjay and i shall not marry i shall wait she was going to say for you but turned the hesitation to a period is the village where i posted my letter the day before yesterday too far for you crossjay howled in contempt next to clara my favourites lucy he said i thought clara came next to nelson said she and a long way off too if youre not going to be a landlubber im not going to be a landlubber miss middleton you may be absolutely positive on your solemn word youre getting to talk like one a little now and then crossjay then i wont talk at all he stuck to his resolution for one whole minute clara hoped that on this morning of a doubtful though imperative venture she had done some good they walked fast to cover the distance to the village postoffice and back before the breakfast hour and they had plenty of time arriving too early for the opening of the door so that crossjay began to dance with an appetite and was despatched to besiege a bakery clara felt lonely without him apprehensively timid in the shuttered unmoving village street she was glad of his return when at last her letter was handed to her on the testimony of the postman that she was the lawful applicant crossjay and she put out on a sharp trot to be back at the hall in good time she took a swallowing glance of the first page of lucys writing telegraph and i will meet you i will supply you with everything you can want for the two nights if you cannot stop longer that was the gist of the letter a second less voracious glance at it along the road brought sweetnesslucy wrote do i love you as i did my best friend you must fall into unhappiness to have the answer to that clara broke a silence yes dear crossjay and if you like you shall have another walk with me after breakfast but remember you must not say where you have gone with me i shall give you twenty shillings to go and buy those birds eggs and the butterflies you want for your collection and mind promise me today is your last day of truancy tell mr whitford how ungrateful you know you have been that he may have some hope of you you know the way across the fields to the railway station you save a mile you drop on the road by comblines mill and then theres another fiveminutes cut and the rests road then crossjay immediately after breakfast run round behind the pheasantry and there ill find you and if any one comes to you before i come say you are admiring the plumage of the himalayathe beautiful indian bird and if were found together we run a race and of course you can catch me but you mustnt until were out of sight tell mr vernon at nighttell mr whitford at night you had the money from me as part of my allowance to you for pocketmoney i used to like to have pocketmoney crossjay and you may tell him i gave you the holiday and i may write to him for his excuse if he is not too harsh to grant it he can be very harsh you look right into his eyes next time miss middleton i used to think him awful till he made me look at him he says men ought to look straight at one another just as we do when he gives me my boxinglesson and then we wont have quarrelling half so much i cant recollect everything he says you are not bound to crossjay no but you like to hear really dear boy i cant accuse myself of having told you that no but miss middleton you do and hes fond of your singing and playing on the piano and watches you we shall be late if we dont mind said clara starting to a pace close on a run they were in time for a circuit in the park to the wild double cherryblossom no longer all white clara gazed up from under it where she had imagined a fairer visible heavenliness than any other sight of earth had ever given her that was when vernon lay beneath but she had certainly looked above not at him the tree seemed sorrowful in its withering flowers of the colour of trodden snow crossjay resumed the conversation he says ladies dont like him much who says that mr whitford were those his words i forget the words but he said they wouldnt be taught by him like me ever since you came and since you came ive liked him ten times more the more you like him the more i shall like you crossjay the boy raised a shout and scampered away to sir willoughby at the appearance of whom clara felt herself nipped and curling inward crossjay ran up to him with every sign of pleasure yet he had not mentioned him during the walk and clara took it for a sign that the boy understood the entire satisfaction willoughby had in mere shows of affection and acted up to it hardly blaming crossjay she was a critic of the scene for the reason that youthful creatures who have ceased to love a person hunger for evidence against him to confirm their hard animus which will seem to them sometimes when he is not immediately irritating them brutish because they can not analyze it and reduce it to the multitude of just antagonisms whereof it came it has passed by large accumulation into a sombre and speechless load upon the senses and fresh evidence the smallest item is a champion to speak for it being about to do wrong she grasped at this eagerly and brooded on the little of vital and truthful that there was in the man and how he corrupted the boy nevertheless she instinctively imitated crossjay in an almost sparkling salute to him goodmorning willoughby it was not a morning to lose have you been out long he retained her hand my dear clara and you have you not overfatigued yourself where have you been roundeverywhere and i am certainly not tired only you and crossjay you should have loosened the dogs their barking would have annoyed the house less than i am annoyed to think of you without protection he kissed her fingers it was a loving speech the household said clara but would not insist to convict him of what he could not have perceived if you outstrip me another morning clara promise me to take the dogs will you yes today i am altogether yours are you from the first to the last hour of itso you fall in with horaces humour pleasantly he is very amusing as good as though one had hired him here comes colonel de craye he must think we have hired him she noticed the bitterness of willoughbys tone he sang out a goodmorning to de craye and remarked that he must go to the stables darleton darleton miss middleton said the colonel rising from his bow to her a daughter of general darleton if so i have had the honour to dance with her and have not youpractised with her i mean or gone off in a triumph to dance it out as young ladies do so you know what a delightful partner she is she is cried clara enthusiastic for her succouring friend whose letter was the treasure in her bosom oddly the name did not strike me yesterday miss middleton in the middle of the night it rang a little silver bell in my ear and i remembered the lady i was half in love with if only for her dancing she is dark of your height as light on her feet a sister in another colour now that i know her to be your friend why you may meet her colonel de craye itll be to offer her a castaway and one only meets a charming girl to hear that shes engaged tis not a line of a ballad miss middleton but out of the heart lucy darleton you were leading me to talk seriously to you colonel de craye will you one dayand not think me a perpetual tumbler you have heard of melancholy clowns you will find the face not so laughable behind my paint when i was thirteen years younger i was loved and my dearest sank to the grave since then i have not been quite at home in life probably because of finding no one so charitable as she tis easy to win smiles and hands but not so easy to win a woman whose faith you would trust as your own heart before the enemy i was poor then she said the day after my twentyfirst birthday and that day i went for her and i wondered they did not refuse me at the door i was shown upstairs and i saw her and saw death she wished to marry me to leave me her fortune then never marry said clara in an underbreath she glanced behind sir willoughby was close walking on turf i must be cunning to escape him after breakfast she thought he had discarded his foolishness of the previous days and the thought in him could have replied i am a dolt if i let you out of my sight vernon appeared formal as usual of late clara begged his excuse for withdrawing crossjay from his morning swim he nodded de craye called to willoughby for a book of the trains theres a card in the smokingroom eleven one and four are the hours if you must go said willoughby you leave the hall colonel de craye in two or three days miss middleton she did not request him to stay his announcement produced no effect on her consequently thought hewell what nothing well then that she might not be minded to stay herself otherwise she would have regretted the loss of an amusing companion that is the modest way of putting it there is a modest and a vain for the same sentiment and both may be simultaneously in the same breast and each one as honest as the other so shy is mans vanity in the presence of here and there a lady she liked him she did not care a pin for himhow could she yet she liked him o to be able to do her some kindling bit of service these were his consecutive fancies resolving naturally to the exclamation and built on the conviction that she did not love willoughby and waited for a spirited lift from circumstances his call for a book of the trains had been a sheer piece of impromptu in the mind as well as on the mouth it sprang unknown to him of conjectures he had indulged yesterday and the day before this morning she would have an answer to her letter to her friend miss lucy darleton the pretty dark girl whom de craye was astonished not to have noticed more when he danced with her she pretty as she was had come to his recollection through the name and rank of her father a famous general of cavalry and tactician in that arm the colonel despised himself for not having been devoted to clara middletons friend the mornings letters were on the bronze plate in the hall clara passed on her way to her room without inspecting them de craye opened an envelope and went upstairs to scribble a line sir willoughby observed their absence at the solemn reading to the domestic servants in advance of breakfast three chairs were unoccupied vernon had his own notions of a mechanical serviceand a precious profit he derived from them but the other two seats returned the stare willoughby cast at their backs with an impudence that reminded him of his friend horaces calling for a book of the trains when a minute afterward he admitted he was going to stay at the hall another two days or three the man possessed by jealousy is never in need of matter for it he magnifies grass is jungle hillocks are mountains willoughbys legs crossing and uncrossing audibly and his tightfolded arms and clearing of the throat were faint indications of his condition are you in fair health this morning willoughby dr middleton said to him after he had closed his volumes the thing is not much questioned by those who know me intimately he replied willoughby unwell and he is health incarnate exclaimed the ladies eleanor and isabel laetitia grieved for him sunrays on a peststricken city she thought were like the smile of his face she believed that he deeply loved clara and had learned more of her alienation he went into the ball to look into the well for the pair of malefactors on fire with what he could not reveal to a soul de craye was in the housekeepers room talking to young crossjay and mrs montague just come up to breakfast he had heard the boy chattering and as the door was ajar he peeped in and was invited to enter mrs montague was very fond of hearing him talk he paid her the familiar respect which a lady of fallen fortunes at a certain period after the fall enjoys as a befittingly sad souvenir and the respectfulness of the lord of the house was more chilling she bewailed the boys trying his constitution with long walks before he had anything in him to walk on and where did you go this morning my lad said de craye ah you know the ground colonel said crossjay i am hungry i shall eat three eggs and some bacon and buttered cakes and jam then begin again on my second cup of coffee its not braggadocio remarked mrs montague he waits empty from five in the morning till nine and then he comes famished to my table and cats too much oh mrs montague that is what the country people call roemancing for colonel de craye i had a bun at seven oclock miss middleton forced me to go and buy it a stale bun my boy yesterdays there wasnt much of a stopper to you in it like a new bun and where did you leave miss middleton when you went to buy the bun you should never leave a lady and the street of a country town is lonely at that early hour crossjay you surprise me she forced me to go colonel indeed she did what do i care for a bun and she was quite safe we could hear the people stirring in the postoffice and i met our postman going for his letterbag i didnt want to go bother the bunbut you cant disobey miss middleton i never want to and wouldnt there were of the same mind said the colonel and crossjay shouted for the lady whom they exalted was at the door you will be too tired for a ride this morning de craye said to her descending the stairs she swung a bonnet by the ribands i dont think of riding today why did you not depute your mission to me i like to bear my own burdens as far as i can miss darleton is well i presume so will you try her recollection for me it will probably be quite as lively as yours was shall you see her soon i hope so sir willoughby met her at the foot of the stairs but refrained from giving her a hand that shook we shall have the day together he said clara bowed at the breakfasttable she faced a clock de craye took out his watch you are five and a half minutes too slow by that clock willoughby the man omitted to come from rendon to set it last week horace he will find the hour too late here for him when he does come one of the ladies compared the time of her watch with de crayes and clara looked at hers and gratefully noted that she was four minutes in arrear she left the breakfastroom at a quarter to ten after kissing her father willoughby was behind her he had been soothed by thinking of his personal advantages over de craye and he felt assured that if he could be solitary with his eccentric bride and fold her in himself he would cutting temper adrift be the man he had been to her not so many days back considering how few days back his temper was roused but he controlled it they were slightly dissenting as de craye stepped into the hall a present worth examining willoughby said to her and i do not dwell on the costliness come presently then i am at your disposal all day i will drive you in the afternoon to call on lady busshe to offer your thanks but you must see it first it is laid out in the laboratory there is time before the afternoon said clara wedding presents interposed de craye a porcelain service from lady busshe horace not in fragments let me have a look at it im haunted by an idea that porcelain always goes to pieces ill have a look and take a hint were in the laboratory miss middleton he put his arm under willoughbys the resistance to him was momentary willoughby had the satisfaction of the thought that de craye being with him was not with clara and seeing her giving orders to her maid barclay he deferred his claim on her company for some short period de craye detained him in the laboratory first over the china cups and saucers and then with the latest of londontales of youngest cupid upon subterranean adventures having high titles to light him willoughby liked the tale thus illuminated for without the title there was no special savour in such affairs and it pulled down his betters in rank he was of a morality to reprobate the erring dame while he enjoyed the incidents he could not help interrupting de craye to point at vernon through the window striding this way and that evidently on the hunt for young crossjay no one here knows how to manage the boy except myself but go on horace he said checking his contemptuous laugh and vernon did look ridiculous out there halfdrenched already in a white rain again shuffled off by the little rascal it seemed that he was determined to have his runaway he struck up the avenue at full pedestrian racing pace a man looks a fool cutting after a cricketball but putting on steam in a storm of rain to catch a young villain out of sight beats anything ive witnessed willoughby resumed in his amusement aiha said de craye waving a hand to accompany the melodious accent there are things to beat that for fun he had smoked in the laboratory so willoughby directed a servant to transfer the porcelain service to one of the sittingrooms for claras inspection of it youre a bold man de craye remarked the luck may be with you though i wouldnt handle the fragile treasure for a trifle i believe in my luck said willoughby clara was now sought for the lord of the house desired her presence impatiently and had to wait she was in none of the lower rooms barclay her maid upon interrogation declared she was in none of the upper willoughby turned sharp on de craye he was there the ladies eleanor and isabel and miss dale were consulted they had nothing to say about claras movements more than that they could not understand her exceeding restlessness the idea of her being out of doors grew serious heaven was black hard thunder rolled and lightning flushed the battering rain men bearing umbrellas shawls and cloaks were dispatched on a circuit of the park de craye said ill be one no cried willoughby starting to interrupt him i cant allow it ive the scent of a hound willoughby ill soon be on the track my dear horace i wont let you go adieu dear boy and if the ladys discoverable im the one to find her he stepped to the umbrellastand there was then a general question whether clara had taken her umbrella barclay said she had the fact indicated a wider stroll than round inside the park crossjay was likewise absent de craye nodded to himself willoughby struck a rattling blow on the barometer wheres pollington he called and sent word for his man pollington to bring big fishingboots and waterproof wrappers an urgent debate within him was in progress should he go forth alone on his chance of discovering clara and forgiving her under his umbrella and cloak or should he prevent de craye from going forth alone on the chance he vaunted so impudently you will offend me horace if you insist he said regard me as an instrument of destiny willoughby replied de craye then we go in company but thats an addition of one that cancels the other by conjunction ands worse than simple division for i cant trust my wits unless i rely on them alone you see upon my word you talk at times most unintelligible stuff to be frank with you horace give it in english tis not suited perhaps to the genius of the language for i thought i talked english oh theres english gibberish as well as irish we know and a deal foolisher when they do go at it for it wont bear squeezing we think like irish where exclaimed the ladies where can she be the storm is terrible laetitia suggested the boathouse for crossjay hadnt a swim this morning said de craye no one reflected on the absurdity that clara should think of taking crossjay for a swim in the lake and immediately after his breakfast it was accepted as a suggestion at least that she and crossjay had gone to the lake for a row in the hopefulness of the idea willoughby suffered de craye to go on his chance unaccompanied he was near chuckling he projected a plan for dismissing crossjay and remaining in the boathouse with clara luxuriating in the prestige which would attach to him for seeking and finding her deadly sentiments intervened still he might expect to be alone with her where she could not slip from him the throwing open of the halldoors for the gentlemen presented a framed picture of a deluge all the youngleaved trees were steely black without a gradation of green drooping and pouring and the song of rain had become an inveterate hiss the ladies beholding it exclaimed against clara even apostrophized her so dark are trivial errors when circumstances frown she must be mad to tempt such weather she was very giddy she was never at rest clara clara how could you be so wild ought we not to tell dr middleton laetitia induced them to spare him which way do you take said willoughby rather fearful that his companion was not to be got rid of now any way said de craye i chuck up my head like a halfpenny and go by the toss this enraging nonsense drove off willoughby de craye saw him cast a furtive eye at his heels to make sure he was not followed and thought jove he may be fond of her but hes not on the track shes a determined girl if im correct shes a girl of a hundred thousand girls like that make the right sort of wives for the right men theyre the girls to make men think of marrying tomorrow only give me a chance they stick to you fast when they do stick then a thought of her flowerlike drapery and face caused him fervently to hope she had escaped the storm calling at the west parklodge he heard that miss middleton had been seen passing through the gate with master crossjay but she had not been seen coming back mr vernon whitford had passed through half an hour later after his young man said the colonel the lodgekeepers wife and daughter knew of master crossjays pranks mr whitford they said had made inquiries about him and must have caught him and sent him home to change his dripping things for master crossjay had come back and had declined shelter in the lodge he seemed to be crying he went away soaking over the wet grass hanging his head the opinion at the lodge was that master crossjay was unhappy he very properly received a wigging from mr whitford i have no doubt said colonel do craye mother and daughter supposed it to be the case and considered crossjay very wilful for not going straight home to the hall to change his wet clothes he was drenched do craye drew out his watch the time was ten minutes past eleven if the surmise he had distantly spied was correct miss middleton would have been caught in the storm midway to her destination by his guess at her character knowledge of it he would have said he judged that no storm would daunt her on a predetermined expedition he deduced in consequence that she was at the present moment flying to her friend the charming brunette lucy darleton still as there was a possibility of the rain having been too much for her and as he had no other speculation concerning the route she had taken he decided upon keeping along the road to rendon with a keen eye at cottage and farmhouse windows chapter xxvi vernon in pursuit the lodgekeeper had a son who was a chum of master crossjays and errantfellow with him upon many adventures for this boys passion was to become a gamekeeper and accompanied by one of the headgamekeepers youngsters he and crossjay were in the habit of rangeing over the country preparing for a profession delightful to the tastes of all three crossjays prospective connection with the mysterious ocean bestowed the title of captain on him by common consent he led them and when missing for lessons he was generally in the society of jacob croom or jonathan fernaway vernon made sure of crossjay when he perceived jacob croom sitting on a stool in the little lodgeparlour jacobs appearance of a diligent perusal of a book he had presented to the lad he took for a decent piece of trickery it was with amazement that he heard from the mother and daughter as well as jacob of miss middletons going through the gate before ten oclock with crossjay beside her the latter too hurried to spare a nod to jacob that she of all on earth should be encouraging crossjay to truancy was incredible vernon had to fall back upon greek and latin aphoristic shots at the sex to believe it rain was universal a thick robe of it swept from hill to hill thunder rumbled remote and between the ruffled roars the downpour pressed on the land with a great noise of eager gobbling much like that of the swines trough fresh filled as though a vast assembly of the hungered had seated themselves clamorously and fallen to on meats and drinks in a silence save of the chaps a rapid walker poetically and humourously minded gathers multitudes of images on his way and rain the heaviest you can meet is a lively companion when the resolute pacer scorns discomfort of wet clothes and squealing boots southwestern rainclouds too are never long sullen they enfold and will have the earth in a good strong glut of the kissing overflow then as a hawk with feathers on his beak of the bird in his claw lifts head they rise and take veiled feature in long climbing watery lines at any moment they may break the veil and show soft upper cloud show sun on it show sky green near the verge they spring from of the green of grass in early dew or along a travelling sweep that rolls asunder overhead heavens laughter of purest blue among titanic white shoulders it may mean fair smiling for awhile or be the lightest interlude but the watery lines and the drifting the chasing the upsoaring all in a shadowy fingering of form and the animation of the leaves of the trees pointing them on the bending of the treetops the snapping of branches and the hurrahings of the stubborn hedge at wrestle with the flaws yielding but a leaf at most and that on a fling make a glory of contest and wildness without aid of colour to inflame the man who is at home in them from old association on road heath and mountain let him be drenched his heart will sing and thou trim cockney that jeerest consider thyself to whom it may occur to be out in such a scene and with what steps of a nervous dancingmaster it would be thine to play the hunted rat of the elements for the preservation of the one imagined dryspot about thee somewhere on thy luckless person the taking of rain and sun alike befits men of our climate and he who would have the secret of a strengthening intoxication must court the clouds of the southwest with a lovers blood vernons happy recklessness was dashed by fears for miss middleton apart from those fears he had the pleasure of a gull wheeling among foamstreaks of the wave he supposed the swiss and tyrol alps to have hidden their heads from him for many a day to come and the springing and chiming southwest was the next best thing a milder rain descended the country expanded darkly defined underneath the moving curtain the clouds were as he liked to see them scaling but their skirts dragged torrents were in store for they coursed streamingly still and had not the higher lift or eagle ascent which he knew for one of the signs of fairness nor had the hills any belt of mistlike vapour on a step of the stile leading to the shortcut to rendon young crossjay was espied a mantramp sat on the topbar there you are what are you doing there wheres miss middleton said vernon now take care before you open your mouth crossjay shut the mouth he had opened the lady has gone away over to a station sir said the tramp you fool roared crossjay ready to fly at him but aint it now young gentleman can you say it aint i gave you a shilling you ass you give me that sum young gentleman to stop here and take care of you and here i stopped mr whitford crossjay appealed to his master and broke of in disgust take care of me as if anybody who knows me would think i wanted taking care of why what a beast you must be you fellow just as you like young gentleman i chaunted you all i know to keep up your downcast spirits you did want comforting you wanted it rarely you cried like an infant i let you chaunt as you call it to keep you from swearing and why did i swear young gentleman because ive got an itchy coat in the wet and no shirt for a lining and no breakfast to give me a stomach for this kind of weather thats what ive come to in this world im a walking moral no wonder i swears when i dont strike up a chaunt but why are you sitting here wet through crossjay be off home at once and change and get ready for me mr whitford i promised and i tossed this fellow a shilling not to go bothering miss middleton the lady wouldnt have none o the young gentleman sir and i offered to go pioneer for her to the station behind her at a respectful distance as ifyou treacherous cur crossjay ground his teeth at the betrayer well mr whitford and i didnt trust him and i stuck to him or hed have been after her whining about his coat and stomach and talking of his being a moral he repeats that to everybody she has gone to the station said vernon not a word on that subject was to be won from crossjay how long since vernon partly addressed mr tramp the latter became seized with shivers as he supplied the information that it might be a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes but whats time to me sir if i had reglar meals i should carry a clock in my inside i got the rheumatics instead way there vernon cried and took the stile at a vault thats what gentlemen can do who sleeps in their beds warm moaned the tramp theyve no joints vernon handed him a halfcrown piece for he had been of use for once mr whitford let me come if you tell me to come i may do let me come crossjay begged with great entreaty i shant see her for be off quick vernon cut him short and pushed on the tramp and crossjay were audible to him crossjay spurning the consolations of the professional sad man vernon spun across the fields timing himself by his watch to reach rendon station ten minutes before eleven though without clearly questioning the nature of the resolution which precipitated him dropping to the road he had better foothold than on the slippery fieldpath and he ran his principal hope was that clara would have missed her way another pelting of rain agitated him on her behalf might she not as well be suffered to goand sit three hours and more in a railwaycarriage with wet feet he clasped the visionary little feet to warm them on his breastbut willoughbys obstinate fatuity deserved the blowbut neither she nor her father deserved the scandal but she was desperate could reasoning touch her if not what would he knew of nothing yesterday he had spoken strongly to willoughby to plead with him to favour her departure and give her leisure to sound her mind and he had left his cousin convinced that claras best measure was flight a man so cunning in a pretended obtuseness backed by senseless pride and in petty tricks that sprang of a grovelling tyranny could only be taught by facts her recent treatment of him however was very strange so strange that he might have known himself better if he had reflected on the bound with which it shot him to a hard suspicion de craye had prepared the world to hear that he was leaving the hall were they in concert the idea struck at his heart colder than if her damp little feet had been there vernons full exoneration of her for making a confidant of himself did not extend its leniency to the young ladys character when there was question of her doing the same with a second gentleman he could suspect much he could even expect to find de craye at the station that idea drew him up in his run to meditate on the part he should play and by drove little dr corney on the way to rendon and hailed him and gave his cheerless figure the nearest approach to an irish bug in the form of a dry seat under an umbrella and waterproof covering though it is the worst i can do for you if you decline to supplement it with a dose of hot brandy and water at the dolphin said he and ill see you take it if you please im bound to ease a rendon patient out of the world medicines one of their superstitions which they cling to the harder the more useless it gets pill and priest launch him happy between themand whats on your conscience patits whether your blessing your riverence would disagree with another drop then put the horse before the cart my son and you shall have the two in harmony and god speed yerendon station did you say vernon you shall have my prescription at the railway arms if youre hurried you have the look what is it can i help no and dont ask youre like the irish grenadier who had a bullet in a humiliating situation heres rendon and through it we go with a spanking clatter heres doctor corneys dogcart posthaste again for theres no dying without him now and repentance is on the deathbed for not calling him in before half a charge of humbug hurts no son of a gun friend vernon if hed have his firing take effect be tender tot in man or woman particularly woman so by goes the meteoric doctor and ill bring noses to windowpanes youll see which reminds me of the sweetest young lady i ever saw and the luckiest man when is she off for her bridal trousseau and when are they spliced ill not call her perfection for thats a post afraid to move but shes a dancing sprig of the tree next it poetrys wanted to speak of her im irish and inflammable i suppose but i never looked on a girl to make a man comprehend the entire holy meaning of the word rapturous like that one and away she goes well not say another word but youre a grecian friend vernon now couldnt you think her just a whiff of an idea of a daughter of a peccadillogoddess deuce take you corney drop me here i shall be late for the train said vernon laying hand on the doctors arm to check him on the way to the station in view dr corney had a celtic intelligence for a meaning behind an illogical tongue he drew up observing two minutes run wont hurt you he slightly fancied he might have given offence though he was well acquainted with vernon and had a cordial grasp at the parting the truth must be told that vernon could not at the moment bear any more talk from an irishman dr corney had succeeded in persuading him not to wonder at clara middletons liking for colonel de craye chapter xxvii at the railway station clara stood in the waitingroom contemplating the white rails of the rainswept line her lips parted at the sight of vernon you have your ticket said he she nodded and breathed more freely the matteroffact question was reassuring you are wet he resumed and it could not be denied a little i do not feel it i must beg you to come to the inn hard byhalf a dozen steps we shall see your train signalled come she thought him startlingly authoritative but he had good sense to back him and depressed as she was by the dampness she was disposed to yield to reason if he continued to respect her independence so she submitted outwardly resisted inwardly on the watch to stop him from taking any decisive lead shall we be sure to see the signal mr whitford ill provide for that he spoke to the stationclerk and conducted her across the road you are quite alone miss middleton i am i have not brought my maid you must take off boots and stockings at once and have them dried ill put you in the hands of the landlady but my train you have full fifteen minutes besides fair chances of delay he seemed reasonable the reverse of hostile in spite of his commanding air and that was not unpleasant in one friendly to her adventure she controlled her alert distrustfulness and passed from him to the landlady for her feet were wet and cold the skirts of her dress were soiled generally inspecting herself she was an object to be shuddered at and she was grateful to vernon for his inattention to her appearance vernon ordered dr corneys dose and was ushered upstairs to a room of portraits where the publicans ancestors and family sat against the walls flat on their canvas as weeds of the botanists portfolio although corpulency was pretty generally insisted on and there were formidable battalions of bust among the females all of them had the aspect of the national energy which has vanquished obstacles to subside on its ideal they all gazed straight at the guest drink and come to this they might have been labelled to say to him he was in the private walhalla of a large class of his countrymen the existing host had taken forethought to be of the party in his prime and in the central place looking freshfattened there and sanguine from the performance by and by a son would shove him aside meanwhile he shelved his parent according to the manners of energy one should not be a critic of our works of art in uncomfortable garments vernon turned from the portraits to a stuffed pike in a glass case and plunged into sympathy with the fish for a refuge clara soon rejoined him saying but you you must be very wet you were without an umbrella you must be wet through mr whitford were all wet through today said vernon crossjays wet through and a tramp he met the horrid man but crossjay should have turned back when i told him cannot the landlord assist you you are not tied to time i begged crossjay to turn back when it began to rain when it became heavy i compelled him so you met my poor crossjay you have not to blame him for betraying you the tramp did that i was thrown on your track quite by accident now pardon me for using authority and dont be alarmed miss middleton you are perfectly free for me but you must not run a risk to your health i met doctor corney coming along and he prescribed hot brandy and water for a wet skin especially for sitting in it theres the stuff on the table i see you have been aware of a singular odour you must consent to sip some as medicine merely to give you warmth impossible mr whitford i could not taste it but pray obey dr corney if he ordered it for you i cant unless you do i will then i will try she held the glass attempted and was baffled by the reek of it try you can do anything said vernon now that you find me here mr whitford anything for myself it would seem and nothing to save a friend but i will really try it must be a good mouthful i will try and you will finish the glass with your permission if you do not leave too much they were to drink out of the same glass and she was to drink some of this infamous mixture and she was in a kind of hotel alone with him and he was drenched in running after herall this came of breaking loose for an hour oh what a misfortune that it should be such a day mr whitford did you not choose the day not the weather and the worst of it is that willoughby will come upon crossjay wet to the bone and pump him and get nothing but shufflings blank lies and then find him out and chase him from the house clara drank immediately and more than she intended she held the glass as an enemy to be delivered from gasping uncertain of her breath never let me be asked to endure such a thing again you are unlikely to be running away from father and friends again she panted still with the fiery liquid she had gulped and she wondered that it should belie its reputation in not fortifying her but rendering her painfully susceptible to his remarks mr whitford i need not seek to know what you think of me what i think i dont think at all i wish to serve you if i can am i right in supposing you a little afraid of me you should not be i have deceived no one i have opened my heart to you and am not ashamed of having done so it is an excellent habit they say it is not a habit with me he was touched and for that reason in his dissatisfaction with himself not unwilling to hurt we take our turn miss middleton im no hero and a bad conspirator so i am not of much avail you have been reservedbut i am going and i leave my character behind you condemned me to the poisonbowl you have not touched it yourself in vino veritas if i do i shall be speaking my mind then do for the sake of mind and body it wont be complimentary you can be harsh only say everything have we time they looked at their watches six minutes clara said vernons had stopped penetrated by his total drenching she reproached herself he laughed to quiet her my dies solemnes are sure to give me duckings im used to them as for the watch it will remind me that it stopped when you went she raised the glass to him she was happier and hoped for some little harshness and kindness mixed that she might carry away to travel with and think over he turned the glass as she had given it turned it round in putting it to his lips a scarce perceptible manoeuvre but that she had given it expressly on one side it may be hoped that it was not done by design done even accidentally without a taint of contrivance it was an affliction to see and coiled through her causing her to shrink and redden fugitives are subject to strange incidents they are not vessels lying safe in harbour she shut her lips tight as if they had stung the realizing sensitiveness of her quick nature accused them of a loss of bloom and the man who made her smart like this was formal as a railway official on a platform now we are both pledged in the poisonbowl said he and it has the taste of rank poison i confess but the doctor prescribed it and at sea we must be sailors now miss middleton time presses will you return with me no no where do you propose to go to london to a friendmiss darleton what message is there for your father say i have left a letter for him in a letter to be delivered to you to me and what message for willoughby my maid barclay will hand him a letter at noon you have sealed crossjays fate how he is probably at this instant undergoing an interrogation you may guess at his replies the letter will expose him and willoughby does not pardon i regret it i cannot avoid it poor boy my dear crossjay i did not think of how willoughby might punish him i was very thoughtless mr whitford my pinmoney shall go for his education later when i am a little older i shall be able to support him thats an encumbrance you should not tie yourself to drag it about you are unalterable of course but circumstances are not and as it happens women are more subject to them than we are but i will not be your command of them is shown at the present moment because i determine to be free no because you do the contrary you dont determine you run away from the difficulty and leave it to your father and friends to bear as for crossjay you see you destroy one of his chances i should have carried him off before this if i had not thought it prudent to keep him on terms with willoughby well let crossjay stand aside hell behave like a man of honour imitating others who have had to do the same for ladies have spoken falsely to shelter cowards you mean mr whitford oh i knowi have but two minutes the die is cast i cannot go back i must get ready will you see me to the station i would rather you should hurry home i will see the last of you i will wait for you here an express runs ahead of your train and i have arranged with the clerk for a signal i have an eye on the window you are still my best friend mr whitford though well though you do not perfectly understand what torments have driven me to this carried on tides and blown by winds ah you do not understand mysteries sufferings are not mysteries they are very simple facts well then i dont understand but decide at once i wish you to have your free will she left the room dry stockings and boots are better for travelling in than wet ones but in spite of her direct resolve she felt when drawing them on like one that has been tripped the goal was desirable the ardour was damped vernons wish that she should have her free will compelled her to sound it and it was of course to go to be liberated to cast off incubus and hurt her father injure crossjay distress her friends no and ten times no she returned to vernon in haste to shun the reflex of her mind he was looking at a closed carriage drawn up at the station door shall we run over now mr whitford theres no signal here its not so chilly i ventured to enclose my letter to papa in yours trusting you would attend to my request to you to break the news to him gently and plead for me we will all do the utmost we can i am doomed to vex those who care for me i tried to follow your counsel first you spoke to me and then you spoke to miss dale and at least you have a clear conscience no what burdens it i have done nothing to burden it then its a clear conscience no vernons shoulders jerked our patience with an innocent duplicity in women is measured by the place it assigns to us and another if he had liked he could have thought you have not done but meditated something to trouble conscience that was evident and her speaking of it was proof too of the willingness to be dear he would not help her mans blood which is the link with women and responsive to them on the instant for or against obscured him he shrugged anew when she said my character would have been degraded utterly by my staying there could you advise it certainly not the degradation of your character he said black on the subject of de craye and not lightened by feelings which made him sharply sensible of the beggarly dependant that he was or poor adventuring scribbler that he was to become why did you pursue me and wish to stop me mr whitford said clara on the spur of a wound from his tone he replied i suppose im a busybody i was never aware of it till now you are my friend only you speak in irony so much that was irony about my clear conscience i spoke to you and to miss dale and then i rested and drifted can you not feel for me that to mention it is like a scorching furnace willoughby has entangled papa he schemes incessantly to keep me entangled i fly from his cunning as much as from anything i dread it i have told you that i am more to blame than he but i must accuse him and weddingpresents and congratulations and to be his guest all that makes up a plea in mitigation said vernon is it not sufficient for you she asked him timidly you have a masculine good sense that tells you you wont be respected if you run three more days there might cover a retreat with your father he will not listen to me he confuses me willoughby has bewitched him commission me i will see that he listens and go back oh no to london besides there is the dining with mrs mountstuart this evening and i like her very well but i must avoid her she has a kind of idolatry and what answers can i give i supplicate her with looks she observes them my efforts to divert them from being painful produce a comic expression to her and i am a charming rogue and i am entertained on the topic she assumes to be principally interesting me i must avoid her the thought of her leaves me no choice she is clever she could tattoo me with epigrams stay there you can hold your own she has told me you give me credit for a spice of wit i have not discovered my possession we have spoken of it we call it your delusion she grants me some beauty that must be hers theres no delusion in one case or the other miss middleton you have beauty and wit public opinion will say wildness indifference to your reputation will be charged on you and your friends will have to admit it but you will be out of this difficulty ahto weave a second impossible to judge until we see how you escape the first and i have no more to say i love your father his humour of sententiousness and doctorial stilts is a mask he delights in but you ought to know him and not be frightened by it if you sat with him an hour at a latin task and if you took his hand and told him you could not leave him and no tearshe would answer you at once it would involve a day or two further disagreeable to you no doubt preferable to the present mode of escape as i think but i have no power whatever to persuade i have not the ladys tongue my appeal is always to reason it is a compliment i loathe the ladys tongue its a distinctly good gift and i wish i had it i might have succeeded instead of failing and appearing to pay a compliment surely the express train is very late mr whitford the express has gone by then we will cross over you would rather not be seen by mrs mountstuart that is her carriage drawn up at the station and she is in it clara looked and with the sinking of her heart said i must brave her in that case i will take my leave of you here miss middleton she gave him her hand why is mrs mountstuart at the station today i suppose she has driven to meet one of the guests for her dinnerparty professor crooklyn was promised to your father and he may be coming by the downtrain go back to the hall exclaimed clara how can i i have no more endurance left in me if i had some supportif it were the sense of secretly doing wrong it might help me through i am in a web i cannot do right whatever i do there is only the thought of saving crossjay yes and sparing papagoodbye mr whitford i shall remember your kindness gratefully i cannot go back you will not said he tempting her to hesitate no but if you are seen by mrs mountstuart you must go back ill do my best to take her away should she see you you must patch up a story and apply to her for a lift that i think is imperative not to my mind said clara he bowed hurriedly and withdrew after her confession peculiar to her of possibly finding sustainment in secretly doing wrong her flying or remaining seemed to him a choice of evils and whilst she stood in bewildered speculation on his reason for pursuing herwhich was not evidenthe remembered the special fear inciting him and so far did her justice as to have at himself on that subject he had done something perhaps to save her from a cold such was his only consolatory thought he had also behaved like a man of honour taking no personal advantage of her situation but to reflect on it recalled his astonishing dryness the strict man of honour plays a part that he should not reflect on till about the fall of the curtain otherwise he will be likely sometimes to feel the shiver of foolishness at his good conduct chapter xxviii the return posted in observation at a corner of the window clara saw vernon cross the road to mrs mountstuart jenkinsons carriage transformed to the leanest pattern of himself by narrowed shoulders and raised coatcollar he had such an air of saying toms acold that her skin crept in sympathy presently he left the carriage and went into the station a bell had rung was it her train he approved her going for he was employed in assisting her to go a proceeding at variance with many things he had said but he was as full of contradiction today as women are accused of being the train came up she trembled no signal had appeared and vernon must have deceived her he returned he entered the carriage and the wheels were soon in motion immediately thereupon flitchs fly drove past containing colonel de craye vernon could not but have perceived him but what was it that had brought the colonel to this place the pressure of vernons mind was on her and foiled her efforts to assert her perfect innocence though she knew she had done nothing to allure the colonel hither excepting willoughby colonel de craye was the last person she would have wished to encounter she had now a dread of hearing the bell which would tell her that vernon had not deceived her and that she was out of his hands in the hands of some one else she bit at her glove she glanced at the concentrated eyes of the publicans family portraits all looking as one she noticed the empty tumbler and went round to it and touched it and the silly spoon in it a little yielding to desperation shoots us to strange distances vernon had asked her whether she was alone connecting that inquiry singular in itself and singular in his manner of putting it with the glass of burning liquid she repeated he must have seen colonel de craye and she stared at the empty glass as at something that witnessed to something for vernon was not your supple cavalier assiduously on the smirk to pin a gallantry to commonplaces but all the doors are not open in a young ladys consciousness quick of nature though she may be some are locked and keyless some will not open to the key some are defended by ghosts inside she could not have said what the something witnessed to if we by chance know more we have still no right to make it more prominent than it was with her and the smell of the glass was odious it disgraced her she had an impulse to pocket the spoon for a memento to show it to grandchildren for a warning even the prelude to the morality to be uttered on the occasion sprang to her lips here my dears is a spoon you would be ashamed to use in your teacups yet it was of more value to me at one period of my life than silver and gold in pointing out etc the conclusion was hazy like the conception she had her idea and in this mood she ran downstairs and met colonel de craye on the station steps the bright illumination of his face was that of the confident man confirmed in a risky guess in the crisis of doubt and dispute miss middleton his joyful surprise predominated the pride of an accurate forecast adding i am not too late to be of service she thanked him for the offer have you dismissed the fly colonel de craye i have just been getting change to pay mr flitch he passed me on the road he is interwound with our fates to a certainty i had only to jump in i knew it and rolled along like a magician commanding a genie have i been not seriously nobody doubts you being under shelter you will allow me to protect you my time is yours i was thinking of a running visit to my friend miss darleton may i venture i had the fancy that you wished to see miss darleton today you cannot make the journey unescorted please retain the fly where is willoughby he is in jackboots but may i not miss middleton i shall never be forgiven if you refuse me there has been searching for me some hallooing but why am i rejected besides i dont require the fly i shall walk if i am banished flitch is a wonderful conjurer but the virtue is out of him for the next fourandtwenty hours and it will be an opportunity to me to make my bow to miss darleton she is rigorous on the conventionalities colonel de craye ill appear before her as an ignoramus or a rebel whichever she likes best to take in leadingstrings i remember her i was greatly struck by her upon recollection memory didnt happen to be handy at the first mention of the ladys name as the general said of his ammunition and transport theres the armybut it was leagues in the rear like the footman who went to sleep after smelling fire in the house i was thinking of other things it will serve me right to be forgottenif i am ive a curiosity to know a remainder of my coxcombry not that exactly a wish to see the impression i made on your friendnone at all but any pebble casts a ripple that is hardly an impression said clara pacifying her irresoluteness with this light talk the utmost to be hoped for by men like me i have your permissionone minutei will get my ticket do not said clara your manservant entreats you she signified a decided negative with the head but her eyes were dreamy she breathed deep this thing done would cut the cord her sensation of languor swept over her de craye took a stride he was accosted by one of the railwayporters flitchs fly was in request for a gentleman a portly old gentleman bothered about luggage appeared on the landing the gentleman can have it said de craye handing flitch his money open the door clara said to flitch he tugged at the handle with enthusiasm the door was open she stepped in then mount the box and ill jump up beside you de craye called out after the passion of regretful astonishment had melted from his features clara directed him to the seat fronting her he protested indifference to the wet she kept the door unshut his temper would have preferred to buffet the angry weather the invitation was too sweet she heard now the bell of her own train driving beside the railway embankment she met the train it was eighteen minutes late by her watch and why when it flung up its whalespouts of steam she was not journeying in it she could not tell she had acted of her free will that she could say vernon had not induced her to remain assuredly her present companion had not and her whole heart was for flight yet she was driving back to the hall not devoid of calmness she speculated on the circumstance enough to think herself incomprehensible and there left it intent on the scene to come with willoughby i must choose a better day for london she remarked de craye bowed but did not remove his eyes from her miss middleton you do not trust me she answered say in what way it seems to me that i do i may speak if it depends on my authority fully whatever you have to say let me stipulate be not very grave i want cheering in wet weather miss middleton flitch is charioteer once more think of it theres a tide that carries him perpetually to the place where he was cast forth and a thread that ties us to him in continuity i have not the honour to be a friend of long standing one ventures on ones devotion it dates from the first moment of my seeing you flitch is to blame if any one perhaps the spell would be broken were he reinstated in his ancient office perhaps it would said clara not with her best of smiles willoughbys pride of relentlessness appeared to her to be receiving a blow by rebound and that seemed high justice i am afraid you were right the poor fellow has no chance de craye pursued he paused as for decorum in the presence of misfortune and laughed sparklingly unless i engage him or pretend to i verily believe that flitchs melancholy person on the skirts of the hall completes the picture of the eden withinwhy will you not put some trust in me miss middleton but why should you not pretend to engage him then colonel de craye well plot it if you like can you trust me for that for any act of disinterested kindness i am sure you mean it without reserve you could talk publicly of taking him to london miss middleton just now you were going my arrival changed your mind you distrust me and ought i to wonder the wonder would be all the other way you have not had the sort of report of me which would persuade you to confide even in a case of extremity i guessed you were going do you ask me how i cannot say through what they call sympathy and thats inexplicable theres natural sympathy natural antipathy people have to live together to discover how deep it is clara breathed her dumb admission of his truth the fly jolted and threatened to lurch flitch my dear man the colonel gave a murmuring remonstrance for said he to clara whom his apostrophe to flitch had set smiling were not safe with him however we make believe and hell be jerking the heart out of me before he has donebut if two of us have not the misfortune to be united when they come to the discovery theres hope that is if one has courage and the other has wisdom otherwise they may go to the yoke in spite of themselves the great enemy is pride who has them both in a coach and drives them to the fatal door and the only thing to do is to knock him off his box while theres a minute to spare and as theres no pride like the pride of possession the deadliest wound to him is to make that doubtful pride wont be taught wisdom in any other fashion but one must have the courage to do it de craye trifled with the windowsash to give his words time to sink in solution who but willoughby stood for pride and who swayed by languor had dreamed of a method that would be surest and swiftest to teach him the wisdom of surrendering her you know miss middleton i study character said the colonel i see that you do she answered you intend to return oh decidedly the day is unfavourable for travelling i must say it is you may count on my discretion in the fullest degree i throw myself on your generosity when i assure you that it was not my design to surprise a secret i guessed the station and went there to put myself at your disposal did you said clara reddening slightly chance to see mrs mountstuart jenkinsons carriage pass you when you drove up to the station de craye had passed a carriage i did not see the lady she was in it yes and therefore it is better to put discretion on one side we may be certain she saw you but not you miss middleton i prefer to think that i am seen i have a description of courage colonel de craye when it is forced on me i have not suspected the reverse courage wants training as well as other fine capacities mine is often rusty and rheumatic i cannot hear of concealment or plotting except pray to advance the cause of poor flitch he shall be excepted the colonel screwed his head round for a glance at his coachmans back perfectly guaranteed today he said of flitchs look of solidity the convulsion of the elements appears to sober our friend he is only dangerous in calms five minutes will bring us to the parkgates clara leaned forward to gaze at the hedgeways in the neighbourhood of the hall strangely renewing their familiarity with her both in thought and sensation she was like a flower beaten to earth and she thanked her feminine mask for not showing how nerveless and languid she was she could have accused vernon of a treacherous cunning for imposing it on her free will to decide her fate involuntarily she sighed there is a train at three said de craye with splendid promptitude yes and one at five we dine with mrs mountstuart tonight and i have a passion for solitude i think i was never intended for obligations the moment i am bound i begin to brood on freedom ladies who say that miss middleton what of them theyre feeling too much alone she could not combat the remark by her selfassurance that she had the principle of faithfulness she acknowledged to herself the truth of itthere is no freedom for the weak vernon had said that once she tried to resist the weight of it and her sheer inability precipitated her into a sense of pitiful dependence half an hour earlier it would have been a perilous condition to be traversing in the society of a closely scanning reader of fair faces circumstances had changed they were at the gates of the park shall i leave you said de craye why should you she replied he bent to her gracefully the mild subservience flattered claras languor he had not compelled her to be watchful on her guard and she was unaware that he passed it when she acquiesced to his observation an anticipatory story is a trap to the teller it is she said she had been thinking as much he threw up his head to consult the brain comically with a dozen little blinks no you are right miss middleton inventing beforehand never prospers t is a way to trip our own cleverness truth and motherwit are the best counsellors and as you are the former ill try to act up to the character you assign me some tangle more prospective than present seemed to be about her as she reflected but her intention being to speak to willoughby without subterfuge she was grateful to her companion for not tempting her to swerve no one could doubt his talent for elegant fibbing and she was in the humour both to admire and adopt the art so she was glad to be rescued from herself how motherwit was to second truth she did not inquire and as she did not happen to be thinking of crossjay she was not troubled by having to consider how truth and his tale of the morning would be likely to harmonize driving down the park she had full occupation in questioning whether her return would be pleasing to vernon who was the virtual cause of it though he had done so little to promote it so little that she really doubted his pleasure in seeing her return chapter xxix in which the sensitiveness of sir willoughby is explained and he receives much instruction the halldock over the stables was then striking twelve it was the hour for her flight to be made known and clara sat in a turmoil of dim apprehension that prepared her nervous frame for a painful blush on her being asked by colonel de craye whether she had set her watch correctly he must she understood have seen through her at the breakfast table and was she not cruelly indebted to him for her evasion of willoughby such perspicacity of vision distressed and frightened her at the same time she was obliged to acknowledge that he had not presumed on it her dignity was in no way the worse for him but it had been at a mans mercy and there was the affliction she jumped from the fly as if she were leaving danger behind she could at the moment have greeted willoughby with a conventionally friendly smile the doors were thrown open and young crossjay flew out to her he hung and danced on her hand pressed the hand to his mouth hardly believing that he saw and touched her and in a lingo of dashes and asterisks related how sir willoughby had found him under the boathouse eaves and pumped him and had been sent off to hoppners farm where there was a sick child and on along the road to a labourers cottage for i said youre so kind to poor people miss middleton thats true now that is true and i said you wouldnt have me with you for fear of contagion this was what she had feared every crack and bang in a boys vocabulary remarked the colonel listening to him after he had paid flitch the latter touched his hat till he had drawn attention to himself when he exclaimed with rosy melancholy ah my lady ah colonel if ever i lives to drink some of the old port wine in the old hall at christmastide their healths would on that occasion be drunk it was implied he threw up his eyes at the windows humped his body and drove away then mr whitford has not come back said clara to crossjay no miss middleton sir willoughby has and hes upstairs in his room dressing have you seen barclay she has just gone into the laboratory i told her sir willoughby wasnt there tell me crossjay had she a letter she had something run say i am here i want the letter it is mine crossjay sprang away and plunged into the arms of sir willoughby one has to catch the fellow like a football exclaimed the injured gentleman doubled across the boy and holding him fast that he might have an object to trifle with to give himself countenance he needed it clara you have not been exposed to the weather hardly at all i rejoice you found shelter yes in one of the cottages not in a cottage but i was perfectly sheltered colonel de craye passed a fly before he met me flitch again ejaculated the colonel yes you have luck you have luck willoughby addressed him still clutching crossjay and treating his tugs to get loose as an invitation to caresses but the foil barely concealed his livid perturbation stay by me sir he said at last sharply to crossjay and clara touched the boys shoulder in admonishment of him she turned to the colonel as they stepped into the hall i have not thanked you colonel de craye she dropped her voice to its lowest a letter in my handwriting in the laboratory crossjay cried aloud with pain i have you willoughby rallied him with a laugh not unlike the squeak of his victim you squeeze awfully hard sir why you milksop am i but i want to get a book where is the book in the laboratory colonel de craye sauntering by the laboratory door sung out ill fetch you your book what is it early navigators infant hymns i think my cigarcase is in here barclay speaks of a letter for me willoughby said to clara marked to be delivered to me at noon in case of my not being back earlier it was written to avert anxiety she replied you are very good oh good call me anything but good here are the ladies dear ladies clara swam to meet them as they issued from a morningroom into the hall and interjections reigned for a couple of minutes willoughby relinquished his grasp of crossjay who darted instantaneously at an angle to the laboratory whither he followed and he encountered de craye coming out but passed him in silence crossjay was rangeing and peering all over the room willoughby went to his desk and the batterytable and the mantelpiece he found no letter barclay had undoubtedly informed him that she had left a letter for him in the laboratory by order of her mistress after breakfast he hurried out and ran upstairs in time to see de craye and barclay breaking a conference he beckoned to her the maid lengthened her upper lip and beat her dress down smooth signs of the apprehension of a crisis and of the getting ready for action my mistresss bell has just rung sir willoughby you had a letter for me i said you said when i met you at the foot of the stairs that you had left a letter for me in the laboratory it is lying on my mistresss toilettable get it barclay swept round with another of her demure grimaces it was apparently necessary with her that she should talk to herself in this public manner willoughby waited for her but there was no reappearance of the maid struck by the ridicule of his posture of expectation and of his whole behaviour he went to his bedroom suite shut himself in and paced the chambers amazed at the creature he had become agitated like the commonest of wretches destitute of selfcontrol not able to preserve a decent mask be accustomed to inflict these emotions and tremours upon others was at once the puppet and dupe of an intriguing girl his very stature seemed lessened the glass did not say so but the shrunken heart within him did and wailfully too her compunctioncall me anything but goodcoming after her return to the hall beside de craye and after the visible passage of a secret between them in his presence was a confession it blew at him with the fury of a furnaceblast in his face egoist agony wrung the outcry from him that dupery is a more blessed condition he desired to be deceived he could desire such a thing only in a temporary transport for above all he desired that no one should know of his being deceived and were he a dupe the deceiver would know it and her accomplice would know it and the world would soon know of it that world against whose tongue he stood defenceless within the shadow of his presence he compressed opinion as a strong frost binds the springs of earth but beyond it his shivering sensitiveness ran about in dread of a stripping in a wintry atmosphere this was the ground of his hatred of the world it was an appalling fear on behalf of his naked eidolon the tender infant self swaddled in his name before the world for which he felt as the most highly civilized of men alone can feel and which it was impossible for him to stretch out hands to protect there the poor little loveable creature ran for any mouth to blow on and frostnipped and bruised it cried to him and he was of no avail must we not detest a world that so treats us we loathe it the more by the measure of our contempt for them when we have made the people within the shadowcircle of our person slavish and he had been once a young prince in popularity the world had been his possession claras treatment of him was a robbery of land and subjects his grander dream had been a marriage with a lady of so glowing a fame for beauty and attachment to her lord that the world perforce must take her for witness to merits which would silence detraction and almost not quite it was undesireable extinguish envy but for the nature of women his dream would have been realized he could not bring himself to denounce fortune it had cost him a grievous pang to tell horace de craye he was lucky he had been educated in the belief that fortune specially prized and cherished little willoughby hence of necessity his maledictions fell upon women or he would have forfeited the last blanket of a dream warm as poets revel in but if clara deceived him he inspired her with timidity there was matter in that to make him wish to be deceived she had not looked him much in the face she had not crossed his eyes she had looked deliberately downward keeping her head up to preserve an exterior pride the attitude had its bewitchingness the girls physical pride of stature scorning to bend under a load of conscious guilt had a certain blackangel beauty for which he felt a hugging hatred and according to his policy when these fits of amorous meditation seized him he burst from the present one in the mood of his more favourable conception of clara and sought her out the quality of the mood of hugging hatred is that if you are disallowed the hug you do not hate the fiercer contrariwise the prescription of a decorous distance of two feet ten inches which is by measurement the delimitation exacted of a rightly respectful deportment has this miraculous effect on the great creature man or often it has that his peculiar hatred returns to the reluctant admiration begetting it and his passion for the hug falls prostrate as one of the faithful before the shrine he is reduced to worship by fasting for these mysteries consult the sublime chapter in the great book the seventyfirst on love wherein nothing is written but the reader receives a lanthorn a powdercask and a pickaxe and therewith pursues his yellowdusking path across the rubble of preceding excavators in the solitary quarry a yet more instructive passage than the overscrawled seventieth or french section whence the chapter opens and where hitherto the polite world has halted the hurry of the hero is on us we have no time to spare for mining works he hurried to catch her alone to wreak his tortures on her in a bitter semblance of bodily worship and satiated then comfortably to spurn he found her protected by barclay on the stairs that letter for me he said i think i told you willoughby there was a letter i left with barclay to reassure you in case of my not returning early said clara it was unnecessary for her to deliver it indeed but any letter any writing of yours and from you to me you have it still no i have destroyed it that was wrong it could not have given you pleasure my dear clara one line from you there were but three barclay stood sucking her lips a maid in the secrets of her mistress is a purchaseable maid for if she will take a bribe with her right hand she will with her left all that has to be calculated is the nature and amount of the bribe such was the speculation indulged by sir willoughby and he shrank from the thought and declined to know more than that he was on a volcanic hillside where a thin crust quaked over lava this was a new condition with him representing claras gain in their combat clara did not fear his questioning so much as he feared her candour mutually timid they were of course formally polite and no plain speaking could have told one another more distinctly that each was defensive clara stood pledged to the fib packed scaled and posted and he had only to ask to have it supposing that he asked with a voice not exactly peremptory she said in her heart it is your fault you are relentless and you would ruin crossjay to punish him for devoting himself to me like the poor thoughtless boy he is and so i am bound in honour to do my utmost for him the reciprocal devotedness moreover served two purposes it preserved her from brooding on the humiliation of her lame flight and flutter back and it quieted her mind in regard to the precipitate intimacy of her relations with colonel de craye willoughbys boast of his implacable character was to blame she was at war with him and she was compelled to put the case in that light crossjay must be shielded from one who could not spare an offender so colonel de craye quite naturally was called on for his help and the colonels dexterous aid appeared to her more admirable than alarming nevertheless she would not have answered a direct question falsely she was for the fib but not the lie at a word she could be disdainful of subterfuges her look said that willoughby perceived it she had written him a letter of three lines there were but three and she had destroyed the letter something perchance was repented by her then she had done him an injury between his wrath at the suspicion of an injury and the prudence enjoined by his abject coveting of her he consented to be fooled for the sake of vengeance and something besides well here you are safe i have you said he with courtly exultation and that is better than your handwriting i have been all over the country after you why did you we are not in a barbarous land said clara crossjay talks of your visiting a sick child my loveyou have changed your dress you see the boy declared you were going to that farm of hoppners and some cottage i met at my gates a tramping vagabond who swore to seeing you and the boy in a totally contrary direction did you give him money i fancy so then he was paid for having seen me willoughby tossed his head it might be as she suggested beggars are liars but who sheltered you my dear clara you had not been heard of at hoppners the people have been indemnified for their pains to pay them more would be to spoil them you disperse money too liberally there was no fever in the place who could have anticipated such a downpour i want to consult miss dale on the important theme of a dress i think of wearing at mrs mountstuarts tonight do she is unerring she has excellent taste she dresses very simply herself but it becomes her she is one of the few women whom i feel i could not improve with a touch she has judgement he reflected and repeated his encomium the shadow of a dimple in claras cheek awakened him to the idea that she had struck him somewhere and certainly he would never again be able to put up the fiction of her jealousy of laetitia what then could be this girls motive for praying to be released the interrogation humbled him he fled from the answer willoughby went in search of de craye that sprightly intriguer had no intention to let himself be caught solus he was undiscoverable until the assembly sounded when clara dropped a public word or two and he spoke in perfect harmony with her after that he gave his company to willoughby for an hour at billiards and was well beaten the announcement of a visit of mrs mountstuart jenkinson took the gentlemen to the drawingroom rather suspecting that something stood in the way of her dinnerparty as it happened she was lamenting only the loss of one of the jewels of the party to wit the great professor crooklyn invited to meet dr middleton at her table and she related how she had driven to the station by appointment the professor being notoriously a botherheaded traveller as was shown by the fact that he had missed his train in town for he had not arrived nothing had been seen of him she cited vernon whitford for her authority that the train had been inspected and the platform scoured to find the professor and so said she i drove home your green man to dry him he was wet through and chattering the man was exactly like a skeleton wrapped in a sponge and if he escapes a cold he must be as invulnerable as he boasts himself these athletes are terrible boasters they climb their alps to crow said clara excited by her apprehension that mrs mountstuart would speak of having seen the colonel near the station there was a laugh and colonel de craye laughed loudly as it flashed through him that a quickwitted impressionable girl like miss middleton must before his arrival at the hall have speculated on such obdurate clay as vernon whitford was with humourous despair at his uselessness to her glancing round he saw vernon standing fixed in a stare at the young lady you heard that whitford he said and claras face betokening an extremer contrition than he thought was demanded the colonel rallied the alpine climber for striving to be the tallest of themsignor excelsiorand described these conquerors of mountains pancaked on the rocks in desperate embraces bleached here burned there barked all over all to be able to say they had been up so highhad conquered another mountain he was extravagantly funny and selfsatisfied a conqueror of the sex having such different rewards of enterprise vernon recovered in time to accept the absurdities heaped on him climbing peaks wont compare with hunting a wriggler said he his allusion to the incessant pursuit of young crossjay to pin him to lessons was appreciated clara felt the thread of the look he cast from herself to colonel de craye she was helpless if he chose to misjudge her colonel de craye did not crossjay had the misfortune to enter the drawingroom while mrs mountstuart was compassionating vernon for his ducking in pursuit of the wriggler which de craye likened to going through the river after his eel and immediately there was a crossquestioning of the boy between de craye and willoughby on the subject of his latest truancy each gentleman trying to run him down in a palpable fib they were succeeding brilliantly when vernon put a stop to it by marching him off to hard labour mrs mountstuart was led away to inspect the beautiful porcelain service the present of lady busshe porcelain again she said to willoughby and would have signalled to the dainty rogue to come with them had not clara been leaning over to laetitia talking to her in an attitude too graceful to be disturbed she called his attention to it slightly wondering at his impatience she departed to meet an afternoon train on the chance that it would land the professor but tell dr middleton said she i fear i shall have no one worthy of him and she added to willoughby as she walked out to her carriage i shall expect you to do the greatgunnery talk at table miss dale keeps it up with him best said willoughby she does everything best but my dinnertable is involved and i cannot count on a young woman to talk across it i would hire a lion of a menagerie if one were handy rather than have a famous scholar at my table unsupported by another famous scholar doctor middleton would ride down a duke when the wine is in him he will terrify my poor flock the truth is we cant leaven him i foresee undigested lumps of conversation unless you devote yourself i will devote myself said willoughby i can calculate on colonel de craye and our porcelain beauty for any quantity of sparkles if you promise that they play well together you are not to be one of the gods tonight but a kind of jupiters cupbearerjunos if you like and lady busshe and lady culmer and all your admirers shall know subsequently what you have done you see my alarm i certainly did not rank professor crooklyn among the possibly faithless or i never would have ventured on doctor middleton at my table my dinnerparties have hitherto been all successes naturally i feel the greater anxiety about this one for a single failure is all the more conspicuous the exception is everlastingly cited it is not so much what people say but my own sentiments i hate to fail however if you are true we may do whenever the great gun goes off i will fall on my face madam something of that sort said the dame smiling and leaving him to reflect on the egoism of women for the sake of her dinnerparty he was to be a cipher in attendance on dr middleton and clara and de craye were to be encouraged in sparkling together and it happened that he particularly wished to shine the admiration of his county made him believe he had a flavour in general society that was not yet distinguished by his bride and he was to relinquish his opportunity in order to please mrs mountstuart had she been in the pay of his rival she could not have stipulated for more he remembered young crossjays instant quietude after struggling in his grasp when clara laid her hand on the boy and from that infinitesimal circumstance he deduced the boys perception of a differing between himself and his bride and a transfer of crossjays allegiance from him to her she shone she had the gift of female beauty the boy was attracted to it that boy must be made to feel his treason but the point of the cogitation was that similarly were clara to see her affianced shining as shine he could when lighted up by admirers there was the probability that the sensation of her littleness would animate her to take aim at him once more and then was the time for her chastisement a visit to dr middleton in the library satisfied him that she had not been renewing her entreaties to leave patterne no the miserable coquette had now her pastime and was content to stay deceit was in the air he heard the sound of the shuttle of deceit without seeing it but on the whole mindful of what he had dreaded during the hours of her absence he was rather flattered witheringly flattered what was it that he had dreaded nothing less than news of her running away indeed a silly fancy a lovers fancy yet it had led him so far as to suspect after parting with de craye in the rain that his friend and his bride were in collusion and that he should not see them again he had actually shouted on the rainy road the theatric call fooled one of the stagecries which are cries of nature particularly the cry of nature with men who have driven other men to the cry constantia durham had taught him to believe women capable of explosions of treason at half a minutes notice and strangely to prove that women are all of a pack she had worn exactly the same placidity of countenance just before she fled as clara yesterday and today no nervousness no flushes no twitches of the brows but smoothness ease of manneran elegant sisterliness one might almost say as if the creature had found a midway and borderline to walk on between cruelty and kindness and between repulsion and attraction so that up to the verge of her breath she did forcefully attract repelling at one foots length with her armour of chill serenity not with any disdain with no passion such a line as she herself pursued she indicated to him on a neighbouring parallel the passion in her was like a place of waves evaporated to a crust of salt claras resemblance to constantia in this instance was ominous for him whose tragic privilege it had been to fold each of them in his arms and weigh on their eyelids and see the dissolving mistdeeps in their eyes it was horrible once more the comparison overcame him constantia he could condemn for revealing too much to his manly sight she had met him almost halfway well that was complimentary and sanguine but her frankness was a baldness often rendering it doubtful which of the two lady or gentleman was the object of the chasean extreme perplexity to his manly soul now claras inner spirit was shyer shy as a doe down those rosetinged abysses she allured both the lover and the hunter forests of heavenliness were in her flitting eyes here the difference of these fair women made his present fate an intolerable anguish for if constantia was like certain of the ladies whom he had rendered unhappy triumphed over as it is queerly called clara was not her individuality as a woman was a thing he had to bow to it was impossible to roll her up in the sex and bestow a kick on the travelling bundle hence he loved her though she hurt him hence his wretchedness and but for the hearty sincerity of his faith in the self he loved likewise and more he would have been hangdog abject as for de craye willoughby recollected his own exploits too proudly to put his trust in a man that fatal conjunction of temper and policy had utterly thrown him off his guard or he would not have trusted the fellow even in the first hour of his acquaintance with clara but he had wished her to be amused while he wove his plans to retain her at the hallpartly imagining that she would weary of his neglect vile delusion in truth he should have given festivities he should have been the sun of a circle and have revealed himself to her in his more dazzling form he went near to calling himself foolish after the tremendous reverberation of fooled had ceased to shake him how behave it slapped the poor gentlemans pride in the face to ask a private talk with her would rouse her to renew her supplications he saw them flickering behind the girls transparent calmness that calmness really drew its dead ivory hue from the suppression of them something as much he guessed and he was not sure either of his temper or his policy if he should hear her repeat her profane request an impulse to address himself to vernon and discourse with him jocularly on the childish whim of a young lady moved perhaps by some whiff of jealousy to shun the yoke was checked he had always taken so superior a pose with vernon that he could not abandon it for a moment on such a subject too besides vernon was one of your men who entertain the ideas about women of fellows that have never conquered one or only one we will say in his case knowing his secret history and that one no flag to boast of densely ignorant of the sex his nincompoopish idealizations at other times preposterous would now be annoying he would probably presume on claras inconceivable lapse of dignity to read his master a lecture he was quite equal to a philippic upon womans rights this man had not been afraid to say that he talked common sense to women he was an example of the consequence another result was that vernon did not talk sense to men willoughbys wrath at claras exposure of him to his cousin dismissed the proposal of a colloquy so likely to sting his temper and so certain to diminish his loftiness unwilling to speak to anybody he was isolated yet consciously begirt by the mysterious action going on all over the house from clara and de craye to laetitia and young crossjay down to barclay the maid his blind sensitiveness felt as we may suppose a spider to feel when plucked from his own web and set in the centre of anothers laetitia looked her share in the mystery a burden was on her eyelashes how she could have come to any suspicion of the circumstances he was unable to imagine her intense personal sympathy it might be he thought so with some gentle pity for herof the paternal patback order of pity she adored him by decree of venus and the goddess had not decreed that he should find consolation in adoring her nor could the temptings of prudent counsel in his head induce him to run the risk of such a total turnover as the incurring of laetitias pity of himself by confiding in her he checked that impulse also and more sovereignly for him to be pitied by laetitia seemed an upsetting of the scheme of providence providence otherwise the discriminating dispensation of the good things of life had made him the beacon her the bird she was really the last person to whom he could unbosom the idea of his being in a position that suggested his doing so thrilled him with fits of rage and it appalled him there appeared to be another power the same which had humiliated him once was menacing him anew for it could not be providence whose favourite he had ever been we must have a couple of powers to account for discomfort when egoism is the kernel of our religion benevolence had singled him for uncommon benefits malignancy was at work to rob him of them and you think well of the world do you of necessity he associated clara with the darker power pointing the knife at the quick of his pride still he would have raised her weeping he would have stanched her wounds bleeding he had an infinite thirst for her misery that he might ease his heart of its charitable love or let her commit herself and be cast off only she must commit herself glaringly and be cast off by the world as well contemplating her in the form of a discarded weed he had a catch of the breath she was fair he implored his power that horace de craye might not be the man why any man an illness fever fire runaway horses personal disfigurement a laming were sufficient and then a formal and noble offer on his part to keep to the engagement with the unhappy wreck yes and to lead the limping thing to the altar if she insisted his imagination conceived it and the worlds applause besides nausea together with a sense of duty to his line extinguished that loathsome prospect of a mate though without obscuring his chivalrous devotion to his gentlemans word of honour which remained in his mind to compliment him permanently on the whole he could reasonably hope to subdue her to admiration he drank a glass of champagne at his dressing an unaccustomed act but as he remarked casually to his man pollington for whom the rest of the bottle was left he had taken no horseexercise that day having to speak to vernon on business he went to the schoolroom where he discovered clara beautiful in full evening attire with her arm on young crossjays shoulder and heard that the hard taskmaster had abjured mrs mountstuarts party and had already excused himself intending to keep crossjay to the grindstone willoughby was for the boy as usual and more sparklingly than usual clara looked at him in some surprise he rallied vernon with great zest quite silencing him when he said i bear witness that the fellow was here at his regular hour for lessons and were you he laid his hand on crossjay touching claras you will remember what i told you crossjay said she rising from the seat gracefully to escape the touch it is my command crossjay frowned and puffed but only if im questioned he said certainly she replied then i question the rascal said willoughby causing a start what sir is your opinion of miss middleton in her robe of state this evening now the truth crossjay clara held up a finger and the boy could see she was playing at archness but for willoughby it was earnest the truth is not likely to offend you or me either he murmured to her i wish him never never on any excuse to speak anything else i always did think her a beauty crossjay growled he hated the having to say it there exclaimed sir willoughby and bent extending an arm to her you have not suffered from the truth my clara her answer was i was thinking how he might suffer if he were taught to tell the reverse oh for a fair lady that is the worst of teaching willoughby well leave it to the fellows instinct he has our blood in him i could convince you though if i might cite circumstances yes but yes and yes again the entire truth cannot invariably be told i venture to say it should not you would pardon it for the fair lady applaud my love he squeezed the hand within his arm contemplating her she was arrayed in a voluminous robe of pale blue silk vapourous with trimmings of light gauze of the same hue gaze de chambery matching her fair hair and dear skin for the complete overthrow of less inflammable men than willoughby clara sighed be if so it would really be generous she said though the teaching h bad i fancy i can be generous do we ever know he turned his head to vernon issuing brief succinct instructions for letters to be written and drew her into the hall saying know there are people who do not know themselves and as they are the majority they manufacture the axioms and it is assumed that we have to swallow them i may observe that i think i know i decline to be engulphed in those majorities among them but not of them i know this that my aim in life is to be generous is it not an impulse or disposition rather than an aim so much i know pursued willoughby refusing to be tripped but she rang discordantly in his ear his fancy that he could be generous and his aim at being generous had met with no response i have given proofs he said briefly to drop a subject upon which he was not permitted to dilate and he murmured people acquainted with me she was asked if she expected him to boast of generous deeds from childhood she heard him mutter and she said to herself release me and you shall be everything the unhappy gentleman ached as he talked for with men and with hosts of women to whom he was indifferent never did he converse in this shambling thirdrate sheepish manner devoid of all highness of tone and the proper precision of an authority he was unable to fathom the cause of it but clara imposed it on him and only in anger could he throw it off the temptation to an outburst that would flatter him with the sound of his authoritative voice had to be resisted on a night when he must be composed if he intended to shine so he merely mentioned lady busshes present to gratify spleen by preparing the ground for dissension and prudently acquiesced in her anticipated slipperiness she would rather not look at it now she said not now very well said he his immediate deference made her regretful there is hardly time willoughby my dear we shall have to express our thanks to her i cannot his arm contracted sharply he was obliged to be silent dr middleton laetitia and the ladies eleanor and isabel joining them in the hall found two figures linked together in a shadowy indication of halves that have fallen apart and hang on the last thread of junction willoughby retained her hand on his arm he held to it as the symbol of their alliance and oppressed the girls nerves by contact with a frame labouring for breath de craye looked on them from overhead the carriages were at the door and willoughby said wheres horace i suppose hes taking a final shot at his book of anecdotes and neat collection of irishisms no replied the colonel descending thats a spring works of itself and has discovered the secret of continuous motion mores the pityunless youll be pleased to make it of use to science he gave a laugh of goodhumour your laughter horace is a capital comment on your wit willoughby said it with the air of one who has flicked a whip tis a genial advertisement of a vacancy said de craye precisely three parts auctioneer to one for the property oh if you have a musical quack score it a point in his favour willoughby though you dont swallow his drug if he means to be musical let him keep time am i late said de craye to the ladies proving himself an adept in the art of being gracefully vanquished and so winning tender hearts willoughby had refreshed himself at the back of his mind there was a suspicion that his adversary would not have yielded so flatly without an assurance of practically triumphing secretly getting the better of him and it filled him with venom for a further bout at the next opportunity but as he had been sarcastic and mordant he had shown clara what he could do in a way of speaking different from the lamentable cooing stuff gasps and feeble protestations to which he knew not how she reduced him sharing the opinion of his race that blunt personalities or the pugilistic form administered directly on the salient features are exhibitions of mastery in such encounters he felt strong and solid eager for the successes of the evening de craye was in the first carriage as escort to the ladies eleanor and isabel willoughby with clara laetitia and dr middleton followed all silent for the rev doctor was ostensibly pondering and willoughby was damped a little when he unlocked his mouth to say and yet i have not observed that colonel de craye is anything of a celtiberian egnatius meriting fustigation for an untimely display of wellwhitened teeth sir quicquid est ubicunque est quodcunque agit renidetha a morbus neither charming nor urbane to the general eye however consolatory to the actor but this gentleman does not offend so or i am so strangely prepossessed in his favour as to be an incompetent witness dr middletons persistent ha eh upon an honest frown of inquiry plucked an answer out of willoughby that was meant to be humourously scornful and soon became apologetic under the doctors interrogatively grasping gaze these irishmen willoughby said will play the professional jester as if it were an office they were born to we must play critic now and then otherwise we should have them deluging us with their joe millerisms with their omillerisms you would say perhaps willoughby did his duty to the joke but the rev doctor though he wore the paternal smile of a man that has begotten hilarity was not perfectly propitiated and pursued nor to my apprehension is the mans laugh the comment on his wit unchallengeably new instances of cousinship germane to the phrase will recur to you but it has to be noted that it was a phrase of assault it was ostentatiously battery and i would venture to remind you friend that among the elect considering that it is as fatally facile to spring the laugh upon a man as to deprive him of his life considering that we have only to condescend to the weapon and that the more popular necessarily the more murderous that weapon isamong the elect to which it is your distinction to aspire to belong the rule holds to abstain from any employment of the obvious the percoct and likewise for your own sake from the epitonic the overstrained for if the former by readily assimilating with the understandings of your audience are empowered to commit assassination on your victim the latter come under the charge of unseemliness inasmuch as they are a description of public suicide assuming then manslaughter to be your pastime and harikari not to be your bent the phrase to escape criminality must rise in you as you would have it fall on him ex improviso am i right i am in the habit of thinking it impossible sir that you can be in error said willoughby dr middleton left it the more emphatic by saying nothing further both his daughter and miss dale who had disapproved the waspish snap at colonel de craye were in wonderment of the art of speech which could so soothingly inform a gentleman that his behaviour had not been gentlemanly willoughby was damped by what he comprehended of it for a few minutes in proportion as he realized an evening with his ancient admirers he was restored and he began to marvel greatly at his folly in not giving banquets and balls instead of making a solitude about himself and his bride for solitude thought he is good for the man the man being a creature consumed by passion womans love on the contrary will only be nourished by the reflex light she catches of you in the eyes of others she having no passion of her own but simply an instinct driving her to attach herself to whatsoever is most largely admired most shining so thinking he determined to change his course of conduct and he was happier in the first gush of our wisdom drawn directly from experience there is a mental intoxication that cancels the old world and establishes a new one not allowing us to ask whether it is too late chapter xxx treating of the dinnerparty at mrs mountstuart jenkinsons vernon and young crossjay had tolerably steady work together for a couple of hours varied by the arrival of a plate of meat on a tray for the master and some interrogations put to him from time to time by the boy in reference to miss middleton crossjay made the discovery that if he abstained from alluding to miss middletons beauty he might water his dusty path with her name nearly as much as he liked mention of her beauty incurred a reprimand on the first occasion his master was wistful isnt she glorious crossjay fancied he had started a sovereign receipt for blessed deviations he tried it again but paedagoguethunder broke over his head yes only i cant understand what she means mr whitford he excused himself first i was not to tell i know i wasnt because she said so she quite as good as said so her last words were mind crossjay you know nothing about me when i stuck to that beast of a tramp whos a walking moral and gets money out of people by snuffling it attend to your lesson or youll be one said vernon yes but mr whitford now i am to tell im to answer straight out to every question miss middleton is anxious that you should be truthful yes but in the morning she told me not to tell she was in a hurry she has it on her conscience that you may have misunderstood her and she wishes you never to be guilty of an untruth least of all on her account crossjay committed an unspoken resolution to the air in a violent sigh ah and said if i were sure do as she bids you my boy but i dont know what it is she wants hold to her last words to you so i do if she told me to run till i dropped on id go she told you to study your lessons do that crossjay buckled to his book invigorated by an imagination of his liege lady on the page after a studious interval until the impression of his lady had subsided he resumed shes so funny shes just like a girl and then shes a lady too shes my idea of a princess and colonel de craye wasnt he taught dancing when he says something funny he ducks and seems to be setting to his partner i should like to be as clever as her father that is a clever man i dare say colonel de craye will dance with her tonight i wish i was there its a dinnerparty not a dance vernon forced himself to say to dispel that ugly vision isnt it sir i thought they danced after dinnerparties mr whitford have you ever seen her run vernon pointed him to his task they were silent for a lengthened period but does miss middleton mean me to speak out if sir willoughby asks me said crossjay certainly you neednt make much of it alls plain and simple but im positive mr whitford he wasnt to hear of her going to the postoffice with me before breakfast and how did colonel de craye find her and bring her back with that old flitch hes a man and can go where he pleases and id have found her too give me the chance you know im fond of miss dale but sheim very fond of herbut you cant think shes a girl as well and about miss dale when she says a thing there it is clear but miss middleton has a lot of meanings never mind i go by whats inside and im pretty sure to please her take your chin off your hand and your elbow off the book and fix yourself said vernon wrestling with the seduction of crossjays idolatry for miss middletons appearance had been preternaturally sweet on her departure and the next pleasure to seeing her was hearing of her from the lips of this passionate young poet remember that you please her by speaking truth vernon added and laid himself open to questions upon the truth by which he learnt with a perplexed sense of envy and sympathy that the boys idea of truth strongly approximated to his conception of what should be agreeable to miss middleton he was lonely bereft of the bard when he had tucked crossjay up in his bed and left him books he could not read thoughts were disturbing a seat in the library and a stupid stare helped to pass the hours and but for the spot of sadness moving meditation in spite of his effort to stun himself he would have borne a happy resemblance to an idiot in the sun he had verily no command of his reason she was too beautiful whatever she did was best that was the refrain of the fountainsong in him the burden being her whims variations inconsistencies wiles her tremblings between good and naughty that might be stamped to noble or to terrible her sincereness her duplicity her courage cowardice possibilities for heroism and for treachery by dint of dwelling on the theme he magnified the young lady to extraordinary stature and he had sense enough to own that her character was yet liquid in the mould and that she was a creature of only naturally youthful wildness provoked to freakishness by the ordeal of a situation shrewd as any that can happen to her sex in civilized life but he was compelled to think of her extravagantly and he leaned a little to the discrediting of her because her actual image ummanned him and was unbearable and to say at the end of it she is too beautiful whatever she does is best smoothed away the wrong he did her had it been in his power he would have thought of her in the abstractthe stage contiguous to that which he adopted but the attempt was luckless the stagyrite would have faded in it what philosopher could have set down that face of sun and breeze and nymph in shadow as a point in a problem the library door was opened at midnight by miss dale she dosed it quietly you are not working mr whitford i fancied you would wish to hear of the evening professor crooklyn arrived after all mrs mountstuart is bewildered she says she expected you and that you did not excuse yourself to her and she cannot comprehend et caetera that is to say she chooses bewilderment to indulge in the exclamatory she must be very much annoyed the professor did come by the train she drove to meet i thought it probable said vernon he had to remain a couple of hours at the railway inn no conveyance was to be found for him he thinks he has caught a cold and cannot stifle his fretfulness about it he may be as learned as doctor middleton he has not the same happy constitution nothing more unfortunate could have occurred he spoilt the party mrs mountstuart tried petting him which drew attention to him and put us all in his key for several awkward minutes more than once she lost her head she was unlike herself i may be presumptuous in criticizing her but should not the president of a dinnertable treat it like a battlefield and let the guest that sinks descend and not allow the voice of a discordant however illustrious to rule it of course it is when i see failures that i fancy i could manage so well comparison is prudently reserved in the other cases i am a daring critic no doubt because i know i shall never be tried by experiment i have no ambition to be tried she did not notice a smile of vernons and continued mrs mountstuart gave him the lead upon any subject he chose i thought the professor never would have ceased talking of a young lady who had been at the inn before him drinking hot brandy and water with a gentleman how did he hear of that cried vernon roused by the malignity of the fates from the landlady trying to comfort him and a story of her lending shoes and stockings while those of the young lady were drying he has the dreadful snappish humourous way of recounting which impresses it the table took up the subject of this remarkable young lady and whether she was a lady of the neighbourhood and who she could be that went abroad on foot in heavy rain it was painful to me i knew enough to be sure of who she was did she betray it no did willoughby look at her without suspicion then then colonel de craye was diverting us and he was very amusing mrs mountstuart told him afterward that he ought to be paid salvage for saving the wreck of her party sir willoughby was a little too cynical he talked well what he said was good but it was not goodhumoured he has not the reckless indifference of colonel de craye to uttering nonsense that amusement may come of it and in the drawingroom he lost such gaiety as he had i was close to mrs mountstuart when professor crooklyn approached her and spoke in my hearing of that gentleman and that young lady they were you could see by his nods colonel de craye and miss middleton and she at once mentioned it to willoughby colonel de craye gave her no chance if she sought it he courted her profusely behind his rattle he must have brains it ran in all directions to entertain her and her circle willoughby knows nothing i cannot judge he stood with mrs mountstuart a minute as we were taking leave she looked strange i heard her say the rogue he laughed she lifted her shoulders he scarcely opened his mouth on the way home the thing must run its course vernon said with the philosophical air which is desperation rendered decorous willoughby deserves it a man of full growth ought to know that nothing on earth tempts providence so much as the binding of a young woman against her will those two are mutually attracted theyre both they meet and the mischiefs done both are bright he can persuade with a word another might discourse like an angel and it would be useless i said everything i could think of to no purpose and so it is there are those attractionsjust as with her willoughby is the reverse he repels im in about the same predicamentor should be if she were plighted to me that is for the length of five minutes about the space of time i should require for the formality of handing her back her freedom how a sane man can imagine a girl like that but if she has changed she has changed you cant conciliate a withered affection this detaining her and tricking and not listening only increases her aversion she learns the art in turn here she is detained by fresh plots to keep dr middleton at the hall thats true is it not he saw that it was no shes not to blame she has told him her mind he wont listen the question then is whether she keeps to her word or breaks it its a dispute between a conventional idea of obligation and an injury to her nature which is the more dishonourable thing to do why you and i see in a moment that her feelings guide her best its one of the few cases in which nature may be consulted like an oracle is she so sure of her nature said miss dale you may doubt it i do not i am surprised at her coming back de craye is a man of the world and advised it i suppose hewell i never had the persuasive tongue and my failing doesnt count for much but the suddenness of the intimacy the disaster is rather famous at first sight he came in a fortunate hour for him a pigmys a giant if he can manage to arrive in season did you not notice that there was danger at their second or third glance you counselled me to hang on here where the amount of good i do in proportion to what i have to endure is microscopic it was against your wishes i know said laetitia and when the words were out she feared that they were tentative her delicacy shrank from even seeming to sound him in relation to a situation so delicate as miss middletons the same sentiment guarded him from betraying himself and he said partly against we both foresaw the possiblebecause like most prophets we knew a little more of circumstances enabling us to see the fatal a pigmy would have served but de craye is a handsome intelligent pleasant fellow sir willoughbys friend well in these affairs a great deal must be charged on the goddess that is really pagan fatalism our modern word for it is nature science condescends to speak of natural selection look at these they are both graceful and winning and witty bright to mind and eye made for one another as country people say i cant blame him besides we dont know that hes guilty were quite in the dark except that were certain how it must end if the chance should occur to you of giving willoughby a word of counselit mayyou might without irritating him as my knowledge of his plight does hint at your eyes being open his insane dread of a detective world makes him artificially blind as soon as he fancies himself seen he sets to work spinning a web and he discerns nothing else its generally a clever kind of web but if its a tangle to others its the same to him and a veil as well he is preparing the catastrophe he forces the issue tell him of her extreme desire to depart treat her as mad to soothe him otherwise one morning he will wake a second time it is perfectly certain and the second time it will be entirely his own fault inspire him with some philosophy i have none i if i thought so i would say you have better there are two kinds of philosophy mine and yours mine comes of coldness yours of devotion he is unlikely to choose me for his confidante vernon meditated one can never quite guess what he will do from never knowing the heat of the centre in him which precipitates his actions he has a great art of concealment as to me as you perceive my views are too philosophical to let me be of use to any of them i blame only the one who holds to the bond the sooner i am gonein fact i cannot stay on so dr middleton and the professor did not strike fire together doctor middleton was ready and pursued him but professor crooklyn insisted on shivering his line of blank verse a railway platform and a railway inn became pathetic in repetition he must have suffered somebody has to why the innocent he arrives a propos but remember that fridolin sometimes contrives to escape and have the guilty scorched the professor would not have suffered if he had missed his train as he appears to be in the habit of doing thus his unaccustomed goodfortune was the cause of his bad you saw him on the platform i am unacquainted with the professor i had to get mrs mountstuart out of the way she says she described him to you complexion of a sweetbread consistency of a quenelle grey and like a saint without his dish behind the head her descriptions are strikingly accurate but she forgot to sketch his back and all that i saw was a narrow sloping back and a broad hat resting the brim on it my report to her spoke of an old gentleman of dark complexion as the only traveller on the platform she has faith in the efficiency of her descriptive powers and so she was willing to drive off immediately the intention was a start to london colonel de craye came up and effected in five minutes what i could not compass in thirty but you saw colonel de craye pass you my work was done i should have been an intruder besides i was acting wet jacket with mrs mountstuart to get her to drive off fast or she might have jumped out in search of her professor herself she says you were lean as a fork with the wind whistling through the prongs you see how easy it is to deceive one who is an artist in phrases avoid them miss dale they dazzle the penetration of the composer that is why people of ability like mrs mountstuart see so little they are so bent on describing brilliantly however she is kind and charitable at heart i have been considering tonight that to cut this knot as it is now miss middleton might do worse than speak straight out to mrs mountstuart no one else would have such influence with willoughby the simple fact of mrs mountstuarts knowing of it would be almost enough but courage would be required for that goodnight miss dale goodnight mr whitford you pardon me for disturbing you vernon pressed her hand reassuringly he had but to look at her and review her history to think his cousin willoughby punished by just retribution indeed for any maltreatment of the dear boy love by man or by woman coming under your cognizance you if you be of common soundness shall behold the retributive blow struck in your time miss dale retired thinking how like she and vernon were to one another in the toneless condition they had achieved through sorrow he succeeded in masking himself from her owing to her awe of the circumstances she reproached herself for not having the same devotion to the cold idea of duty as he had and though it provoked inquiry she would not stop to ask why he had left miss middleton a prey to the sparkling colonel it seemed a proof of the philosophy he preached as she was passing by young crossjays bedroom door a face appeared sir willoughby slowly emerged and presented himself in his full length beseeching her to banish alarm he said it in a hushed voice with a face qualified to create sentiment are you tired sleepy said he she protested that she was not she intended to read for an hour he begged to have the hour dedicated to him i shall be relieved by conversing with a friend no subterfuge crossed her mind she thought his midnight visit to the boys bedside a pretty feature in him she was full of pity too she yielded to the strange request feeling that it did not become an old woman to attach importance even to the public discovery of midnight interviews involving herself as one and feeling also that she was being treated as an old friend in the form of a very old woman her mind was bent on arresting any recurrence to the project she had so frequently outlined in the tongue of innuendo of which because of her repeated tremblings under it she thought him a master he conducted her along the corridor to the private sittingroom of the ladies eleanor and isabel deceit he said while lighting the candles on the mantelpiece she was earnestly compassionate and a word that could not relate to her personal destinies refreshed her by displacing her apprehensive antagonism and giving pity free play chapter xxxi sir willoughby attempts and achieves pathos both were seated apparently he would have preferred to watch her dark downcast eyelashes in silence under sanction of his air of abstract meditation and the melancholy superinducing it bloodcolour was in her cheeks the party had inspirited her features might it be that lively company an absence of economical solicitudes and a flourishing home were all she required to make her bloom again the supposition was not hazardous in presence of her heightened complexion she raised her eyes he could not meet her look without speaking can you forgive deceit it would be to boast of more charity than i know myself to possess were i to say that i can sir willoughby i hope i am able to forgive i cannot tell i should like to say yes could you live with the deceiver no no i could have given that answer for you no semblance of union should be maintained between the deceiver and ourselves laetitia sir willoughby have i no right to your name if it pleases you to i speak as my thoughts run and they did not know a miss dale so well as a dear laetitia my truest friend you have talked with clara middleton we had a conversation her brevity affrighted him he flew off in a cloud reverting to that question of deceivers is it not your opinion that to pardon to condone is to corrupt society by passing off as pure what is false do we not he wore the smile of haggard playfulness of a convalescent child the first day back to its toys laetitia do we not impose a counterfeit on the currency supposing it to be really deception apart from my loathing of deception of falseness in any shape upon any grounds i hold it an imperious duty to expose punish off with it i take it to be one of the forms of noxiousness which a good citizen is bound to extirpate i am not myself good citizen enough i confess for much more than passive abhorrence i do not forgive i am at heart serious and i cannot forgivethere is no possible reconciliation there can be only an ostensible truce between the two hostile powers dividing this world she glanced at him quickly good and evil he said her face expressed a surprise relapsing on the heart he spelt the puckers of her forehead to mean that she feared he might be speaking unchristianly you will find it so in all religions my dear laetitia the hindoo the persian ours it is universal an experience of our humanity deceit and sincerity cannot live together truth must kill the lie or the lie will kill truth i do not forgive all i say to the person is go but that is right that is generous exclaimed laetitia glad to approve him for the sake of escaping her critical soul and relieved by the idea of claras difficulty solved capable of generosity perhaps he mused aloud she wounded him by not supplying the expected enthusiastic asseveration of her belief in his general tendency to magnanimity he said after a pause but the world is not likely to be impressed by anything not immediately gratifying it people change i find as we increase in years we cease to be the heroes we were i myself am insensible to change i do not admit the charge except in this we will say personal ambition i have it no more and what is it when we have it decidedly a confession of inferiority that is the desire to be distinguished is an acknowledgement of insufficiency but i have still the craving for my dearest friends to think well of me a weakness call it so not a dishonourable weakness laetitia racked her brain for the connection of his present speech with the preceding dialogue she was baffled from not knowing the heat of the centre in him as vernon opaquely phrased it in charity to the object of her worship well said he unappeased and besides the passion to excel i have changed somewhat in the heartiness of my thirst for the amusements incident to my station i do not care to keep a studi was once tempted nor hounds and i can remember the day when i determined to have the best kennels and the best breed of horses in the kingdom puerile what is distinction of that sort or of any acquisition and accomplishment we ask ones self is not the greater to seek it owns to our smallness in real fact and when it is attained what then my horses are good they are admired i challenge the county to surpass them well these are but my horses the praise is of the animals not of me i decline to share in it yet i know men content to swallow the praise of their beasts and be semiequine the littleness of ones fellows in the mob of life is a very strange experience one may regret to have lost the simplicity of ones forefathers which could accept those and other distinctions with a cordial pleasure not to say pride as for instance i am as it is called a dead shot give your acclamations gentlemen to my ancestors from whom i inherited a steady hand and quick sight they do not touch me where i do not find myselfthat i am essentially ino applause can move me to speak to you as i would speak to none admirationyou know that in my early youth i swam in flatteryi had to swim to avoid drowningadmiration of my personal gifts has grown tasteless changed therefore inasmuch as there has been a growth of spirituality we are all in submission to mortal laws and so far i have indeed changed i may add that it is unusual for country gentlemen to apply themselves to scientific researches these are however in the spirit of the time i apprehended that instinctively when at college i forsook the classics for science and thereby escaped the vice of domineering selfsufficiency peculiar to classical men of which you had an amusing example in the carriage on the way to mrs mountstuarts this evening science is modest slow if you like it deals with facts and having mastered them it masters men of necessity not with a stupid loudmouthed arrogance words big and oddly garbed as the popes bodyguard of course one bows to the infallible we must when his giantmercenaries level bayonets sir willoughby offered miss dale half a minute that she might in gentle feminine fashion acquiesce in the implied reproof of dr middletons behaviour to him during the drive to mrs mountstuarts she did not her heart was accusing clara of having done it a wrong and a hurt for while he talked he seemed to her to justify claras feelings and her conduct and her own reawakened sensations of injury came to the surface a moment to look at him affirming that they pardoned him and pitied but hardly wondered the heat of the centre in him had administered the comfort he wanted though the conclusive accordant notes he loved on womans lips that subservient harmony of another instrument desired of musicians when they have done their soloplaying came not to wind up the performance not a single bar she did not speak probably his laetitia was overcome as he had long known her to be when they conversed nervesubdued unable to deploy her mental resources or her musical yet ordinarily she had command of the latterwas she too condoling did a reason exist for it had the impulsive and desperate girl spoken out to laetitia to the fullestshameless daughter of a domineering sire that she was ghastlier inquiry it struck the centre of him with a sounding ring was laetitia pitying him overmuch for worse than the pain of a little difference between loversfor treason on the part of his bride did she know of a rival know more than he when the centre of him was violently struck he was a genius in penetration he guessed that she did know and by this was he presently helped to achieve pathos so my election was for science he continued and if it makes me as i fear a rara avis among country gentlemen it unites me puts me in the main i may say in the only current of progressa word sufficiently despicable in their political jargonyou enjoyed your evening at mrs mountstuarts very greatly she brings her professor to dine here the day after tomorrow does it astonish you you started i did not hear the invitation it was arranged at the table you and i were separatedcruelly i told her she declared that we see enough of one another and that it was good for me that we should be separated neither of which is true i may not have known what is the best for me i do know what is good if in my younger days i egregiously erred that taken of itself alone is assuming me to have sense and feeling the surer proof of present wisdom i can testify in person that wisdom is pain if pain is to add to wisdom let me suffer do you approve of that laetitia it is well said it is felt those who themselves have suffered should know the benefit of the resolution one may have suffered so much as to wish only for peace true but you have you it would be for peace if i prayed for any earthly gift sir willoughby dropped a smile on her i mentioned the popes particoloured bodyguard just now in my youth their singular attire impressed me people tell me they have been reuniformed i am sorry they remain one of my liveliest recollections of the eternal city they affected my sense of humour always alert in me as you are aware we english have humour it is the first thing struck in us when we land on the continent our risible faculties are generally active all through the tour humour or the clash of sense with novel examples of the absurd is our characteristic i do not condescend to boisterous displays of it i observe and note the peoples comicalities for my correspondence but you have read my lettersmost of them if not all many of them i was with you theni was about to saythat swissguard reminded meyou have not been in italy i have constantly regretted it you are the very woman you have the soul for italy i know no other of whom i could say it with whom i should not feel that she was out of place discordant with me italy and laetitia often have i joined you together we shall see i begin to have hopes here you have literally stagnated why a dinnerparty refreshes you what would not travel do and that heavenly climate you are a reader of history and poetry well poetry i never yet saw the poetry that expressed the tenth part of what i feel in the presence of beauty and magnificence and when i really meditateprofoundly call me a positive mind i feel only i feel too intensely for poetry by the nature of it poetry cannot be sincere i will have sincerity whatever touches our emotions should be spontaneous not a craft i know you are in favour of poetry you would win me if any one could but history there i am with you walking over ruins at night the arches of the solemn black amphitheatre pouring moonlight on usthe moonlight of italy you would not laugh there sir willoughby said laetitia rousing herself from a stupor of apprehensive amazement to utter something and realize actual circumstances besides you i think or i am mistaken in youhe deviated from his projected speechyou are not a victim of the sense of association and the ludicrous i can understand the influence of it i have at least a conception of the humourous but ridicule would not strike me in the coliseum of rome i could not bear it no sir willoughby she appeared to be taking him in very strong earnest by thus petitioning him not to laugh in the coliseum and now he said besides you are one who could accommodate yourself to the society of the ladies my aunts good women laetitia i cannot imagine them de trop in italy or in a household i have of course reason to be partial in my judgement they are excellent and most amiable ladies i love them said laetitia fervently the more strongly excited to fervour by her enlightenment as to his drift she read it that he designed to take her to italy with the ladiesafter giving miss middleton her liberty that was necessarily implied and that was truly generous in his boyhood he had been famous for his bountifulness in scattering silver and gold might he not have caused himself to be misperused in later life clara had spoken to her of the visit and mission of the ladies to the library and laetitia daringly conceived herself to be on the certain track of his meaning she being able to enjoy their society as she supposed him to consider that miss middleton did not and would not either abroad or at home sir willoughby asked her you could travel with them indeed i could honestly as affirmatively as one may protest delightedly agreed it is an undertaking he put his hand out whether i be of the party or not to italy laetitia it would give me pleasure to be with you and it will if i must be excluded to think of you in italy his hand was out she had to feign inattention or yield her own she had not the effrontery to pretend not to see and she yielded it he pressed it and whenever it shrunk a quarter inch to withdraw he shook it up and down as an instrument that had been lent him for due emphasis to his remarks and very emphatic an amorous orator can make it upon a captive lady i am unable to speak decisively on that or any subject i am i think you once quoted tossed like a weed on the ocean of myself i can speak i cannot speak for a second person i am infinitely harassed if i could cry to italy tomorrow ah do not set me down for complaining i know the lot of man but laetitia deceit deceit it is a bad taste in the mouth it sickens us of humanity i compare it to an earthquake we lose all our reliance on the solidity of the world it is a betrayal not simply of the person it is a betrayal of humankind my friend constant friend no i will not despair yes i have faults i will remember them only forgiveness is another question yes the injury i can forgive the falseness never in the interests of humanity no so young and such deceit laetitias bosom rose her hand was detained a lady who has yielded it cannot wrestle to have it back those outworks which protect her treacherously shelter the enemy aiming at the citadel when he has taken them in return for the silken armour bestowed on her by our civilization it is exacted that she be soft and civil nigh up to perishingpoint she breathed tremulously high saying on her topbreath if itit may not be so it can scarcely a deep sigh intervened it saddened her that she knew so much for when i love i love said sir willoughby my friends and my servants know that there can be no medium not with me i give all i claim all as i am absorbed so must i absorb we both cancel and create we extinguish and we illumine one another the error may be in the choice of an object it is not in the passion perfect confidence perfect abandonment i repeat i claim it because i give it the selfishness of love may be denounced it is a part of us my answer would be it is an element only of the noblest of us love laetitia i speak of love but one who breaks faith to drag us through the mire who betrays betrays and hands us over to the world whose prey we become identically because of virtues we were educated to think it a blessing to possess tell me the name for thatagain it has ever been a principle with me to respect the sex but if we see women false treacherous why indulge in these abstract views you would ask the world presses them on us full as it is of the vilest specimens they seek to pluck up every rooted principle they sneer at our worship they rob us of our religion this bitter experience of the world drives us back to the antidote of what we knew before we plunged into it of one of something we esteemed and still esteem is that antidote strong enough to expel the poison i hope so i believe so to lose faith in womankind is terrible he studied her she looked distressed she was not moved she was thinking that with the exception of a strain of haughtiness he talked excellently to men at least in the tone of the things he meant to say but that his manner of talking to women went to an excess in the artificial tonguethe tutored tongue of sentimental deference of the towering male he fluted exceedingly and she wondered whether it was this which had wrecked him with miss middleton his intuitive sagacity counselled him to strive for pathos to move her it was a task for while he perceived her to be not ignorant of his plight he doubted her knowing the extent of it and as his desire was merely to move her without an exposure of himself he had to compass being pathetic as it were under the impediments of a mailed and gauntletted knight who cannot easily heave the bosom or show it heaving moreover pathos is a tide often it carries the awakener of it off his feet and whirls him over and over armour and all in ignominious attitudes of helpless prostration whereof he may well be ashamed in the retrospect we cannot quite preserve our dignity when we stoop to the work of calling forth tears moses had probably to take a nimble jump away from the rock after that venerable lawgiver had knocked the water out of it however it was imperative in his mind that he should be sure he had the power to move her he began clumsily at first as yonder gauntletted knight attempting the briny handkerchief what are we we last but a very short time why not live to gratify our appetites i might really ask myself why all the means of satiating them are at my disposal but no i must aim at the highestat that which in my blindness i took for the highest you know the sportsmans instinct laetitia he is not tempted by the stationary object such are we in youth toying with happiness leaving it to aim at the dazzling and attractive we gain knowledge said laetitia at what a cost the exclamation summoned selfpity to his aid and pathos was handy by paying half our lives for it and all our hopes yes we gain knowledge we are the wiser very probably my value surpasses now what it was when i was happier but the loss that youthful bloom of the soul is like health to the body once gone it leaves cripples behind nay my friend and precious friend these four fingers i must retain they seem to me the residue of a wreck you shall be released shortly absolutely laetitia i have nothing else remainingwe have spoken of deception what of being undeceivedwhen one whom we adored is laid bare and the wretched consolation of a worthy object is denied to us no misfortune can be like that were it death we could worship still death would be preferable but may you be spared to know a situation in which the comparison with your inferior is forced on you to your disadvantage and your loss because of your generously giving up your whole heart to the custody of some shallow lightminded self we will not deal in epithets if i were to find as many bad names for the serpent as there are spots on his body it would be serpent still neither better nor worse the loneliness and the darkness our luminary is extinguished selfrespect refuses to continue worshipping but the affection will not be turned aside we are literally in the dust we grovel we would fling away selfrespect if we could we would adopt for a model the creature preferred to us we would humiliate degrade ourselves we cry for justice as if it were for pardon for pardon when we are straining to grant it laetitia murmured and it was as much as she could do she remembered how in her old misery her efforts after charity had twisted her round to feel herself the sinner and beg forgiveness in prayer a noble sentiment that filled her with pity of the bosom in which it had sprung there was no similarity between his idea and hers but her idea had certainly been roused by his word pardon and he had the benefit of it in the moisture of her eyes her lips trembled tears fell he had heard something he had not caught the words but they were manifestly favourable her sign of emotion assured him of it and of the success he had sought there was one woman who bowed to him to all eternity he had inspired one woman with the mysterious mandesired passion of selfabandonment selfimmolation the evidence was before him at any instant he could if he pleased fly to her and command her enthusiasm he had in fact perhaps by sympathetic action succeeded in striking the same springs of pathos in her which animated his lively endeavour to produce it in himself he kissed her hand then released it quitting his chair to bend above her soothingly do not weep laetitia you see that i do not i can smile help me to bear it you must not unman me she tried to stop her crying but selfpity threatened to rain all her long years of grief on her head and she said i must go i am unfit goodnight sir willoughby fearing seriously that he had sunk his pride too low in her consideration and had been carried farther than he intended on the tide of pathos he remarked we will speak about crossjay tomorrow his deceitfulness has been gross as i said i am grievously offended by deception but you are tired goodnight my dear friend goodnight sir willoughby she was allowed to go forth colonel de craye coming up from the smokingroom met her and noticed the state of her eyelids as he wished her goodnight he saw willoughby in the room she had quitted but considerately passed without speaking and without reflecting why he was considerate our heros review of the scene made him on the whole satisfied with his part in it of his power upon one woman he was now perfectly sureclara had agonized him with a doubt of his personal mastery of any one was a poor feast but the pangs of his flesh during the last few days and the latest hours caused him to snatch at it hungrily if contemptuously a poor feast she was yet a fortress a point of succour both shield and lance a cover and an impetus he could now encounter clara boldly should she resist and defy him he would not be naked and alone he foresaw that he might win honour in the worlds eye from his positiona matter to be thought of only in most urgent need the effect on him of his recent exercise in pathos was to compose him to slumber he was for the period well satisfied his attendant imps were well satisfied likewise and danced around about his bed after the vigilant gentleman had ceased to debate on the question of his unveiling of himself past forgiveness of her to laetitia and had surrendered to sleep the present direction of his affairs chapter xxxii laetitia dale discovers a spiritual change and dr middleton a physical clara tripped over the lawn in the early morning to laetitia to greet her she broke away from a colloquy with colonel de craye under sir willoughbys windows the colonel had been one of the bathers and he stood like a circusdriver flicking a wet towel at crossjay capering my dear i am very unhappy said clara my dear i bring you news laetitia replied tell me but the poor boy is to be expelled he burst into crossjays bedroom last night and dragged the sleeping boy out of bed to question him and he had the truth that is one comfort only crossjay is to be driven from the hall because he was untruthful previouslyfor me to serve me really i feel it was at my command crossjay will be out of the way today and has promised to come back at night to try to be forgiven you must help me laetitia you are free clara if you desire it you have but to ask for your freedom you mean he will release you you are sure we had a long conversation last night i owe it to you nothing is owing to me he volunteered it clara made as if to lift her eyes in apostrophe professor crooklyn professor crooklyn i see i did not guess that give credit for some generosity clara you are unjust by and by i will be more than just by and by i will practise on the trumpet i will lecture on the greatness of the souls of men when we know them thoroughly at present we do but half know them and we are unjust you are not deceived laetitia there is to be no speaking to papa no delusions you have agitated me i feel myself a very small person indeed i feel i can understand those who admire him he gives me back my word simply clearly withoutoh that long wrangle in scenes and letters and it will be arranged for papa and me to go not later than tomorrow never shall i be able to explain to any one how i fell into this i am frightened at myself when i think of it i take the whole blame i have been scandalous and dear laetitia you came out so early in order to tell me i wished you to hear it take my heart present me with a partbut for good fie but you have a right to say it i mean no unkindness but is not the heart you allude to an alarmingly searching one selfish it is for i have been forgetting crossjay if we are going to be generous is not crossjay to be forgiven if it were only that the boys father is away fighting for his country endangering his life day by day and for a stipend not enough to support his family we are bound to think of the boy poor dear silly lad with his i say miss middleton why wouldnt some one see my father when he came here to call on him and had to walk back ten miles in the raini could almost fancy that did me mischief but we have a splendid morning after yesterdays rain and we will be generous own laetitia that it is possible to gild the most glorious day of creation doubtless the spirit may do it and make its hues permanent said laetitia you to me i to you he to us well then if he does it shall be one of my heavenly days which is for the probation of experience we are not yet at sunset have you seen mr whitford this morning he passed me do not imagine him ever illtempered i had a governess a learned lady who taught me in person the picturesqueness of grumpiness her temper was ever perfect because she was never in the wrong but i being so she was grumpy she carried my iniquity under her brows and looked out on me through it i was a trying child laetitia said laughing i can believe it yet i liked her and she liked me we were a kind of foreground and background she threw me into relief and i was an apology for her existence you picture her to me she says of me now that i am the only creature she has loved who knows that i may not come to say the same of her you would plague her and puzzle her still have i plagued and puzzled mr whitford he reminds you of her you said you had her picture ah do not laugh at him he is a true friend the man who can be a friend is the man who will presume to be a censor a mild one as to the sentence he pronounces i am unable to speak but his forehead is rhadamanthine condemnation dr middleton clara looked round who i did you hear an echo of papa he would never have put rhadamanthus over european souls because it appears that rhadamanthus judged only the asiatic so you are wrong miss dale my father is infatuated with mr whitford what can it be we women cannot sound the depths of scholars probably because their pearls have no value in our market except when they deign to chasten an impertinent and mr whitford stands aloof from any notice of small fry he is deep studious excellent and does it not strike you that if he descended among us he would be like a triton ashore laetitias habit of wholly subservient sweetness which was her ideal of the feminine not yet conciliated with her acuter character owing to the absence of full pleasure from her lifethe unhealed wound she had sustained and the cramp of a bondage of such old date as to seem ironinduced her to say as if consenting you think he is not quite at home in society but she wished to defend him strenuously and as a consequence she had to quit the selfimposed ideal of her daily acting wherebythe case being unwonted very novel to herthe ladys intelligence became confused through the process that quickened it so sovereign a method of hoodwinking our bright selves is the acting of a part however naturally it may come to us and to this will each honest autobiographical member of the animated world bear witness she added you have not found him sympathetic he is you fancy him brooding gloomy he is the reverse he is cheerful he is indifferent to personal misfortune dr corney says there is no laugh like vernon whitfords and no humour like his latterly he certainly but it has not been your cruel word grumpiness the truth is he is anxious about crossjay and about other things and he wants to leave he is at a disadvantage beside very lively and careless gentlemen at present but your triton ashore is unfair it is ugly he is i can say the truest man i know i did not question his goodness laetitia you threw an accent on it did i i must be like crossjay who declares he likes fun best crossjay ought to know him if anybody should mr whitford has defended you against me clara even since i took to calling you clara perhaps when you supposed him so like your ancient governess he was meditating how he could aid you last night he gave me reasons for thinking you would do wisely to confide in mrs mountstuart it is no longer necessary i merely mention it he is a devoted friend he is an untiring pedestrian oh colonel de craye after hovering near the ladies in the hope of seeing them divide now adopted the system of making three that two may come of it as he joined them with his glittering chatter laetitia looked at clara to consult her and saw the face rosy as a brides the suspicion she had nursed sprung out of her arms a muscular fact on the spot where is my dear boy clara said out for a holiday the colonel answered in her tone advise mr whitford not to waste his time in searching for crossjay laetitia crossjay is better out of the way today at least i thought so just now has he pocketmoney colonel de craye my lord can command his inn how thoughtful you are laetitias bosom swelled upon a mute exclamation equivalent to woman woman snared ever by the sparkling and frivolous undiscerning of the faithful the modest and beneficent in the secret musings of moralists this dramatic rhetoric survives the comparison was all of her own making and she was indignant at the contrast though to what end she was indignant she could not have said for she had no idea of vernon as a rival of de craye in the favour of a plighted lady but she was jealous on behalf of her sex her sexs reputation seemed at stake and the purity of it was menaced by claras idle preference of the shallower man when the young lady spoke so carelessly of being like crossjay she did not perhaps know that a likeness based on a similarity of their enthusiasms loves and appetites had been established between women and boys laetitia had formerly chafed at it rejecting it utterly save when now and then in a season of bitterness she handed here and there a volatile young lady none but the young to be stamped with the degrading brand vernon might be as philosophical as he pleased to her the gaiety of these two colonel de craye and clara middleton was distressingly musical they harmonized painfully the representative of her sex was hurt by it she had to stay beside them clara held her arm the colonels voice dropped at times to something very like a whisper he was answered audibly and smoothly the quickwitted gentleman accepted the correction but in immediately paying assiduous attentions to miss dale in the approved intriguers fashion he showed himself in need of another amounting to a reproof clara said we have been consulting laetitia what is to be done to cure professor crooklyn of his cold de craye perceived that he had taken a wrong step and he was mightily surprised that a lesson in intrigue should be read to him of all men miss middletons audacity was not so astonishing he recognized grand capabilities in the young lady fearing lest she should proceed further and cut away from him his vantageground of secrecy with her he turned the subject and was adroitly submissive claras manner of meeting sir willoughby expressed a timid disposition to friendliness upon a veiled inquiry understood by none save laetitia whose brain was racked to convey assurances to herself of her not having misinterpreted him could there be any doubt she resolved that there could not be and it was upon this basis of reason that she fancied she had led him to it legitimate or not the fancy sprang from a solid foundation yesterday morning she could not have conceived it now she was endowed to feel that she had power to influence him because now since the midnight she felt some emancipation from the spell of his physical mastery he did not appear to her as a different man but she had grown sensible of being a stronger woman he was no more the cloud over her nor the magnet the cloud once heavensuffused the magnet fatally compelling her to sway round to him she admired him still his handsome air his fine proportions the courtesy of his bending to clara and touching of her hand excused a fanatical excess of admiration on the part of a woman in her youth who is never the anatomist of the heros lordly graces but now she admired him piecemeal when it came to the putting of him together she did it coldly to compassionate him was her utmost warmth without conceiving in him anything of the strange old monster of earth which had struck the awakened girls mind of miss middleton laetitia classed him with other men he was one of them and she did not bring her disenchantment as a charge against him she accused herself acknowledged the secret of the change to be and her youthfulness was deadotherwise could she have given him compassion and not herself have been carried on the flood of it the compassion was fervent and pure too she supposed he would supplicate she saw that clara middleton was pleasant with him only for what she expected of his generosity she grieved sir willoughby was fortified by her sorrowful gaze as he and clara passed out together to the laboratory arm in arm laetitia had to tell vernon of the uselessness of his beating the house and grounds for crossjay dr middleton held him fast in discussion upon an overnights classical wrangle with professor crooklyn which was to be renewed that day the professor had appointed to call expressly to renew it a fine scholar said the rev doctor but crotchety like all men who cannot stand their port i hear that he had a cold vernon remarked i hope the wine was good sir as when the foreman of a sentimental jury is commissioned to inform an awful bench exact in perspicuous english of a verdict that must of necessity be pronounced in favour of the hanging of the culprit yet would fain attenuate the crime of a palpable villain by a recommendation to mercy such foreman standing in the attentive eye of a master of grammatical construction and feeling the weight of at least three sentences on his brain together with a prospect of judicial interrogation for the discovery of his precise meaning is oppressed himself is put on trial in turn and he hesitates he recapitulates the fear of involution leads him to be involved as far as a man so posted may he on his own behalf appeals for mercy entreats that his indistinct statement of preposterous reasons may be taken for understood and would gladly were permission to do it credible throw in an imploring word that he may sink back among the crowd without for the one imperishable moment publicly swinging in his lordships estimationmuch so moved by chivalry toward a lady courtesy to the recollection of a hostess and particularly by the knowledge that his hearer would expect with a certain frigid rigour charity of him dr middleton paused spoke and paused he stammered ladies he said were famous poisoners in the middle ages his opinion was that we had a class of manufacturing wine merchants on the watch for widows in this country but he was bound to state the fact of his waking at his usual hour to the minute unassailed by headache on the other hand this was a condition of blessedness unanticipated when he went to bed mr whitford however was not to think that he entertained rancour toward the wine it was no doubt dispensed with the honourable intention of cheering in point of flavour execrable judging by results it was innocuous the test of it shall be the effect of it upon professor crooklyn and his appearance in the forenoon according to promise dr middleton came to an end with his perturbed balancings if i hear more of the eight or twelve winds discharged at once upon a railway platform and the young lady who dries herself of a drenching by drinking brandy and water with a gentleman at a railway inn i shall solicit your sanction to my condemnation of the wine as antibacchic and a counterfeit presentment do not misjudge me our hostess is not responsible but widows should marry you must contrive to stop the professor sir if he should attack his hostess in that manner said vernon widows should marry dr middleton repeated he murmured of objecting to be at the discretion of a butler unless he was careful to add the aforesaid functionary could boast of an university education and even then said he it requires a line of ancestry to train a mans taste the rev doctor smothered a yawn the repression of it caused a second one a real monster to come big as our old friend of the sea advancing on the chainedup beauty disconcerted by this damning evidence of indigestion his countenance showed that he considered himself to have been too lenient to the wine of an unhusbanded hostess he frowned terribly in the interval laetitia told vernon of crossjays flight for the day hastily bidding the master to excuse him she had no time to hint the grounds of excuse vernon mentally made a guess dr middleton took his arm and discharged a volley at the crotchetty scholarship of professor crooklyn whom to confute by book he directed his march to the library having persuaded himself that he was dyspeptic he had grown irascible he denounced all dining out eulogized patterne hall as if it were his home and remembered he had dreamed in the nighta most humiliating sign of physical disturbance but let me find a house in proximity to patterne as i am induced to suppose i shall he said and here only am i to be met when i stir abroad laetitia went to her room she was complacently anxious enough to prefer solitude and be willing to read she was more seriously anxious about crossjay than about any of the others for clara would be certain to speak very definitely and how then could a gentleman oppose her he would supplicate and could she be brought to yield it was not to be expected of a young lady who had turned from sir willoughby his inferiors would have had a better chance whatever his faults he had that element of greatness which excludes the intercession of pity supplication would be with him a form of condescension it would be seen to be such his was a monumental pride that could not stoop she had preserved this image of the gentleman for a relic in the shipwreck of her idolatry so she mused between the lines of her book and finishing her reading and marking the page she glanced down on the lawn dr middleton was there and alone his hands behind his back his head bent his meditative pace and unwonted perusal of the turf proclaimed that a nonsentimental jury within had delivered an unmitigated verdict upon the widows wine laetitia hurried to find vernon he was in the hall as she drew near him the laboratory door opened and shut it is being decided said laetitia vernon was paler than the hue of perfect calmness i want to know whether i ought to take to my heels like crossjay and shun the professor he said they spoke in undertones furtively watching the door i wish what she wishes i am sure but it will go badly with the boy said laetitia oh well then ill take him said vernon i would rather i think i can manage it again the laboratory door opened this time it shut behind miss middleton she was highly flushed seeing them she shook the storm from her brows with a dead smile the best piece of serenity she could put on for public wear she took a breath before she moved vernon strode out of the house clara swept up to laetitia you were deceived the hard sob of anger barred her voice laetitia begged her to come to her room with her i want air i must be by myself said clara catching at her gardenhat she walked swiftly to the portico steps and turned to the right to avoid the laboratory windows chapter xxxiii in which the comic muse has an eye on two good souls clara met vernon on the bowlinggreen among the laurels she asked him where her father was dont speak to him now said vernon mr whitford will you it is not advisable just now wait wait why not now he is not in the right humour she choked there are times when there is no medicine for us in sages we want slaves we scorn to temporize we must overbear on she sped as if she had made the mistake of exchanging words with a post the scene between herself and willoughby was a thick mist in her head except the burden and result of it that he held to her fast would neither assist her to depart nor disengage her oh men men they astounded the girl she could not define them to her understanding their motives their tastes their vanity their tyranny and the domino on their vanity the baldness of their tyranny clinched her in feminine antagonism to brute power she was not the less disposed to rebellion by a very present sense of the justice of what could be said to reprove her she had but one answer anything but marry him it threw her on her nature our last and headlong advocate who is quick as the flood to hurry us from the heights to our level and lower if there be accidental gaps in the channel for say we have been guilty of misconduct can we redeem it by violating that which we are and live by the question sinks us back to the luxuriousness of a sunny relinquishment of effort in the direction against tide our nature becomes ingenious in devices penetrative of the enemy confidently citing its cause for being frankly elvish or worse clara saw a particular way of forcing herself to be surrendered she shut her eyes from it the sight carried her too violently to her escape but her heart caught it up and huzzaed to press the points of her fingers at her bosom looking up to the sky as she did and cry i am not my own i am his was instigation sufficient to make her heart leap up with all her bodys blush to urge it to recklessness a despairing creature then may say she has addressed the heavens and has had no answer to restrain her happily for miss middleton she had walked some minutes in her chafing fit before the falcon eye of colonel de craye spied her away on one of the beechknots vernon stood irresolute it was decidedly not a moment for disturbing dr middletons composure he meditated upon a conversation as friendly as possible with willoughby round on the frontlawn he beheld willoughby and dr middleton together the latter having halted to lend attentive ear to his excellent host unnoticed by them or disregarded vernon turned back to laetitia and sauntered talking with her of things current for as long as he could endure to listen to praise of his pure selfabnegation proof of how well he had disguised himself but it smacked unpleasantly to him his humourous intimacy with mens minds likened the source of this distaste to the gallant allornothing of the gambler who hates the little when he cannot have the much and would rather stalk from the tables cleanpicked than suffer ruin to be tickled by driblets of the glorious fortune he has played for and lost if we are not to be beloved spare us the small coin of compliments on character especially when they compliment only our acting it is partly endurable to win eulogy for our stately fortitude in losing but laetitia was unaware that he flung away a stake so she could not praise him for his merits willoughby makes the pardoning of crossjay conditional he said and the person pleading for him has to grant the terms how could you imagine willoughby would give her up how could he who he should is easily said i was no witness of the scene between them just now but i could have foretold the end of it i could almost recount the passages the consequence is that everything depends upon the amount of courage she possesses dr middleton wont leave patterne yet and it is of no use to speak to him today and she is by nature impatient and is rendered desperate why is it of no use to speak to dr middleton today cried laetitia he drank wine yesterday that did not agree with him he cant work today he is looking forward to patterne port he is not likely to listen to any proposals to leave today goodness i know the depth of that cry you are excluded mr whitford not a bit of it i am in with the rest say that men are to be exclaimed at men have a right to expect you to know your own minds when you close on a bargain you dont know the world or yourselves very well its true still the original error is on your side and upon that you should fix your attention she brought her father here and no sooner was he very comfortably established than she wished to dislocate him i cannot explain it i cannot comprehend it said laetitia you are constancy no she coloured i am in with rest i do not say i should have done the same but i have the knowledge that i must not sit in judgement on her i can waver she coloured again she was anxious that he should know her to be not that stupid statue of constancy in a corner doating on the antic deception reminiscences of the interview overnight made it oppressive to her to hear herself praised for always pointing like the needle her newly enfranchised individuality pressed to assert its existence vernon however not seeing this novelty continued to her excessive discomfort to baste her old abandoned image with his praises they checked hers and moreover he had suddenly conceived an envy of her lifelong uncomplaining almost unaspiring constancy of sentiment if you know lovers when they have not reason to be blissful you will remember that in this mood of admiring envy they are given to fits of uncontrollable maundering praise of constancy moreover smote shadowily a certain inconstant enough to seem to ruffle her smoothness and do no hurt he found his consolation in it and poor laetitia writhed without designing to retort she instinctively grasped at a weapon of defence in further exalting his devotedness which reduced him to cast his head to the heavens and implore them to partially enlighten her nevertheless maunder he must and he recurred to it in a way so utterly unlike himself that laetitia stared in his face she wondered whether there could be anything secreted behind this everlasting theme of constancy he took her awakened gaze for a summons to asseverations of sincerity and out they came she would have fled from him but to think of flying was to think how little it was that urged her to fly and yet the thought of remaining and listening to praises undeserved and no longer flattering was a torture mr whitford i bear no comparison with you i do and must set you for my example miss dale indeed you do wrongly you do not know me i could say that for years pray mr whitford well i have admired it you show us how self can be smothered an echo would be a retort on you on me i am never thinking of anything else i could say that you are necessarily conscious of not swerving but i do i waver dreadfully i am not the same two days running you are the same with ravishing divisions upon the same and you without the divisions i draw such support as i have from you from some simulacrum of me then and that will show you how little you require support i do not speak my own opinion only whose i am not alone again let me say i wish i were like you then let me add i would willingly make the exchange you would be amazed at your bargain others would be your exchange would give me the qualities im in want of miss dale negative passive at the best mr whitford but i should have ohpardon me but you inflict the sensations of a boy with a dose of honesty in him called up to receive a prize he has won by the dexterous use of a crib and how do you suppose she feels who has a crown of queen o the may forced on her head when she is verging on november he rejected her analogy and she his they could neither of them bring to light the circumstances which made one anothers admiration so unbearable the more he exalted her for constancy the more did her mind become bent upon critically examining the object of that imagined virtue and the more she praised him for possessing the spirit of perfect friendliness the fiercer grew the passion in him which disdained the imputation hissing like a heated ironbar that flings the waterdrops to steam he would none of it would rather have stood exposed in his profound foolishness amiable though they were and mutually affectionate they came to a stop in their walk longing to separate and not seeing how it was to be done they had so knit themselves together with the pelting of their interlaudation i think it is time for me to run home to my father for an hour said laetitia i ought to be working said vernon good progress was made to the disgarlanding of themselves thus far yet an acutely civilized pair the abruptness of the transition from floweriness to commonplace affected them both laetitia chiefly as she had broken the pause and she remarkedi am really constancy in my opinions another title is customary where stiff opinions are concerned perhaps by and by you will learn your mistake and then you will acknowledge the name for it how said she what shall i learn if you learn that i am a grisly egoist you and it would not be egoism added laetitia revealing to him at the same instant as to herself that she swung suspended on a scarce credible guess will nothing pierce your ears mr whitford he heard the intruding voice but he was bent on rubbing out the cloudy letters laetitia had begun to spell and he stammered in a tone of matteroffact just that and no better then turned to mrs mountstuart jenkinson or are you resolved you will never see professor crooklyn when you look on him said the great lady vernon bowed to the professor and apologized to him shufflingly and rapidly incoherently and with a red face which induced mrs mountstuart to scan laetitias after lecturing vernon for his abandonment of her yesterday evening and flouting his protestations she returned to the business of the day we walked from the lodgegates to see the park and prepare ourselves for dr middleton we parted last night in the middle of a controversy and are rageing to resume it where is our redoubtable antagonist mrs mountstuart wheeled professor crooklyn round to accompany vernon we she said are for modern english scholarship opposed to the champion of german the contrary observed professor crooklyn oh we she corrected the error serenely are for german scholarship opposed to english certain editions we defend certain editions defend is a term of imperfect application to my position maam my dear professor you have in dr middleton a match for you in conscientious pugnacity and you will not waste it upon me there there they are there he is mr whitford will conduct you i stand away from the first shock mrs mountstuart fell back to laetitia saying he pores over a little inexactitude in phrases and pecks at it like a domestic fowl professor crooklyns attitude and air were so well described that laetitia could have laughed these mighty scholars have their flavour the great lady hastened to add lest her younger companion should be misled to suppose that they were not valuable to a governing hostess their shadowfights are ridiculous but they have their flavour at a table last night no i discard all mention of last night we failed as none else in this neighbourhood could fail but we failed if we have among us a cormorant devouring young lady who drinks up all thehabrandy and waterof our inns and occupies all our flys why our condition is abnormal and we must expect to fail we are deprived of accommodation for accidental circumstances how mr whitford could have missed seeing professor crooklyn and what was he doing at the station miss dale your portrait of professor crooklyn was too striking mrs mountstuart and deceived him by its excellence he appears to have seen only the blank side of the slate ah he is a faithful friend of his cousin do you not think he is the truest of friends as for dr middleton mrs mountstuart diverged from her inquiry he will swell the letters of my vocabulary to gigantic proportions if i see much of him he is contagious i believe it is a form of his humour i caught it of him yesterday at my dinnertable in my distress and must pass it off as a form of mine while it lasts i talked dr middleton half the dreary night through to my pillow your candid opinion my dear come as for me i dont hesitate we seemed to have sat down to a solitary performance on the bassviol we were positively an assembly of insects during thunder my very soul thanked colonel de craye for his diversions but i heard nothing but dr middleton it struck me that my table was petrified and every one sat listening to bowls played overhead i was amused really you delight me who knows but that my guests were sincere in their congratulations on a thoroughly successful evening i have fallen to this you see and i know wretched people that as often as not it is their way of condoling with one i do it myself but only where there have been amiable efforts but imagine my being congratulated for thatgoodmorning sir willoughbythe worst offender and i am in no pleasant mood with him mrs mountstuart said aside to laetitia who drew back retiring sir willoughby came on a step or two he stopped to watch laetitias figure swimming to the house so as for instance beside a stream when a flower on the surface extends its petals drowning to subside in the clear still water we exercise our privilege to be absent in the charmed contemplation of a beautiful natural incident a smile of pleased abstraction melted on his features chapter xxxiv mrs mountstuart and sir willoughby good morning my dear mrs mountstuart sir willoughby wakened himself to address the great lady why has she fled has any one fled laetitia dale letty dale oh if you call that flying possibly to renew a close conversation with vernon whitford that i cut short you frightened me with your shepherdstellme air and tone lead me to one of your gardenseats out of hearing to dr middleton i beg he mesmerizes me he makes me talk latin i was curiously susceptible last night i know i shall everlastingly associate him with an abortive entertainment and solos on big instruments we were flat horace was in good vein you were not and laetitiamiss dale talked well i thought she talked with you and no doubt she talked well we did not mix the yeast was bad you shot darts at colonel de craye you tried to sting you brought dr middleton down on you dear me that man is a reverberation in my head where is your lady and love who am i to name her clara i have not seen her for the last hour wandering i suppose a very pretty summer bower said mrs mountstuart seating herself well my dear sir willoughby preferences preferences are not to be accounted for and one never knows whether to pity or congratulate whatever may occur i want to see miss middleton your dainty rogue in porcelain will be at your beckyou lunch with usbefore you leave so now you have taken to quoting me have you but a romantic tale on her eyelashes is hardly descriptive any longer descriptive of whom now you are upon laetitia dale i quote you generally she has now a graver look and well may have not that the romance has entirely disappeared no it looks as if it were in print you have hit it perfectly as usual maam sir willoughby mused like one resuming his instrument to take up the melody in a concerted piece he said i thought laetitia dale had a singularly animated air last night why mrs mountstuart mildly gaped i want a new description of her you know i collect your mottoes and sentences it seems to me she is coming three parts out of her shell and wearing it as a hood for convenience ready to issue forth at an invitation admirable exact ay my good sir willoughby but are we so very admirable and exact are we never to know our own minds he produced a polysyllabic sigh like those manyjointed compounds of poets in happy languages which are copious in a single expression mine is known to me it always has been cleverness in women is not uncommon intellect is the pearl a woman of intellect is as good as a greek statue she is divinely wrought and she is divinely rare proceed said the lady confiding a cough to the air the rarity of it and it is not mere intellect it is a sympathetic intellect or else it is an intellect in perfect accord with an intensely sympathetic dispositionthe rarity of it makes it too precious to be parted with when once we have met it i prize it the more the older i grow are we on the feminine or the neuter i beg pardon the universal or the individual he shrugged for the rest psychological affinities may exist coincident with and entirely independent of material or moral prepossessions relations engagements ties well that is not the raving of passion certainly said mrs mountstuart and it sounds as if it were a comfortable doctrine for men on that plea you might all of you be having aspasia and a wife we saw your fair middleton and colonel de craye at a distance as we entered the park professor crooklyn is under some hallucination what more likely the readiness and the doublebearing of the reply struck her comic sense with awe the professor must hear that he insists on the fly and the inn and the wet boots and the warming mixture and the testimony of the landlady and the railway porter i say what more likely than that he should insist if he is under the hallucination he may convince others i have only to repeat what more likely its extremely philosophical coincident with a pursuit of the psychological affinities professor crooklyn will hardly descend i suppose from his classical altitudes to lay his hallucinations before dr middleton sir willoughby you are the pink of chivalry by harping on laetitia he had emboldened mrs mountstuart to lift the curtain upon clara it was offensive to him but the injury done to his pride had to be endured for the sake of his general plan of selfprotection simply desirous to save my guests from annoyance of any kind he said dr middleton can look olympus and thunder as vernon calls it dont i see him that look it is dictionarybitten angry homed dictionaryan apparition of dictionary in the nightto a dunce one would undergo a good deal to avoid the sight what the man must be in a storm speak as you please of yourself you are a true and chivalrous knight to dread it for her but now candidly how is it you cannot condescend to a little management listen to an old friend you are too lordly no lover can afford to be incomprehensible for half an hour stoop a little sermonizings are not to be thought of you can govern unseen you are to know that i am one who disbelieves in philosophy in love i admire the look of it i give no credit to the assumption i rather like lovers to be out at times it makes them picturesque and it enlivens their monotony i perceived she had a spot of wildness its proper that she should wear it off before marriage clara the wildness of an infant said willoughby paternally musing over an inward shiver you saw her at a distance just now or you might have heard her laughing horace diverts her excessively i owe him my eternal gratitude for his behaviour last night she was one of my bright faces her laughter was delicious rain in the desert it will tell you what the load on me was when i assure you those two were merely a spectacle to mepoints i scored in a lost game and i know they were witty they both have wit a kind of wit willoughby assented they struck together like a pair of cymbals not the highest description of instrument however they amuse me i like to hear them when i am in the vein that vein should be more at command with you my friend you can be perfect if you like under your tuition willoughby leaned to her bowing languidly he was easier in his pain for having hoodwinked the lady she was the outer world to him she could tune the worlds voice prescribe which of the two was to be pitied himself or clara and he did not intend it to be himself if it came to the worst they were far away from that at present and he continued probably a mans power of putting on a face is not equal to a girls i detest petty dissensions probably i show it when all is not quite smooth little fits of suspicion vex me it is a weakness not to play them off i know men have to learn the arts which come to women by nature i dont sympathize with suspicion from having none myself his eyebrows shot up that illomened man flitch had sidled round by the bushes to within a few feet of him flitch primarily defended himself against the accusation of drunkenness which was hurled at him to account for his audacity in trespassing against the interdict but he admitted that he had taken something short for a fortification in visiting scenes where he had once been happyat christmastide when all the servants and the butler at head grey old mr chessington sat in rows toasting the young heir of the old hall in the old port wine happy had he been then before ambition for a shop to be his own master and an independent gentleman had led him into his quagmireto look back envying a dog on the old estate and sigh for the smell of patterne stables sweeter than arabia his drooping nose appeared to say he held up close against it something that imposed silence on sir willoughby as effectively as a cunning exordium in oratory will enchain mobs to swallow what is not complimenting them and this he displayed secure in its being his licence to drivel his abominable pathos sir willoughby recognized claras purse he understood at once how the must have come by it he was not so quick in devising a means of stopping the tale flitch foiled him intact he replied to the question what have you there he repeated this grand word and then he turned to mrs mountstuart to speak of paradise and adam in whom he saw the prototype of himself also the hebrew people in the bondage of egypt discoursed of by the clergymen not without a likeness to him sorrows have done me one good to send me attentive to church my lady said flitch when i might have gone to london the coachmans home and been driving some honourable family with no great advantage to my morals according to what i hear of and a purse found under the seat of a fly in london would have a poor chance of returning intact to the young lady losing it put it down on that chair inquiries will be made and you will see sir willoughby said mrs mountstuart intact no doubt it is not disputed with one motion of a finger she set the man rounding flitch halted he was very regretful of the termination of his feast of pathos and he wished to relate the finding of the purse but he could not encounter mrs mountstuarts look he slouched away in very close resemblance to the ejected adam of illustrated books its my belief that naturalness among the common people has died out of the kingdom she said willoughby charitably apologized for him he has been fuddling himself her vigilant considerateness had dealt the sensitive gentleman a shock plainly telling him she had her ideas of his actual posture nor was he unhurt by her superior acuteness and her display of authority on his grounds he said boldly as he weighed the purse half tossing it its not unlike claras he feared that his lips and cheeks were twitching and as he grew aware of a glassiness of aspect that would reflect any suspicion of a keeneyed woman he became bolder still laetitias i know it is not hers is an ancient purse a present from you how do you hit on that my dear lady deductively well the purse looks as good as new in quality like the owner the poor dear has not much occasion for using it you are mistaken she uses it daily if it were better filled sir willoughby your old scheme might be arranged the parties do not appear so unwilling professor crooklyn and i came on them just now rather by surprise and i assure you their heads were close faces meeting eyes musing impossible because when they approach the point you wont allow it selfish now said willoughby very animatedly question clara now do my dear mrs mountstuart do speak to clara on that head she will convince you i have striven quite recently against myself if you like i have instructed her to aid me given her the fullest instructions carte blanche she cannot possibly have a doubt i may look to her to remove any you may entertain from your mind on the subject i have proposed seconded and chorussed it and it will not be arranged if you expect me to deplore that fact i can only answer that my actions are under my control my feelings are not i will do everything consistent with the duties of a man of honour perpetually running into fatal errors because he did not properly consult the dictates of those feelings at the right season i can violate them but i can no more command them than i can my destiny they were crushed of old and so let them be now sentiments we wont discuss though you know that sentiments have a bearing on social life are factors as they say in their later jargon i never speak of mine to you i could it is not necessary if old vernon instead of flattening his chest at a desk had any manly ambition to take part in public affairs she would be the woman for him i have called her my egeria she would be his cornelia one could swear of her that she would have noble offspringbut old vernon has had his disappointment and will moan over it up to the end and she so it appears i have tried yes personally without effect in other matters i may have influence with her not in that one she declines she will live and die laetitia dale we are alone i confess to you i love the name its an old song in my ears do not be too ready with a name for me believe mei speak from my experience hithertothere is a fatality in these things i cannot conceal from my poor girl that this fatality exists which is the poor girl at present said mrs mountstuart cool in a mystification and though she will tell you that i have authorized and clara middletondone as much as man can to institute the union you suggest she will own that she is conscious of the presence of thisfatality i call it for want of a better title between us it drives her in one direction me in anotheror would if i submitted to the pressure she is not the first who has been conscious of it are we laying hold of a third poor girl said mrs mountstuart ah i remember and i remember we used to call it playing fast and loose in those days not fatality it is very strange it may be that you were unblushingly courted in those days and excusable and we all supposed but away you went for your tour my mothers medical receipt for me partially it succeeded she was for grand marriages not i i could make i could not be a sacrifice and then i went in due time to dr cupid on my own account she has the kind of attraction but one changes on revient toujours first we begin with a liking then we give ourselves up to the passion of beauty then comes the serious question of suitableness of the mate to match us and perhaps we discover that we were wiser in early youth than somewhat later however she has beauty now mrs mountstuart you do admire her chase the idea of the dainty rogue out of your view of her you admire her she is captivating she has a particular charm of her own nay she has real beauty mrs mountstuart fronted him to say upon my word my dear sir willoughby i think she has it to such a degree that i dont know the man who could hold out against her if she took the field she is one of the women who are dead shots with men whether its in their tongues or their eyes or its an effusion and an atmospherewhatever it is its a spell another fatality for you animal not spiritual oh she hasnt the head of letty dale sir willoughby allowed mrs mountstuart to pause and follow her thoughts dear me she exclaimed i noticed a change in letty dale last night and today she looked fresher and younger extremely well which is not what i can say for you my friend fatalizing is not good for the complexion dont take away my health pray cried willoughby with a snapping laugh be careful said mrs mountstuart you have got a sentimental tone you talk of feelings crushed of old it is to a woman not to a man that you speak but that sort of talk is a way of making the ground slippery i listen in vain for a natural tongue and when i dont hear it i suspect plotting in men you show your underteeth too at times when you draw in a breath like a condemned highcaste hindoo my husband took me to see in a jail in calcutta to give me some excitement when i was pining for england the creature did it regularly as he breathed you did it last night and you have been doing it today as if the air cut you to the quick you have been spoilt you have been too much anointed what ive just mentioned is a sign with me of a settled something on the brain of a man the brain said sir willoughby frowning yes you laugh sourly to look at said she mountstuart told me that the muscles of the mouth betray men sooner than the eyes when they have cause to be uneasy in their minds but maam i shall not break my word i shall not not i intend i have resolved to keep it i do not fatalize let my complexion be black or white despite my resemblance to a highcaste malefactor of the calcutta prisonwards friend friend you know how i chatter he saluted her fingerends despite the extraordinary display of teeth you will find me go to execution with perfect calmness with a resignation as good as happiness like a jacobite lord under the georges you have told me that you wept to read of one like him then my principles have not changed if i have when i was younger i had an idea of a wife who would be with me in my thoughts as well as aims a woman with a spirit of romance and a brain of solid sense i shall sooner or later dedicate myself to a public life and shall i suppose want the counsellor or comforter who ought always to be found at home it may be unfortunate that i have the ideal in my head but i would never make rigorous demands for specific qualities the cruellest thing in the world is to set up a living model before a wife and compel her to copy it in any case here we are upon the road the die is cast i shall not reprieve myself i cannot release her marriage represents facts courtship fancies she will be cured byandby of that coveting of everything that i do feel think dream imagine tatatata ad infinitum laetitia was invited here to show her the example of a fixed charactersolid as any concrete substance you would choose to build on and not a whit the less feminine tatatata ad infinitum you need not tell me you have a design in all that you do willoughby patterne you smell the autocrat yes he can mould and govern the creatures about him his toughest rebel is himself if you see clara you wish to see her i think you said her behaviour to lady busshe last night was queer if you will she makes a mouth at porcelain toujours la porcelaine for me her pettishness is one of her charms i confess it ten years younger i could not have compared them whom laetitia and clara sir willoughby in any case to quote you here we are all upon the road and we must act as if events were going to happen and i must ask her to help me on the subject of my weddingpresent for i dont want to have her making mouths at mine however prettyand she does it prettily another dedicatory offering to the rogue in me she says of porcelain then porcelain it shall not be i mean to consult her i have come determined upon a chat with her i think i understand but she produces false impressions on those who dont know you both i shall have that porcelain back says lady busshe to me when we were shaking hands last night i think says she it should have been the willow pattern and she really said hes in for being jilted a second time sir willoughby restrained a bound of his body that would have sent him up some feet into the air he felt his skull thundered at within rather than that it should fan upon her ejaculated he correcting his resemblance to the highcaste culprit as soon as it recurred to him but you know lady busshe said mrs mountstuart genuinely solicitous to ease the proud man of his pain she could see through him to the depth of the skin which his fencing sensitiveness vainly attempted to cover as it did the heart of him lady busshe is nothing without her flights fads and fancies she has always insisted that you have an unfortunate nose i remember her saying on the day of your majority it was the nose of a monarch destined to lose a throne have i ever offended lady busshe she trumpets you she carries lady culmer with her too and you may expect a visit of nods and hints and pots of alabaster they worship you you are the hope of england in their eyes and no woman is worthy of you but they are a pair of fatalists and if you begin upon letty dale with them you might as well forbid your banns they will be all over the country exclaiming on predestination and marriages made in heaven clara and her father cried sir willoughby dr middleton and his daughter appeared in the circle of shrubs and flowers bring her to me and save me from the polyglot said mrs mountstuart in afright at dr middletons manner of pouring forth into the ears of the downcast girl the leisure he loved that he might debate with his genius upon any next step was denied to willoughby he had to place his trust in the skill with which he had sown and prepared mrs mountstuarts understanding to meet the girlbeautiful abhorred that she was detested darling thing to squeeze to death and throw to the dust and mourn over he had to risk it and at an hour when lady busshes prognostic grievously impressed his intense apprehensiveness of nature as it happened that dr middletons notion of a disagreeable duty in colloquy was to deliver all that he contained and escape the listening to a syllable of reply willoughby withdrew his daughter from him opportunely mrs mountstuart wants you clara i shall be very happy clara replied and put on a new face an imperceptible nervous shrinking was met by another force in her bosom that pushed her to advance without a sign of reluctance she seemed to glitter she was handed to mrs mountstuart dr middleton laid his hand over willoughbys shoulder retiring on a bow before the great lady of the district he blew and said an opposition of female instincts to masculine intellect necessarily creates a corresponding antagonism of intellect to instinct her answer sir her reasons has she named any the cat said dr middleton taking breath for a sentence that humps her back in the figure of the letter h or a chinese bridge has given the dog her answer and her reasons we may presume but he that undertakes to translate them into human speech might likewise venture to propose an addition to the alphabet and a continuation of homer the one performance would be not more wonderful than the other daughters willoughby daughters above most human peccancies i do abhor a breach of faith she will not be guilty of that i demand a cheerful fulfilment of a pledge and i sigh to think that i cannot count on it without administering a lecture she will soon be my care sir she shall be why she is as good as married she is at the altar she is in her house she iswhy where is she not she has entered the sanctuary she is out of the market this maenad shriek for freedom would happily entitle her to the republican capthe phrygianin a revolutionary parisian procession to me it has no meaning and but that i cannot credit child of mine with mania i should be in trepidation of her wits sir willoughbys livelier fears were pacified by the information that clara had simply emitted a cry clara had once or twice given him cause for starting and considering whether to think of her sex differently or condemningly of her yet he could not deem her capable of fully unbosoming herself even to him and under excitement his idea of the cowardice of girls combined with his ideal of a waxwork sex to persuade him that though they are often he had experienced it wantonly desperate in their acts their tongues are curbed by rosy prudency and this was in his favour for if she proved speechless and stupid with mrs mountstuart the lady would turn her over and beat her flat beat her angular in fine turn her to any shape despising her and cordially believe him to be the model gentleman of christendom she would fill in the outlines he had sketched to her of a picture that he had small pride in by comparison with his early vision of a fortunefavoured triumphing squire whose career is like the suns intelligibly lordly to all comprehensions not like your model gentleman that has to be expoundeda thing for abstract esteem however it was the choice left to him and an alternative was enfolded in that mrs mountstuarts model gentleman could marry either one of two women throwing the other overboard he was bound to marry he was bound to take to himself one of them and whichever one he selected would cast a lustre on his reputation at least she would rescue him from the claws of lady busshe and her owls hoot of willow pattern and her hags shriek of twice jilted that flying infant willoughbyhis unprotected little incorporeal omnipresent self not thought of so much as passionately felt forwould not be scoffed at as the luckless with women a fall indeed from his original conception of his name of fame abroad but willoughby had the high consolation of knowing that others have fallen lower there is the fate of the devils to comfort us if we are driven hard for one of your pangs another bosom is racked by ten we read in the solacing book with all these nice calculations at work willoughby stood above himself contemplating his active machinery which he could partly criticize but could not stop in a singular wonderment at the aims and schemes and tremours of one who was handsome manly acceptable in the worlds eyes and had he not loved himself most heartily he would have been divided to the extent of repudiating that urgent and excited half of his being whose motions appeared as those of a body of insects perpetually erecting and repairing a structure of extraordinary pettiness he loved himself too seriously to dwell on the division for more than a minute or so but having seen it and for the first time as he believed his passion for the woman causing it became surcharged with bitterness atrabiliar a glance behind him as he walked away with dr middleton showed clara cunning creature that she was airily executing her malicious graces in the preliminary courtesies with mrs mountstuart chapter xxxv miss middleton and mrs mountstuart sit beside me fair middleton said the great lady gladly said clara bowing to her title i want to sound you my dear clara presented an open countenance with a dim interrogation on the forehead yes she said submissively you were one of my bright faces last night i was in love with you delicate vessels ring sweetly to a fingernail and if the wit is true you answer to it that i can see and that is what i like most of the people one has at a table are drums a rubadubdub on them is the only way to get a sound when they can be persuaded to do it upon one another they call it conversation colonel de craye was very funny funny and witty too but never spiteful these irish or half irishmen are my taste if theyre not politicians mind i mean irish gentlemen i will never have another dinnerparty without one our mens tempers are uncertain you cant get them to forget themselves and when the wine is in them the nature comes out and they must be buffetting and up start politics and goodbye to harmony my husband i am sorry to say was one of those who have a long account of ruined dinners against them i have seen him and his friends red as the roast and white as the boiled with wrath on a popular topic they had excited themselves over intrinsically not worth a snap of the fingers in london exclaimed mrs mountstuart to aggravate the charge against her lord in the shades but town or country the table should be sacred i have heard women say it is a plot on the side of the men to teach us our littleness i dont believe they have a plot it would be to compliment them on a talent i believe they fall upon one another blindly simply because they are full which is we are told the preparation for the fighting englishman they cannot eat and keep a truce did you notice that dreadful mr capes the gentleman who frequently contradicted papa but colonel de craye was good enough to relieve us how my dear you did not hear him he took advantage of an interval when mr capes was breathing after a paean to his friend the governori thinkof one of the presidencies to say to the lady beside him he was a wonderful administrator and great logician he married an angloindian widow and soon after published a pamphlet in favour of suttee and what did the lady say she said oh hark at her and was it heard mr capes granted the widow but declared he had never seen the pamphlet in favour of suttee and disbelieved in it he insisted that it was to be named sati he was vehement now i do rememberwhich must have delighted the colonel and mr capes retired from the front upon a repetition of in toto in toto as if in toto were the language of a dinnertable but what will ever teach these men must we import frenchmen to give them an example in the art of conversation as their grandfathers brought over marquises to instruct them in salads and our young men too women have to take to the huntingfield to be able to talk with them and be on a par with their grooms now there was willoughby patterne a prince among them formerly now did you observe him last night did you notice how instead of conversing instead of assisting meas he was bound to do doubly owing to the defection of vernon whitford a thing i dont yet comprehendthere he sat sharpening his lower lip for cutting remarks and at my best man at colonel de craye if he had attacked mr capes with his governor of bomby as the man pronounces it or colonel wildjohn and his protestant church in danger or sir wilson pettifer harping on his monarchical republic or any other no he preferred to be sarcastic upon friend horace and he had the worst of it sarcasm is so silly what is the gain if he has been smart people forget the epigram and remember the others good temper on that field my dear you must make up your mind to be beaten by friend horace i have my prejudices and i have my prepossessions but i love good temper and i love wit and when i see a man possessed of both i set my cap at him and theres my flat confession and highly unfeminine it is not at all cried clara we are one then clara put up a mouth empty of words she was quite one with her mrs mountstuart pressed her hand when one does get intimate with a dainty rogue she said you forgive me all that for i could vow that willoughby has betrayed me clara looked soft kind bright in turns and clouded instantly when the lady resumed a friend of my own sex and young and a close neighbour is just what i would have prayed for and ill excuse you my dear for not being so anxious about the friendship of an old woman but i shall be of use to you you will find in the first place i never tap for secrets in the second i keep them thirdly i have some power and fourth every young married woman has need of a friend like me yes and lady patterne heading all the county will be the stronger for my backing you dont look so mighty well pleased my dear speak out dear mrs mountstuart i tell you i am very fond of willoughby but i saw the faults of the boy and see the mans he has the pride of a king and its a pity if you offend it he is prodigal in generosity but he cant forgive as to his own errors you must be blind to them as a saint the secret of him is that he is one of those excessively civilized creatures who aim at perfection and i think he ought to be supported in his conceit of having attained it for the more men of that class the greater our influence he excels in manly sports because he wont be excelled in anything but as men dont comprehend his fineness he comes to us and his wife must manage him by that key you look down at the idea of managing it has to be done one thing you may be assured of he will be proud of you his wife wont be very much enamoured of herself if she is not the happiest woman in the world you will have the best horses the best dresses the finest jewels in england and an incomparable cook the house will be changed the moment you enter it as lady patterne and my dear just where he is with all his graces deficient of attraction yours will tell the sort of othello he would make or leontes i dont know and none of us ever needs to know my impression is that if even a shadow of a suspicion flitted across him he is a sort of man to doubledye himself in guilt by way of vengeance in anticipation of an imagined offence not uncommon with men i have heard strange stories of them and so will you in your time to come but not from me no young woman shall ever be the sourer for having been my friend one word of advice now we are on the topic never play at counterstrokes with him he will be certain to outstroke you and you will be driven further than you meant to go they say we beat men at that game and so we do at the cost of beating ourselves and if once we are started it is a racecourse ending on a precipiceover goes the winner we must be moderately slavish to keep our place which is given us in appearance but appearances make up a remarkably large part of life and far the most comfortable so long as we are discreet at the right moment he is a man whose pride when hurt would run his wife to perdition to solace it if he married a troublesome widow his pamphlet on suttee would be out within the year vernon whitford would receive instructions about it the first frosty moon you like miss dale i think i like her better than she likes me said clara have you never warmed together i have tried it she is not one bit to blame i can see how it is that she misunderstands me or justly condemns me perhaps i should say the hero of two women must die and be wept over in common before they can appreciate one another you are not cold no you shuddered my dear did i i do sometimes feet will be walking over ones grave wherever it lies be sure of this willoughby patterne is a man of unimpeachable honour i do not doubt it he means to be devoted to you he has been accustomed to have women hanging around him like votive offerings i you cannot of course not any one could see that at a glance you are all the sweeter to me for not being tame marriage cures a multitude of indispositions oh mrs mountstuart will you listen to me presently dont threaten me with confidences eloquence is a terrible thing in woman i suspect my dear that we both know as much as could be spoken you hardly suspect the truth i fear let me tell you one thing about jealous menwhen they are not blackamoors married to disobedient daughters i speak of our civil creature of the drawingrooms and lovers mind not husbands two distinct species married or nottheyre rarely given to jealousy unless they are flighty themselves the jealousy fixes them they have only to imagine that we are for some fun likewise and they grow as deferential as my footman as harmless as the sportsman whose gun has burst ah my fair middleton am i pretending to teach you you have read him his lesson and my table suffered for it last night but i bear no rancour you bewilder me mrs mountstuart not if i tell you that you have driven the poor man to try whether it would be possible for him to give you up i have well and you are successful i am jump my dear he will when men love stale instead of fresh withered better than blooming excellence in the abstract rather than the palpable with their idle prate of feminine intellect and a grotto nymph and a mother of gracchi why he must think me dazed with admiration of him to talk to me one listens you know and he is one of the men who cast a kind of physical spell on you while he has you by the ear until you begin to think of it by talking to somebody else i suppose there are clever people who do see deep into the breast while dialogue is in progress one reads of them no my dear you have very cleverly managed to show him that it isnt at all possible he cant and the real cause for alarm in my humble opinion is lest your amiable foil should have been a trifle as he would say deceived too much in earnest led too far one may reprove him for not being wiser but men wont learn without groaning that they are simply weapons taken up to be put down when done with leave it to me to compose himwilloughby cant give you up im certain he has tried his pride has been horridly wounded you were shrewd and he has had his lesson if these little rufflings dont come before marriage they come after so its not time lost and its good to be able to look back on them you are very white my child can you mrs mountstuart can you think i would be so heartlessly treacherous be honest fair middleton and answer me can you say you had not a corner of an idea of producing an effect on willoughby clara checked the instinct of her tongue to defend her reddening cheeks with a sense that she was disintegrating and crumbling but she wanted this lady for a friend and she had to submit to the conditions and be red and silent mrs mountstuart examined her leisurely that will do conscience blushes one knows it by the conflagration dont be hard on yourself there you are in the other extreme that blush of yours would count with me against any quantity of evidenceall the crooklyns in the kingdom you lost your purse i discovered that it was lost this morning flitch has been here with it willoughby has it you will ask him for it he will demand payment you will be a couple of yards length or so of cramoisy and there ends the episode nobody killed only a poor man melancholywounded and i must offer him my hand to mend him vowing to prove to him that suttee was properly abolished well and now to business i said i wanted to sound you you have been overdone with porcelain poor lady busshe is in despair at your disappointment now i mean my weddingpresent to be to your taste madam who is the madam you are imploring dear mrs mountstuart well i shall fall in your esteem perhaps you will help me no one else can i am a prisoner i am compelled to continue this imposture oh i shun speaking much you object to it and i dislike it but i must endeavour to explain to you that i am unworthy of the position you think a proud one tuttut we are all unworthy cross our arms bow our heads and accept the honours are you playing humble handmaid what an old organtune that is well give me reasons i do not wish to marry hes the great match of the county i cannot marry him why you are at the church door with him cannot marry him it does not bind me the church door is as binding as the altar to an honourable girl what have you been about since i am in for confidences half ones wont do we must have honourable young women as well as men of honour you cant imagine he is to be thrown over now at this hour what have you against him come i have found that i do not what love him mrs mountstuart grimaced transiently that is no answer the cause she said what has he done nothing and when did you discover this nothing by degrees unknown to myself suddenly suddenly and by degrees i suppose its useless to ask for a head but if all this is true you ought not to be here i wish to go i am unable have you had a scene together i have expressed my wish in roundaboutgirls english quite clearly oh very clearly have you spoken to your father i have and what does dr middleton say it is incredible to him to me too i can understand little differences little whims caprices we dont settle into harness for a tap on the shoulder as a man becomes a knight but to break and bounce away from an unhappy gentleman at the church door is either madness or its one of the things without a name you think you are quite sure of yourself i am so sure that i look back with regret on the time when i was not but you were in love with him i was mistaken no love i have none to give dear meyes yes but that tone of sorrowful conviction is often a trick its not new and i know that assumption of plain sense to pass off a monstrosity mrs mountstuart struck her lap soh but ive had to rack my brain for it feminine disgust you have been hearing imputations of his past life moral character no circumstances might make him behave unkindly not unhandsomely and we have no claim over a mans past or its too late to assert it what is the case we are quite divided nothing in the way of nothing greeneyed far from that then name it we disagree many a very good agreement is founded on disagreeing its to be regretted that you are not portionless if you had been you would have made very little of disagreeing you are just as much bound in honour as if you had the ring on your finger in honour but i appeal to his i am no wife for him but if he insists you consent i appeal to reason is it madam but i say if he insists you consent he will insist upon his own misery as well as mine mrs mountstuart rocked herself my poor sir willoughby what a fateand i took you for a clever girl why i have been admiring your management of him and here am i bound to take a lesson from lady busshe my dear good middleton dont let it be said that lady busshe saw deeper than i i put some little vanity in it i own i wont conceal it she declares that when she sent her presenti dont believe hershe had a premonition that it would come back surely you wont justify the extravagances of a woman without common reverencefor anatomize him as we please to ourselves he is a splendid man and i did it chiefly to encourage and come at you we dont often behold such a lordlylooking man so conversable too when he feels at home a picture of an english gentleman the very man we want married for our neighbourhood a woman who can openly talk of expecting him to be twice jilted you shrink it is repulsive it would be incomprehensible except of course to lady busshe who rushed to one of her violent conclusions and became a prophetess conceive a womans imagining it could happen twice to the same man i am not sure she did not send the identical present that arrived and returned once before you know the durham engagement she told me last night she had it back i watched her listening very suspiciously to professor crooklyn my dear it is her passion to foretell disastersher passion and when they are confirmed she triumphs of course we shall have her domineering over us with sapient nods at every trifle occurring the county will be unendurable unsay it my middleton and dont answer like an oracle because i do all the talking pour out to me youll soon come to a stop and find the want of reason in the want of words i assure you thats true let me have a good gaze at you no said mrs mountstuart after posturing herself to peruse claras features brains you have one can see it by the nose and the mouth i could vow you are the girl i thought you you have your wits on tiptoe how of the heart none clara sighed the sigh was partly voluntary though unforced as one may with ready sincerity act a character that is our own only through sympathy mrs mountstuart felt the extra weight in the young ladys falling breath there was no necessity for a deep sigh over an absence of heart or confession of it if clara did not love the man to whom she was betrothed sighing about it signified what some pretence and a pretence is the cloak of a secret girls do not sigh in that way with compassion for the man they have no heart for unless at the same time they should be oppressed by the knowledge or dread of having a heart for some one else as a rule they have no compassion to bestow on him you might as reasonably expect a soldier to bewail the enemy he strikes in action they must be very disengaged to have it and supposing a show of the thing to be exhibited when it has not been worried out of them there is a reserve in the background they are pitying themselves under a mask of decent pity of their wretch so ran mrs mountstuarts calculations which were like her suspicion coarse and broad not absolutely incorrect but not of an exact measure with the truth that pins head of the truth is rarely hit by design the search after it of the professionally penetrative in the dark of a bosom may bring it forth by the heavy knocking all about the neighbourhood that we call good guessing but it does not come out clean other matter adheres to it and being more it is less than truth the unadulterate is to be had only by faith in it or by waiting for it a lover thought the sagacious dame there was no lover some love there was or rather there was a preparation of the chamber with no lamp yet lighted do you positively tell me you have no heart for the position of first lady of the county said mrs mountstuart claras reply was firm none whatever my dear i will believe you on one condition look at me you have eyes if you are for mischief you are armed for it but how much better when you have won a prize to settle down and wear it lady patterne will have entire occupation for her flights and whimsies in leading the county and the man surely the manhe behaved badly last night but a beauty like this she pushed a finger at claras cheek and doated a half instant you have the very beauty to break in an ogres temper and the man is as governable as he is presentable you have the beauty the french callno its the beauty of a queen of elves one sees them lurking about you one here one there smilethey dance be dolefulthey hang themselves no theres not a trace of satanic at least not yet and come come my middleton the man is a man to be proud of you can send him into parliament to wear off his humours to my thinking he has a fine style conscious i never thought so before last night i cant guess what has happened to him recently he was once a young grand monarque he was really a superb young english gentleman have you been wounding him it is my misfortune to be obliged to wound him said clara quite needlessly my child for marry him you must claras bosom rose her shoulders rose too narrowing and her head fell slight back mrs mountstuart exclaimed but the scandal you would never never think of following the example of that durham girlwhether she was provoked to it by jealousy or not it seems to have gone so astonishingly far with you in a very short time that one is alarmed as to where you will stop your look just now was downright revulsion i fear it is it is i am past my own control dear madam you have my assurance that i will not behave scandalously or dishonourably what i would entreat of you is to help me i know this of myself i am not the best of women i am impatient wickedly i should be no good wife feelings like mine teach me unhappy things of myself rich handsome lordly influential brilliant health fine estates mrs mountstuart enumerated in petulant accents as there started across her mind some of sir willoughbys attributes for the attraction of the soul of woman i suppose you wish me to take you in earnest i appeal to you for help what help persuade him of the folly of pressing me to keep my word i will believe you my dear middleton on one condition your talk of no heart is nonsense a change like this if one is to believe in the change occurs through the heart not because there is none dont you see that but if you want me for a friend you must not sham stupid its bad enough in itself the imitations horrid you have to be honest with me and answer me right out you came here on this visit intending to marry willoughby patterne yes and gradually you suddenly discovered since you came here that you did not intend it if you could find a means of avoiding it oh madam yes it is true now comes the test and my lovely middleton your flaming cheeks wont suffice for me this time the old serpent can blush like an innocent maid on occasion you are to speak and you are to tell me in six words why that was and dont waste one on madam or oh mrs mountstuart why did you change i camewhen i came i was in some doubt indeed i speak the truth i found i could not give him the admiration he has i dare say a right to expect i turnedit surprised me it surprises me now but so completely so that to think of marrying him is defer the simile mrs mountstuart interposed if you hit on a clever one you will never get the better of it now by just as much as you have outstripped my limitation of words to you you show me you are dishonest i could make a vow you would forswear yourself will you help me if you are perfectly ingenuous i may try dear lady what more can i say it may be difficult you can reply to a catechism i shall have your help well yes though i dont like stipulations between friends there is no man living to whom you could willingly give your hand that is my question i cannot possibly take a step unless i know reply briefly there is or there is not clara sat back with bated breath mentally taking the leap into the abyss realizing it and the cold prudence of abstention and the delirium of the confession was there such a man it resembled freedom to think there was to avow it promised freedom oh mrs mountstuart well you will help me upon my word i shall begin to doubt your desire for it willingly give my hand madam for shame and with wits like yours cant you perceive where hesitation in answering such a question lands you dearest lady will you give me your hand may i whisper you need not whisper i wont look claras voice trembled on a tense chord there is one compared with him i feel my insignificance if i could aid him what necessity have you to tell me more than that there is one ah madam it is different not as you imagine you bid me be scrupulously truthful i am i wish you to know the different kind of feeling it is from what might be suspected from a confession to give my hand is beyond any thought i have ever encouraged if you had asked me whether there is one whom i admireyes i do i cannot help admiring a beautiful and brave selfdenying nature it is one whom you must pity and to pity casts you beneath him for you pity him because it is his nobleness that has been the enemy of his fortunes he lives for others her voice was musically thrilling in that low muted tone of the very heart impossible to deride or disbelieve mrs mountstuart set her head nodding on springs is he clever very he talks well yes handsome he might be thought so witty i think he is gay cheerful in his manner why the man would be a mountebank if he adopted any other and poor he is not wealthy mrs mountstuart preserved a lengthened silence but nipped claras fingers once or twice to reassure her without approving of course hes poor she said at last directly the reverse of what you could have it must be well my fair middleton i cant say you have been dishonest ill help you as far as im able how it is quite impossible to tell were in the mire the best way seems to me to get this pitiable angel to cut some ridiculous capers and present you another view of him i dont believe in his innocence he knew you to be a plighted woman he has not once by word or sign hinted a disloyalty then how do you know i do not know he is not the cause of your wish to break your engagement no then you have succeeded in just telling me nothing what is ah madam you would break your engagement purely because the admirable creature is in existence clara shook her head she could not say she was dizzy she had spoken out more than she had ever spoken to herself and in doing so she had cast herself a step beyond the line she dared to contemplate i wont detain you any longer said mrs mountstuart the more we learn the more we are taught that we are not so wise as we thought we were i have to go to school to lady busshe i really took you for a very clever girl if you change again you will notify the important circumstance to me i trust i will said clara and no violent declaration of the impossibility of her changing again would have had such an effect on her hearer mrs mountstuart scanned her face for a new reading of it to match with her later impressions i am to do as i please with the knowledge i have gained i am utterly in your hands madam i have not meant to be unkind you have not been unkind i could embrace you i am rather too shattered and kissing wont put me together i laughed at lady busshe no wonder you went off like a rocket with a disappointing bouquet when i told you you had been successful with poor sir willoughby and he could not give you up i noticed that a woman like lady busshe always prying for the lamentable would have required no further enlightenment has he a temper clara did not ask her to signalize the person thus abruptly obtruded he has faults she said theres an end to sir willoughby then though i dont say he will give you up even when he hears the worst if he must hear it as for his own sake he should and i wont say he ought to give you up hell be the pitiable angel if he does for youbut you dont deserve compliments they would be immoral you have behaved badly badly badly i have never had such a rightaboutface in my life you will deserve the stigma you will be notorious you will be called number two think of that not even original we will break the conference or i shall twaddle to extinction i think i heard the luncheon bell it rang you dont look fit for company but you had better come oh yes every day its the same whether youre in my hands or im in yours were a couple of archconspirators against the peace of the family whose table were sitting at and the more we rattle the viler we are but we must do it to ease our minds mrs mountstuart spread the skirts of her voluminous dress remarking further at a certain age our teachers are young people we learn by looking backward it speaks highly for me that i have not called you madfull of faults goodishlooking not a bad talker cheerful poorishand she prefers that to this the great lady exclaimed in her reverie while emerging from the circle of shrubs upon a view of the hall colonel de craye advanced to her certainly goodlooking certainly cheerful by no means a bad talker nothing of a croesus and variegated with faults his laughing smile attacked the irresolute hostility of her mien confident as the sparkle of sunlight in a breeze the effect of it on herself angered her on behalf of sir willoughbys bride goodmorning mrs mountstuart i believe i am the last to greet you and how long do you remain here colonel de craye i kissed earth when i arrived like the norman william and consequently ive an attachment to the soil maam youre not going to take possession of it i suppose a handful would satisfy me you play the conqueror pretty much i have heard but property is held more sacred than in the times of the norman william and speaking of property miss middleton your purse is found he said i know it is she replied as unaffectedly as mrs mountstuart could have desired though the ingenuous air of the girl incensed her somewhat clara passed on you restore purses observed mrs mountstuart her stress on the word and her look thrilled de craye for there had been a long conversation between the young lady and the dame it was an article that dropped and was not stolen said he barely sweet enough to keep then i think i could have felt to it like poor flitch the flyman who was the finder if you are conscious of these temptations to appropriate what is not your own you should quit the neighbourhood and do it elsewhere but thats not virtuous counsel and im not counselling in the interests of your virtue colonel de craye and i dared for a moment to hope that you were maam he said ruefully drooping they were close to the diningroom window and mrs mountstuart preferred the terminating of a dialogue that did not promise to leave her features the austerely iron cast with which she had commenced it she was under the spell of gratitude for his behaviour yesterday evening at her dinnertable she could not be very severe chapter xxxvi animated conversation at a luncheontable vernon was crossing the hall to the diningroom as mrs mountstuart stepped in she called to him are the champions reconciled he replied hardly that but they have consented to meet at an altar to offer up a victim to the gods in the shape of modern poetic imitations of the classical that seems innocent enough the professor has not been anxious about his chest he recollects his cough now and then you must help him to forget it lady busshe and lady culmer are here said vernon not supposing it to be a grave announcement until the effect of it on mrs mountstuart admonished him she dropped her voice engage my fair friend for one of your walks the moment we rise from table you may have to rescue her but do i mean it shes a capital walker vernon remarked in simpleton style theres no necessity for any of your pedestrian feats mrs mountstuart said and let him go turning to colonel de craye to pronounce an encomium on him the most openminded man i know warranted to do perpetual service and no mischief if you were all instead of catching at every prize you covet yes you would have your reward for unselfishness i assure you yes and where you seek it that is what none of you men will believe when you behold me in your own livery cried the colonel do i said she dallying with a halfformed design to be confidential how is it one is always tempted to address you in the language of innuendo i cant guess except that as a dog doesnt comprehend good english we naturally talk bad to him the great lady was tickled who could help being amused by this man and after all if her fair middleton chose to be a fool there could be no gainsaying her sorry though poor sir willoughbys friends must feel for him she tried not to smile you are too absurd or a baby you might have added i hadnt the daring ill tell you what colonel de craye i shall end by falling in love with you and without esteeming you i fear the second follows as surely as the flavour upon a draught of bacchus if youll but toss off the glass maam we women sir think it should be first tis to transpose the seasons and give october the blossom and april the apple and no sweet one esteems a mellow thing that comes after bloom and fire like an evening at home because if it went before it would have no father and couldnt hope for progeny for thered be no nature in the business so please maam keep to the original order and youll be natures child and i the most blessed of mankind really were i fifteen years younger i am not so certain i might try and make you harmless draw the teeth of the lamb so long as you pet him i challenged you colonel and i wont complain of your pitch but now lay your wit down beside your candour and descend to an everyday level with me for a minute is it innuendo no though i daresay it would be easier for you to respond to if it were im the straightforwardest of men at a word of command this is a whisper be alert as you were last night shuffle the table well a little liveliness will do it i dont imagine malice but theres curiosity which is often as bad and not so lightly foiled we have lady busshe and lady culmer here to sweep the cobwebs out of the sky well then can you fence with broomsticks i have had a bout with them in my time they are terribly direct they give point as napoleon commanded his cavalry to do you must help me to ward it they will require variety in the conversation constant you are an angel of intelligence and if i have the judgeing of you im afraid youll be allowed to pass in spite of the scandal above open the door i dont unbonnet de craye threw the door open lady busshe was at that moment saying and are we indeed to have you for a neighbour dr middleton the rev doctors reply was drowned by the new arrivals i thought you had forsaken us observed sir willoughby to mrs mountstuart and run away with colonel de craye im too weighty my dear friend besides i have not looked at the weddingpresents yet the very object of our call exclaimed lady culmer i have to confess i am in dire alarm about mine lady busshe nodded across the table at clara oh you may shake your head but i would rather hear a rough truth than the most complimentary evasion how would you define a rough truth dr middleton said mrs mountstuart like the trained warrior who is ready at all hours for the trumpet to arms dr middleton waked up for judicial allocution in a trice a rough truth madam i should define to be that description of truth which is not imparted to mankind without a powerful impregnation of the roughness of the teller it is a rough truth maam that the world is composed of fools and that the exceptions are knaves professor crooklyn furnished that example avoided by the rev doctor not to precipitate myself into the jaws of the foregone definition which strikes me as being as happy as jonahs whale that could carry probably the most learned man of his time inside without the necessity of digesting him said de craye a rough truth is a rather strong charge of universal nature for the firing off of a modicum of personal fact it is a rough truth that plato is moses atticizing said vernon to dr middleton to keep the diversion alive and that aristotle had the globe under his cranium rejoined the rev doctor and that the moderns live on the ancients and that not one in ten thousand can refer to the particular treasury he filches the art of our days is a revel of rough truth remarked professor crooklyn and the literature has laboriously mastered the adjective wherever it may be in relation to the noun dr middleton added orsons first appearance at court was in the figure of a rough truth causing the maids of honour accustomed to tapestry adams astonishment and terror said de craye that he might not be left out of the sprightly play sir willoughby levelled a lance at the quintain smiling on laetitia in fine caricature is rough truth she said is one end of it and realistic directness is the other he bowed the palm is yours mrs mountstuart admired herself as each one trotted forth in turn characteristically with one exception unaware of the aid which was being rendered to a distressed damsel wretchedly incapable of decent hypocrisy her intrepid lead had shown her hand to the colonel and drawn the enemy at a blow sir willoughbys in fine however did not please her still less did his lackadaisical lothariolike bowing and smiling to miss dale and he perceived it and was hurt for how carrying his tremendous load was he to compete with these unhandicapped men in the game of nonsense she had such a fondness for starting at a table he was further annoyed to hear miss eleanor and miss isabel patterne agree together that caricature was the final word of the definition relatives should know better than to deliver these awards to us in public well quoth lady busshe expressive of stupefaction at the strange dust she had raised are they on view miss middleton inquired lady culmer theres a regiment of us on view and ready for inspection colonel de craye bowed to her but she would not be foiled miss middletons admirers are always on view said he are they to be seen said lady busshe clara made her face a question with a laudable smoothness the weddingpresents lady culmer explained no otherwise my dear we are in danger of duplicating and triplicating and quadruplicating not at all to the satisfaction of the bride but theres a worse danger to encounter in the on view my lady said de craye and thats the magnetic attraction a display of weddingpresents is sure to have for the ineffable burglar who must have a nuptial soul in him for wherever theres that collection on view hes never a league off and tis said he knows a ladys dressingcase presented to her on the occasion fifteen years after the event as many as fifteen said mrs mountstuart by computation of the police and if the presents are on view dogs are of no use nor bolts nor barshes worse than cupid the only protection to be found singular as it may be thought is in a couple of bottles of the oldest jamaica rum in the british isles rum cried lady busshe the liquor of the royal navy my lady and with your permission ill relate the tale in proof of it i had a friend engaged to a young lady niece of an old seacaptain of the old school the benbow school the wooden leg and pigtail school a perfectly salt old gentleman with a pickled tongue and a dash of brine in every deed he committed he looked rolled over to you by the last wave on the shore sparkling he was neptunes own for humour and when his present to the bride was opened sure enough there lay a couple of bottles of the oldest jamaica rum in the british isles born before himself and his father to boot tis a fabulous spirit i beg you to believe in my lady the sole merit of the story being its portentous veracity the bottles were tied to make them appear twins as they both had the same claim to seniority and there was a label on them telling their great age to maintain their identity they were in truth a pair of patriarchal bottles rivalling many of the biggest houses in the kingdom for antiquity they would have made the donkey that stood between the two bundles of hay look at them with obliquity supposing him to have for an animal a rum taste and a turn for hilarity wonderful old bottles so on the label just over the date was written large uncle benjamins wedding present to his niece bessy poor bessy shed tears of disappointment and indignation enough to float the old gentleman on his native element ship and all she vowed it was done curmudgeonly to vex her because her uncle hated weddingpresents and had grunted at the exhibition of cups and saucers and this and that beautiful service and epergnes and inkstands mirrors knives and forks dressingcases and the whole mighty category she protested she flung herself about she declared those two ugly bottles should not join the exhibition in the diningroom where it was laid out for days and the family ate their meals where they could on the walls like flies but there was also uncle benjamins legacy on view in the distance so it was ruled against her that the bottles should have their place and one fine morning down came the family after a fearful row of the domestics shouting screaming cries for the police and murder topping all what did they see they saw two prodigious burglars extended along the floor each with one of the twin bottles in his hand and a remainder of the horror of the midnight hanging about his person like a blown fog sufficient to frighten them whilst they kicked the rascals entirely intoxicated never was wilder disorder of weddingpresents and not one lostowing youll own to uncle benjys two bottles of ancient jamaica rum colonel de craye concluded with an asseveration of the truth of the story a most provident farsighted old seacaptain exclaimed mrs mountstuart laughing at lady busshe and lady culmer these ladies chimed in with her gingerly and have you many more clever stories colonel de craye said lady busshe ah my lady when the tree begins to count its gold tis nigh upon bankruptcy poetic ejaculated lady culmer spying at miss middletons rippled countenance and noting that she and sir willoughby had not interchanged word or look but that in the case of your patterne port a bottle of it would outvalue the catalogue of nuptial presents willoughby i would recommend your stationing some such constabulary to keep watch and ward said dr middleton as he filled his glass taking bordeaux in the middle of the day under a consciousness of virtue and its reward to come at halfpast seven in the evening the rascals would require a dozen of that sir said de craye then it is not to be thought of indeed one dr middleton negatived the idea we are no further advanced than when we began observed lady busshe if we are marked to go by stages mrs mountstuart assented why then we shall be called old coaches remarked the colonel you said lady culmer have the advantage of us in a closer acquaintance with miss middleton you know her tastes and how far they have been consulted in the little souvenirs already grouped somewhere although not yet for inspection i am at sea and here is lady busshe in deadly alarm there is plenty of time to effect a changethough we are drawing on rapidly to the fatal day miss middleton we are we are very near it oh yes i am one who thinks that these little affairs should be spoken of openly without that ridiculous bourgeois affectation so that we may be sure of giving satisfaction it is a transaction like everything else in life i for my part wish to be remembered favourably i put it as a test of breeding to speak of these things as plain matteroffact you marry i wish you to have something by you to remind you of me what shall it beuseful or ornamental for an ordinary household the choice is not difficult but where wealth abounds we are in a dilemma and with persons of decided tastes added lady busshe i am really very unhappy she protested to clara sir willoughby dropped laetitia claras look of a sedate resolution to preserve silence on the topic of the nuptial gifts made a diversion imperative your porcelain was exquisitely chosen and i profess to be a connoisseur he said i am poor in old saxony as you know i can match the country in savres and my inheritance of china will not easily be matched in the country you may consider your dragon vases a present from young crossjay said de craye how hasnt he abstained from breaking them the capital boy porcelain and a boy in the house together is a case of prospective disaster fully equal to flitch and a fly you should understand that my friend horacewhose wit is in this instance founded on another tale of a boybrought us a magnificent piece of porcelain destroyed by the capsizing of his conveyance from the station said sir willoughby to lady busshe she and lady culmer gave out lamentable ohs while miss eleanor and miss isabel patterne sketched the incident then the lady visitors fixed their eyes in united sympathy upon clara recovering from which after a contemplation of marble lady busshe emphasized no you do not love porcelain it is evident miss middleton i am glad to be assured of it said lady culmer oh i know that face i know that look lady busshe affected to remark rallyingly it is not the first time i have seen it sir willoughby smarted to his marrow we will rout these fancies of an overscrupulous generosity my dear lady busshe her unwonted breach of delicacy in speaking publicly of her present and the vulgar persistency of her sticking to the theme very much perplexed him and if he mistook her not she had just alluded to the demoniacal constantia durham it might be that he had mistaken her he was on guard against his terrible sensitiveness nevertheless it was hard to account for this behaviour of a lady greatly his friend and admirer a lady of birth and lady culmer as welllikewise a lady of birth were they in collusion had they a suspicion he turned to laetitias face for the antidote to his pain oh but you are not one yet and i shall require two voices to convince me lady busshe rejoined after another stare at the marble lady busshe i beg you not to think me ungrateful said clara fiddlegratitude it is to please your taste to satisfy you i care for gratitude as little as for flattery but gratitude is flattering said vernon now no metaphysics mr whitford but do care a bit for flattery my lady said de craye tis the finest of the arts we might call it moral sculpture adepts in it can cut their friends to any shape they like by practising it with the requisite skill i myself poor hand as i am have made a man act solomon by constantly praising his wisdom he took a sagacious turn at an early period of the dose he weighed the smallest question of his daily occasions with a deliberation truly oriental had i pushed it hed have hired a baby and a couple of mothers to squabble over the undivided morsel i shall hope for a day in london with you said lady culmer to clara you did not forget the queen of sheba said mrs mountstuart to de craye with her appearance the game has to be resigned to her entirely he rejoined that is lady culmer continued if you do not despise an old woman for your comrade on a shopping excursion despise whom we fleece exclaimed dr middleton oh no lady culmer the sheep is sacred i am not so sure said vernon in what way and to what extent are you not so sure said dr middleton the natural tendency is to scorn the fleeced i stand for the contrary pity if you like particularly when they bleat this is to assume that makers of gifts are a fleeced people i demur said mrs mountstuart madam we are expected to give we are incited to give you have dubbed it the fashion to give and the person refusing to give or incapable of giving may anticipate that he will be regarded as benignly as a sheep of a drooping and flaccid wool by the farmer who is reminded by the poor beasts appearance of a strange dog that worried the flock even captain benjamin as you have seen was unable to withstand the demand on him the hymeneal pair are licensed freebooters levying blackmail on us survivors of an uncivilized period but in taking without mercy i venture to trust that the manners of a happier era instruct them not to scorn us i apprehend that mr whitford has a lower order of latrons in his mind permit me to say sir that you have not considered the ignoble aspect of the fleeced said vernon i appeal to the ladies would they not if they beheld an ostrich walking down a queens drawing room cleanplucked despise him though they were wearing his plumes an extreme supposition indeed said dr middleton frowning over it scarcely legitimately to be suggested i think it fair sir as an instance has the circumstance occurred i would ask in life a thousand times i fear so said mrs mountstuart lady busshe showed symptoms of a desire to leave a profitless table vernon started up glancing at the window did you see crossjay he said to clara no i must if he is there said she she made her way out vernon after her they both had the excuse which way did the poor boy go she asked him i have not the slightest idea he replied but put on your bonnet if you would escape that pair of inquisitors mr whitford what humiliation i suspect you do not feel it the most and the end of it cant be remote said he thus it happened that when lady busshe and lady culmer quitted the diningroom miss middleton had spirited herself away from summoning voice and messenger sir willoughby apologized for her absence if i could be jealous it would be of that boy crossjay you are an excellent man and the best of cousins was lady busshes enigmatical answer the exceedingly lively conversation at his table was lauded by lady culmer though said she what it all meant and what was the drift of it i couldnt tell to save my life is it every day the same with you here very much how you must enjoy a spell of dulness if you said simplicity and not talking for effect i generally cast anchor by laetitia dale ah lady busshe coughed but the fact is mrs mountstuart is made for cleverness i think my lady laetitia dale is to the full as clever as any of the stars mrs mountstuart assembles or i talkative cleverness i mean in conversation as well perhaps you have not yet given her a chance yes yes she is clever of course poor dear she is looking better too handsome i thought said lady culmer she varies observed sir willoughby the ladies took seat in their carriage and fell at once into a closebonnet colloquy not a single allusion had they made to the weddingpresents after leaving the luncheontable the cause of their visit was obvious chapter xxxvii contains clever fencing and intimations of the need for it that woman lady busshe had predicted after the event constantia durhams defection she had also subsequent to willoughbys departure on his travels uttered sceptical things concerning his rooted attachment to laetitia dale in her bitter vulgarity that beaten rival of mrs mountstuart jenkinson for the leadership of the county had taken his nose for a melancholy prognostic of his fortunes she had recently played on his name she had spoken the hideous english of his fate little as she knew she was alive to the worst interpretation of appearances no other eulogy occurred to her now than to call him the best of cousins because vernon whitford was housed and clothed and fed by him she had nothing else to say for a man she thought luckless she was a woman barren of wit stripped of style but she was wealthy and a gossipa forge of showering sparksand she carried lady culmer with her the two had driven from his house to spread the malignant rumour abroad already they blew the biting world on his raw wound neither of them was like mrs mountstuart a witty woman who could be hoodwinked they were dull women who steadily kept on their own scent of the fact and the only way to confound such inveterate forces was to be ahead of them and seize and transform the expected fact and astonish them when they came up to him with a totally unanticipated fact you see you were in error ladies and so we were sir willoughby and we acknowledge it we never could have guessed that thus the phantom couple in the future delivered themselves as well they might at the revelation he could run far ahead ay but to combat these dolts facts had to be encountered deeds done in groaning earnest these representatives of the pigsconces of the population judged by circumstances airy shows and seems had no effect on them dexterity of fence was thrown away a flying peep at the remorseless might of dulness in compelling us to a concrete performance counter to our inclinations if we would deceive its terrible instinct gave willoughby for a moment the survey of a sage his intensity of personal feeling struck so vivid an illumination of mankind at intervals that he would have been individually wise had he not been moved by the source of his accurate perceptions to a personal feeling of opposition to his own sagacity he loathed and he despised the vision so his mind had no benefit of it though he himself was whipped along he chose rather and the choice is open to us all to be flattered by the distinction it revealed between himself and mankind but if he was not as others were why was he discomfited solicitous miserable to think that it should be so ran dead against his conquerors theories wherein he had been trained which so long as he gained success awarded success to native merit grandeur to the grand in soul as light kindles light nature presents the example his early training his bright beginning of life had taught him to look to earths principal fruits as his natural portion and it was owing to a girl that he stood a mark for tongues naked wincing at the possible malignity of a pair of harridans why not whistle the girl away why then he would be free to enjoy careless younger than his youth in the rebound to happiness and then would his nostrils begin to lift and sniff at the creeping up of a thick pestiferous vapour then in that volume of stench would he discern the sullen yellow eye of malice a malarious earth would hunt him all over it the breath of the world the worlds view of him was partly his vital breath his view of himself the ancestry of the tortured man had bequeathed him this condition of high civilization among their other bequests your withered contracted egoists of the hut and the grot reck not of public opinion they crave but for liberty and leisure to scratch themselves and soothe an excessive scratch willoughby was expansive a blooming one born to look down upon a tributary world and to exult in being looked to do we wonder at his consternation in the prospect of that worlds blowing foul on him princes have their obligations to teach them they are mortal and the brilliant heir of a tributary world is equally enchained by the homage it brings himmore inasmuch as it is immaterial elusive not gathered by the tax and he cannot capitally punish the treasonable recusants still must he be brilliant he must court his people he must ever both in his reputation and his person aching though he be show them a face and a leg the wounded gentleman shut himself up in his laboratory where he could stride to and fro and stretch out his arms for physical relief secure from observation of his fantastical shapes under the idea that he was meditating there was perhaps enough to make him fancy it in the heavy fire of shots exchanged between his nerves and the situation there were notable flashes he would not avow that he was in an agony it was merely a desire for exercise quintessence of worldliness mrs mountstuart appeared through his farthest window swinging her skirts on a turn at the end of the lawn with horace de craye smirking beside her and the womans vaunted penetration was unable to detect the histrionic irishism of the fellow or she liked him for his acting and nonsense nor she only the voluble beast was created to snare women willoughby became smitten with an adoration of stedfastness in women the incarnation of that divine quality crossed his eyes she was clad in beauty a horrible nondescript convulsion composed of yawn and groan drove him to his instruments to avert a renewal of the shock and while arranging and fixing them for their unwonted task he compared himself advantageously with men like vernon and de craye and others of the county his fellows in the huntingfield and on the magistrates bench who neither understood nor cared for solid work beneficial practical work the work of science he was obliged to relinquish it his hand shook experiments will not advance much at this rate he said casting the noxious retardation on his enemies it was not to be contested that he must speak with mrs mountstuart however he might shrink from the trial of his facial muscles her not coming to him seemed ominous nor was her behaviour at the luncheontable quite obscure she had evidently instigated the gentlemen to cross and counterchatter lady busshe and lady culmer for what purpose claras features gave the answer they were implacable and he could be the same in the solitude of his room he cried right out i swear it i will never yield her to horace de craye she shall feel some of my torments and try to get the better of them by knowing she deserves them he had spoken it and it was an oath upon the record desire to do her intolerable hurt became an ecstasy in his veins and produced another stretching fit that terminated in a violent shake of the body and limbs during which he was a spectacle for mrs mountstuart at one of the windows he laughed as he went to her saying no no work today it wont be done positively refuses i am taking the professor away said she he is fidgety about the cold he caught sir willoughby stepped out to her i was trying at a bit of work for an hour not to be idle all day you work in that den of yours every day never less than an hour if i can snatch it it is a wonderful resource the remark set him throbbing and thinking that a prolongation of his crisis exposed him to the approaches of some organic malady possibly heartdisease a habit he said in there i throw off the world we shall see some results in due time i promise none i like to be abreast of the real knowledge of my day that is all and a pearl among country gentlemen in your gracious consideration my dear lady generally speaking it would be more advisable to become a chatterer and keep an anecdotal notebook i could not do it simply because i could not live with my own emptiness for the sake of making an occasional display of fireworks i aim at solidity it is a narrow aim no doubt not much appreciated laetitia dale appreciates it a smile of enforced ruefulness like a leaf curling in heat wrinkled his mouth why did she not speak of her conversation with clara have they caught crossjay he said apparently they are giving chase to him the likelihood was that clara had been overcome by timidity must you leave us i think it prudent to take professor crooklyn away he still the extraordinary resemblance a word aside to dr middleton will dispel that you are thoroughly good this hateful encomium of commiseration transfixed him then she knew of his calamity philosophical he said would be the proper term i think colonel de craye by the way promises me a visit when he leaves you tomorrow the earlier the better he is too captivating he is delightful he won me in five minutes i dont accuse him nature gifted him to cast the spell we are weak women sir willoughby she knew like to like the witty to the witty maam you wont compliment me with a little bit of jealousy i forbear from complimenting him be philosophical of course if you have the philosophy i pretend to it probably i suppose myself to succeed because i have no great requirement of it i cannot say we are riddles to ourselves mrs mountstuart pricked the turf with the point of her parasol she looked down and she looked up well said he to her eyes well and where is laetitia dale he turned about to show his face elsewhere when he fronted her again she looked very fixedly and set her head shaking it will not do my dear sir willoughby what i never could solve enigmas playing tatatata ad infinitum then things have gone far all parties would be happier for an excursion send her home laetitia i cant part with her mrs mountstuart put a tooth on her under lip as her head renewed its brushing negative in what way can it be hurtful that she should be here maam he ventured to persist think she is proof twice the word was big artillery he tried the affectation of a staring stupidity she might have seen his heart thump and he quitted the mask for an agreeable grimace she is inaccessible she is my friend i guarantee her on my honour have no fear for her i beg you to have confidence in me i would perish rather no soul on earth is to be compared with her mrs mountstuart repeated twice the low monosyllable musically spoken in the same tone of warning of a gentle ghost rolled a thunder that maddened him but he dared not take it up to fight against it on plain terms is it for my sake he said it will not do sir willoughby she spurred him to a frenzy my dear mrs mountstuart you have been listening to tales i am not a tyrant i am one of the most easygoing of men let us preserve the forms due to society i say no more as for poor old vernon people call me a good sort of cousin i should like to see him comfortably married decently married this time i have proposed to contribute to his establishment i mention it to show that the case has been practically considered he has had a tolerably souring experience of the state he might be inclined if say you took him in hand for another venture its a demoralizing lottery however government sanctions it but sir willoughby what is the use of my taking him in hand when as you tell me laetitia dale holds back she certainly does then we are talking to no purpose unless you undertake to melt her he suffered a lurking smile to kindle to some strength of meaning you are not overconsiderate in committing me to such an office you are afraid of the danger she all but sneered sharpened by her tone he said i have such a love of stedfastness of character that i should be a poor advocate in the endeavour to break it and frankly i know the danger i saved my honour when i made the attempt that is all i can say upon my word mrs mountstuart threw back her head to let her eyes behold him summarily over their fine aquiline bridge you have the art of mystification my good friend abandon the idea of laetitia dale and marry your cousin vernon to whom where are we as i said maam i am an easygoing man i really have not a spice of the tyrant in me an intemperate creature held by the collar may have that notion of me while pulling to be released as promptly as it entered the noose but i do strictly and sternly object to the scandal of violent separations open breaches of solemn engagements a public rupture put it that i am the cause i will not consent to a violation of decorum is that clear it is just possible for things to be arranged so that all parties may be happy in their way without much hubbub mind it is not i who have willed it so i am and i am forced to be passive but i will not be obstructive he paused waving his hand to signify the vanity of the more that might be said some conception of him dashed by incredulity excited the ladys intelligence well she exclaimed you have planted me in the land of conjecture as my husband used to say i dont see light but i think i see the lynx that does we wont discuss it at present i certainly must be a younger woman than i supposed for i am learning hardhere comes the professor buttoned up to the ears and dr middleton flapping in the breeze there will be a cough and a footnote referring to the young lady at the station if we stand together so please order my carriage you found clara complacent roguish i will call tomorrow you have simplified my task sir willoughby very much that is assuming that i have not entirely mistaken you i am so far in the dark that i have to help myself by recollecting how lady busshe opposed my view of a certain matter formerly scepticism is her forte it will be the very oddest thing if after all no i shall own romance has not departed are you fond of dupes i detest the race an excellent answer i could pardon you for it she refrained from adding if you are making one of me sir willoughby went to ring for her carriage she knew that was palpable clara had betrayed him the earlier colonel de craye leaves patterne hall the better she had said that and all parties would be happier for an excursion she knew the position of things and she guessed the remainder but what she did not know and could not divine was the man who fenced her he speculated further on the witty and the dull these latter are the redoubtable body they will have facts to convince them they had he confessed it to himself precipitated him into the novel sphere of his dark hints to mrs mountstuart from which the utter darkness might allow him to escape yet it embraced him singularly and even pleasantly with the sense of a fact established it embraced him even very pleasantly there was an end to his tortures he sailed on a tranquil sea the husband of a stedfast womanno rogue the exceeding beauty of stedfastness in women clothed laetitia in graces clara could not match a tried stedfast woman is the one jewel of the sex she points to her husband like the sunflower her love illuminates him she lives in him for him she testifies to his worth she drags the world to his feet she leads the chorus of his praises she justifies him in his own esteem surely there is not on earth such beauty if we have to pass through anguish to discover it and cherish the peace it gives to clasp it calling it ours is a full reward deep in his reverie he said his adieus to mrs mountstuart and strolled up the avenue behind the carriagewheels unwilling to meet laetitia till he had exhausted the fresh savour of the cud of fancy supposing it done it would be generous on his part it would redound to his credit his home would be a fortress impregnable to tongues he would have divine security in his home one who read and knew and worshipped him would be sitting there starlike sitting there awaiting him his fixed star it would be marriage with a mirror with an echo marriage with a shining mirror a choric echo it would be marriage with an intellect with a fine understanding to make his home a fountain of repeatable wit to make his dear old patterne hall the luminary of the county he revolved it as a chant with anon and anon involuntarily a discordant animadversion on lady busshe its attendant imps heard the angry inward cry forthwith he set about painting laetitia in delectable human colours like a miniature of the past century reserving her ideal figure for his private satisfaction the world was to bow to her visible beauty and he gave her enamel and glow a taller stature a swimming air a transcendency that exorcized the image of the old witch who had driven him to this the result in him was that laetitia became humanly and avowedly beautiful her dark eyelashes on the pallor of her cheeks lent their aid to the transformation which was a necessity to him so it was performed he received the waxen impression his retinue of imps had a revel we hear wonders of men and we see a lifting up of hands in the world the wonders would be explained and never a hand need to interject if the mystifying man were but accompanied by that monkeyeyed confraternity they spy the heart and its twists the heart is the magical gentleman none of them would follow where there was no heart the twists of the heart are the comedy the secret of the heart is its pressing love of self says the book by that secret the mystery of the organ is legible and a comparison of the heart to the mountain rillet is taken up to show us the unbaffled force of the little channel in seeking to swell its volume strenuously sinuously ever in pursuit of self the busiest as it is the most singleaiming of forces on our earth and we are directed to the sinuosities for posts of observation chiefly instructive few maintain a stand there people see and they rush away to interchange liftings of hands at the sight instead of patiently studying the phenomenon of energy consequently a man in love with one woman and in all but absolute consciousness behind the thinnest of veils preparing his mind to love another will be barely credible the particular hunger of the forceful but adaptable heart is the key of him behold the mountain rillet become a brook become a torrent how it inarms a handsome boulder yet if the stone will not go with it on it hurries pursuing self in extension down to where perchance a dam has been raised of a sufficient depth to enfold and keep it from inordinate restlessness laetitia represented this peaceful restraining space in prospect but she was a faded young woman he was aware of it and systematically looking at himself with her upturned orbs he accepted her benevolently as a god grateful for worship and used the divinity she imparted to paint and renovate her his heart required her so the heart works the springs of imagination imagination received its commission from the heart and was a cunning artist cunning to such a degree of seductive genius that the masterpiece it offered to his contemplation enabled him simultaneously to gaze on clara and think of laetitia clara came through the parkgates with vernon a brilliant girl indeed and a shallow one a healthy creature and an animal attractive but capricious impatient treacherous foul a woman to drag men through the mud she approached chapter xxxviii in which we take a step to the centre of egoism they met vernon soon left them you have not seen crossjay willoughby inquired no said clara once more i beg you to pardon him he spoke falsely owing to his poor boys idea of chivalry the chivalry to the sex which commences in lies ends by creating the womans hero whom we see about the world and in certain courts of law his ability to silence her was great she could not reply to speech like that you have said he made a confidante of mrs mountstuart yes this is your purse i thank you professor crooklyn has managed to make your father acquainted with your project that i suppose is the railway ticket in the fold of the purse he was assured at the station that you had taken a ticket to london and would not want the fly it is true i was foolish you have had a pleasant walk with vernonturning me in and out we did not speak of you you allude to what he would never consent to hes an honest fellow in his oldfashioned way hes a secret old fellow does he ever talk about his wife to you clara dropped her purse and stooped and picked it up i know nothing of mr whitfords affairs she said and she opened the purse and tore to pieces the railway ticket the storys a proof that romantic spirits do not furnish the most romantic history you have the word chivalry frequently on your lips he chivalrously married the daughter of the lodginghouse where he resided before i took him we obtained information of the auspicious union in a newspaper report of mrs whitfords drunkenness and rioting at a london railway terminusprobably the one whither your ticket would have taken you yesterday for i heard the lady was on her way to us for supplies the connubial larder being empty i am sorry i am ignorant i have heard nothing i know nothing said clara you are disgusted but half the students and authors you hear of marry in that way and very few have vernons luck she had good qualities asked clara her under lip hung it looked like disgust he begged her not indulge the feeling literary men it is notorious even with the entry to society have no taste in women the housewife is their object ladies frighten and would no doubt be an annoyance and hindrance to them at home you said he was fortunate you have a kindness for him i respect him he is a friendly old fellow in his awkward fashion honourable and so forth but a disreputable alliance of that sort sticks to a man the world will talk yes he was fortunate so far he fell into the mire and got out of it were he to marry again she died do not be startled it was a natural death she responded to the sole wishes left to his family he buried the woman and i received him i took him on my tour a second marriage might cover the first there would be a buzz about the old business the womans relatives write to him still try to bleed him i dare say however now you understand his gloominess i dont imagine he regrets his loss he probably sentimentalizes like most men when they are well rid of a burden you must not think the worse of him i do not said clara i defend him whenever the matters discussed i hope you do without approving his folly i cant wash him clean they were at the halldoors she waited for any personal communications he might be pleased to make and as there was none she ran upstairs to her room he had tossed her to vernon in his mind not only painlessly but with a keen acid of satisfaction the heart is the wizard next he bent his deliberate steps to laetitia the mind was guilty of some hesitation the feet went forward she was working at an embroidery by an open window colonel de craye leaned outside and willoughby pardoned her air of demure amusement on hearing him say no i have had one of the pleasantest halfhours of my life and would rather idle here if idle you will have it than employ my faculties on horseback time is not lost in conversing with miss dale said willoughby the light was tender to her complexion where she sat in partial shadow de craye asked whether crossjay had been caught laetitia murmured a kind word for the boy willoughby examined her embroidery the ladies eleanor and isabel appeared they invited her to take carriage exercise with them laetitia did not immediately answer and willoughby remarked miss dale has been reproving horace for idleness and i recommend you to enlist him to do duty while i relieve him here the ladies had but to look at the colonel he was at their disposal if they would have him he was marched to the carriage laetitia plied her threads colonel de craye spoke of crossjay she said may i hope you have forgiven the poor boy sir willoughby he replied plead for him i wish i had eloquence in my opinion you have it if he offends it is never from meanness at school among comrades he would shine he is in too strong a light his feelings and his moral nature are overexcited that was not the case when he was at home with you i am severe i am stern a spartan mother my system of managing a boy would be after that model except in this he should always feet that he could obtain forgiveness not at the expense of justice ah young creatures are not to be arraigned before the higher courts it seems to me perilous to terrify their imaginations if we do so are we not likely to produce the very evil we are combating the alternations for the young should be school and home and it should be in their hearts to have confidence that forgiveness alternates with discipline they are of too tender an age for the rigours of the world we are in danger of hardening them i prove to you that i am not possessed of eloquence you encouraged me to speak sir willoughby you speak wisely laetitia i think it true will not you reflect on it you have only to do so to forgive him i am growing bold indeed and shall have to beg forgiveness for myself you still write you continue to work with your pen said willoughby a little a very little i do not like you to squander yourself waste yourself on the public you are too precious to feed the beast giving out incessantly must end by attenuating reserve yourself for your friends why should they be robbed of so much of you is it not reasonable to assume that by lying fallow you would be more enriched for domestic life candidly had i authority i would confiscate your pen i would away with that bauble you will not often find me quoting cromwell but his words apply in this instance i would say rather that lancet perhaps it is the more correct term it bleeds you it wastes you for what for a breath of fame i write for money and therei would say of anotheryou subject yourself to the risk of mental degradation who knowsmoral trafficking the brains for money must bring them to the level of the purchasers in time i confiscate your pen laetitia it will be to confiscate your own gift sir willoughby then that proveswill you tell me the date you sent me a gold penholder on my sixteenth birthday it proves my utter thoughtlessness then and later and later he rested an elbow on his knee and covered his eyes murmuring in that profound hollow which is haunted by the voice of a contrite past and later the deed could be done he had come to the conclusion that it could be done though the effort to harmonize the figure sitting near him with the artistic figure of his purest pigments had cost him labour and a blinking of the eyelids that also could be done her pleasant tone sensible talk and the light favouring her complexion helped him in his effort she was a sober cup sober and wholesome deliriousness is for adolescence the men who seek intoxicating cups are men who invite their fates curiously yet as positively as things can be affirmed the husband of this woman would be able to boast of her virtues and treasures abroad as he could notimpossible to say why notboast of a beautiful wife or a bluestocking wife one of her merits as a wife would be this extraordinary neutral merit of a character that demanded colour from the marital hand and would take it laetitia had not to learn that he had much to distress him her wonder at his exposure of his grief counteracted a fluttering of vague alarm she was nervous she sat in expectation of some burst of regrets or of passion i may hope that you have pardoned crossjay she said my friend said he uncovering his face i am governed by principles convince me of an error i shall not obstinately pursue a premeditated course but you know me men who have not principles to rule their conduct arewell they are unworthy of a half hour of companionship with you i will speak to you tonight i have letters to dispatch tonight at twelve in the room where we spoke last or await me in the drawingroom i have to attend to my guests till late he bowed he was in a hurry to go the deed could be done it must be done it was his destiny chapter xxxix in the heart of the egoist but already he had begun to regard the deed as his executioner he dreaded meeting clara the folly of having retained her stood before him how now to look on her and keep a sane resolution unwavering she tempted to the insane had she been away he could have walked through the performance composed by the sense of doing a duty to himself perhaps faintly hating the poor wretch he made happy at last kind to her in a manner polite claras presence in the house previous to the deed and oh heaven after it threatened his wits pride he had none he cast it down for her to trample it he caught it back ere it was trodden on yes he had pride he had it as a dagger in his breast his pride was his misery but he was too proud to submit to misery what i do is right he said the words and rectitude smoothed his path till the question clamoured for answer would the world countenance and endorse his pride in laetitia at one time yes and now claras beauty ascended laid a beam on him we are on board the labouring vessel of humanity in a storm when cries and countercries ring out disorderliness mixes the crew and the fury of selfpreservation divides this one is for the ship that one for his life clara was the former to him laetitia the latter but what if there might not be greater safety in holding tenaciously to clara than in casting her off for laetitia no she had done things to set his pride throbbing in the quick she had gone bleeding about first to one then to another she had betrayed him to vernon and to mrs mountstuart a look in the eyes of horace de craye said to him as well to whom not he might hold to her for vengeance but that appetite was shortlived in him if it ministered nothing to his purposes i discard all idea of vengeance he said and thrilled burningly to a smart in his admiration of the man who could be so magnanimous under mortal injury for the more admirable he the more pitiable he drank a drop or two of selfpity like a poison repelling the assaults of public pity clara must be given up it must be seen by the world that as he felt the thing he did was right laocoon of his own serpents he struggled to a certain magnificence of attitude in the muscular net of constrictions he flung around himself clara must be given up oh bright abominable she must be given up but not to one whose touch of her would be darts in the blood of the yielder snakes in his bed she must be given up to an extinguisher to be the second wife of an oldfashioned semirecluse disgraced in his first and were it publicly known that she had been cast off and had fallen on old vernon for a refuge and part in spite part in shame part in desperation part in a fit of good sense under the circumstances espoused him her beauty would not influence the world in its judgement the world would know what to think as the instinct of selfpreservation whispered to willoughby the world were it requisite might be taught to think what it assuredly would not think if she should be seen tripping to the altar with horace de craye selfpreservation not vengeance breathed that whisper he glanced at her iniquity for a justification of it without any desire to do her a permanent hurt he was highly civilized but with a strong intention to give her all the benefit of a scandal supposing a scandal or ordinary tattle and so he handed her to his cousin and secretary vernon whitford who opened his mouth and shut his eyes you hear the world how are we to stop it from chattering enough that he had no desire to harm her some gentle anticipations of her being tarnished were imperative they came spontaneously to him otherwise the radiance of that bright abominable in loss would have been insufferable he could not have borne it he could never have surrendered her moreover a happy present effect was the result he conjured up the anticipated chatter and shrug of the world so vividly that her beauty grew hectic with the stain bereft of its formidable magnetism he could meet her calmly he had steeled himself purity in women was his principal stipulation and a woman puffed at was not the person to cause him tremours consider him indulgently the egoist is the son of himself he is likewise the father and the son loves the father the father the son they reciprocate affection through the closest of ties and shall they view behaviour unkindly wounding either of them not for each others dear sake abhorring the criminal they would not injure you but they cannot consent to see one another suffer or crave in vain the two rub together in sympathy besides relationship to an intenser one are you without much offending sacrificed by them it is on the altar of their mutual love to filial piety or paternal tenderness the younger has offered a dainty morsel to the elder or the elder to the younger absorbed in their great example of devotion do they not think of you they are beautiful yet is it most true that the younger has the passions of youth whereof will come division between them and this is a tragic state they are then pathetic this was the state of sir willoughby lending ear to his elder until he submitted to bite at the fruit proposed to himwith how wry a mouth the venerable senior chose not to mark at least as we perceive a half of him was ripe of wisdom in his own interests the cruder half had but to be obedient to the leadership of sagacity for his interests to be secured and a filial disposition assisted him painfully indeed but the same rare quality directed the good gentleman to swallow his pain that the son should bewail his fate were a dishonour to the sire he reverenced and submitted thus to say consider him indulgently is too much an appeal for charity on behalf of one requiring but initial anatomya slicing in halvesto exonerate perchance exalt him the egoist is our fountainhead primeval man the primitive is born again the elemental reconstituted born again into new conditions the primitive may be highly polished of men and forfeit nothing save the roughness of his original nature he is not only his own father he is ours and he is also our son we have produced him he us such were we to such are we returning not other sings the poet than one who toilfully works his shallop against the tide si brachia forte remisitlet him haply relax the labour of his arms however high up the stream and back he goes in pejus to the early principle of our being with seeds and plants that are as carelessly weighed in the hand and as indiscriminately husbanded as our humanity poets on the other side may be cited for an assurance that the primitive is not the degenerate rather is he a sign of the indestructibility of the race of the ancient energy in removing obstacles to individual growth a sample of what we would be had we his concentrated power he is the original innocent the pure simple it is we who have fallen we have melted into society diluted our essence dissolved he stands in the midst monumentally a landmark of the tough and honest old ages with the symbolic alphabet of striking arms and running legs our early language scrawled over his person and the glorious first flint and arrowhead for his crest at once the spectre of the kitchenmidden and our ripest issue but society is about him the occasional spectacle of the primitive dangling on a rope has impressed his mind with the strength of his natural enemy from which uncongenial sight he has turned shuddering hardly less to behold the blast that is blown upon a reputation where one has been disrespectful of the many by these means through meditation on the contrast of circumstances in life a pulse of imagination has begun to stir and he has entered the upper sphere or circle of spiritual egoism he has become the civilized egoist primitive still as sure as man has teeth but developed in his manner of using them degenerate or not and there is no just reason to suppose it sir willoughby was a social egoist fiercely imaginative in whatsoever concerned him he had discovered a greater realm than that of the sensual appetites and he rushed across and around it in his conquering period with an alexanders pride on these windlike journeys he had carried constantia subsequently clara and however it may have been in the case of miss durham in that of miss middleton it is almost certain she caught a glimpse of his interior from sheer fatigue in hearing him discourse of it what he revealed was not the cause of her sickness women can bear revelationsthey are exciting but the monotonousness he slew imagination there is no direr disaster in love than the death of imagination he dragged her through the labyrinths of his penetralia in his hungry coveting to be loved more and still more more still until imagination gave up the ghost and he talked to her plain hearing like a monster it must have been that for the spell of the primitive upon women is masterful up to the time of contact and so he handed her to his cousin and secretary vernon whitford who opened his mouth and shut his eyes the urgent question was how it was to be accomplished willoughby worked at the subject with all his power of concentration a power that had often led him to feel and say that as a barrister a diplomatist or a general he would have won his grades and granting him a personal interest in the business he might have achieved eminence he schemed and fenced remarkably well he projected a scene following expressions of anxiety on account of old vernon and his future settlement and then clara maintaining her doggedness to which he was now so accustomed that he could not conceive a change in itsays he if you determine on breaking i give you back your word on one condition whereupon she starts he insists on her promise she declines affairs resume their former footing she frets she begs for the disclosure he flatters her by telling her his desire to keep her in the family she is unilluminated but strongly moved by curiosity he philosophizes on marriage what are we poor creatures we must get through life as we can doing as much good as we can to those we love and think as you please i love old vernon am i not giving you the greatest possible proof of it she will not see then flatly out comes the one condition that and no other take vernon and i release you she refuses now ensues the debate all the oratory being with him is it because of his unfortunate first marriage you assured me you thought no worse of him etc she declares the proposal revolting he can distinguish nothing that should offend her in a proposal to make his cousin happy if she will not him irony and sarcasm relieve his emotions but he convinces her he is dealing plainly and intends generosity she is confused she speaks in maiden fashion he touches again on vernons early escapade she does not enjoy it the scene closes with his bidding her reflect on it and remember the one condition of her release mrs mountstuart jenkinson now reduced to believe that he burns to be free is then called in for an interview with clara his aunts eleanor and isabel besiege her laetitia in passionate earnest besieges her her father is wrought on to besiege her finally vernon is attacked by willoughby and mrs mountstuartand here willoughby chose to think was the main difficulty but the girl has money she is agreeable vernon likes her she is fond of his alps they have tastes in common he likes her father and in the end he besieges her will she yield de craye is absent there is no other way of shunning a marriage she is incomprehensibly but frantically averse to she is in the toils her father will stay at patterne hall as long as his host desires it she hesitates she is overcome in spite of a certain nausea due to vernons preceding alliance she yields willoughby revolved the entire drama in claras presence it helped him to look on her coolly conducting her to the dinnertable he spoke of crossjay not unkindly and at table he revolved the set of scenes with a heated animation that took fire from the wine and the face of his friend horace while he encouraged horace to be flowingly irish he nipped the fellow goodhumouredly once or twice having never felt so friendly to him since the day of his arrival but the position of critic is instinctively taken by men who do not flow and patterne port kept dr middleton in a benevolent reserve when willoughby decided that something said by de craye was not new and laughingly accused him of failing to consult his anecdotal notebook for the doublecross to his last sprightly sally your sallies are excellent horace but spare us your aunt sallies de craye had no repartee nor did dr middleton challenge a pun we have only to sharpen our wits to trip your seductive rattler whenever we may choose to think proper and evidently if we condescended to it we could do better than he the critic who has hatched a witticism is impelled to this opinion judging by the smiles of the ladies they thought so too shortly before eleven oclock dr middleton made a spartan stand against the offer of another bottle of port the regulation couple of bottles had been consumed in equal partnership and the rev doctor and his host were free to pay a ceremonial visit to the drawingroom where they were not expected a piece of work of the elder ladies a silken boudoir sofarug was being examined with high approval of the two younger vernon and colonel de craye had gone out in search of crossjay one to mr dales cottage the other to call at the head and undergamekeepers they were said to be strolling and smoking for the night was fine willoughby left the room and came back with the key of crossjays door in his pocket he foresaw that the delinquent might be of service to him laetitia and clara sang together laetitia was flushed clara pale at eleven they saluted the ladies eleanor and isabel willoughby said goodnight to each of them contrasting as he did so the downcast look of laetitia with claras frigid directness he divined that they were off to talk over their one object of common interest crossjay saluting his aunts he took up the rug to celebrate their diligence and taste and that he might make dr middleton impatient for bed he provoked him to admire it held it out and laid it out and caused the courteous old gentleman some confusion in hitting on fresh terms of commendation before midnight the room was empty ten minutes later willoughby paid it a visit and found it untenanted by the person he had engaged to be there vexed by his disappointment he paced up and down and chanced abstractedly to catch the rug in his hand for what purpose he might well ask himself admiration of ladies work in their absence was unlikely to occur to him nevertheless the touch of the warm soft silk was meltingly feminine a glance at the mantelpiece clock told him laetitia was twenty minutes behind the hour her remissness might endanger all his plans alter the whole course of his life the colours in which he painted her were too lively to last the madness in his head threatened to subside certain it was that he could not be ready a second night for the sacrifice he had been about to perform the clock was at the half hour after twelve he flung the silken thing on the central ottoman extinguished the lamps and walked out of the room charging the absent laetitia to bear her misfortune with a consciousness of deserving it chapter xl midnight sir willoughby and laetitia with young crossjay under a coverlet young crossjay was a glutton at holidays and never thought of home till it was dark the close of the day saw him several miles away from the hall dubious whether he would not round his numerous adventures by sleeping at an inn for he had lots of money and the idea of jumping up in the morning in a strange place was thrilling besides when he was shaken out of sleep by sir willoughby he had been told that he was to go and not to show his face at patterne again on the other hand miss middleton had bidden him come back there was little question with him which person he should obey he followed his heart supper at an inn where he found a company to listen to his adventures delayed him and a short cut intended to make up for it lost him his road he reached the hall very late ready to be in love with the horrible pleasure of a nights rest under the stars if necessary but a candle burned at one of the back windows he knocked and a kitchenmaid let him in she had a bowl of hot soup prepared for him crossjay tried a mouthful to please her his head dropped over it she roused him to his feet and he pitched against her shoulder the dry air of the kitchen department had proved too much for the tired youngster mary the maid got him to step as firmly as he was able and led him by the backway to the hall bidding him creep noiselessly to bed he understood his position in the house and though he could have gone fast to sleep on the stairs he took a steady aim at his room and gained the door catlike the door resisted he was appalled and unstrung in a minute the door was locked crossjay felt as if he were in the presence of sir willoughby he fled on ricketty legs and had a fall and bumps down half a dozen stairs a door opened above he rushed across the hall to the drawingroom invitingly open and there staggered in darkness to the ottoman and rolled himself in something sleek and warm soft as hands of ladies and redolent of them so delicious that he hugged the folds about his head and heels while he was endeavouring to think where he was his legs curled his eyelids shut and he was in the thick of the days adventures doing yet more wonderful things he heard his own name that was quite certain he knew that he heard it with his ears as he pursued the fleetest dreams ever accorded to mortal it did not mix it was outside him and like the dangerpole in the ice which the skater shooting hither and yonder comes on again it recurred and now it marked a point in his career how it caused him to relax his pace he began to circle and whirled closer round it until as at a blow his heart knocked he tightened himself thought of bolting and lay deadstill to throb and hearken oh sir willoughby a voice had said the accents were sharp with alarm my friend my dearest was the answer i came to speak of crossjay will you sit here on the ottoman no i cannot wait i hoped i had heard crossjay return i would rather not sit down may i entreat you to pardon him when he comes home you and you only may do so i permit none else of crossjay tomorrow he may be lying in the fields we are anxious the rascal can take pretty good care of himself crossjay is perpetually meeting accidents he shall be indemnified if he has had excess of punishment i think i will say goodnight sir willoughby when freely and unreservedly you have given me your hand there was hesitation to say goodnight i ask you for your hand goodnight sir willoughby you do not give it you are in doubt still what language must i use to convince you and yet you know me who knows me but you you have always known me you are my home and my temple have you forgotten your verses of the day of my majority the dawnstar has arisen in plenitude of light do not repeat them pray cried laetitia with a gasp i have repeated them to myself a thousand times in india america japan they were like our english skylark carolling to me my heart now burst thy prison with proud aerial flight oh i beg you will not force me to listen to nonsense that i wrote when i was a child no more of those most foolish lines if you knew what it is to write and despise ones writing you would not distress me and since you will not speak of crossjay tonight allow me to retire you know me and therefore you know my contempt for verses as a rule laetitia but not for yours to me why should you call them foolish they expressed your feelingshold them sacred they are something religious to me not mere poetry perhaps the third verse is my favourite it will be more than i can bear you were in earnest when you wrote them i was very young very enthusiastic very silly you were and are my image of constancy it is an error sir willoughby i am far from being the same we are all older i trust wiser i am i will own much wiser wise at last i offer you my hand she did not reply i offer you my hand and name laetitia no response you think me bound in honour to another she was mute i am free thank heaven i am free to choose my matethe woman i have always loved freely and unreservedly as i ask you to give your hand i offer mine you are the mistress of patterne hall my wife she had not a word my dearest do you not rightly understand the hand i am offering you is disengaged it is offered to the lady i respect above all others i have made the discovery that i cannot love without respecting and as i will not marry without loving it ensues that i am freei am yours at lastyour lips move tell me the words have always loved i said you carry in your bosom the magnet of constancy and i in spite of apparent deviations declare to you that i have never ceased to be sensible of the attraction and now there is not an impediment we two against the world we are one let me confess to an old foibleperfectly youthful and you will ascribe it to youth once i desired to absorb i mistrusted that was the reason i perceive it you teach me the difference of an alliance with a lady of intellect the pride i have in you laetitia definitely cures me of that insane passioncall it an insatiable hunger i recognize it as a folly of youth i have as it were gone the tour to come home to youat lastand live our manly life of comparative equals at last then but remember that in the younger man you would have had a despotperhaps a jealous despot young men i assure you are orientally inclined in their ideas of love love gets a bad name from them we my laetitia do not regard love as a selfishness if it is it is the essence of life at least it is our selfishness rendered beautiful i talk to you like a man who has found a compatriot in a foreign land it seems to me that i have not opened my mouth for an age i certainly have not unlocked my heart those who sing for joy are not unintelligible to me if i had not something in me worth saying i think i should sing in every sense you reconcile me to men and the world laetitia why press you to speak i will be the speaker as surely as you know me i know you and laetitia burst forth with no i do not know you said he searchingly mellifluous hardly how not i am changed in what way deeply sedater materially colour will come back have no fear i promise it if you imagine you want renewing i have the specific i my love i forgive mewill you tell me sir willoughby whether you have broken with miss middleton rest satisfied my dear laetitia she is as free as i am i can do no more than a man of honour should do she releases me tomorrow or next day she departs we laetitia you and i my love are home birds it does not do for the home bird to couple with the migratory the little imperceptible change you allude to is nothing italy will restore you i am ready to stake my own healthnever yet shaken by a doctor of medicinei say medicine advisedly for there are doctors of divinity who would shake giantsthat an italian trip will send you backthat i shall bring you home from italy a blooming bride you shake your headdespondently my love i guarantee it cannot i give you colour behold come to the light look in the glass i may redden said laetitia i suppose that is due to the action of the heart i am changed heart for any other purpose i have not i am like you sir willoughby in this i could not marry without loving and i do not know what love is except that it is an empty dream marriage my dearest you are mistaken i will cure you my laetitia look to me i am the tonic it is not common confidence but conviction i my love i there is no cure for what i feel sir willoughby spare me the formal prefix i beg you place your hand in mine relying on me i am pledge for the remainder we end as we began my request is for your handyour hand in marriage i cannot give it to be my wife it is an honour i must decline it are you quite well laetitia i propose in the plainest terms i can employ to make you lady patternemine i am compelled to refuse why refuse your reason the reason has been named he took a stride to inspirit his wits theres a madness comes over women at times i know answer me laetitiaby all the evidence a man can have i could swear itbut answer me you loved me once i was an exceedingly foolish romantic girl you evade my question i am serious oh he walked away from her booming a sound of utter repudiation of her present imbecility and hurrying to her side said but it was manifest to the whole world it was a legend to love like laetitia dale was a current phrase you were an example a light to women no one was your match for devotion you were a precious cameo still gazing and i was the object you loved me you loved me you belonged to me you were mine my possession my jewel i was prouder of your constancy than of anything else that i had on earth it was a part of the order of the universe to me a doubt of it would have disturbed my creed why good heaven where are we is nothing solid on earth you loved me i was childish indeed you loved me passionately do you insist on shaming me through and through sir willoughby i have been exposed enough you cannot blot out the past it is written it is recorded you loved me devotedly silence is no escape you loved me i did you never loved me you shallow woman i did as if there could be a cessation of a love what are we to reckon on as ours we prize a womans love we guard it jealously we trust to it dream of it there is our wealth there is our talisman and when we open the casket it has flownbarren vacuitywe are poorer than dogs as well think of keeping a costly wine in potters clay as love in the heart of a woman there are womenwomen oh they are all of a stamp coin coin for any hand its a fiction an imposturethey cannot love they are the shadows of men compared with men they have as much heart in them as the shadow beside the body laetitia sir willoughby you refuse my offer i must you refuse to take me for your husband i cannot be your wife you have changed you have set your heart you could marry there is a man you could marry one i will have an answer i am sick of evasions what was in the mind of heaven when women were created will be the riddle to the end of the world every good man in turn has made the inquiry i have a right to know who robs mewe may try as we like to solve itsatan is painted laughingi say i have a right to know who robs me answer me i shall not marry that is not an answer i love no one you loved meyou are silentbut you confessed it then you confess it was a love that could die are you unable to perceive how that redounds to my discredit you loved me you have ceased to love me in other words you charge me with incapacity to sustain a womans love you accuse me of inspiring a miserable passion that cannot last a lifetime you let the world see that i am a man to be aimed at for a temporary mark and simply because i happen to be in your neighbourhood at an age when a young woman is impressionable you make a public example of me as a for whom women may have a caprice but that is all he cannot enchain them he fascinates passingly they fall off is it just for me to be taken up and cast down at your will reflect on that scandal shadows why a mans shadow is faithful to him at least what are women there is not a comparison in nature that does not tower above them not one that does not hoot at them i throughout my life guided by absolute deference to their weaknesspaying them politeness courtesywhatever i touch i am happy in except when i touch women how is it what is the mystery some monstrous explanation must exist what can it be i am favoured by fortune from my birth until i enter into relations with women but will you be so good as to account for it in your defence of them oh were the relations dishonourable it would be quite another matter then they i could recount i disdain to chronicle such victories quite another matter but they are flies and i am something more stable they are flies i look beyond the day i owe a duty to my line they are flies i foresee it i shall be crossed in my fate so long as i fail to shun themflies not merely born for the day i maintain that they are spiritually ephemeralwell my opinion of your sex is directly traceable to you you may alter it or fling another of us men out on the world with the old bitter experience consider this that it is on your head if my ideal of women is wrecked it rests with you to restore it i love you i discover that you are the one woman i have always loved i come to you i sue you and suddenlyyou have changed i have changed i am not the same what can it mean i cannot marry i love no one and you say you do not know what love isavowing in the same breath that you did love me am i the empty dream my hand heart fortune name are yours at your feet you kick them hence i am hereyou reject me but why for what mortal reason am i here other than my faith in your love you drew me to you to repel me and have a wretched revenge you know it is not that sir willoughby have you any possible suspicion that i am still entangled not as i assure you i am perfectly free in fact and in honour it is not that name it for you see your power would you have me kneel to you madam oh no it would complete my grief you feel grief then you believe in my affection and you hurl it away i have no doubt that as a poetess you would say love is eternal and you have loved me and you tell me you love me no more you are not very logical laetitia dale poetesses rarely are if i am one which i little pretend to be for writing silly verses i have passed out of that delusion with the rest you shall not wrong those dear old days laetitia i see them now when i rode by your cottage and you were at your window pen in hand your hair straying over your forehead romantic yes not foolish why were you foolish in thinking of me some day i will commission an artist to paint me that portrait of you from my description and i remember when we first whispered i remember your trembling you have forgotteni remember i remember our meeting in the park on the path to church i remember the heavenly morning of my return from my travels and the same laetitia meeting me stedfast and unchangeable could i ever forget those are ineradicable scenes pictures of my youth interwound with me i may say that as i recede from them i dwell on them the more tell me laetitia was there not a certain prophecy of your fathers concerning us two i fancy i heard of one there was one he was an invalid elderly people nurse illusions ask yourself laetitia who is the obstacle to the fulfilment of his predictiontruth if ever a truth was foreseen on earth you have not changed so far that you would feel no pleasure in gratifying him i go to him tomorrow morning with the first light you will compel me to follow and undeceive him do so and i denounce an unworthy affection you are ashamed to avow that would be idle though it would be base proof of love then for no one but you should it be done and no one but you dare accuse me of a baseness sir willoughby you will let my father die in peace he and i together will contrive to persuade you you tempt me to imagine that you want a wife at any cost you laetitia you i am tired she said it is late i would rather not hear more i am sorry if i have caused you pain i suppose you to have spoken with candour i defend neither my sex nor myself i can only say i am a woman as good as dead happy to be made happy in my way but so little alive that i cannot realize any other way as for love i am thankful to have broken a spell you have a younger woman in your mind i am an old one i have no ambition and no warmth my utmost prayer is to float on the streama purely physical desire of life i have no strength to swim such a woman is not the wife for you sir willoughby good night one final word weigh it express no conventional regrets resolutely you refuse resolutely i do you refuse yes i have sacrificed my pride for nothing you refuse yes humbled myself and this is the answer you do refuse i do good night laetitia dale he gave her passage good night sir willoughby i am in your power he said in a voice between supplication and menace that laid a claw on her and she turned and replied you will not be betrayed i can trust you i go home tomorrow before breakfast permit me to escort you upstairs if you please but i see no one here either tonight or tomorrow it is for the privilege of seeing the last of you they withdrew young crossjay listened to the drumming of his head somewhere in or over the cavity a drummer rattled tremendously sir willoughbys laboratory door shut with a slam crossjay tumbled himself off the ottoman he stole up to the unclosed drawingroom door and peeped never was a boy more thoroughly awakened his object was to get out of the house and go through the night avoiding everything human for he was big with information of a character that he knew to be of the nature of gunpowder and he feared to explode he crossed the hall in the passage to the scullery he ran against colonel de craye so there you are said the colonel ive been hunting you crossjay related that his bedroom door was locked and the key gone and sir willoughby sitting up in the laboratory colonel de craye took the boy to his own room where crossjay lay on a sofa comfortably covered over and snug in a swelling pillow but he was restless he wanted to speak to bellow to cry and he bounced round to his left side and bounced to his right not knowing what to think except that there was treason to his adored miss middleton why my lad youre not half a campaigner the colonel called out to him attributing his uneasiness to the material discomfort of the sofa and crossjay had to swallow the taunt bitter though it was a dim sentiment of impropriety in unburdening his overcharged mind on the subject of miss middleton to colonel de craye restrained him from defending himself and so he heaved and tossed about till daybreak at an early hour while his hospitable friend who looked very handsome in profile half breast and head above the sheets continued to slumber crossjay was on his legs and away he says im not half a campaigner and a couple of hours of bed are enough for me the boy thought proudly and snuffed the springing air of the young sun on the fields a glance back at patterne hall dismayed him for he knew not how to act and he was immoderately combustible too full of knowledge for selfcontainment much too zealously excited on behalf of his dear miss middleton to keep silent for many hours of the day chapter xli the rev dr middleton clara and sir willoughby when master crossjay tumbled down the stairs laetitia was in claras room speculating on the various mishaps which might have befallen that battered youngster and clara listened anxiously after laetitia had run out until she heard sir willoughbys voice which in some way satisfied her that the boy was not in the house she waited expecting miss dale to return then undressed went to bed tried to sleep she was tired of strife strange thoughts for a young head shot through her as that it is possible for the sense of duty to counteract distaste and that one may live a life apart from ones admirations and dislikes she owned the singular strength of sir willoughby in outwearying she asked herself how much she had gained by strugglingevery effort seemed to expend her spirits force and rendered her less able to get the clear vision of her prospects as though it had sunk her deeper the contrary of her intention to make each further step confirm her liberty looking back she marvelled at the things she had done looking round how ineffectual they appeared she had still the great scene of positive rebellion to go through with her father the anticipation of that was the cause of her extreme discouragement he had not spoken to her since he became aware of her attempted flight but the scene was coming and besides the wish not to inflict it on him as well as to escape it herself the girls peculiar unhappiness lay in her knowledge that they were alienated and stood opposed owing to one among the more perplexing masculine weaknesses which she could not hint at dared barely think of and would not name in her meditations diverting to other subjects she allowed herself to exclaim wine wine in renewed wonder of what there could be in wine to entrap venerable men and obscure their judgements she was too young to consider that her being very much in the wrong gave all the importance to the cordial glass in a venerable gentlemans appreciation of his dues why should he fly from a priceless wine to gratify the caprices of a fantastical child guilty of seeking to commit a breach of faith he harped on those words her fault was grave no doubt the wine coloured it to him as a drop or two will do in any cup still her fault was grave she was too young for such considerations she was ready to expatiate on the gravity of her fault so long as the humiliation assisted to her disentanglement her snared nature in the toils would not permit her to reflect on it further she had never accurately perceived it for the reason perhaps that willoughby had not been moving in his appeals but admitting the charge of waywardness she had come to terms with conscience upon the understanding that she was to perceive it and regret it and do penance for it byandbyby renouncing marriage altogether how light a penance in the morning she went to laetitias room knocked and had no answer she was informed at the breakfasttable of miss dales departure the ladies eleanor and isabel feared it to be a case of urgency at the cottage no one had seen vernon and clara requested colonel de craye to walk over to the cottage for news of crossjay he accepted the commission simply to obey and be in her service assuring her however that there was no need to be disturbed about the boy he would have told her more had not dr middleton led her out sir willoughby marked a lapse of ten minutes by his watch his excellent aunts had ventured a comment on his appearance that frightened him lest he himself should be the person to betray his astounding discomfiture he regarded his conduct as an act of madness and laetitias as no less that of a madwomanhappily mad very happily mad indeed her rejection of his ridiculously generous proposal seemed to show an intervening hand in his favour that sent her distraught at the right moment he entirely trusted her to be discreet but she was a miserable creature who had lost the one last chance offered her by providence and furnished him with a signal instance of the mediocrity of womans love time was flying in a little while mrs mountstuart would arrive he could not fence her without a design in his head he was destitute of an armoury if he had no scheme he racked the brain only to succeed in rousing phantasmal vapours her infernal twice would cease now to apply to laetitia it would be an echo of lady busshe nay were all in the secret thrice jilted might become the universal roar and this he reflected bitterly of a man whom nothing but duty to his line had arrested from being the most mischievous of his class with women such is our reward for uprightness at the expiration of fifteen minutes by his watch he struck a knuckle on the library door dr middleton held it open to him you are disengaged sir the sermon is upon the paragraph which is toned to awaken the clerk replied the rev doctor clara was weeping sir willoughby drew near her solicitously dr middletons mane of silvery hair was in a state bearing witness to the vehemence of the sermon and willoughby said i hope sir you have not made too much of a trifle i believe sir that i have produced an effect and that was the point in contemplation clara my dear clara willoughby touched her she sincerely repents her conduct i may inform you said dr middleton my love willoughby whispered we have had a misunderstanding i am at a loss to discover where i have been guilty but i take the blame all the blame i implore you not to weep do me the favour to look at me i would not have had you subjected to any interrogation whatever you are not to blame clara said on a sob undoubtedly willoughby is not to blame it was not he who was bound on a runaway errand in flagrant breach of duty and decorum nor he who inflicted a catarrh on a brother of my craft and cloth said her father the clerk sir has pronounced amen observed willoughby and no man is happier to hear an ejaculation that he has laboured for with so much sweat of his brow than the parson i can assure you dr middleton mildly groaned i have notions of the trouble of abraham a sermon of that description is an immolation of the parent however it may go with the child willoughby soothed his clara i wish i had been here to share it i might have saved you some tears i may have been hasty in our little dissensions i will acknowledge that i have been my temper is often irascible and so is mine exclaimed dr middleton and yet i am not aware that i made the worse husband for it nor do i rightly comprehend how a probably justly excitable temper can stand for a plea in mitigation of an attempt at an outrageous breach of faith the sermon is over sir reverberations the rev doctor waved his arm placably take it for thunder heard remote your hand my love willoughby murmured the hand was not put forth dr middleton remarked the fact he walked to the window and perceiving the pair in the same position when he faced about he delivered a cough of admonition it is cruel said clara that the owner of your hand should petition you for it inquired her father she sought refuge in a fit of tears willoughby bent above her mute is a scene that is hardly conceivable as a parents obligation once in a lustrum to be repeated within the half hour shouted her father she drew up her shoulders and shook let them fall and dropped her head my dearest your hand fluted willoughby the hand surrendered it was much like the icicle of a sudden thaw willoughby squeezed it to his ribs dr middleton marched up and down the room with his arms locked behind him the silence between the young people seemed to denounce his presence he said cordially old hiems has but to withdraw for buds to burst jam ver egelidos refert tepores the equinoctial fury departs i will leave you for a term clara and willoughby simultaneously raised their faces with opposing expressions my girl her father stood by her laying gentle hand on her yes papa i will come out to you she replied to his apology for the rather heavy weight of his vocabulary and smiled no sir i beg you will remain said willoughby i keep you frostbound clara did not deny it willoughby emphatically did then which of them was the more loverlike dr middleton would for the moment have supposed his daughter clara said shall you be on the lawn papa willoughby interposed stay sir give us your blessing that you have dr middleton hastily motioned the paternal ceremony in outline a few minutes papa said clara will she name the day came eagerly from willoughby i cannot clara cried in extremity the day is important on its arrival said her father but i apprehend the decision to be of the chief importance at present first prime your piece of artillery my friend the decision is taken sir then i will be out of the way of the firing hit what day you please clara checked herself on an impetuous exclamation it was done that her father might not be detained her astute selfcompression sharpened willoughby as much as it mortified and terrified him he understood how he would stand in an instant were dr middleton absent her father was the tribunal she dreaded and affairs must be settled and made irrevocable while he was with them to sting the blood of the girl he called her his darling and half enwound her shadowing forth a salute she strung her body to submit seeing her father take it as a signal for his immediate retirement willoughby was upon him before he reached the door hear us out sir do not go stay at my entreaty i fear we have not come to a perfect reconcilement if that is your opinion said clara it is good reason for not distressing my father dr middleton i love your daughter i wooed her and won her i had your consent to our union and i was the happiest of mankind in some way since her coming to my house i know not howshe will not tell me or cannoti offended one may be innocent and offend i have never pretended to impeccability which is an admission that i may very naturally offend my appeal to her is for an explanation or for pardon i obtain neither had our positions been reversed oh not for any real offencenot for the worst that can be imaginedi think noti hope notcould i have been tempted to propose the dissolution of our engagement to love is to love with me an engagement a solemn bond with all my errors i have that merit of utter fidelityto the world laughable i confess to a multitude of errors i have that single merit and am not the more estimable in your daughters eyes on account of it i fear in plain words i am i do not doubt one of the fools among men of the description of human dog commonly known as faithfulwhose destiny is that of a tribe a man who cries out when he is hurt is absurd and i am not asking for sympathy call me luckless but i abhor a breach of faith a broken pledge is hateful to me i should regard it myself as a form of suicide there are principles which civilized men must contend for our social fabric is based on them as my word stands for me i hold others to theirs if that is not done the world is more or less a carnival of counterfeits in this instanceah clara my love and you have principles you have inherited you have been indoctrinated with them have i then in my ignorance offended past penitence that you of all women and without being able to name my sinnot only for what i lose by it but in the abstract judiciallyapart from the sentiment of personal interest grief pain and the possibility of my having to endure that which no temptation would induce me to commitjudiciallyi fear sir i am a poor forensic orator the situation sir does not demand a cicero proceed said dr middleton balked in his approving nods at the right true things delivered judicially i am bold to say though it may appear a presumption in one suffering acutely i abhor a breach of faith dr middleton brought his nod down low upon the phrase he had anticipated and i said he personally and presently abhor a breach of faith judicially judicially to examine judicially to condemn but does the judicial mind detest i think sir we are not on the bench when we say that we abhor we have unseated ourselves yet our abhorrence of bad conduct is very certain you would signify impersonally which suffices for this exposition of your feelings he peered at the gentleman under his brows and resumed she has had it willoughby she has had it in plain saxon and in uncompromising olympian there is i conceive no necessity to revert to it pardon me sir but i am still unforgiven you must babble out the rest between you i am about as much at home as a turkey with a pair of pigeons leave us father said clara first join our hands and let me give you that title sir reach the good man your hand my girl forthright from the shoulder like a brave boxer humour a lover he asks for his own it is more than i can do father how it is more than you can do you are engaged to him a plighted woman i do not wish to marry the apology is inadequate i am unworthy chatter chatter i beg him to release me lunacy i have no love to give him have you gone back to your cradle clara middleton oh leave us dear father my offence clara my offence what is it will you only name it father will you leave us we can better speak together we have spoken clara how often willoughby resumed with what resultthat you loved me that you have ceased to love me that your heart was mine that you have withdrawn it plucked it from me that you request me to consent to a sacrifice involving my reputation my life and what have i done i am the same unchangeable i loved and love you my heart was yours and is and will be yours forever you are my affiancedthat is my wife what have i done it is indeed useless clara sighed not useless my girl that you should inform this gentleman your affianced husband of the ground of the objection you conceived against him i cannot say do you know if i could name it i could hope to overcome it dr middleton addressed sir willoughby i verily believe we are directing the girl to dissect a caprice such things are seen large by these young people but as they have neither organs nor arteries nor brains nor membranes dissection and inspection will be alike profitlessly practised your inquiry is natural for a lover whose passion to enter into relations with the sex is ordinarily in proportion to his ignorance of the stuff composing them at a particular age they traffic in whims which are i presume the spiritual of hysterics and are indubitably preferable so long as they are not pushed too far examples are not wanting to prove that a flighty initiative on the part of the male is a handsome corrective in that case we should probably have had the roof off the house and the girl now at your feet ha despise me father i am punished for ever thinking myself the superior of any woman said clara your hand out to him my dear since he is for a formal reconciliation and i cant wonder father i have said i do not i have said i cannot by the most merciful what what the name for it words for it do not frown on me father i wish him happiness i cannot marry him i do not love him you will remember that you informed me aforetime that you did love him i was ignorant i did not know myself i wish him to be happy you deny him the happiness you wish him it would not be for his happiness were i to wed him oh burst from willoughby you hear him he rejects your prediction clara middleton she caught her clasped hands up to her throat wretched wretched both and you have not a word against him miserable girl miserable i am it is the cry of an animal yes father you feel like one your behaviour is of that shape you have not a word against myself not against him and i when you speak so generously am to yield you give you up cried willoughby ah my love my clara impose what you will on me not that it is too much for man it is i swear it beyond my strength pursue continue the strain tis in the right key said dr middleton departing willoughby wheeled and waylaid him with a bound plead for me sir you are allpowerful let her be mine she shall be happy or i will perish for it i will call it on my headimpossible i cannot lose her lose you my love it would be to strip myself of every blessing of body and soul it would be to deny myself possession of grace beauty wit all the incomparable charms of loveliness of mind and person in woman and plant myself in a desert you are my mate the sum of everything i call mine clara i should be less than man to submit to such a loss consent to it but i love you i worship you how can i consent to lose you he saw the eyes of the desperately wily young woman slink sideways dr middleton was pacing at ever shorter lengths closer by the door you hate me willoughby sunk his voice if it should turn to hate she murmured hatred of your husband i could not promise she murmured more softly in her wiliness hatred he cried aloud and dr middleton stopped in his walk and flung up his head hatred of your husband of the man you have vowed to love and honour oh no once mine it is not to be feared i trust to my knowledge of your nature i trust in your blood i trust in your education had i nothing else to inspire confidence i could trust in your eyes and clara take the confession i would rather be hated than lose you for if i lose you you are in another world out of this one holding me in its deathlike cold but if you hate me we are together we are still together any alliance any in preference to separation clara listened with critical ear his language and tone were new and comprehending that they were in part addressed to her father whose phrase a breach of faith he had so cunningly used disdain of the actor prompted the extreme blunder of her sayingfrigidly though she said it you have not talked to me in this way before finally remarked her father summing up the situation to settle it from that little speech he talks to you in this way now and you are under my injunction to stretch your hand out to him for a symbol of union or to state your objection to that course he by your admission is at the terminus and there failing the why not must you join him her head whirled she had been severely flagellated and weakened previous to willoughbys entrance language to express her peculiar repulsion eluded her she formed the words and perceived that they would not stand to bear a breath from her father she perceived too that willoughby was as ready with his agony of supplication as she with hers if she had tears for a resource he had gestures quite as eloquent and a cry of her loathing of the union would fetch a countervailing torrent of the mans lovewhat could she say he is an egoist the epithet has no meaning in such a scene invent shrieked the hundredvoiced instinct of dislike within her and alone with her father alone with willoughby she could have invented some equivalent to do her heart justice for the injury it sustained in her being unable to name the true and immense objection but the pair in presence paralyzed her she dramatized them each springing forward by turns with crushing rejoinders the activity of her mind revelled in giving them a tongue but would not do it for herself then ensued the inevitable consequence of an incapacity to speak at the hearts urgent dictate heart and mind became divided one throbbed hotly the other hung aloof and mentally while the sick inarticulate heart kept clamouring she answered it with all that she imagined for those two men to say and she dropped poison on it to still its reproaches bidding herself remember her fatal postponements in order to preserve the seeming of consistency before her father calling it hypocrite asking herself what was she who loved her and thus beating down her heart she completed the mischief with a piercing view of the foundation of her fathers advocacy of willoughby and more lamentably asked herself what her value was if she stood bereft of respect for her father reason on the other hand was animated by her better nature to plead his case against her she clung to her respect for him and felt herself drowning with it and she echoed willoughby consciously doubling her horror with the consciousness in crying out on a world where the most sacred feelings are subject to such lapses it doubled her horror that she should echo the man but it proved that she was no better than be only some years younger those years would soon be outlived after which he and she would be of a pattern she was unloved she did no harm to any one by keeping her word to this man she had pledged it and it would be a breach of faith not to keep it no one loved her behold the quality of her fathers love to give him happiness was now the principal aim for her her own happiness being decently buried and here he was happy why should she be the cause of his going and losing the poor pleasure he so much enjoyed the idea of her devotedness flattered her feebleness she betrayed signs of hesitation and in hesitating she looked away from a look at willoughby thinking so much against her nature was it to resign herself to him that it would not have been so difficult with an illfavoured man with one horribly ugly it would have been a horrible exultation to cast off her youth and take the fiendish leap unfortunately for sir willoughby he had his reasons for pressing impatience and seeing her deliberate seeing her hasty look at his fine figure his opinion of himself combined with his recollection of a particular maxim of the great book to assure him that her resistance was over chiefly owing as he supposed to his physical perfections frequently indeed in the contest between gentlemen and ladies have the maxims of the book stimulated the assailant to victory they are rosy with blood of victims to bear them is to hear a horn that blows the mort has blown it a thousand times it is good to remember how often they have succeeded when for the benefit of some future lady vauban who may bestir her wits to gather maxims for the inspiriting of the defence the circumstance of a failure has to be recorded willoughby could not wait for the melting of the snows he saw full surely the dissolving process and sincerely admiring and coveting her as he did rashly this illfated gentleman attempted to precipitate it and so doing arrested whence might we draw a note upon yonder maxim in words akin to these make certain ere a breath come from thee that thou be not a frost mine she is mine he cried mine once more mine utterly mine eternally and he followed up his devouring exclamations in person as she less decidedly retreated she retreated as young ladies should ever do two or three steps and he would not notice that she had become an angry dian all arrows her maidenliness in surrendering pleased him grasping one fair hand he just allowed her to edge on the outer circle of his embrace crying not a syllable of what i have gone through you shall not have to explain it my clara i will study you more diligently to be guided by you my darling if i offend again my wife will not find it hard to speak what my bride withheldi do not ask why perhaps not able to weigh the effect of her reticence not at that time when she was younger and less experienced estimating the sacredness of a plighted engagement it is past we are one my dear sir and father you may leave us now i profoundly rejoice to hear that i may said dr middleton clara writhed her captured hand no papa stay it is an error an error you must not leave me do not think me utterly eternally belonging to any one but you no one shall say i am his but you are you quicksands clara middleton that nothing can be built on you whither is a flighty head and a shifty will carrying the girl clara and i sir said willoughby and so you shall said the doctor turning about not yet papa clara sprang to him why you you you it was you who craved to be alone with willoughby her father shouted and here we are rounded to our startingpoint with the solitary difference that now you do not want to be alone with willoughby first i am bidden go next i am pulled back and judging by collar and coattag i suspect you to be a young woman to wear an angels temper threadbare before you determine upon which one of the tides driving him to and fro you intend to launch on yourself where is your mind clara smoothed her forehead i wish to please you papa i request you to please the gentleman who is your appointed husband i am anxious to perform my duty that should be a satisfactory basis for you willoughby as girls go let me sir simply entreat to have her hand in mine before you why not clara why an empty ceremony papa the implication is that she is prepared for the important one friend willoughby her hand sir the reassurance of her hand in mine under your eyesafter all that i have suffered i claim it i think i claim it reasonably to restore me to confidence quite reasonably which is not to say necessarily but i will add justifiably and it may be sagaciously when dealing with the volatile and here said willoughby is my hand clara recoiled he stepped on her father frowned she lifted both her hands from the shrinking elbows darted a look of repulsion at her pursuer and ran to her father crying call it my mood i am volatile capricious flighty very foolish but you see that i attach a real meaning to it and feel it to be binding i cannot think it an empty ceremony if it is before you yes only be a little considerate to your moody girl she will be in a fitter state in a few hours spare me this moment i must collect myself i thought i was free i thought he would not press me if i give my hand hurriedly now i shall i know immediately repent it there is the picture of me but papa i mean to try to be above that and if i go and walk by myself i shall grow calm to perceive where my duty lies in which direction shall you walk said willoughby wisdom is not upon a particular road said dr middleton i have a dread sir of that one which leads to the railwaystation with some justice dr middleton sighed over his daughter clara coloured to deep crimson but she was beyond anger and was rather gratified by an offence coming from willoughby i will promise not to leave his grounds papa my child you have threatened to be a breaker of promises oh she wailed but i will make it a vow to you why not make it a vow to me this moment for this gentlemans contentment that he shall be your husband within a given period i will come to you voluntarily i burn to be alone i shall lose her exclaimed willoughby in heartfelt earnest how so said dr middleton i have her sir if you will favour me by continuing in abeyanceyou will come within an hour voluntarily clara and you will either at once yield your hand to him or you will furnish reasons and they must be good ones for withholding it yes papa you will i will mind i say reasons reasons papa if i have none if you have none that are to my satisfaction you implicitly and instantly and cordially obey my command i will obey what more would you require dr middleton bowed to sir willoughby in triumph will she sir sir she is your daughter sir i am satisfied she has perchance wrestled with her engagement as the aboriginals of a land newly discovered by a crew of adventurous colonists do battle with the garments imposed on them by our considerate civilizationultimately to rejoice with excessive dignity in the wearing of a battered cockedhat and trowsers not extending to the shanks but she did not break her engagement sir and we will anticipate that moderating a young womans native wildness she may after the manner of my comparison take a similar pride in her fortune in good season willoughby had not leisure to sound the depth of dr middletons compliment he had seen clara gliding out of the room during the delivery and his fear returned on him that not being won she was lost she has gone her father noticed her absence she does not waste time in her mission to procure that astonishing product of a shallow soil her reasons if such be the object of her search but no it signifies that she deems herself to have need of composurenothing more no one likes to be turned about we like to turn ourselves about and in the question of an act to be committed we stipulate that it shall be our actgirls and others after the lapse of an hour it will appear to her as her act happily willoughby we do not dine away from patterne tonight no sir it may be attributable to a sense of deserving but i could plead guilty to a weakness for old port today there shall be an extra bottle sir all going favourably with you as i have no cause to doubt said dr middleton with the motion of wafting his host out of the library chapter xlii shows the divining arts of a perceptive mind starting from the hall a few minutes before dr middleton and sir willoughby had entered the drawingroom overnight vernon parted company with colonel de craye at the parkgates and betook himself to the cottage of the dales where nothing had been heard of his wanderer and he received the same disappointing reply from dr corney out of the bedroom window of the genial physician whose astonishment at his covering so long a stretch of road at night for news of a boy like crossjaygifted with the lives of a catbecame violent and rapped punchlike blows on the windowsill at vernons refusal to take shelter and rest vernons excuse was that he had no one but that fellow to care for and he strode off naming a farm five miles distant dr corney howled an invitation to early breakfast to him in the event of his passing on his way back and retired to bed to think of him the result of a variety of conjectures caused him to set vernon down as miss middletons knight and he felt a strong compassion for his poor friend though thought he a hopeless attachment is as pretty an accompaniment to the tune of life as a gentleman might wish to have for its one of those big doses of discord which make all the minor ones fit in like an agreeable harmony and so he shuffles along as pleasantly as the fortunefavoured when they come to compute sir willoughby was the fortunefavoured in the little doctors mind that highstepping gentleman having wealth and public consideration and the most ravishing young lady in the world for a bride still though he reckoned all these advantages enjoyed by sir willoughby at their full value he could imagine the ultimate balance of good fortune to be in favour of vernon but to do so he had to reduce the whole calculation to the extreme abstract and feed his lean friend as it were on dew and roots and the happy effect for vernon lay in a distant future on the borders of old age where he was to be blessed with his ladys regretful preference and rejoice in the fruits of good constitutional habits the reviewing mind was irish sir willoughby was a character of man profoundly opposed to dr corneys nature the latters instincts bristled with antagonismnot to his race for vernon was of the same race partly of the same blood and corney loved him the type of person was the annoyance and the circumstance of its prevailing successfulness in the country where he was placed while it held him silent as if under a law heaped stores of insurgency in the celtic bosom corney contemplating sir willoughby and a trotting kern governed by strongbow have a point of likeness between them with the point of difference that corney was enlightened to know of a friend better adapted for eminent station and especially better adapted to please a lovely ladycould these highbred englishwomen but be taught to conceive another idea of manliness than the formal carvedinwood idol of their national worship dr corney breakfasted very early without seeing vernon he was off to a patient while the first lark of the morning carolled above and the business of the day not yet fallen upon men in the shape of cloud was happily intermixed with natures hues and pipings turning off the highroad tip a green lane an hour later he beheld a youngster prying into a hedge head and arms by the peculiar strenuous twist of whose hinder parts indicative of a frame plunged on the pursuit in hand he clearly distinguished young crossjay out came eggs the doctor pulled up what bird he bellowed yellowhammer crossjay yelled back now sir youll drop a couple of those eggs in the nest dont order me crossjay was retorting oh its you doctor corney good morning i said that because i always do drop a couple back i promised mr whitford i would and miss middleton too had breakfast not yet not hungry i should be if i thought about it jump up i think id rather not doctor corney and youll just do what doctor corney tells you and set your mind on rashers of curly fat bacon and sweetly smoking coffee toast hot cakes marmalade and damsonjam wide go the fellows nostrils and theres water at the dimples of his mouth up my man crossjay jumped up beside the doctor who remarked as he touched his horse i dont want a man this morning though ill enlist you in my service if i do youre fond of miss middleton instead of answering crossjay heaved the sigh of love that bears a burden and so am i pursued the doctor youll have to put up with a rival its worse than fond im in love with her how do you like that i dont mind how many love her said crossjay youre worthy of a gratuitous breakfast in the front parlour of the best hotel of the place they call arcadia and how about your bed last night pretty middling hard was it where the bones havent cushion i dont care for bed a couple of hours and thats enough for me but youre fond of miss middleton anyhow and thats a virtue to his great surprise dr corney beheld two big round tears force their way out of this tough youngsters eyes and all the while the boys face was proud crossjay said when he could trust himself to disjoin his lips i want to see mr whitford have you got news for him ive something to ask him its about what i ought to do then my boy you have the right name addressed in the wrong direction for i found you turning your shoulders on mr whitford and he has been out of his bed hunting you all the unholy night youve made it for him thats melancholy what do you say to asking my advice crossjay sighed i cant speak to anybody but mr whitford and youre hot to speak to him i want to and i found you running away from him youre a curiosity mr crossjay patterne ah sod anybody be who knew as much as i do said crossjay with a sober sadness that caused the doctor to treat him seriously the fact is he said mr whitford is beating the country for you my best plan will be to drive you to the hall id rather not go to the hall crossjay spoke resolutely you wont see miss middleton anywhere but at the hall i dont want to see miss middleton if i cant be a bit of use to her no danger threatening the lady is there crossjay treated the question as if it had not been put now tell me said dr corney would there be a chance for me supposing miss middleton were disengaged the answer was easy im sure she wouldnt and why sir are you so cock sure there was no saying but the doctor pressed for it and at last crossjay gave his opinion that she would take mr whitford the doctor asked why and crossjay said it was because mr whitford was the best man in the world to which with a lusty amen to that dr corney remarked i should have fancied colonel de craye would have had the first chance hes more of a ladys man crossjay surprised him again by petulantly saying dont the boy added i dont want to talk except about birds and things what a jolly morning it is i saw the sun rise no rain today youre right about hungry doctor corney the kindly little man swung his whip crossjay informed him of his disgrace at the hall and of every incident connected with it from the tramp to the baronet save miss middletons adventure and the night scene in the drawingroom a strong smell of something left out struck dr corney and he said youll not let miss middleton know of my affection after all its only a little bit of love but as patrick said to kathleen when she owned to such a little bit thats the best bit of all and he was as right as i am about hungry crossjay scorned to talk of loving he declared i never tell miss middleton what i feel why theres miss dales cottage its nearer to your empty inside than my mansion said the doctor and well stop just to inquire whether a beds to be had for you there tonight and if not ill have you with me and bottle you and exhibit you for youre a rare specimen breakfast you may count on from mr dale i spy a gentleman its colonel de craye come after news of you i wonder miss middleton sends him of course she does crossjay turned his full face to the doctor i havent seen her for such a long time but he saw me last night and he might have told her that if shes anxiousgoodmorning colonel ive had a good walk and a capital drive and im as hungry as the boats crew of captain bligh he jumped down the colonel and the doctor saluted smiling ive rung the bell said de craye a maid came to the gate and upon her steps appeared miss dale who flung herself at crossjay mingling kisses and reproaches she scarcely raised her face to the colonel more than to reply to his greeting and excuse the hungry boy for hurrying indoors to breakfast ill wait said de craye he had seen that she was paler than usual so had dr corney and the doctor called to her concerning her fathers health she reported that he had not yet risen and took crossjay to herself thats well said the doctor if the invalid sleeps long the lady is not looking so well though but ladies vary they show the mind on the countenance for want of the punching we meet with to conceal it theyre like military flags for a funeral or a gala one day furled and next day streaming men are ships figureheads about the same for a storm or a calm and not too handsome thanks to the ocean its an age since we encountered last colonel on board the dublin boat i recollect and a night it was i recollect that you set me on my legs doctor ah and youll please to notify that corneys no quack at sea by favour of the monks of the chartreuse whose elixir has power to still the waves and we hear that miracles are done with roll a physician and a monk together doctor true itll be a miracle if they combine though the cure of the soul is often the entire and total cure of the body and its maliciously said that the body given over to our treatment is a signal to set the soul flying by the way colonel that boy has a trifle on his mind i suppose he has been worrying a farmer or a gamekeeper try him youll find him tight hes got miss middleton on the brain theres a bit of a secret and hes not so cheerful about it well see said the colonel dr corney nodded i have to visit my patient here presently im too early for him so ill make a call or two on the lame birds that are up he remarked and drove away de craye strolled through the garden he was a gentleman of those actively perceptive wits which if ever they reflect do so by hops and jumps upon some dancing mirror within we may fancy he penetrated a plot in a flash and in a flash he formed one but in both cases it was after long hovering and not overeager deliberation by the patient exercise of his quick perceptives the fact that crossjay was considered to have miss middleton on the brain threw a series of images of everything relating to crossjay for the last forty hours into relief before him and as he did not in the slightest degree speculate on any one of them but merely shifted and surveyed them the falcon that he was in spirit as well as in his handsome face leisurely allowed his instinct to direct him where to strike a reflective disposition has this danger in action that it commonly precipitates conjecture for the purpose of working upon probabilities with the methods and in the tracks to which it is accustomed and to conjecture rashly is to play into the puzzles of the maze he who can watch circling above it awhile quietly viewing and collecting in his eye gathers matter that makes the secret thing discourse to the brain by weight and balance he will get either the right clue or none more frequently none but he will escape the entanglement of his own cleverness he will always be nearer to the enigma than the guesser or the calculator and he will retain a breadth of vision forfeited by them he must however to have his chance of success be acutely besides calmly perceptive a reader of features audacious at the proper moment de craye wished to look at miss dale she had returned home very suddenly not as it appeared owing to her fathers illness and he remembered a redness of her eyelids when he passed her on the corridor one night she sent crossjay out to him as soon as the boy was well filled he sent crossjay back with a request she did not yield to it immediately she stepped to the front door reluctantly and seemed disconcerted de craye begged for a message to miss middleton there was none to give he persisted but there was really none at present she said you wont entrust me with the smallest word said he and set her visibly thinking whether she could dispatch a word she could not she had no heart for messages i shall see her in a day or two colonel de craye she will miss you severely we shall soon meet and poor willoughby laetitia coloured and stood silent a butterfly of some rarity allured crossjay i fear he has been doing mischief she said i cannot get him to look at me his appetite is good very good indeed de craye nodded a boy with a noble appetite is never a hopeless lock the colonel and crossjay lounged over the garden and now said the colonel well see if we cant arrange a meeting between you and miss middleton youre a lucky fellow for shes always thinking of you i know im always thinking of her said crossjay if ever youre in a scrape shes the person you must go to yes if i know where she is why generally shell be at the hall there was no reply crossjays dreadful secret jumped to his throat he certainly was a weaker lock for being full of breakfast i want to see mr whitford so much he said something to tell him i dont know what to do i dont understand it the secret wriggled to his mouth he swallowed it down yes i want to talk to mr whitford hes another of miss middletons friends i know he is hes true steel were all her friends crossjay i flatter myself im a toledo when im wanted how long had you been in the house last night before you ran into me i dont know sir i fell asleep for some time and then i woke where did you find yourself i was in the drawingroom come crossjay youre not a fellow to be scared by ghosts you looked it when you made a dash at my midriff i dont believe there are such things do you colonel you cant theres no saying well hope not for it wouldnt be fair fighting a man with a ghost to back himd beat any ten we couldnt box him or play cards or stand a chance with him as a rival in love did you now catch a sight of a ghost they werent ghosts crossjay said what he was sure of and his voice pronounced his conviction i doubt whether miss middleton is particularly happy remarked the colonel why why you upset her you know now and then the boy swelled id do id go i wouldnt have her unhappy its that thats it and i dont know what i ought to do i wish i could see mr whitford you get into such headlong scrapes my lad i wasnt in any scrape yesterday so you made yourself up a comfortable bed in the drawingroom luckily sir willoughby didnt see you he didnt though a close shave was it i was under a covering of something silk he woke you i suppose he did i heard him talking he was talking what talking to himself no the secret threatened crossjay to be out or suffocate him de craye gave him a respite you like sir willoughby dont you crossjay produced a stillborn affirmative hes kind to you said the colonel hell set you up and look after your interests yes i like him said crossjay with his customary rapidity in touching the subject i like him hes kind and all that and tips and plays with you and all that but i never can make out why he wouldnt see my father when my father came here to see him ten miles and had to walk back ten miles in the rain to go by rail a long way down home as far as devonport because sir willoughby wouldnt see him though he was at home my father saw we all thought it so odd and my father wouldnt let us talk much about it my fathers a very brave man captain patterne is as brave a man as ever lived said de craye im positive youd like him colonel i know of his deeds and i admire him and thats a good step to liking he warmed the boys thoughts of his father because what they say at home is a little bread and cheese and a glass of ale and a rest to a poor manlots of great houses will give you that and we wouldnt have asked for more than that my sisters say they think sir willoughby must be selfish hes awfully proud and perhaps it was because my father wasnt dressed well enough but what can we do were very poor at home and lots of us and all hungry my father says he isnt paid very well for his services to the government hes only a marine hes a hero said de craye he came home very tired with a cold and had a doctor but sir willoughby did send him money and mother wished to send it back and my father said she was not like a womanwith our big family he said he thought sir willoughby an extraordinary man not at all very common indigenous said de craye the art of cutting is one of the branches of a polite education in this country and youll have to learn it if you expect to be looked on as a gentleman and a patterne my boy i begin to see how it is miss middleton takes to you so follow her directions but i hope you did not listen to a private conversation miss middleton would not approve of that colonel de craye how could i help myself i heard a lot before i knew what it was there was poetry still crossjay if it was importantwas it the boy swelled again and the colonel asked him does miss dale know of your having played listener she said crossjay oh i couldnt tell her he breathed thick then came a threat of tears she wouldnt do anything to hurt miss middleton im sure of that it wasnt her fault shethere goes mr whitford crossjay bounded away the colonel had no inclination to wait for his return he walked fast up the road not perspicuously conscious that his motive was to be well in advance of vernon whitford to whom after all the knowledge imparted by crossjay would be of small advantage that fellow would probably trot of to willoughby to row him for breaking his word to miss middleton there are men thought de craye who see nothing feel nothing he crossed a stile into the wood above the lake where as he was in the humour to think himself signally lucky espying her he took it as a matter of course that the lady who taught his heart to leap should be posted by the fates and he wondered little at her power for rarely had the world seen such union of princess and sylph as in that ladys figure she stood holding by a beechbranch gazing down on the water she had not heard him when she looked she flushed at the spectacle of one of her thousand thoughts but she was not startled the colour overflowed a grave face and tis not quite the first time that willoughby has played this trick de craye said to her keenly smiling with a parted mouth clara moved her lips to recall remarks introductory to so abrupt and strange a plunge he smiled in that peculiar manner of an illuminated comic perception for the moment he was all falcon and he surprised himself more than clara who was not in the mood to take surprises it was the sight of her which had animated him to strike his game he was down on it another instinct at work they spring up in twenties oftener than in twos when the heart is the hunter prompted him to directness and quickness to carry her on the flood of the discovery she regained something of her mental selfpossession as soon as she was on a level with a meaning she had not yet inspected but she had to submit to his lead distinctly perceiving where its drift divided to the forked currents of what might be in his mind and what was in hers miss middleton i bear a bit of a likeness to the messenger to the glorious despotmy head is off if i speak not true everything i have is on the die did i guess wrong your wishi read it in the dark by the heart but heres a certainty willoughby sets you free you have come from him she could imagine nothing else and she was unable to preserve a disguise she trembled from miss dale ah clara drooped she told me that once tis the fact that tells it now you have not seen him since you left the house darkly clear enough not unlike the hand of destinythrough a veil he offered himself to miss dale last night about between the witching hours of twelve and one miss dale would she other could she the poor lady has languished beyond a decade shes love in the feminine person are you speaking seriously colonel de craye would i dare to trifle with you miss middleton i have reason to know it cannot be if i have a head it is a fresh and blooming truth and morei stake my vanity on it let me go to her she stepped consider said he miss dale and i are excellent friends it would not seem indelicate to her she has a kind of regard for me through crossjayoh can it be there must be some delusion you have seenyou wish to be of service to me you may too easily be deceived last nighthe last night and this morning tis not the first time our friend has played the trick miss middleton but this is incredible that last night and this morning in my fathers presence he presses you have seen miss dale everything is possible of him they were together i know colonel de craye i have not the slightest chance of concealment with you i think i felt that when i first saw you will you let me hear why you are so certain miss middleton when i first had the honour of looking on you it was in a posture that necessitated my looking up and morally so it has been since i conceived that willoughby had won the greatest prize of earth and next i was led to the conclusion that he had won it to lose it whether he much cares is the mystery i havent leisure to fathom himself is the principal consideration with himself and ever was you discovered it said clara he uncovered it said de craye the miracle was that the world wouldnt see but the world is a piggywiggy world for the wealthy fellow who fills a trough for it and that he has always very sagaciously done only women besides myself have detected him i have never exposed him i have been an observer pure and simple and because i apprehended another catastrophemaking something like the fourth to my knowledge one being public you knew miss durham and harry oxford too and theyre a pair as happy as blackbirds in a cherrytree in a summer sunrise with the owner of the garden asleep because of that apprehension of mine i refused the office of best man till willoughby had sent me a third letter he insisted on my coming i came saw and was conquered i trust with all my soul i did not betray myself i owed that duty to my position of concealing it as for entirely hiding that i had used my eyes i cant say they must answer for it the colonel was using his eyes with an increasing suavity that threatened more than sweetness i believe you have been sincerely kind said clara we will descend to the path round the lake she did not refuse her hand on the descent and he let it escape the moment the service was done as he was performing the admirable character of the man of honour he had to attend to the observance of details and sure of her though he was beginning to feel there was a touch of the unknown in clara middleton which made him fear to stamp assurance despite a barely resistible impulse coming of his emotions and approved by his maxims he looked at the hand now a free ladys hand willoughby settled his chance was great who else was in the way no one he counselled himself to wait for her she might have ideas of delicacy her face was troubled speculative the brows clouded the lips compressed you have not heard this from miss dale she said last night they were together this morning she fled i saw her this morning distressed she is unwilling to send you a message she talks vaguely of meeting you some days hence and it is not the first time he has gone to her for his consolation that is not a proposal clara reflected he is too prudent he did not propose to her at the time you mention have you not been hasty colonel de craye shadows crossed her forehead she glanced in the direction of the house and stopped her walk last night miss middleton there was a listener who crossjay was under that pretty silk coverlet worked by the miss patternes he came home late found his door locked and dashed downstairs into the drawingroom where he snuggled up and dropped asleep the two speakers woke him they frightened the poor dear lad in his love for you and after they had gone he wanted to run out of the house and i met him just after i had come back from my search bursting and took him to my room and laid him on the sofa and abused him for not lying quiet he was restless as a fish on a bank when i woke in the morning he was off doctor corney came across him somewhere on the road and drove him to the cottage i was ringing the bell corney told me the boy had you on his brain and was miserable so crossjay and i had a talk crossjay did not repeat to you the conversation he had heard said clara no she smiled rejoicingly proud of the boy as she walked on but youll pardon me miss middletonand im for him as much as you areif i was guilty of a little angling my sympathies are with the fish the poor fellow had a secret that hurt him it rose to the surface crying to be hooked and i spared him twice or thrice because he had a sort of holy sentiment i respected that none but mr whitford ought to be his father confessor crossjay she cried hugging her love of the boy the secret was one not to be communicated to miss dale of all people he said that as good as the very words she informed me too that she couldnt induce him to face her straight oh that looks like it and crossjay was unhappy very unhappy he was just where tears are on the brim and would have been over if he were not such a manly youngster it looks she reverted in thought to willoughby and doubted and blindly stretched hands to her recollection of the strange old monster she had discovered in him such a man could do anything that conclusion fortified her to pursue her walk to the house and give battle for freedom willoughby appeared to her scarce human unreadable save by the key that she could supply she determined to put faith in colonel de crayes marvellous divination of circumstances in the dark marvels are solid weapons when we are attacked by real prodigies of nature her countenance cleared she conversed with de craye of the polite and the political world throwing off her personal burden completely and charming him at the edge of the garden on the bridge that crossed the haha from the park he had a second impulse almost a warning within to seize his heavenly opportunity to ask for thanks and move her tender lowered eyelids to hint at his reward he repressed it doubtful of the wisdom something like heaven forgive me was in claras mind though she would have declared herself innocent before the scrutator chapter xliii in which sir willoughby is led to think that the elements have conspired against him clara had not taken many steps in the garden before she learned how great was her debt of gratitude to colonel de craye willoughby and her father were awaiting her de craye with his ready comprehension of circumstances turned aside unseen among the shrubs she advanced slowly the vapours we may trust have dispersed her father hailed her one word and these discussions are over we dislike them equally said willoughby no scenes dr middleton added speak your decision my girl pro forma seeing that he who has the right demands it and pray release me clara looked at willoughby i have decided to go to miss dale for her advice there was no appearance in him of a man that has been shot to miss dalefor advice dr middleton invoked the furies what is the signification of this new freak miss dale must be consulted papa consulted with reference to the disposal of your hand in marriage she must be miss dale do you say i do papa dr middleton regained his natural elevation from the bend of body habitual with men of an established sanity paedagogues and others who are called on at odd intervals to inspect the magnitude of the infinitesimally absurd in human nature small that is under the light of reason immense in the realms of madness his daughter profoundly confused him he swelled out his chest remarking to willoughby i do not wonder at your scared expression of countenance my friend to discover yourself engaged to a girl mad as cassandra without a boast of the distinction of her being sunstruck can be no specially comfortable enlightenment i am opposed to delays and i will not have a breach of faith committed by daughter of mine do not repeat those words clara said to willoughby he started she had evidently come armed but how within so short a space what could have instructed her and in his bewilderment he gazed hurriedly above gulped air and cried scared sir i am not aware that my countenance can show a scare i am not accustomed to sue for long i am unable to sustain the part of humble supplicant she puts me out of harmony with creationwe are plighted clara it is pure waste of time to speak of soliciting advice on the subject would it be a breach of faith for me to break my engagement she said you ask it is a breach of sanity to propound the interrogation said her father she looked at willoughby now he shrugged haughtily since last night she said last night am i not released not by me by your act my dear clara have you not virtually disengaged me i who claim you as mine can you i do and must after last night tricks shufflings jabber of a barbarian woman upon the evolutions of a serpent exclaimed dr middleton you were to capitulate or to furnish reasons for your refusal you have none give him your hand girl according to the compact i praised you to him for returning within the allotted term and now forbear to disgrace yourself and me is he perfectly free to offer his ask him papa perform your duty do let us have peace perfectly free as on the day when i offered it first willoughby frankly waved his honourable hand his face was blanched enemies in the air seemed to have whispered things to her he doubted the fidelity of the powers above since last night said she oh if you insist i reply since last night you know what i mean sir willoughby oh certainly you speak the truth sir willoughby her father ejaculated in wrath but will you explain what you mean epitome that you are of all the contradictions and mutabilities ascribed to women from the beginning certainly he says and knows no more than i she begs grace for an hour and returns with a fresh store of evasions to insult the man she has injured it is my humiliation to confess that our share in this contract is rescued from public ignominy by his generosity nor can i congratulate him on his fortune should he condescend to bear with you to the utmost for instead of the young woman i supposed myself to be bestowing on him i see a fantastical planguncula enlivened by the wanton tempers of a nursery chit if one may conceive a meaning in her in miserable apology for such behaviour some spirit of jealousy informs the girl i can only remark that there is no foundation for it said willoughby i am willing to satisfy you clara name the person who discomposes you i can scarcely imagine one to exist but who can tell she could name no person the detestable imputation of jealousy would be confirmed if she mentioned a name and indeed laetitia was not to be named he pursued his advantage jealousy is one of the fits i am a stranger toi fancy sir that gentlemen have dismissed it i speak for myselfbut i can make allowances in some cases it is considered a compliment and often a word will soothe it the whole affair is so senseless however i will enter the witnessbox or stand at the prisoners bar anything to quiet a distempered mind of you sir said dr middleton might a parent be justly proud it is not jealousy i could not be jealous clara cried stung by the very passion and she ran through her brain for a suggestion to win a sign of meltingness if not esteem from her father she was not an iron maiden but one among the nervous natures which live largely in the moment though she was then sacrificing it to her natures deep dislike you may be proud of me again papa she could hardly have uttered anything more impolitic optume but deliver yourself ad rem he rejoined alarmingly pacified firmavit fidem do you likewise and double on us no more like puss in the field i wish to see miss dale she said up flew the rev doctors arms in wrathful despair resembling an imprecation she is at the cottage you could have seen her said willoughby evidently she had not is it untrue that last night between twelve oclock and one in the drawingroom you proposed marriage to miss dale he became convinced that she must have stolen downstairs during his colloquy with laetitia and listened at the door on behalf of old vernon he said lightly laughing the idea is not novel as you know they are suited if they could see itlaetitia dale and my cousin vernon whitford sir fairly schemed my friend and i will say for you you have the patience willoughby of a husband willoughby bowed to the encomium and allowed some fatigue to be visible he half yawned i claim no happier title sir and made light of the weariful discussion clara was shaken she feared that crossjay had heard incorrectly or that colonel de craye had guessed erroneously it was too likely that willoughby should have proposed vernon to laetitia there was nothing to reassure her save the vision of the panic amazement of his face at her persistency in speaking of miss dale she could have declared on oath that she was right while admitting all the suppositions to be against her and unhappily all the delicacies a doughty battalion for the defence of ladies until they enter into difficulties and are shorn of them at a blow bare as dairymaids all the bodyguard of a young gentlewoman the drawingroom sylphides which bear her train which wreathe her hair which modulate her voice and tone her complexion which are arrows and shield to awe the creature man forbade her utterance of what she felt on pain of instant fulfilment of their oftrepeated threat of late to leave her to the last remnant of a protecting sprite she could not as in a dear melodrama from the aim of a pointed finger denounce him on the testimony of her instincts false of speech false in deed she could not even declare that she doubted his truthfulness the refuge of a sullen fit the refuge of tears the pretext of a mood were denied her now by the rigour of those laws of decency which are a garment to ladies of pure breeding one more respite papa she implored him bitterly conscious of the closer tangle her petition involved and if it must be betrayed of her perceiving in an illumination how the knot might become so woefully gordian that haply in a cloud of wild events the intervention of a gallant gentleman out of heaven albeit in the likeness of one of earth would have to cut it her cry within as she succumbed to weakness being fervider anything but marry this one she was faint with strife and dejected a condition in the young when their imaginative energies hold revel uncontrolled and are projectively desperate no respite said willoughby genially and i say no respite observed her father you have assumed a position that has not been granted you clara middleton i cannot bear to offend you father him your duty is not to offend him address your excuses to him i refuse to be dragged over the same ground to reiterate the same command perpetually if authority is deputed to me i claim you said willoughby you have not broken faith with me assuredly not or would it be possible for me to press my claim and join the right hand to the right said dr middleton no it would not be possible what insane root she has been nibbling i know not but she must consign herself to the guidance of those whom the gods have not abandoned until her intellect is liberated she was once there i look not backif she it was and no simulacrum of a reasonable daughter i welcome the appearance of my friend mr whitford he is my seabath and supper on the beach of troy after the days battle and dust vernon walked straight up to them an act unusual with him for he was shy of committing an intrusion clara guessed by that and more by the dancing frown of speculative humour he turned on willoughby that he had come charged in support of her his forehead was curiously lively as of one who has got a surprise well under to feed on its amusing contents have you seen crossjay mr whitford she said ive pounced on crossjay his bones are sound where did he sleep on a sofa it seems she smiled with good hopevernon had the story willoughby thought it just to himself that he should defend his measure of severity the boy lied he played a double game for which he should have been reasoned with at the grecian portico of a boy said the rev doctor my system is different sir i could not inflict what i would not endure myself so is greek excluded from the later generations and you leave a field the most fertile in the moralities in youth unplowed and unsown ah well this growing too fine is our way of relapsing upon barbarism beware of oversensitiveness where nature has plainly indicated her alternative gateway of knowledge and now i presume i am at liberty vernon will excuse us for a minute or two i hold by mr whitford now i have him ill join you in the laboratory vernon willoughby nodded bluntly we will leave them mr whitford they are at the timehonoured dissension upon a particular day that for the sake of dignity blushes to be named what day said vernon like a rustic the day these people call it vernon sent one of his vivid eyeshots from one to the other his eyes fixed on willoughbys with a quivering glow beyond amazement as if his humour stood at furnaceheat and absorbed all that came willoughby motioned to him to go have you seen miss dale mr whitford said clara he answered no something has shocked her is it her feeling for crossjay ah vernon said to willoughby your pocketing of the key of crossjays bedroom door was a masterstroke the celestial irony suffused her and she bathed and swam in it on hearing its dupe reply my methods of discipline are short i was not aware that she had been to his door but i may hope that miss dale will see me said clara we are in sympathy about the boy mr dale might be seen he seems to be of a divided mind with his daughter vernon rejoined she has locked herself up in her room he is not the only father in that unwholesome predicament said dr middleton he talks of coming to you willoughby why to me willoughby chastened his irritation he will be welcome of course it would be better that the boy should come if there is a chance of your forgiving him said clara let the dales know i am prepared to listen to the boy vernon there can be no necessity for mr dale to drag himself here how are mr dale and his daughter of a divided mind mr whitford said clara vernon simulated an uneasiness with a vacant gaze that enlarged around willoughby and was more discomforting than intentness he replied perhaps she is unwilling to give him her entire confidence miss middleton in which respect then our situations present their solitary point of unlikeness in resemblance for i have it in excess observed dr middleton clara dropped her eyelids for the wave to pass over it struck me that miss dale was a person of the extremest candour why should we be prying into the domestic affairs of the dales willoughby interjected and drew out his watch merely for a diversion he was on tiptoe to learn whether vernon was as well instructed as clara and hung to the view that he could not be while drenching in the sensation that he wasand if so what were the powers above but a body of conspirators he paid laetitia that compliment he could not conceive the human betrayal of the secret claras discovery of it had set his common sense adrift the domestic affairs of the dales do not concern me said vernon and yet my friend dr middleton balanced himself and with an air of benevolent slyness the import of which did not awaken willoughby until too late remarked they might concern you i will even add that there is a probability of your being not less than the fount and origin of this division of father and daughter though willoughby in the drawingroom last night stands accusably the agent favour me sir with an explanation said vernon seeking to gather it from clara dr middleton threw the explanation upon willoughby clara communicated as much as she was able in one of those looks of still depth which say think and without causing a thought to stir takes us into the pellucid mind vernon was enlightened before willoughby had spoken his mouth shut rigidly and there was a springing increase of the luminous wavering of his eyes some star that clara had watched at night was like them in the vivid wink and overflow of its light yet as he was perfectly sedate none could have suspected his blood to be chasing wild with laughter and his frame strung to the utmost to keep it from volleying so happy was she in his aspect that her chief anxiety was to recover the name of the star whose shining beckons and speaks and is in the quick of spiritfire it is the sole star which on a night of frost and strong moonlight preserves an indomitable fervency that she remembered and the picture of a hoar earth and a lean orion in flooded heavens and the star beneath eastward of him but the name the nameshe heard willoughby indistinctly oh the old story another effort you know my wish a failure of course and no thanks on either side i suppose i must ask your excusethey neither of them see whats good for them sir manifestly however said dr middleton if one may opine from the division we have heard of the father is disposed to back your nominee i cant say as far as i am concerned i made a mess of it vernon withstood the incitement to acquiesce but he sparkled with his recognition of the fact you meant well willoughby i hope so vernon only you have driven her away we must resign ourselves it wont affect me for im off tomorrow you see sir the thanks i get mr whitford said dr middleton you have a tower of strength in the ladys father would you have me bring it to bear upon the lady sir wherefore not to make her marriage a matter of obedience to her father ay my friend a lusty lover would have her gladly on those terms well knowing it to be for the ladys good what do you say willoughby sir say what can i say miss dale has not plighted her faith had she done so she is a lady who would never dishonour it she is an ideal of constancy who would keep to it though it had been broken on the other side said vernon and clara thrilled i take that sir to be a statue of constancy modelled upon which a lady of our flesh may be proclaimed as graduating for the condition of idiocy said dr middleton but faith is faith sir but the broken is the broken sir whether in porcelain or in human engagements and all that one of the two continuing faithful i should rather say regretful can do is to devote the remainder of life to the picking up of the fragments an occupation properly to be pursued for the comfort of mankind within the enclosure of an appointed asylum you destroy the poetry of sentiment dr middleton to invigorate the poetry of nature mr whitford then you maintain sir that when faith is broken by one the engagement ceases and the other is absolutely free i do i am the champion of that platitude and sound that knell to the sentimental world and since you have chosen to defend it i will appeal to willoughby and ask him if he would not side with the world of good sense in applauding the nuptials of man or maid married within a month of a jilting clara slipped her arm under her fathers poetry sir said willoughby i never have been hypocrite enough to pretend to understand or care for dr middleton laughed vernon too seemed to admire his cousin for a reply that rung in claras ears as the dullest ever spoken her arm grew cold on her fathers she began to fear willoughby again he depended entirely on his agility to elude the thrusts that assailed him had he been able to believe in the treachery of the powers above he would at once have seen design in these deadly strokes for his feelings had rarely been more acute than at the present crisis and he would then have led away clara to wrangle it out with her relying on vernons friendliness not to betray him to her father but a wrangle with clara promised no immediate fruits nothing agreeable and the lifelong trust he had reposed in his protecting genii obscured his intelligence to evidence he would otherwise have accepted on the spot on the faith of his delicate susceptibility to the mildest impressions which wounded him clara might have stooped to listen at the door she might have heard sufficient to create a suspicion but vernon was not in the house last night she could not have communicated it to him and he had not seen laetitia who was besides trustworthy an admirable if a foolish and illfated woman preferring to consider vernon a pragmatical moralist played upon by a sententious drone he thought it politic to detach them and vanquish clara while she was in the beaten mood as she had appeared before vernons vexatious arrival im afraid my dear fellow you are rather too dainty and fussy for a very successful wooer he said its beautiful on paper and absurd in life we have a bit of private business to discuss we will go inside sir i think i will soon release you clara pressed her fathers arm more said he five minutes theres a slight delusion to clear sir my dear clara you will see with different eyes papa wishes to work with mr whitford her heart sunk to hear her father say no tis a lost morning i must consent to pay tax of it for giving another young woman to the world i have a daughter you will i hope compensate me mr whitford in the afternoon be not downcast i have observed you meditative of late you will have no clear brain so long as that stuff is on the mind i could venture to propose to do some pleading for you should it be needed for the prompter expedition of the affair vernon briefly thanked him and said willoughby has exerted all his eloquence and you see the result you have lost miss dale and i have not won her he did everything that one man can do for another in so delicate a case even to the repeating of her famous birthday verses to him to flatter the poetess his best efforts were foiled by the ladys indisposition for me behold said dr middleton as willoughby electrified by the mention of the verses took a sharp stride or two you have in him an advocate who will not be rebuffed by one refusal and i can affirm that he is tenacious pertinacious as are few justly so not to believe in a ladys no is the approved method of carrying that fortress built to yield although unquestionably to have a young man pleading in our interests with a lady counts its objections yet willoughby being notoriously engaged may be held to enjoy the privileges of his elders as an engaged man sir he was on a level with his elders in pleading on my behalf with miss dale said vernon willoughby strode and muttered providence had grown mythical in his thoughts if not malicious and it is the peril of this worship that the object will wear such an alternative aspect when it appears no longer subservient are we coming sir he said and was unheeded the rev doctor would not be defrauded of rolling his billow as an honourable gentleman faithful to his own engagement and desirous of establishing his relatives he deserves in my judgement the ladys esteem as well as your cordial thanks nor should a temporary failure dishearten either of you notwithstanding the precipitate retreat of the lady from patterne and her seclusion in her sanctum on the occasion of your recent visit supposing he had succeeded said vernon driving willoughby to frenzy should i have been bound to marry matter for cogitation was offered to dr middleton the proposal was without your sanction entirely you admire the lady respectfully you do not incline to the state an inch of an angle would exaggerate my inclination how long are we to stand and hear this insufferable nonsense you talk cried willoughby but if mr whitford was not consulted dr middleton said and was overborne by willoughbys hurried oblige me siroblige me my good fellow he swept his arm to vernon and gestured a conducting hand to clara here is mrs mountstuart she exclaimed willoughby stared was it an irruption of a friend or a foe he doubted and stood petrified between the double question clara had seen mrs mountstuart and colonel de craye separating and now the great lady sailed along the sward like a royal barge in festival trim she looked friendly but friendly to everybody which was always a frost on willoughby and terribly friendly to clara coming up to her she whispered news indeed wonderful i could not credit his hint of it yesterday are you satisfied pray mrs mountstuart take an opportunity to speak to papa clara whispered in return mrs mountstuart bowed to dr middleton nodded to vernon and swam upon willoughby with is it but is it am i really to believe you have my dear sir willoughby really the confounded gentleman heaved on a bare plank of wreck in mid sea he could oppose only a paralyzed smile to the assault his intuitive discretion taught him to fall back a step while she said so the plummet word of our mysterious deep fathoms and he fell back further saying madam in a tone advising her to speak low she recovered her volubility followed his partial retreat and dropped her voice impossible to have imagined it as an actual fact you were always full of surprises but this this nothing manlier nothing more gentlemanly has ever been done nothing nothing that so completely changes an untenable situation into a comfortable and proper footing for everybody it is what i like it is what i lovesound sense men are so selfish one cannot persuade them to be reasonable in such positions but you sir willoughby have shown wisdom and sentiment the rarest of all combinations in men where have you willoughby contrived to say heard the hedges the housetops everywhere all the neighbourhood will have it before nightfall lady busshe and lady culmer will soon be rushing here and declaring they never expected anything else i do not doubt i am not so pretentious i beg your excuse for that twice of mine yesterday even if it hurt my vanity i should be happy to confess my error i was utterly out but then i did not reckon on a fatal attachment i thought men were incapable of it i thought we women were the only poor creatures persecuted by a fatality it is a fatality you tried hard to escape indeed you did and she will do honour to your final surrender my dear friend she is gentle and very clever very she is devoted to you she will entertain excellently i see her like a flower in sunshine she will expand to a perfect hostess patterne will shine under her reign you have my warrant for that and so will you yes you flourish best when adored it must be adoration you have been under a cloud of late years ago i said it was a match when no one supposed you could stoop lady busshe would have it was a screen and she was deemed high wisdom the world will be with you all the women will be excepting of course lady busshe whose pride is in prophecy and she will soon be too glad to swell the host there my friend your sincerest and oldest admirer congratulates you i could not contain myself i was compelled to pour forth and now i must go and be talked to by dr middleton how does he take it they leave he is perfectly well said willoughby aloud quite distraught she acknowledged his just correction of her for running on to an extreme in lowtoned converse though they stood sufficiently isolated from the others these had by this time been joined by colonel de craye and were all chatting in a groupof himself willoughby horribly suspected clara was gone from him gone but he remembered his oath and vowed it again not to horace de craye she was gone lost sunk into the world of waters of rival men and he determined that his whole force should be used to keep her from that man the false friend who had supplanted him in her shallow heart and might if he succeeded boast of having done it by simply appearing on the scene willoughby intercepted mrs mountstuart as she was passing over to dr middleton my dear lady spare me a minute de craye sauntered up with a face of the friendliest humour never was man like you willoughby for shaking new patterns in a kaleidoscope have you turned punster horace willoughby replied smarting to find yet another in the demon secret and he draw dr middleton two or three steps aside and hurriedly begged him to abstain from prosecuting the subject with clara we must try to make her happy as we best can sir she may have her reasonsa young ladys reasons he laughed and left the rev doctor considering within himself under the arch of his lofty frown of stupefaction de craye smiled slyly and winningly as he shadowed a deep droop on the bend of his head before clara signifying his absolute devotion to her service and this present good fruit for witness of his merits she smiled sweetly though vaguely there was no concealment of their intimacy the battle is over vernon said quietly when willoughby had walked some paces beside mrs mountstuart adding you may expect to see mr dale here he knows vernon and clara exchanged one look hard on his part in contrast with her softness and he proceeded to the house de craye waited for a word or a promising look he was patient being selfassured and passed on clara linked her arm with her fathers once more and said on a sudden brightness sirius papa he repeated it in the profoundest manner sirius and is there he asked a feminine scintilla of sense in that it is the name of the star i was thinking of dear papa it was the star observed by king agamemnon before the sacrifice in aulis you were thinking of that but my love my iphigenia you have not a father who will insist on sacrificing you did i hear him tell you to humour me papa dr middleton humphed verily the dogstar rages in many heads he responded chapter xliv dr middleton the ladies eleanor and isabel and mr dale clara looked up at the flying clouds she travelled with them now and tasted freedom but she prudently forbore to vex her father she held herself in reserve they were summoned by the midday bell few were speakers at the meal few were eaters clara was impelled to join it by her desire to study mrs mountstuarts face willoughby was obliged to preside it was a meal of an assembly of mutes and plates that struck the ear like the wellknown sound of a collection of offerings in church after an impressive exhortation from the pulpit a sally of colonel de crayes met the reception given to a charityboys muffled burst of animal spirits in the silence of the sacred edifice willoughby tried politics with dr middleton whose regular appetite preserved him from uncongenial speculations when the hour for appeasing it had come and he alone did honour to the dishes replying to his host times are bad you say and we have a ministry doing with us what they will well sir and that being so and opposition a manner of kicking them into greater stability it is the time for wise men to retire within themselves with the steady determination of the seed in the earth to grow repose upon nature sleep in firm faith and abide the seasons that is my counsel to the weaker party the counsel was excellent but it killed the topic dr middletons appetite was watched for the signal to rise and breathe freely and such is the grace accorded to a good man of an untroubled conscience engaged in doing his duty to himself that he perceived nothing of the general restlessness he went through the dishes calmly and as calmly he quoted milton to the ladies eleanor and isabel when the company sprung up all at once upon his closing his repast vernon was taken away from him by willoughby mrs mountstuart beckoned covertly to clara willoughby should have had something to say to him dr middleton thought the position was not clear but the situation was not disagreeable and he was in no serious hurry though he wished to be enlightened this dr middleton said to the spinster aunts as he accompanied them to the drawingroom shall be no lost day for me if i may devote the remainder of it to you the thunder we fear is not remote murmured one we fear it is imminent sighed the other they took to chanting in alternation we are accustomed to peruse our willoughby and we know him by a shadow from his infancy to his glorious youth and his established manhood he was ever the soul of chivalry duty duty first the happiness of his family the wellbeing of his dependants if proud of his name it was not an overweening pride it was founded in the conscious possession of exalted qualities he could be humble when occasion called for it dr middleton bowed to the litany feeling that occasion called for humbleness from him let us hope he said with unassumed penitence on behalf of his inscrutable daughter the ladies resumed vernon whitford not of his blood is his brother a thousand instances laetitia dale remembers them better than we that any blow should strike him that another should be in store for him it seems impossible he can be quite misunderstood let us hope said dr middleton one would not deem it too much for the dispenser of goodness to expect to be a little looked up to when he was a child he one day mounted a chair and there he stood in danger would not let us touch him because he was taller than we and we were to gaze do you remember him eleanor i am the sun of the house it was inimitable your feelings he would have your feelings he was fourteen when his cousin grace whitford married and we lost him they had been the greatest friends and it was long before he appeared among us he has never cared to see her since but he has befriended her husband never has he failed in generosity his only fault is his sensitiveness and that is his secret and that you are not to discover it is the same with him in manhood no one will accuse willoughby patterne of a deficiency of manlinesss but what is ithe suffers as none suffer if he is not loved he himself is inalterably constant in affection what it is no one can say we have lived with him all his life and we know him ready to make any sacrifice only he does demand the whole heart in return and if he doubts he looks as we have seen him today shattered as we have never seen him look before we will hope said dr middleton this time hastily he tingled to say what it was he had it in him to solve perplexity in their inquiry he did say adopting familiar speech to suit the theme you know ladies we english come of a rough stock a dose of rough dealing in our youth does us no harm braces us otherwise we are likely to feel chilly we grow too fine where tenuity of stature is necessarily buffetted by gales namely in our selfesteem we are barbarians on a forcing soil of wealth in a conservatory of comfortable security but still barbarians so you see we shine at our best when we are plucked out of that to where hard blows are given in a state of war in a state of war we are at home our men are highminded fellows scipios and good legionaries in the state of peace we do not live in peace our native roughness breaks out in unexpected places under extraordinary aspectstyrannies extravagances domestic exactions and if we have not had sharp early training within and without the oldfashioned islandinstrument to drill into us the civilization of our masters the ancients we show it by running here and there to some excess ahem yet added the rev doctor abandoning his effort to deliver a weighty truth obscurely for the comprehension of dainty spinster ladies the superabundance of whom in england was in his opinion largely the cause of our decay as a people yet i have not observed this ultrasensitiveness in willoughby he has borne to hear more than i certainly no example of the frailty could have endured he concealed it said the ladies it is intense then is it a disease it bears no explanation it is mystic it is a cultus then a form of selfworship self they ejaculated but is not self indifferent to others is it self that craves for sympathy love and devotion he is an admirable host ladies he is admirable in all respects admirable must he be who can impress discerning women his lifelong housemates so favourably he is i repeat a perfect host he will be a perfect husband in all probability it is a certainty let him be loved and obeyed he will be guided that is the secret for her whom he so fatally loves that if we had dared we would have hinted to her she will rule him through her love of him and through him all about her and it will not be a rule he submits to but a love he accepts if she could see it if she were a metaphysician sighed dr middleton but a sensitiveness so keen as his might fretted by an unsympathizing mate in the end become for the best of us is mortal callous he would feel perhaps as much or more he would still be tender but he might grow outwardly hard both ladies looked up at dr middleton as they revealed the dreadful prospect it is the story told of corns he said sad as they the three stood drooping the ladies with an attempt to digest his remark the rev doctor in dejection lest his gallantry should no longer continue to wrestle with his good sense he was rescued the door opened and a footman announced mr dale miss eleanor and miss isabel made a sign to one another of raising their hands they advanced to him and welcomed him pray be seated mr dale you have not brought us bad news of our laetitia so rare is the pleasure of welcoming you here mr dale that we are in some alarm when as we trust it should be matter for unmixed congratulation has doctor corney been doing wonders i am indebted to him for the drive to your house ladies said mr dale a spare closebuttoned gentleman with an indian complexion deadened in the sickchamber it is unusual for me to stir from my precincts the rev dr middleton mr dale bowed he seemed surprised you live in a splendid air sir observed the rev doctor i can profit little by it sir replied mr dale he asked the ladies will sir willoughby be disengaged they consulted he is with vernon we will send to him the bell was rung i have had the gratification of making the acquaintance of your daughter mr dale a most estimable lady said dr middleton mr dale bowed she is honoured by your praises sir to the best of my beliefi speak as a fathershe merits them hitherto i have had no doubts of laetitia exclaimed the ladies and spoke of her as gentleness and goodness incarnate hitherto i have devoutly thought so said mr dale surely she is the very sweetest nurse the most devoted of daughters as far as concerns her duty to her father i can say she is that ladies in all her relations mr dale it is my prayer he said the footman appeared he announced that sir willoughby was in the laboratory with mr whitford and the door locked domestic business the ladies remarked you know willoughbys diligent attention to affairs mr dale he is well mr dale inquired in excellent health body and mind but dear mr dale he is never ill ah for one to hear that who is never well and mr whitford is quite sound sound the question alarms me for myself said dr middleton sound as our constitution the credit of the country the reputation of our prince of poets i pray you to have no fears for him mr dale gave the mild little sniff of a man thrown deeper into perplexity he said mr whitford works his head he is a hard student he may not be always if i may so put it at home on worldly affairs dismiss that defamatory legend of the student mr dale and take my word for it that he who persistently works his head has the strongest for all affairs ah your daughter sir is here my daughter is here sir and will be most happy to present her respects to the father of her friend miss dale they are friends very cordial friends mr dale administered another feebly pacifying sniff to himself laetitia he sighed in apostrophe and swept his forehead with a hand seen to shake the ladies asked him anxiously whether he felt the heat of the room and one offered him a smellingbottle he thanked them i can hold out until sir willoughby comes we fear to disturb him when his door is locked mr dale but if you wish it we will venture on a message you have really no bad news of our laetitia she left us hurriedly this morning without any leavetaking except a word to one of the maids that your condition required her immediate presence my condition and now her door is locked to me we have spoken through the door and that is all i stand sick and stupefied between two locked doors neither of which will open it appears to give me the enlightenment i need more than medicine dear me cried dr middleton i am struck by your description of your position mr dale it would aptly apply to our humanity of the present generation and were these the days when i sermonized i could propose that it should afford me an illustration for the pulpit for my part when doors are closed i try not their locks and i attribute my perfect equanimity health even to an uninquiring acceptation of the fact that they are closed to me i read my page by the light i have on the contrary the world of this day if i may presume to quote you for my purpose is heard knocking at those two locked doors of the secret of things on each side of us and is beheld standing sick and stupefied because it has got no response to its knocking why sir let the world compare the diverse fortunes of the beggar and the postman knock to give and it is opened unto you knock to crave and it continues shut i say carry a letter to your locked door and you shall have a good reception but there is none that is handed out for which reason mr dale swept a perspiring forehead and extended his hand in supplication i am an invalid dr middleton he said i am unable to cope with analogies i have but strength for the slow digestion of facts for facts we are bradypeptics to a man sir we know not yet if nature be a fact or an effort to master one the world has not yet assimilated the first fact it stepped on we are still in the endeavour to make good blood of the fact of our being pressing his hands at his temples mr dale moaned my head twirls i did unwisely to come out i came on an impulse i trust honourable i am unfiti cannot follow you dr middleton pardon me nay sir let me say from my experience of my countrymen that if you do not follow me and can abstain from abusing me in consequence you are magnanimous the rev doctor replied hardly consenting to let go the man he had found to indemnify him for his gallant service of acquiescing as a mute to the ladies though he knew his breathing robustfulness to be as an east wind to weak nerves and himself an engine of punishment when he had been torn for a day from his books miss eleanor said the enlightenment you need mr dale can we enlighten you i think not he answered faintly i think i will wait for sir willoughby or mr whitford if i can keep my strength or could i exchangei fear to break downtwo words with the young lady who is was miss middleton my daughter sir she shall be at your disposition i will bring her to you dr middleton stopped at the window she it is true may better know the mind of miss dale than i but i flatter myself i know the gentleman better i think mr dale addressing you as the ladys father you will find me a persuasive i could be an impassioned advocate in his interests mr dale was confounded the weakly sapling caught in a gust falls back as he did advocate he said he had little breath his impassioned advocate i repeat for i have the highest opinion of him you see sir i am acquainted with the circumstances i believe dr middleton half turned to the ladies we must until your potent inducements mr dale have been joined to my instances and we overcome what feminine scruples there may be treat the circumstances as not generally public our strephon may be chargeable with shyness but if for the present it is incumbent on us in proper consideration for the parties not to be nominally precise it is hardly requisite in this household that we should be he is now for protesting indifference to the state i fancy we understand that phase of amatory frigidity frankly mr dale i was once in my life myself refused by a lady and i was not indignant merely indifferent to the marriagetie my daughter has refused him sir temporarily it would appear that she has declined the proposal he was at liberty he could honourably his best friend and nearest relative is your guarantee i know it i hear so i am informed of that i have heard of the proposal and that he could honourably make it still i am helpless i cannot move until i am assured that my daughters reasons are such as a father need not underline does the lady perchance equivocate i have not seen her this morning i rise late i hear an astounding account of the cause for her departure from patterne and i find her door locked to meno answer it is that she had no reasons to give and she feared the demand for them ladies dolorously exclaimed mr dale we guess the secret we guess it they exclaimed in reply and they looked smilingly as dr middleton looked she had no reasons to give mr dale spelled these words to his understanding then sir she knew you not adverse undoubtedly by my high esteem for the gentleman she must have known me not adverse but she would not consider me a principal she could hardly have conceived me an obstacle i am simply the gentlemans friend a zealous friend let me add mr dale put out an imploring hand it was too much for him pardon me i have a poor head and your daughter the same sir we will not measure it too closely but i may say my daughter the same sir and likewisemay i not addthese ladies mr dale made sign that he was overfilled where am i and laetitia refused him temporarily let us assume will it not partly depend on you mr dale but what strange things have been happening during my daughters absence from the cottage cried mr dale betraying an elixir in his veins i feel that i could laugh if i did not dread to be thought insane she refused his hand and he was at liberty to offer it my girl we are all on our heads the fairytales were right and the lessonbooks were wrong but it is really it is really very demoralizing an invalidand i am one and no momentary exhilaration will be taken for the contraryclings to the idea of stability order the slightest disturbance of the wonted course of things unsettles him why for years i have been prophesying it and for years i have had everything against me and now when it is confirmed i am wondering that i must not call myself a fool and for years dear mr dale this union in spite of countercurrents and human arrangements has been our willoughbys constant preoccupation said miss eleanor his most cherished aim said miss isabel the name was not spoken by me said dr middleton but it is out and perhaps better out if we would avoid the chance of mystifications i do not suppose we are seriously committing a breach of confidence though he might have wished to mention it to you first himself i have it from willoughby that last night he appealed to your daughter mr dalenot for the first time if i apprehend him correctly and unsuccessfully he despairs i do not supposing that is your assistance vouchsafed to us and i do not despair because the gentleman is a gentleman of worth of acknowledged worth you know him well enough to grant me that i will bring you my daughter to help me in sounding his praises dr middleton stepped through the window to the lawn on an elastic foot beaming with the happiness he felt charged to confer on his friend mr whitford ladies it passes all wonders mr dale gasped willoughbys generosity does pass all wonders they said in chorus the door opened lady busshe and lady culmer were announced chapter xlv the patterne ladies mr dale lady busshe and lady culmer with mrs mountstuart jenkinson lady busshe and lady culmer entered spying to right and left at the sight of mr dale in the room lady busshe murmured to her friend confirmation lady culmer murmured corney is quite reliable the man is his own best tonic he is invaluable for the country miss eleanor and miss isabel greeted them the amiability of the patterne ladies combined with their total eclipse behind their illustrious nephew invited enterprising women of the world to take liberties and they were not backward lady busshe said well the news we have the outlines dont be astonished we know the points we have heard the gun i could have told you as much yesterday i saw it and i guessed it the day before oh i do believe in fatalities now lady culmer and i agree to take that view it is the simplest well and are you satisfied my dears the ladies grimaced interrogatively with what with it with all with her with him our willoughby can it be possible that they require a dose of corney lady busshe remarked to lady culmer they play discretion to perfection said lady culmer but my dears we are in the secret how did she behave whispered lady busshe no high flights and flutters i do hope she was wellconnected they say though i dont comprehend what they mean by a line of scholarsone thinks of a row of pinafores and she was pretty that is well enough at the start it never will stand against brains he had the two in the house to contrast them and the result a young woman with brainsin a housebeats all your beauties lady culmer and i have determined on that view he thought her a delightful partner for a dance and found her rather tiresome at the end of the gallopade i saw it yesterday clear as daylight she did not understand him and he did understand her that will be our report she is young she will learn said the ladies uneasily but in total ignorance of her meaning and you are charitable and always were i remember you had a good word for that girl durham lady busshe crossed the room to mr dale who was turning over leaves of a grand book of the heraldic devices of our great families study it she said study it my dear mr dale you are in it by right of possessing a clever and accomplished daughter at page you will find the patterne crest and mark me she will drag you into the peerage before she has donerelatively you know sir willoughby and wife will not be contented to sit down and manage the estates has not laetitia immense ambition and very creditable i say mr dale tried to protest something he shut the book examining the binding flapped the cover with a finger hoped her ladyship was in good health alluded to his own and the strangeness of the bird out of the cage you will probably take up your residence here in a larger and handsomer cage mr dale he shook his head do i apprehend he said i know said she dear me can it be mr dale gazed upward with the feelings of one awakened late to see a world alive in broad daylight lady busshe dropped her voice she took the liberty permitted to her with an inferior in station while treating him to a tone of familiarity in acknowledgment of his expected rise which is high breeding or the exact measurement of social dues laetitia will be happy you may be sure i love to see a long and faithful attachment rewardedlove it her tale is the triumph of patience far above grizzel no woman will be ashamed of pointing to lady patterne you are uncertain you are in doubt let me hearas low as you like but there is no doubt of the new shifting of the sceneno doubt of the proposal dear mr dale a very little louder you are here because of course you wish to see sir willoughby she i did not catch you quite she it seems you say lady culmer said to the patterne ladies you must have had a distressing time these affairs always mount up to a climax unless people are very well bred we saw it coming naturally we did not expect such a transformation of brides who could if i had laid myself down on my back to think i should have had it i am unerring when i set to speculating on my back one is cooler ideas come they have not to be forced that is why i am brighter on a dull winter afternoon on the sofa beside my teaservice than at any other season however your trouble is over when did the middletons leave the middletons leave said the ladies dr middleton and his daughter they have not left us the middletons are here they are here yes why should they have left patterne why yes they are likely to stay some days longer goodness there is no ground for any report to the contrary lady culmer no ground lady culmer called out to lady busshe a cry came back from that startled dame she has refused him who she has shesir willoughby refuseddeclines the honour oh never no that carries the incredible beyond romance but is he perfectly at quite it seems and she was asked in due form and refused no and no again my dear i have it from mr dale mr dale what can be the signification of her conduct indeed lady culmer said mr dale not unpleasantly agitated by the interest he excited in spite of his astonishment at a public discussion of the matter in this house i am in the dark her father should know but i do not her door is locked to me i have not seen her i am absolutely in the dark i am a recluse i have forgotten the ways of the world i should have supposed her father would first have been addressed tuttut modern gentlemen are not so formal they are creatures of impulse and take a pride in it he spoke we settle that but where did you get this tale of a refusal i have it from dr middleton from dr middleton shouted lady busshe the middletons are here said lady culmer what whirl are we in lady busshe got up ran two or three steps and seated herself in another chair oh do let us proceed upon system if not we shall presently be rageing we shall be dangerous the middletons are here and dr middleton himself communicates to mr dale that laetitia dale has refused the hand of sir willoughby who is ostensibly engaged to his own daughter and pray mr dale how did dr middleton speak of it compose yourself there is no violent hurry though our sympathy with you and our interest in all the parties does perhaps agitate us a little quite at your leisurespeak madam lady busshe mr dale gulped a ball in his throat i see no reason why i should not speak i do not see how i can have been deluded the miss patternes heard him dr middleton began upon it not i i was unaware when i came that it was a refusal i had been informed that there was a proposal my authority for the tale was positive the object of my visit was to assure myself of the integrity of my daughters conduct she had always the highest sense of honour but passion is known to mislead and there was this most strange report i feared that our humblest apologies were due to dr middleton and his daughter i know the charm laetitia can exercise madam in the plainest language without a possibility of my misapprehending him dr middleton spoke of himself as the advocate of the suitor for my daughters hand i have a poor head i supposed at once an amicable rupture between sir willoughby and miss middleton or that the version which had reached me of their engagement was not strictly accurate my head is weak dr middletons language is trying to a head like mine but i can speak positively on the essential points he spoke of himself as ready to be the impassioned advocate of the suitor for my daughters hand those were his words i understood him to entreat me to intercede with her nay the name was mentioned there was no concealment i am certain there could not be a misapprehension and my feelings were touched by his anxiety for sir willoughbys happiness i attributed it to a sentiment upon which i need not dwell impassioned advocate he said we are in a perfect maelstrom cried lady busshe turning to everybody it is a complete hurricane cried lady culmer a light broke over the faces of the patterne ladies they exchanged it with one another they had been so shocked as to be almost offended by lady busshe but their natural gentleness and habitual submission rendered them unequal to the task of checking her is it not said miss eleanor a misunderstanding that a change of names will rectify this is by no means the first occasion said miss isabel that willoughby has pleaded for his cousin vernon we deplore extremely the painful error into which mr dale has fallen it springs we now perceive from an entire misapprehension of dr middleton vernon was in his mind it was clear to us impossible that it could have been willoughby you see the impossibility the error and the middletons here said lady busshe oh if we leave unilluminated we shall be the laughingstock of the county mr dale please wake up do you see you may have been mistaken lady busshe he woke up i may have mistaken dr middleton he has a language that i can compare only to a reviewday of the field forces but i have the story on authority that i cannot question it is confirmed by my daughters unexampled behaviour and if i live through this day i shall look about me as a ghost tomorrow dear mr dale said the patterne ladies compassionately lady busshe murmured to them you know the two did not agree they did not get on i saw it i predicted it she will understand him in time said they never and my belief is they have parted by consent and letty dale wins the day at last yes now i do believe it the ladies maintained a decided negative but they knew too much not to feel perplexed and they betrayed it though they said dear lady busshe is it credible in decency dear mrs mountstuart lady busshe invoked her great rival appearing among them you come most opportunely we are in a state of inextricable confusion we are bordering on frenzy you and none but you can help us you know you always know we hang on you is there any truth in it a particle mrs mountstuart seated herself regally ah mr dale she said inclining to him yes dear lady busshe there is a particle now do not roast us you can you have the art i have the whole story that is i have a part i mean i have the outlines i cannot be deceived but you can fill them in i know you can i saw it yesterday now tell us tell us it must be quite true or utterly false which is it be precise his fatality you called her yes i was sceptical but here we have it all come round again and if the tale is true i shall own you infallible has heand she both and the middletons here they have not gone they keep the field and more astounding she refuses him and to add to it dr middleton intercedes with mr dale for sir willoughby dr middleton intercedes this was rather astonishing to mrs mountstuart for vernon miss eleanor emphasized for vernon whitford his cousin said miss isabel still more emphatically who said mrs mountstuart with a sovereign lift and turn of her head speaks of a refusal i have it from mr dale said lady busshe i had it i thought distinctly from dr middleton said mr dale that willoughby proposed to laetitia for his cousin vernon doctor middleton meant said miss eleanor her sister followed hence this really ridiculous misconceptionsad indeed she added for balm to mr dale willoughby was vernons proxy his cousin if not his first is ever the second thought with him but can we continue such a discussion mrs mountstuart gave them a judicial hearing they were regarded in the county as the most indulgent of nonentities and she as little as lady busshe was restrained from the burning topic in their presence she pronounced each party is right and each is wrong a dry i shall shriek came from lady busshe cruel groaned lady culmer mixed you are all wrong disentangled you are each of you right sir willoughby does think of his cousin vernon he is anxious to establish him he is the author of a proposal to that effect we know it the patterne ladies exclaimed and laetitia rejected poor vernon once more who spoke of miss dales rejection of mr whitford is he not rejected lady culmer inquired it is in debate and at this moment being decided oh do he seated mr dale lady busshe implored him rising to thrust him back to his chair if necessary any dislocation and we are thrown out again we must hold together if this riddle is ever to be read then dear mrs mountstuart we are to say that there isno truth in the other story you are to say nothing of the sort dear lady busshe be merciful and what of the fatality as positive as the pole to the needle she has not refused him ask your own sagacity accepted wait and all the worlds ahead of me now mrs mountstuart you are oracle riddles if you like only speak if we cant have corn why give us husks is any one of us able to anticipate events lady busshe yes i believe that you are i bow to you i do sincerely so its another person for mr whitford you nod and it is our laetitia for sir willoughby you smile you would not deceive me a very little and i run about crazed and howl at your doors and dr middleton is made to play blind man in the midst and the other person isnow i see day an amicable rupture and a smooth new arrangement she has money she was never the match for our hero never i saw it yesterday and before often and so he hands her overtutherumtumtum tutherumtumtum lady busshe struck a quick march on her knee now isnt that clever guessing the shadow of a clue for me and because i know human nature one peep and i see the combination in a minute so he keeps the money in the family becomes a benefactor to his cousin by getting rid of the girl and succumbs to his fatality rather a pity he let it ebb and flow so long time counts the tides you know but it improves the story i defy any other county in the kingdom to produce one fresh and living to equal it let me tell you i suspected mr whitford and i hinted it yesterday did you indeed said mrs mountstuart humouring her excessive acuteness i really did there is that dear good man on his feet again and looks agitated again mr dale had been compelled both by the ladys voice and his interest in the subject to listen he had listened more than enough he was exceedingly nervous he held on by his chair afraid to quit his moorings and manners he said to himself unconsciously aloud as he cogitated on the libertine way with which these chartered great ladies of the district discussed his daughter he was heard and unnoticed the supposition if any would have been that he was admonishing himself at this juncture sir willoughby entered the drawingroom by the garden window and simultaneously dr middleton by the door chapter xlvi the scene of sir willoughbys generalship history we may fear will never know the qualities of leadership inherent in sir willoughby patterne to fit him for the post of commander of an army seeing that he avoided the fatigues of the service and preferred the honours bestowed in his country upon the quiet administrators of their own estates but his possession of particular gifts which are military and especially of the proleptic mind which is the stamp and signwarrant of the heavensent general was displayed on every urgent occasion when in the midst of difficulties likely to have extinguished one less alert than he to the threatening aspect of disaster he had to manoeuvre himself he had received no intimation of mr dales presence in his house nor of the arrival of the dreaded women lady busshe and lady culmer his locked door was too great a terror to his domestics having finished with vernon after a tedious endeavour to bring the fellow to a sense of the policy of the step urged on him he walked out on the lawn with the desire to behold the opening of an interview not promising to lead to much and possibly to profit by its failure clara had been prepared according to his directions by mrs mountstuart jenkinson as vernon had been prepared by him his wishes candidly and kindly expressed both to vernon and mrs mountstuart were that since the girl appeared disinclined to make him a happy man she would make one of his cousin intimating to mrs mountstuart that he would be happier without her he alluded to the benefit of the girls money to poor old vernon the general escape from a scandal if old vernon could manage to catch her as she dropped the harmonious arrangement it would be for all parties and only on the condition of her taking vernon would he consent to give her up this he said imperatively adding that such was the meaning of the news she had received relating to laetitia dale from what quarter had she received it he asked she shuffled in her reply made a gesture to signify that it was in the air universal and fell upon the proposed arrangement he would listen to none of mrs mountstuarts womanoftheworld instances of the folly of pressing it upon a girl who had shown herself a girl of spirit she foretold the failure he would not be advised he said it is my scheme and perhaps the look of mad benevolence about it induced the lady to try whether there was a chance that it would hit the madness in our nature and somehow succeed or lead to a pacification sir willoughby condescended to arrange things thus for claras good he would then proceed to realize his own such was the face he put upon it we can wear what appearance we please before the world until we are found out nor is the worlds praise knocking upon hollowness always hollow music but mrs mountstuarts laudation of his kindness and simplicity disturbed him for though he had recovered from his rebuff enough to imagine that laetitia could not refuse him under reiterated pressure he had let it be supposed that she was a submissive handmaiden throbbing for her elevation and mrs mountstuarts belief in it afflicted his recent bitter experience his footing was not perfectly secure besides assuming it to be so he considered the sort of prize he had won and a spasm of downright hatred of a world for which we make mighty sacrifices to be repaid in a worn thin comparatively valueless coin troubled his counting of his gains laetitia it was true had not passed through other hands in coming to him as vernon would know it to be claras case time only had worn her but the comfort of the reflection was annoyed by the physical contrast of the two hence an unusual melancholy in his tone that mrs mountstuart thought touching it had the scenic effect on her which greatly contributes to delude the wits she talked of him to clara as being a man who had revealed an unsuspected depth vernon took the communication curiously he seemed readier to be in love with his benevolent relative than with the lady he was confused undisguisedly moved said the plan was impossible out of the question but thanked willoughby for the best of intentions thanked him warmly after saying that the plan was impossible the comical fellow allowed himself to be pushed forth on the lawn to see how miss middleton might have come out of her interview with mrs mountstuart willoughby observed mrs mountstuart meet him usher him to the place she had quitted among the shrubs and return to the open turfspaces he sprang to her she will listen mrs mountstuart said she likes him respects him thinks he is a very sincere friend clever a scholar and a good mountaineer and thinks you mean very kindly so much i have impressed on her but i have not done much for mr whitford she consents to listen said willoughby snatching at that as the deathblow to his friend horace she consents to listen because you have arranged it so that if she declined she would be rather a savage you think it will have no result none at all her listening will do and you must be satisfied with it we shall see anything for peace she says and i dont say that a gentleman with a tongue would not have a chance she wishes to please you old vernon has no tongue for women poor fellow you will have us be spider or fly and if a man cant spin a web all he can hope is not to be caught in one she knows his history too and that wont be in his favour how did she look when you left them not so bright like a bit of china that wants dusting she looked a trifle gauche it struck me more like a country girl with the hoyden taming in her than the wellbred creature she is i did not suspect her to have feeling you must remember sir willoughby that she has obeyed your wishes done her utmost i do think we may say she has made some amends and if she is to blame she repents and you will not insist too far i do insist said he beneficent but a tyrant well well he did not dislike the character they perceived dr middleton wandering over the lawn and willoughby went to him to put him on the wrong track mrs mountstuart swept into the drawingroom willoughby quitted the rev doctor and hung about the bower where he supposed his pair of dupes had by this time ceased to stutter mutuallyor what if they had found the word of harmony he could bear that just bear it he rounded the shrubs and behold both had vanished the trellis decorated emptiness his idea was that they had soon discovered their inability to be turtles and desiring not to lose a moment while clara was fretted by the scene he rushed to the drawingroom with the hope of lighting on her there getting her to himself and finally urgently passionately offering her the sole alternative of what she had immediately rejected why had he not used passion before instead of limping crippled between temper and policy he was capable of it as soon as imagination in him conceived his personal feelings unwounded and unimperiled the might of it inspired him with heroical confidence and clara grateful clara softly moved led him to think of clara melted thus anticipating her he burst into the room one step there warned him that he was in the jaws of the world we have the phrase that a man is himself under certain trying circumstances there is no need to say it of sir willoughby he was thrice himself when danger menaced himself inspired him he could read at a single glance the polyphemus eye in the general head of a company lady busshe lady culmer mrs mountstuart mr dale had a similarity in the variety of their expressions that made up one giant eye for him perfectly if awfully legible he discerned the fact that his demon secret was abroad universal he ascribed it to fate he was in the jaws of the world on the worlds teeth this time he thought laetitia must have betrayed him and bowing to lady busshe and lady culmer gallantly pressing their fingers and responding to their becks and archnesses he ruminated on his defences before he should accost her father he did not want to be alone with the man and he considered how his presence might be made useful i am glad to see you mr dale pray be seated is it nature asserting her strength or the efficacy of medicine i fancy it cant be both you have brought us back your daughter mr dale sank into a chair unable to resist the hand forcing him no sir willoughby no i have not i have not seen her since she came home this morning from patterne indeed she is unwell i cannot say she secludes herself has locked herself in said lady busshe willoughby threw her a smile it made them intimate this was an advantage against the world but an exposure of himself to the abominable woman dr middleton came up to mr dale to apologize for not presenting his daughter clara whom he could find neither in nor out of the house we have in mr dale as i suspected he said to willoughby a stout ally if i may beg two minutes with you sir willoughby said mr dale your visits are too rare for me to allow of your numbering the minutes willoughby replied we cannot let mr dale escape us now that we have him i think dr middleton not without ransom said the rev doctor mr dale shook his head my strength sir willoughby will not sustain me long you are at home mr dale not far from home in truth but too far for an invalid beginning to grow sensible of weakness you will regard patterne as your home mr dale willoughby repeated for the world to hear unconditionally dr middleton inquired with a humourous air of dissenting willoughby gave him a look that was coldly courteous and then he looked at lady busshe she nodded imperceptibly her eyebrows rose and willoughby returned a similar nod translated the signs ran thus pestered by the rev gentlemani see you are is the story i have heard correctpossibly it may err in a few details this was fettering himself in loose manacles but lady busshe would not be satisfied with the compliment of the intimate looks and nods she thought she might still be behind mrs mountstuart and she was a bold woman and anxious about him halfcrazed by the riddle of the pot she was boiling in and having very few minutes to spare not extremely reticent by nature privileged by station and made intimate with him by his covert looks she stood up to him one word to an old friend which is the father of the fortunate creature i dont know how to behave to them no time was afforded him to be disgusted with her vulgarity and audacity he replied feeling her rivet his gyves the house will be empty tomorrow i see a decent withdrawal and very well cloaked we had a tale here of her running off to decline the honour afraid or on her dignity or something how was it that the woman was ready to accept the altered posture of affairs in his houseif she had received a hint of them he forgot that he had prepared her in selfdefence from whom did you have that he asked her father and the lady aunts declare it was the cousin she refused willoughbys brain turned over he righted it for action and crossed the room to the ladies eleanor and isabel his ears tingled he and his whole story discussed in public himself unroofed and the marvel that he of all men should be in such a tangle naked and blown on condemned to use his cunningest arts to unwind and cover himself struck him as though the lord of his kind were running the gauntlet of a legion of imps he felt their lashes the ladies were talking to mrs mountstuart and lady culmer of vernon and the suitableness of laetitia to a scholar he made sign to them and both rose it is the hour for your drive to the cottage mr dale is in she must come her sick father no delay going or returning bring her here at once poor man they sighed and willoughby said one and the other said there is a strange misconception you will do well to correct they were about to murmur what it was he swept his hand round and excusing themselves to their guests obediently they retired lady busshe at his entreaty remained and took a seat beside lady culmer and mrs mountstuart she said to the latter you have tried scholars what do you think excellent but hard to mix was the reply i never make experiments said lady culmer some one must mrs mountstuart groaned over her dull dinnerparty lady busshe consoled her at any rate the loss of a scholar is no loss to the county they are well enough in towns lady culmer said and then i am sure you must have them by themselves we have nothing to regret my opinion the voice of dr middleton in colloquy with mr dale swelled on a melodious thunder for whom else should i plead as the passionate advocate i proclaimed myself to you sir there is but one man known to me who would move me to back him upon such an adventure willoughby join me i am informing mr dale willoughby stretched his hands out to mr dale to support him on his legs though he had shown no sign of a wish to rise you are feeling unwell mr dale do i look very ill sir willoughby it will pass laetitia will be with us in twenty minutes mr dale struck his hands in a clasp he looked alarmingly ill and satisfactorily revealed to his host how he could be made to look so i was informing mr dale that the petitioner enjoys our concurrent good wishes and mine in no degree less than yours willoughby observed dr middleton whose billows grew the bigger for a check he supposed himself speaking confidentially ladies have the trick they have i may say the natural disposition for playing enigma now and again pressure is often a sovereign specific let it be tried upon her all round from every radiating line of the circle you she refuses then i venture to propose myself to appeal to her my daughter has assuredly an esteem for the applicant that will animate a womans tongue in such a case the ladies of the house will not be backward lastly if necessary we trust the ladys father to add his instances my prescription is to fatigue her negatives and where no rooted objection exists i maintain it to be the unfailing receipt for the conduct of the siege no woman can say no forever the defence has not such resources against even a single assailant and we shall have solved the problem of continuous motion before she will have learned to deny in perpetuity that i stand on willoughby glanced at mrs mountstuart what is that she said treason to our sex dr middleton i think i heard that no woman can say no forever remarked lady busshe to a loyal gentleman maam assuming the field of the recurring request to be not unholy ground consecrated to affirmatives rather dr middleton was attacked by three angry bees they made him say yes and no alternately so many times that he had to admit in men a shiftier yieldingness than women were charged with willoughby gesticulated as mute chorus on the side of the ladies and a little show of party spirit like that coming upon their excitement under the topic inclined them to him genially he drew mr dale away while the conflict subsided in sharp snaps of rifles and an interval rejoinder of a cannon mr dale had shown by signs that he was growing fretfully restive under his burden of doubt sir willoughby i have a question i beg you to lead me where i may ask it i know my head is weak mr dale it is answered when i say that my house is your home and that laetitia will soon be with us then this report is true i know nothing of reports you are answered can my daughter be accused of any shadow of falseness dishonourable dealing as little as i mr dale scanned his face he saw no shadow for i should go to my grave bankrupt if that could be said of her and i have never yet felt poor though you know the extent of a pensioners income then this tale of a refusal is nonsense she has accepted there are situations mr dale too delicate to be clothed in positive definitions ah sir willoughby but it becomes a father to see that his daughter is not forced into delicate situations i hope all is well i am confused it may be my head she puzzles me you are not can i ask it here you are quite will you moderate my anxiety my infirmities must excuse me sir willoughby conveyed by a shake of the head and a pressure of mr dales hand that he was not and that he was quite dr middleton said mr dale he leaves us tomorrow really the invalid wore a look as if wine had been poured into him he routed his hosts calculations by calling to the rev doctor we are to lose you sir willoughby attempted an interposition but dr middleton crashed through it like the lordly organ swallowing a flute not before i score my victory mr dale and establish my friend upon his rightful throne you do not leave tomorrow sir have you heard sir that i leave tomorrow mr dale turned to sir willoughby the latter said clara named today tomorrow i thought preferable ah dr middleton towered on the swelling exclamation but with no dark light he radiated splendidly yes then tomorrow that is if we subdue the lady he advanced to willoughby seized his hand squeezed it thanked him praised him he spoke under his breath for a wonder but we are in your debt lastingly my friend was heard and he was impressive he seemed subdued and saying aloud though i should wish to aid in the reduction of that fortress he let it be seen that his mind was rid of a load dr middleton partly stupefied willoughby by his way of taking it but his conduct was too serviceable to allow of speculation on his readiness to break the match it was the turningpoint of the engagement lady busshe made a stir i cannot keep my horses waiting any longer she said and beckoned sir willoughby was beside her immediately you are admirable perfect dont ask me to hold my tongue i retract i recant it is a fatality i have resolved upon that view you could stand the shot of beauty not of brains that is our report there and its delicious to feel that the county wins you no tea i cannot possibly wait and oh here she is i must have a look at her my dear laetitia dale willoughby hurried to mr dale you are not to be excited sir compose yourself you will recover and be strong tomorrow you are at home you are in your own house you are in laetitias drawingroom all will be clear tomorrow till tomorrow we talk riddles by consent sit i beg you stay with us he met laetitia and rescued her from lady busshe murmuring with the air of a lover who says my love my sweet that she had done rightly to come and come at once her father had been thrown into the proper condition of clammy nervousness to create the impression laetitias anxiety sat prettily on her long eyelashes as she bent over him in his chair hereupon dr corney appeared and his name had a bracing effect on mr dale corney has come to drive me to the cottage he said i am ashamed of this public exhibition of myself my dear let us go my head is a poor one dr corney had been intercepted he broke from sir willoughby with a dozen little nods of accurate understanding of him even to beyond the mark of the communications he touched his patients pulse lightly briefly sighed with professional composure and pronounced rest must not be moved no no nothing serious he quieted laetitias fears but rest rest a change of residence for a night will tone him i will bring him a draught in the course of the evening yes yes ill fetch everything wanted from the cottage for you and for him repose on corneys forethought you are sure dr corney said laetitia frightened on her fathers account and on her own which aspect will be the best for mr dales bedroom the hospitable ladies eleanor and isabel inquired southeast decidedly let him have the morning sun a warm air a vigorous air and a bright air and the patient wakes and sings in his bed still doubtful whether she was in a trap laetitia whispered to her father of the privacy and comforts of his home he replied to her that he thought he would rather be in his own home dr corney positively pronounced no to it laetitia breathed again of home but with the sigh of one overborne the ladies eleanor and isabel took the word from willoughby and said but you are at home my dear this is your home your father will be at least as well attended here as at the cottage she raised her eyelids on them mournfully and by chance diverted her look to dr middleton quite by chance it spoke eloquently to the assembly of all that willoughby desired to be imagined but there is crossjay she cried my cousin has gone and the boy is left alone i cannot have him left alone if we if dr corney you are sure it is unsafe for papa to be moved today crossjay must he cannot be left bring him with you corney said sir willoughby and the little doctor heartily promised that he would in the event of his finding crossjay at the cottage which he thought a distant probability he gave me his word he would not go out till my return said laetitia and if crossjay gave you his word the accents of a new voice vibrated close by be certain that he will not come back with dr corney unless he has authority in your handwriting clara middleton stepped gently to laetitia and with a manner that was an embrace as much as kissed her for what she was doing on behalf of crossjay she put her lips in a pouting form to simulate saying press it he is to come said laetitia then write him his permit there was a chatter about crossjay and the sentinel true to his post that he could be during which laetitia distressfully scribbled a line for dr corney to deliver to him clara stood near she had rebuked herself for want of reserve in the presence of lady busshe and lady culmer and she was guilty of a slightly excessive containment when she next addressed laetitia it was like laetitias look at dr middleton opportune enough to make a man who watched as willoughby did a fatalist for life the shadow of a difference in her bearing toward laetitia sufficed to impute acting either to her present coolness or her previous warmth better still when dr middleton said so we leave tomorrow my dear and i hope you have written to the darletons clara flushed and beamed and repressed her animation on a sudden with one grave look that might be thought regretful to where willoughby stood chance works for us when we are good captains willoughbys pride was high though he knew himself to be keeping it up like a fearfully dexterous juggler and for an empty reward but he was in the toils of the world have you written the postbag leaves in half an hour he addressed her we are expected but i will write she replied and her not having yet written counted in his favour she went to write the letter dr corney had departed on his mission to fetch crossjay and medicine lady busshe was impatient to be gone corney she said to lady culmer is a deadly gossip inveterate was the answer my poor horses not the young pair of bays luckily they are my dear and dont let me hear of dining tonight sir willoughby was leading out mr dale to a quiet room contiguous to the invalid gentlemans bedchamber he resigned him to laetitia in the hall that he might have the pleasure of conducting the ladies to their carriage as little agitation as possible corney will soon be back he said bitterly admiring the graceful subservience of laetitias figure to her fathers weight on her arm he had won a desperate battle but what had he won what had the world given him in return for his efforts to gain it just a shirt it might be said simple scanty clothing no warmth lady busshe was unbearable she gabbled she was illbred permitted herself to speak of dr middleton as ineligible no loss to the county and mrs mountstuart was hardly much above her with her inevitable stroke of caricatureyou see doctor middletons pulpit scampering after him with legs perhaps the rev doctor did punish the world for his having forsaken his pulpit and might be conceived as haunted by it at his heels but willoughby was in the mood to abhor comic images he hated the perpetrators of them and the grinners contempt of this laughing empty world for which he had performed a monstrous immolation led him to associate dr middleton in his mind and clara too with the desireable things he had sacrificeda shape of youth and health a sparkling companion a face of innumerable charms and his own veracity his inner sense of his dignity and his temper and the limpid frankness of his air of scorn that was to him a visage of candid happiness in the dim retrospect haply also he had sacrificed more he looked scientifically into the future he might have sacrificed a nameless more and for what he asked again for the favourable looks and tongues of these women whose looks and tongues he detested dr middleton says he is indebted to me i am deeply in his debt he remarked it is we who are in your debt for a lovely romance my dear sir willoughby said lady busshe incapable of taking a correction so thoroughly had he imbued her with his fiction or with the belief that she had a good story to circulate away she drove rattling her tongue to lady culmer a hat and horn and she would be in the old figure of a postboy on a hueandcry sheet said mrs mountstuart willoughby thanked the great lady for her services and she complimented the polished gentleman on his noble selfpossession but she complained at the same time of being defrauded of her charmer colonel de craye since luncheon an absence of warmth in her compliment caused willoughby to shrink and think the wretched shirt he had got from the world no covering after all a breath flapped it he comes to me tomorrow i believe she said reflecting on her superior knowledge of facts in comparison with lady busshe who would presently be hearing of something novel and exclaiming so that is why you patronized the colonel and it was nothing of the sort for mrs mountstuart could honestly say she was not the woman to make a business of her pleasure horace is an enviable fellow said willoughby wise in the book which bids us ever for an assuagement to fancy our friends condition worse than our own and recommends the deglutition of irony as the most balsamic for wounds in the whole moral pharmacopoeia i dont know she replied with a marked accent of deliberation the colonel is to have you to himself tomorrow i cant be sure of what i shall have in the colonel your perpetual sparkler mrs mountstuart set her head in motion she left the matter silent ill come for him in the morning she said and her carriage whirled her off either she had guessed it or clara had confided to her the treacherous passion of horace de craye however the world was shut away from patterne for the night chapter xlvii sir willoughby and his friend horace de craye willoughby shut himself up in his laboratory to brood awhile after the conflict sounding through himself as it was habitual with him to do for the plan most agreeable to his taste he came on a strange discovery among the lower circles of that microcosm he was no longer guided in his choice by liking and appetite he had to put it on the edge of a sharp discrimination and try it by his acutest judgement before it was acceptable to his heart and knowing well the direction of his desire he was nevertheless unable to run two strides on a wish he had learned to read the world his partial capacity for reading persons had fled the mysteries of his own bosom were bare to him but he could comprehend them only in their immediate relation to the world outside this hateful world had caught him and transformed him to a machine the discovery he made was that in the gratification of the egoistic instinct we may so beset ourselves as to deal a slaughtering wound upon self to whatsoever quarter we turn surely there is nothing stranger in mortal experience the man was confounded at the game of chess it is the dishonour of our adversary when we are stalemated but in life combatting the world such a winning of the game questions our sentiments willoughbys interpretation of his discovery was directed by pity he had no other strong emotion left in him he pitied himself and he reached the conclusion that he suffered because he was active he could not be quiescent had it not been for his devotion to his house and name never would he have stood twice the victim of womankind had he been selfish he would have been the happiest of men he said it aloud he schemed benevolently for his unborn young and for the persons about him hence he was in a position forbidding a step under pain of injury to his feelings he was generous otherwise would he not in scorn of soul at the outset straight off have pitched clara middleton to the wanton winds he was faithful in his affection laetitia dale was beneath his roof to prove it both these women were examples of his power of forgiveness and now a tender word to clara might fasten shame on himsuch was her gratitude and if he did not marry laetitia laughter would be devilish all around himsuch was the worlds probably vernon would not long be thankful for the chance which varied the monotony of his days what of horace willoughby stripped to enter the ring with horace he cast away disguise that man had been the first to divide him in the all but equal slices of his egoistic from his amatory self murder of his individuality was the crime of horace de craye and further suspicion fixed on horace he knew not how except that the book bids us be suspicious of those we hate as the man who had betrayed his recent dealings with laetitia willoughby walked the thoroughfares of the house to meet clara and make certain of her either for himself or if it must be for vernon before he took another step with laetitia dale clara could reunite him turn him once more into a whole and an animated man and she might be willing her willingness to listen to vernon promised it a gentleman with a tongue would have a chance mrs mountstuart had said how much greater the chance of a lover for he had not yet supplicated her he had shown pride and temper he could woo he was a torrential wooer and it would be glorious to swing round on lady busshe and the world with clara nestling under an arm and protest astonishment at the erroneous and utterly unfounded anticipations of any other development and it would righteously punish laetitia clara came downstairs bearing her letter to miss darleton must it be posted willoughby said meeting her in the hall they expect us any day but it will be more comfortable for papa was her answer she looked kindly in her new shyness she did not seem to think he had treated her contemptuously in flinging her to his cousin which was odd you have seen vernon it was your wish you had a talk we conversed a long one we walked some distance clara i tried to make the best arrangement i could your intention was generous he took no advantage of it it could not be treated seriously it was meant seriously there i see the generosity willoughby thought this encomium and her consent to speak on the subject and her scarcely embarrassed air and richness of tone in speaking very strange and strange was her taking him quite in earnest apparently she had no feminine sensation of the unwontedness and the absurdity of the matter but clara am i to understand that he did not speak out we are excellent friends to miss it though his chance were the smallest you forget that it may not wear that appearance to him he spoke not one word of himself no ah the poor old fellow was taught to see it was hopelesschilled may i plead will you step into the laboratory for a minute we are two sensible persons pardon me i must go to papa vernons personal history perhaps i think it honourable to him honourablehem by comparison comparison with what with others he drew up to relieve himself of a critical and condemnatory expiration of a certain length this young lady knew too much but how physically exquisite she was could you clara could you promise mei hold to it i must have it i know his shy trickspromise me to give him ultimately another chance is the idea repulsive to you it is one not to be thought of it is not repulsive nothing could be repulsive in mr whitford i have no wish to annoy you clara i feel bound to listen to you willoughby whatever i can do to please you i will it is my lifelong duty could you clara could you conceive it could you simply conceive itgive him your hand as a friend oh yes in marriage she paused she so penetrative of him when he opposed her was hoodwinked when he softened her feelings for the heart though the clearest is not the most constant instructor of the head the heart unlike the often obtuser head works for itself and not for the commonwealth you are so kind i would do much she said would you accept himmarry him he is poor i am not ambitious of wealth would you marry him marriage is not in my thoughts but could you marry him willoughby expected no in his expectation of it he hung inflated she said these words i could engage to marry no one else his amazement breathed without a syllable he flapped his arms resembling for the moment those birds of enormous body which attempt a rise upon their wings and achieve a hop would you engage it he said content to see himself stepped on as an insect if he could but feel the agony of his false friend horacetheir common pretensions to win her were now of that comparative size oh there can be no necessity and an oathno said clara inwardly shivering at a recollection but you could my wish is to please you you could i said so it has been known to the patriotic mountaineer of a hoary pile of winters with little life remaining in him but that little on fire for his country that by the brink of the precipice he has flung himself on a young and lusty invader dedicating himself exultingly to death if only he may score a point for his country by extinguishing in his countrys enemy the stronger man so likewise did willoughby in the blow that deprived him of hope exult in the toppling over of horace de craye they perished together but which one sublimely relished the headlong descent and vernon taken by clara would be vernon simply tolerated and clara taken by vernon would be clara previously touched smirched altogether he could enjoy his fall it was at least upon a comfortable bed where his pride would be dressed daily and would never be disagreeably treated he was henceforth laetitias own the bell telling of dr corneys return was a welcome sound to willoughby and he said goodhumouredly wait clara you will see your hero crossjay crossjay and dr corney tumbled into the hall willoughby caught crossjay under the arms to give him a lift in the old fashion pleasing to clara to see the boy was heavy as lead i had work to hook him and worse to net him said dr corney i had to make him believe he was to nurse every soul in the house you among them miss middleton willoughby pulled the boy aside crossjay came back to clara heavier in looks than his limbs had been she dropped her letter in the hallbox and took his hand to have a private hug of him when they were alone she said crossjay my dear my dear you look unhappy yes and who wouldnt be and youre not to marry sir willoughby his voice threatened a cry i know youre not for dr corney says you are going to leave did you so very much wish it crossjay i should have seen a lot of you and i shant see you at all and im sure if id known i wouldnt haveand he has been and tipped me this crossjay opened his fist in which lay three gold pieces that was very kind of him said clara yes but how can i keep it by handing it to mr whitford to keep for you yes but miss middleton oughtnt i to tell him i mean sir willoughby what why that icrossjay got close to herwhy that i that iyou know what you used to say i wouldnt tell a lie but oughtnt i without his asking and this money i dont mind being turned out again consult mr whitford said clara i know what you think though perhaps you had better not say anything at present dear boy but what am i to do with this money crossjay held the gold pieces out as things that had not yet mingled with his ideas of possession i listened and i told of him he said i couldnt help listening but i went and told and i dont like being here and his money and he not knowing what i did havent you heard im certain i know what you think and so do i and i must take my luck im always in mischief getting into a mess or getting out of it i dont mind i really dont miss middleton i can sleep in a tree quite comfortably if youre not going to be here id just as soon be anywhere i must try to earn my living some day and why not a cabinboy sir cloudesley shovel was no better and i dont mind his being wrecked at last if youre drowned an admiral so i shall go and ask him to take his money back and if he asks me i shall tell him and there you know what it is i guessed that from what dr corney said im sure i know youre thinking whats manly fancy me keeping his money and you not marrying him i wouldnt mind driving a plough i shouldnt make a bad gamekeeper of course i love boats best but you cant have everything speak to mr whitford first said clara too proud of the boy for growing as she had trained him to advise a course of conduct opposed to his notions of manliness though now that her battle was over she would gladly have acquiesced in little casuistic compromises for the sake of the general peace some time later vernon and dr corney were arguing upon the question corney was dead against the sentimental view of the morality of the case propounded by vernon as coming from miss middleton and partly shared by him if its on the boys mind vernon said i cant prohibit his going to willoughby and making a clean breast of it especially as it involves me and sooner or later i should have to tell him myself dr corney said no at all points now hear me he said finally this is between ourselves and no breach of confidence which id not be guilty of for forty friends though id give my hand from the wristjoint for onemy left thats to say sir willoughby puts me one or two searching interrogations on a point of interest to him his house and name very well and good night to that and i wish miss dale had been ten years younger or had passed the ten with no heartrisings and sinkings wearing to the tissues of the frame and the moral fibre to boot shell have a fairish health with a little occasional doctoring taking her rank and wealth in right earnest and shying her pen back to mother goose shell do and by the way i think its to the credit of my sagacity that i fetched mr dale here fully primed and roused the neighbourhood which i did and so fixed our gentleman neat as a prodded eel on a pair of prongsnamely the positive fact and the general knowledge of it but mark me my friend we understand one another at a nod this boy young squire crossjay is a good stiff hearty kind of a saxon boy out of whom you may cut as gallant a fellow as ever wore epaulettes i like him you like him miss dale and miss middleton like him and sir willoughby patterne of patterne hall and other places wont be indisposed to like him mightily in the event of the sun being seen to shine upon him with a particular determination to make him appear a prominent object because a solitary and a patterne dr corney lifted his chest and his finger now mark me and verbum sap crossjay must not offend sir willoughby i say no more look ahead miracles happen but its best to reckon that they wont well now and miss dale shell not be cruel it appears as if she would said vernon meditating on the cloudy sketch dr corney had drawn she cant my friend her positions precarious her father has little besides a pension and her writing damages her health she cant and she likes the baronet oh its only a little fit of proud blood shes the woman for him shell manage himgive him an idea hes got a lot of ideas itd kill her father if she were obstinate he talked to me when i told him of the business about his dream fulfilled and if the dream turns to vapour hell be another example that we hang more upon dreams than realities for nourishment and medicine too last week i couldnt have got him out of his house with all my art and science oh shell come round her father prophesied this and ill prophesy that shes fond of him she was she sees through him without quite doing justice to him now said vernon he can be generousin his way how corney inquired and was informed that he should hear in time to come meanwhile colonel de craye after hovering over the park and about the cottage for the opportunity of pouncing on miss middleton alone had returned crestfallen for once and plumped into willoughbys hands my dear horace willoughby said ive been looking for you all the afternoon the fact isi fancy youll think yourself lured down here on false pretences but the truth is i am not so much to blame as the world will suppose in point of fact to be brief miss dale and i i never consult other men how they would have acted the fact of the matter is miss middleton i fancy you have partly guessed it partly said de craye well she has a liking that way and if it should turn out strong enough its the best arrangement i can think of the lively play of the colonels features fixed in a blank inquiry one can back a good friend for making a good husband said willoughby i could not break with her in the present stage of affairs without seeing to that and i can speak of her highly though she and i have seen in time that we do not suit one another my wife must have brains i have always thought it said colonel de craye glistening and looking hungry as a wolf through his wonderment there will not be a word against her you understand you know my dislike of tattle and gossip however let it fall on me my shoulders are broad i have done my utmost to persuade her and there seems a likelihood of her consenting she tells me her wish is to please me and this will please me certainly whos the gentleman my best friend i tell you i could hardly have proposed another allow this business to go on smoothly just now there was an uproar within the colonel to blind his wits and willoughby looked so friendly that it was possible to suppose the man of projects had mentioned his best friend to miss middleton and who was the best friend not having accused himself of treachery the quickeyed colonel was duped have you his name handy willoughby that would be unfair to him at present horaceask yourselfand to her things are in a ticklish posture at present dont be hasty certainly i dont ask initialsll do you have a remarkable aptitude for guessing horace and this case offers you no tough problemif ever you acknowledged toughness i have a regard for her and for himfor both pretty equally you know i have and i should be thoroughly thankful to bring the matter about lordly said de craye i dont see it i call it sensible oh undoubtedly the style i mean tolerably antique novel i should say and not the worse for that we want plain practical dealings between men and women usually we go the wrong way to work and i loathe sentimental rubbish de craye hummed an air but the lady said he i told you there seems a likelihood of her consenting willoughbys fish gave a perceptible little leap now that he had been taught to exercise his aptitude for guessing without any of the customary preliminaries on the side of the gentleman he said we must put him through his paces friend horace hes a notorious blunderer with women hasnt a word for them never marked a conquest de craye crested his plumes under the agreeable banter he presented a face humourously sceptical the lady is positively not indisposed to give the poor fellow a hearing i have cause to think she is not said willoughby glad of acting the indifference to her which could talk of her inclinations cause good cause bless us as good as one can have with a woman ah i assure you ah does it seem like her though well she wouldnt engage herself to accept him well that seems more like her but she said she could engage to marry no one else the colonel sprang up crying clara middleton said it he curbed himself thats a bit of wonderful compliancy she wishes to please me we separate on those terms and i wish her happiness ive developed a heart lately and taken to think of others nothing better you appear to make cock sure of the other partyour friend you know him too well horace to doubt his readiness do you willoughby she has money and good looks yes i can say i do it wouldnt be much of a man whod want hard pulling to that lighted altar and if he requires persuasion you and i horace might bring him to his senses kicking t would be i like to see everybody happy about me said willoughby naming the hour as time to dress for dinner the sentiment he had delivered was de crayes excuse for grasping his hand and complimenting him but the colonel betrayed himself by doing it with an extreme fervour almost tremulous when shall we hear more he said oh probably tomorrow said willoughby dont be in such a hurry im an infant asleep the colonel replied departing he resembled one to willoughbys mind or a traitor drugged there is a fellow i thought had some brains who are not fools to beset spinning if we choose to whip them with their vanity it is the consolation of the great to watch them spin but the pleasure is loftier and may comfort our unmerited misfortune for a while in making a false friend drunk willoughby among his many preoccupations had the satisfaction of seeing the effect of drunkenness on horace de craye when the latter was in claras presence he could have laughed cut in keen epigram were the marginal notes added by him to that chapter of the book which treats of friends and a woman and had he not been profoundly preoccupied troubled by recent intelligence communicated by the ladies his aunts he would have played the two together for the royal amusement afforded him by his friend horace chapter xlviii the lovers the hour was close upon eleven at night laetitia sat in the room adjoining her fathers bedchamber her elbow was on the table beside her chair and two fingers pressed her temples the state between thinking and feeling when both are molten and flow by us is one of our natures coming after thought has quieted the fiery nerves and can do no more she seemed to be meditating she was conscious only of a struggle past she answered a tap at the door and raised her eyes on clara clara stepped softly mr dale is asleep i hope so ah dear friend laetitia let her hand be pressed have you had a pleasant evening mr whitford and papa have gone to the library colonel de craye has been singing yeswith a voice i thought of you upstairs but could not ask him to sing piano he is probably exhilarated one would suppose it he sang well you are not aware of any reason it cannot concern me clara was in rosy colour but could meet a steady gaze and crossjay has gone to bed long since he was at dessert he would not touch anything he is a strange boy not very strange laetitia he did not come to me to wish me goodnight that is not strange it is his habit at the cottage and here and he professes to like me oh he does i may have wakened his enthusiasm but you he loves why do you say it is not strange clara he fears you a little and why should crossjay fear me dear i will tell you last nightyou will forgive him for it was by accident his own bedroom door was locked and he ran down to the drawingroom and curled himself up on the ottoman and fell asleep under that padded silken coverlet of the ladiesboots and all i am afraid laetitia profited by this absurd allusion thanking clara in her heart for the refuge he should have taken off his boots she said he slept there and woke up dear he meant no harm next day he repeated what he had heard you will blame him he meant well in his poor boys head and now it is over the county ah do not frown that explains lady busshe exclaimed laetitia dear dear friend said clara whyi presume on your tenderness for me but let me tomorrow i gowhy will you reject your happiness those kind good ladies are deeply troubled they say your resolution is inflexible you resist their entreaties and your fathers can it be that you have any doubt of the strength of this attachment i have none i have never had a doubt that it was the strongest of his feelings if before i go i could see you both happy i should be relieved i should rejoice laetitia said quietly do you remember a walk we had one day together to the cottage clara put up her hands with the motion of intending to stop her ears before i go said she if i might know this was to be which all desire before i leave i should not feel as i do now i long to see you happy him yes him too is it like asking you to pay my debt then please but no i am not more than partly selfish on this occasion he has won my gratitude he can be really generous an egoist who is you have forgotten our conversation on the day of our walk to the cottage help me to forget itthat day and those days and all those days i should be glad to think i passed a time beneath the earth and have risen again i was the egoist i am sure if i had been buried i should not have stood up seeing myself more vilely stained soiled disfiguredoh help me to forget my conduct laetitia he and i were unsuitedand i remember i blamed myself then you and he are not and now i can perceive the pride that can be felt in him the worst that can be said is that he schemes too much is there any fresh scheme said laetitia the rose came over claras face you have not heard it was impossible but it was kindly intended judging by my own feeling at this moment i can understand his we love to see our friends established laetitia bowed my curiosity is piqued of course dear friend tomorrow we shall be parted i trust to be thought of by you as a little better in grain than i have appeared and my reason for trusting it is that i know i have been always honesta boorish young woman in my stupid mad impatience but not insincere it is no lofty ambition to desire to be remembered in that character but such is your clara she discovers i will tell you it is his wish his wish that i should promise to give my hand to mr whitford you see the kindness laetitias eyes widened and fixed you think it kindness the intention he sent mr whitford to me and i was taught to expect him was that quite kind to mr whitford what an impression i must have made on you during that walk to the cottage laetitia i do not wonder i was in a fever you consented to listen i really did it astonishes me now but i thought i could not refuse my poor friend vernon whitford tried a love speech he no oh no you discouraged him i no gently i mean no surely you did not dream of trifling he has a deep heart has he you ask that and you know something of him he did not expose it to me dear not even the surface of the mighty deep laetitia knitted her brows no said clara not a coquette she is not a coquette i assure you with a laugh laetitia replied you have still the dreadful power you made me feel that day i wish i could use it to good purpose he did not speak of switzerland tyrol the iliad antigone that was all no political economy our situation you will own was unexampled or mine was are you interested in me i should be if i knew your sentiments i was grateful to sir willoughby grieved for mr whitford real grief because the task unposed on him of showing me politely that he did not enter into his cousins ideas was evidently very great extremely burdensome you so quickeyed in some things clara he felt for me i saw that in his avoidance of and he was as he always is pleasant we rambled over the park for i know not how long though it did not seem long never touching that subject not ever neighbouring it dear a gentleman should esteem the girl he would ask certain questions i fancy he has a liking for me as a volatile friend if he had offered himself despising me you can be childish clara probably you delight to tease he had his time of it and it is now my turn but he must despise me a little are you blind perhaps dear we both are a little the ladies looked deeper into one another will you answer me said laetitia your if if he had it would have been an act of condescension you are too slippery stay dear laetitia he was considerate in forbearing to pain me that is an answer you allowed him to perceive that it would have pained you dearest if i may convey to you what i was in a simile for comparison i think i was like a fishermans float on the water perfectly still and ready to go down at any instant or up so much for my behaviour similes have the merit of satisfying the finder of them and cheating the hearer said laetitia you admit that your feelings would have been painful i was a fishermans float please admire my simile any way you like this way or that or so quiet as to tempt the eyes to go to sleep and suddenly i might have disappeared in the depths or flown in the air but no fish bit well then to follow you supposing the fish or the fisherman for i dont know which is which oh no no this is too serious for imagery i am to understand that you thanked him at least for his reserve yes without the slightest encouragement to him to break it a fishermans float laetitia baffled and sighing laetitia kept silence for a space the simile chafed her wits with a suspicion of a meaning hidden in it if he had spoken she said he is too truthful a man and the railings of men at pussy women who wind about and will not be brought to a mark become intelligible to me then laetitia if he had spoken if and one could have imagined him sincere so truthful a man i am looking at myself ifwhy then i should have burnt to death with shame where have i readsome storyof an inextinguishable spark that would have been shot into my heart shame clara you are free as much as remains of me i could imagine a certain shame in such a position where there was no feeling but pride i could not imagine it where there was no feeling but pride laetitia mused and you dwell on the kindness of a proposition so extraordinary gaining some light impatiently she cried vernon loves you do not say it i have seen it i have never had a sign of it there is the proof when it might have been shown again and again the greater proof why did he not speak when he was privilegedstrangely but privileged he feared me feared to wound youand himself as well possibly men may be pardoned for thinking of themselves in these cases but why should he fear that another was dearer to you what cause had i given ah i see he could fear that suspect it see his opinion of me can he care for such a girl abuse me laetitia i should like a good round of abuse i need purification by fire what have i been in this house i have a sense of whirling through it like a madwoman and to be loved after it allno we must be hearing a tale of an antiquary prizing a battered relic of the battlefield that no one else would look at to be loved i see is to feel our littleness hollownessfeel shame we come out in all our spots never to have given me one sign when a lover would have been so tempted let me be incredulous my own dear laetitia because he is a man of honour you would say but are you unconscious of the torture you inflict for if i amyou say itloved by this gentleman what an object it is he lovesthat has gone clamouring about more immodestly than women will bear to hear of and she herself to think of oh i have seen my own heart it is a frightful spectre i have seen a weakness in me that would have carried me anywhere and truly i shall be charitable to womeni have gained that but loved by vernon whitford the miserable little me to be taken up and loved after tearing myself to pieces have you been simply speculating you have no positive knowledge of it why do you kiss me why do you tremble and blush so clara looked at her as clearly as she could she bowed her head it makes my conduct worse she received a tenderer kiss for that it was her avowal and it was understood to know that she had loved or had been ready to love him shadowed her in the retrospect ah you read me through and through said clara sliding to her for a whole embrace then there never was cause for him to fear laetitia whispered clara slid her head more out of sight not that my heart but i said i have seen it and it is unworthy of him and if as i think now i could have been so rash so weak wicked unpardonablesuch thoughts were in methen to hear him speak would make it necessary for me to uncover myself and tell himincredible to you yesthat while yes laetitia all this is true and thinking of him as the noblest of men i could have welcomed any help to cut my knot so there said clara issuing from her nest with winking eyelids you see the pain i mentioned why did you not explain it to me at once dearest i wanted a century to pass and you feel that it has passed yes in purgatorywith an angel by me my report of the place will be favourable good angel i have yet to say something say it and expiate i think i did fancy once or twice very dimly and especially today properly i ought not to have had any idea but his coming to me and his not doing as another would have done seemed a gentleman of real nobleness does not carry the common light for us to read him by i wanted his voice but silence i think did tell me more if a nature like mine could only have had faith without bearing the rattle of a tongue a knock at the door caused the ladies to exchange looks laetitia rose as vernon entered i am just going to my father for a few minutes she said and i have just come from yours vernon said to clara she observed a very threatening expression in him the sprite of contrariety mounted to her brain to indemnify her for her recent selfabasement seeing the bedroom door shut on laetitia she said and of course papa has gone to bed implying otherwise yes he has gone he wished me well his formula of goodnight would embrace that wish and failing it will be goodnight for good to me claras breathing gave a little leap we leave early tomorrow i know i have an appointment at bregenz for june so soon with papa and from there we break into tyrol and round away to the right southward to the italian alps and was it assumed that i should be of this expedition your father speaks dubiously you have spoken of me then i ventured to speak of you i am not overbold as you know her lovely eyes troubled the lids to hide their softness papa should not think of my presence with him dubiously he leaves it to you to decide yes then many times all that can be uttered do you consider what you are saying mr whitford i shut my eyes and say yes beware i give you one warning if you shut your eyes of course she flew from him big mountains must be satisfied with my admiration at their feet that will do for a beginning they speak encouragingly one of them vernons breast heaved high to be at your feet makes a mountain of you said she with the heart of a mouse if that satisfies me you tower too high you are inaccessible i give you a second warning you may be seized and lifted some one would stoop then to plant you like the flag on the conquered peak you have indeed been talking to papa mr whitford vernon changed his tone shall i tell you what he said i know his language so well he said but you have acted on it only partly he said you will teach me nothing he said vernon no oh not in this house that supplication coupled with his name confessed the end to which her quick vision perceived she was being led where she would succumb she revived the same shrinking in him from a breath of their great word yet not here somewhere in the shadow of the mountains but he was sure of her and their hands might join the two hands thought so or did not think behaved like innocents the spirit of dr middleton as clara felt had been blown into vernon rewarding him for forthright outspeaking over their books vernon had abruptly shut up a volume and related the tale of the house has this man a spice of religion in him the rev doctor asked midway vernon made out a fair general case for his cousin in that respect the complemental dot on his i of a commonly civilized human creature said dr middleton looking at his watch and finding it too late to leave the house before morning the risky communication was to come vernon was proceeding with the narrative of willoughbys generous plan when dr middleton electrified him by calling out he whom of all men living i should desire my daughter to espouse and willoughby rose in the rev doctors esteem he praised that sensibly minded gentleman who could acquiesce in the turn of mood of a little maid albeit fortune had withheld from him a taste of the switch at school the father of the little maids appreciation of her volatility was exhibited in his exhortation to vernon to be off to her at once with his authority to finish her moods and assure him of peace in the morning vernon hesitated dr middleton remarked upon being not so sure that it was not he who had done the mischief thereupon vernon to prove his honesty made his own story bare go to her said dr middleton vernon proposed a meeting in switzerland to which dr middleton assented adding go to her and as he appeared a total stranger to the decorum of the situation vernon put his delicacy aside and taking his heart up obeyed he too had pondered on claras consent to meet him after she knew of willoughbys terms and her grave sweet manner during the ramble over the park her fathers breath had been blown into him so now with nothing but the faith lying in sensation to convince him of his happy fortune and how unconvincing that may be until the mind has grasped and stamped it we experience even then when we acknowledge that we are most blessed he held her hand and if it was hard for him for both but harder for the man to restrain their particular word from a flight to heaven when the cage stood open and nature beckoned he was practised in selfmastery and she loved him the more laetitia was a witness of their union of hands on her coming back to the room they promised to visit her very early in the morning neither of them conceiving that they left her to a night of storm and tears she sat meditating on claras present appreciation of sir willoughbys generosity chapter xlix laetitia and sir willoughby we cannot be abettors of the tribes of imps whose revelry is in the frailties of our poor human constitution they have their place and their service and so long as we continue to be what we are now they will hang on to us restlessly plucking at the garments which cover our nakedness nor ever ceasing to twitch them and strain at them until they have stripped us for one of their horrible walpurgis nights when the laughter heard is of a character to render laughter frightful to the ears of men throughout the remainder of their days but if in these festival hours under the beam of hecate they are uncontrollable by the comic muse she will not flatter them with her presence during the course of their insane and impious hilarities whereof a description would outbrocken brockens and make graymalkin and paddock too intimately our familiars it shall suffice to say that from hour to hour of the midnight to the greyeyed morn assisted at intervals by the ladies eleanor and isabel and by mr dale awakened and reawakenedhearing the vehemence of his petitioning outcry to soften her obduracysir willoughby pursued laetitia with solicitations to espouse him until the inveteracy of his wooing wore the aspect of the lifelong love he raved of aroused to a state of mania he appeared he departed he returned and all the while his imps were about him and upon him riding him prompting driving inspiring him with outrageous pathos an eloquence to move any one but the dead which its object seemed to be in her torpid attention he heard them he talked to them caressed them he flung them off and ran from them and stood vanquished for them to mount him again and swarm on him there are men thus imphaunted men who setting their minds upon an object must have it breed imps they are noted for their singularities as their converse with the invisible and amazing distractions are called willoughby became aware of them that night he said to himself upon one of his dashes into solitude i believe i am possessed and if he did not actually believe it but only suspected it or framed speech to account for the transformation he had undergone into a desperately beseeching creature having lost acquaintance with his habitual personality the operations of an impish host had undoubtedly smitten his consciousness he had them in his brain for while burning with an ardour for laetitia that incited him to frantic excesses of language and comportment he was aware of shouts of the names of lady busshe and mrs mountstuart jenkinson the which freezing him as they did were directly the cause of his hurrying to a wilder extravagance and more headlong determination to subdue before break of day the woman he almost dreaded to behold by daylight though he had now passionately persuaded himself of his love of her he could not he felt stand in the daylight without her she was his morning she was he raved his predestinated wife he cried darling both to her and to solitude every prescription of his ideal of demeanour as an example to his class and country was abandoned by the enamoured gentleman he had lost command of his countenance he stooped so far as to kneel and not gracefully nay it is in the chronicles of the invisible host around him that in a fit of supplication upon a cry of laetitia twice repeated he whimpered let so much suffice and indeed not without reason do the multitudes of the servants of the muse in this land of social policy avoid scenes of an inordinate wantonness which detract from the dignity of our leaders and menace human nature with confusion sagacious are they who conduct the individual on broad lines over familiar tracks under wellknown characteristics what men will do and amorously minded men will do is less the question than what it is politic they should be shown to do the night wore through laetitia was bent but had not yielded she had been obliged to sayand how many times she could not bear to recollect i do not love you i have no love to give and issuing from such a night to look again upon the face of day she scarcely felt that she was alive the contest was renewed by her father with the singing of the birds mr dale then produced the first serious impression she had received he spoke of their circumstances of his being taken from her and leaving her to poverty in weak health of the injury done to her health by writing for bread and of the oppressive weight he would be relieved of by her consenting he no longer implored her he put the case on common ground and he wound up pray do not be ruthless my girl the practical statement and this adjuration incongruously to conclude it harmonized with her disordered understanding her loss of all sentiment and her desire to be kind she sighed to herself happily it is over her father was too weak to rise he fell asleep she was bound down to the house for hours and she walked through her suite here at the doors there at the windows thinking of claras remark of a century passing she had not wished it but a light had come on her to show her what she would have supposed a century could not have effected she saw the impossible of overnight a possible thing not desireable yet possible wearing the features of the possible happily she had resisted too firmly to be again besought those features of the possible once beheld allured the mind to reconsider them wealth gives us the power to do good on earth wealth enables us to see the world the beautiful scenes of the earth laetitia had long thirsted both for a dowering moneybag at her girdle and the wings to fly abroad over lands which had begun to seem fabulous in her starved imagination then moreover if her sentiment for this gentleman was gone it was only a delusion gone accurate sight and knowledge of him would not make a woman the less helpful mate that was the mate he required and he could be led a sentimental attachment would have been serviceless to him not so the woman allied by a purely rational bond and he wanted guiding happily she had told him too much of her feeble health and her lovelessness to be reduced to submit to another attack she busied herself in her room arranging for her departure so that no minutes might be lost after her father had breakfasted and dressed clara was her earliest visitor and each asked the other whether she had slept and took the answer from the face presented to her the rings of laetitias eyes were very dark clara was her mirror and she said a singular object to be persecuted through a night for her hand i know these two damp dead leaves i wear on my cheeks to remind me of midnight vigils but you have slept well clara i have slept well and yet i could say i have not slept at all laetitia i was with you dear part in dream and part in thought hoping to find you sensible before i go sensible that is the word for me laetitia briefly sketched the history of the night and clara said with a manifest sincerity that testified of her gratitude to sir willoughby could you resist him so earnest as he is laetitia saw the human nature without sourness and replied i hope clara you will not begin with a large stock of sentiment for there is nothing like it for making you hard matteroffact worldly calculating the next visitor was vernon exceedingly anxious for news of mr dale laetitia went into her fathers room to obtain it for him returning she found them both with sad visages and she ventured in alarm for them to ask the cause its this vernon said willoughby will everlastingly tease that boy to be loved by him perhaps poor fellow he had an excuse last night anyhow he went into crossjays room this morning woke him up and talked to him and set the lad crying and what with one thing and another crossjay got a berry in his throat as he calls it and poured out everything he knew and all he had done i neednt tell you the consequence he has ruined himself here for good so i must take him vernon glanced at clara you must indeed said she he is my boy as well as yours no chance of pardon its not likely laetitia what can i do oh what can you not do i do not know teach him to forgive laetitias brows were heavy and clara forbore to torment her she would not descend to the family breakfasttable clara would fain have stayed to drink tea with her in her own room but a last act of conformity was demanded of the liberated young lady she promised to run up the moment breakfast was over not unnaturally therefore laetitia supposed it to be she to whom she gave admission half an hour later with a glad cry of come in dear the knock had sounded like claras sir willoughby entered he stepped forward he seized her hands dear he said you cannot withdraw that you call me dear i am i must be dear to you the word is out by accident or not but by heaven i have it and i give it up to no one and love me or notmarry me and my love will bring it back to you you have taught me i am not so strong i must have you by my side you have powers i did not credit you with you are mistaken in me sir willoughby laetitia said feebly outworn as she was a woman who can resist me by declining to be my wife through a whole night of entreaty has the quality i need for my house and i will batter at her ears for months with as little rest as i had last night before i surrender my chance of her but i told you last night i want you within the twelve hours i have staked my pride on it by noon you are mine you are introduced to mrs mountstuart as mine as the lady of my life and house and to the world i shall not let you go you will not detain me here sir willoughby i will detain you i will use force and guile i will spare nothing he raved for a term as he had done overnight on his growing rather breathless laetitia said you do not ask me for love i do not i pay you the higher compliment of asking for you love or no love my love shall be enough reward me or not i am not used to be denied but do you know what you ask for do you remember what i told you of myself i am hard materialistic i have lost faith in romance the skeleton is present with me all over life and my health is not good i crave for money i should marry to be rich i should not worship you i should be a burden barely a living one irresponsive and cold conceive such a wife sir willoughby it will be you she tried to recall how this would have sung in her cars long back her bosom rose and fell in absolute dejection her ammunition of arguments against him had been expended overnight you are so unforgiving she said is it i who am you do not know me but you are the woman of all the world who knows me laetitia can you think it better for you to be known he was about to say other words he checked them i believe i do not know myself anything you will only give me your hand give it trust to me you shall direct me if i have faults help me to obliterate them will you not expect me to regard them as the virtues of meaner men you will be my wife laetitia broke from him crying your wife your critic oh i cannot think it possible send for the ladies let them hear me they are at hand said willoughby opening the door they were in one of the upper rooms anxiously on the watch dear ladies laetitia said to them as they entered i am going to wound you and i grieve to do it but rather now than later if i am to be your housemate he asks me for a hand that cannot carry a heart because mine is dead i repeat it i used to think the heart a womans marriage portion for her husband i see now that she may consent and he accept her without one but it is right that you should know what i am when i consent i was once a foolish romantic girl now i am a sickly woman all illusions vanished privation has made me what an abounding fortune usually makes of othersi am an egoist i am not deceiving you that is my real character my girls view of him has entirely changed and i am almost indifferent to the change i can endeavour to respect him i cannot venerate dear child the ladies gently remonstrated willoughby motioned to them if we are to live together and i could very happily live with you laetitia continued to address them you must not be ignorant of me and if you as i imagine worship him blindly i do not know how we are to live together and never shall you quit this house to make way for me i have a hard detective eye i see many faults have we not all of us faults dear child not such as he has though the excuses of a gentleman nurtured in idolatry may be pleaded but he should know that they are seen and seen by her he asks to be his wife that no misunderstanding may exist and while it is yet time he may consult his feelings he worships himself willoughby he is vindictive our willoughby that is not your opinion ladies it is firmly mine time has taught it me so if you and i are at such variance how can we live together it is an impossibility they looked at willoughby he nodded imperiously we have never affirmed that our dear nephew is devoid of faults if he is offended and supposing he claims to be foremost is it not his rightful claim made good by much generosity reflect dear laetitia we are your friends too she could not chastise the kind ladies any further you have always been my good friends and you have no other charge against him laetitia was milder in saying he is unpardoning name one instance laetitia he has turned crossjay out of his house interdicting the poor boy ever to enter it again crossjay said willoughby was guilty of a piece of infamous treachery which is the cause of your persecuting me to become your wife there was a cry of persecuting no young fellow behaving so basely can come to good said willoughby stained about the face with flecks of redness at the lashings he received honestly she retorted he told of himself and he must have anticipated the punishment he would meet he should have been studying with a master for his profession he has been kept here in comparative idleness to be alternately petted and discarded no one but vernon whitford a poor gentleman doomed to struggle for a livelihood by literaturei know something of that struggletoo much for meno one but mr whitford for his friend crossjay is forgiven said willoughby you promise me that he shall be packed off to a crammer at once but my home must be crossjays home you are mistress of my house laetitia she hesitated her eyelashes grew moist you can be generous he is dear child the ladies cried he is forget his errors in his generosity as we do there is that wretched man flitch that sot has gone about the county for years to get me a bad character said willoughby it would have been generous in you to have offered him another chance he has children nine and i am responsible for them i speak of being generous dictate willoughby spread out his arms surely now you should be satisfied laetitia said the ladies is he willoughby perceived mrs mountstuarts carriage coming down the avenue to the full he presented his hand she raised hers with the fingers catching back before she ceased to speak and dropped it ladies you are witnesses that there is no concealment there has been no reserve on my part may heaven grant me kinder eyes than i have now i would not have you change your opinion of him only that you should see how i read him for the rest i vow to do my duty by him whatever is of worth in me is at his service i am very tired i feel i must yield or break this is his wish and i submit and i salute my wife said willoughby making her hand his own and warming to his possession as he performed the act mrs mountstuarts indecent hurry to be at the hall before the departure of dr middleton and his daughter afflicted him with visions of the physical contrast which would be sharply perceptible to her this morning of his laetitia beside clara but he had the lady with brains he had and he was to learn the nature of that possession in the woman who is our wife chapter l upon which the curtain falls plain sense upon the marriage question is my demand upon man and woman for the stopping of many a tragedy these were dr middletons words in reply to willoughbys brief explanation he did not say that he had shown it parentally while the tragedy was threatening or at least there was danger of a precipitate descent from the levels of comedy the parents of hymeneal men and women he was indisposed to consider as dramatis personae nor did he mention certain sympathetic regrets he entertained in contemplation of the health of mr dale for whom poor gentleman the proffer of a bottle of the patterne port would be an egregious mockery he paced about anxious for his departure and seeming better pleased with the society of colonel de craye than with that of any of the others colonel de craye assiduously courted him was anecdotal deferential charmingly vivacious the very man the rev doctor liked for company when plunged in the bustle of the preliminaries to a journey you would be a cheerful travelling comrade sir he remarked and spoke of his doom to lead his daughter over the alps and alpine lakes for the summer months strange to tell the alps for the summer months was a settled project of the colonels and thence dr middleton was to be hauled along to the habitable quarters of north italy in high summertide that also had been traced for a route on the map of colonel de craye we are started in june i am informed said dr middleton june by miracle was the month the colonel had fixed upon i trust we shall meet sir said he i would gladly reckon it in my catalogue of pleasures the rev doctor responded for in good sooth it is conjecturable that i shall be left very much alone paris strasburg basle the colonel inquired the lake of constance i am told said dr middleton colonel de craye spied eagerly for an opportunity of exchanging a pair of syllables with the third and fairest party of this glorious expedition to come willoughby met him and rewarded the colonels frankness in stating that he was on the lookout for miss middleton to take his leave of her by furnishing him the occasion he conducted his friend horace to the blue room where clara and laetitia were seated circling a half embrace with a brook of chatter and contrived an excuse for leading laetitia forth some minutes later mrs mountstuart called aloud for the colonel to drive him away willoughby whose good offices were unabated by the services he performed to each in rotation ushered her into the blue room hearing her say as she stood at the entrance is the man coming to spend a day with me with a face like that she was met and detained by clara de craye came out what are you thinking of said willoughby i was thinking said the colonel of developing a heart like you and taking to think of others at last ay youre a true friend willoughby a true friend and a cousin to boot what has clara been communicative the itinerary of a voyage miss middleton is going to make do you join them why it would be delightful willoughby but it happens ive got a lot of powder i want to let off and so ive an idea of shouldering my gun along the seacoast and shooting gulls whichll be a harmless form of committing patricide and matricide and fratricidefor theres my family and i come of itthe gull and ive to talk lively to mrs mountstuart for something like a matter of twelve hours calculating that she goes to bed at midnight and i wouldnt bet on it such is the energy of ladies of that age willoughby scorned the man who could not conceal a blow even though he joked over his discomfiture gull he muttered a bird thats easy to be had and better for stuffing than for eating said de craye youll miss your cousin i have replied willoughby one fully equal to supplying his place there was confusion in the hall for a time and an assembly of the household to witness the departure of dr middleton and his daughter vernon had been driven off by dr corney who further recommended rest for mr dale and promised to keep an eye for crossjay along the road i think you will find him at the station and if you do command him to come straight back here laetitia said to clara the answer was an affectionate squeeze and claras hand was extended to willoughby who bowed over it with perfect courtesy bidding her adieu so the knot was cut and the next carriage to dr middletons was mrs mountstuarts conveying the great lady and colonel de craye i beg you not to wear that face with me she said to him i have had to dissemble which i hate and i have quite enough to endure and i must be amused or i shall run away from you and enlist that little countryman of yours and him i can count on to be professionally restorative who can fathom the heart of a girl here is lady busshe right once more and i was wrong she must be a gambler by nature i
