the story of diana of the crossways is to be read as fiction chapter i of diaries and diarists touching the heroine among the diaries beginning with the second quarter of our century there is frequent mention of a lady then becoming famous for her beauty and her wit 'an unusual combination' in the deliberate syllables of one of the writers who is however not disposed to personal irony when speaking of her it is otherwise in his case and a general fling at the sex we may deem pardonable for doing as little harm to womankind as the stone of an urchin cast upon the bosom of mother earth though men must look some day to have it returned to them which is a certainty and indeed full surely will our idle handed youngster too in his riper season be heard complaining of a strange assault of wanton missiles coming on him he knows not whence for we are all of us distinctly marked to get back what we give even from the thing named inanimate nature the 'leaves from the diary of henry wilmers' are studded with examples of the dinner table wit of the time not always worth quotation twice for smart remarks have their measured distances many requiring to be a brule pourpoint or within throw of the pistol to make it hit in other words the majority of them are addressed directly to our muscular system and they have no effect when we stand beyond the range on the contrary they reflect sombrely on the springs of hilarity in the generation preceding us with due reserve of credit of course to an animal vivaciousness that seems to have wanted so small an incitement our old yeomanry farmers returning to their beds over ferny commons under bright moonlight from a neighbour's harvest home eased their bubbling breasts with a ready roar not unakin to it still the promptness to laugh is an excellent progenitorial foundation for the wit to come in a people and undoubtedly the diarial record of an imputed piece of wit is witness to the spouting of laughter this should comfort us while we skim the sparkling passages of the 'leaves' when a nation has acknowledged that it is as yet but in the fisticuff stage of the art of condensing our purest sense to golden sentences a readier appreciation will be extended to the gift which is to strike not the dazzled eyes the unanticipating nose the ribs the sides and stun us twirl us hoodwink mystify tickle and twitch by dexterities of lingual sparring and shuffling but to strike roots in the mind the hesperides of good things we shall then set a price on the 'unusual combination' a witty woman is a treasure a witty beauty is a power has she actual beauty actual wit not simply a tidal material beauty that passes current any pretty flippancy or staggering pretentiousness grant the combination she will appear a veritable queen of her period fit for homage at least meriting a disposition to believe the best of her in the teeth of foul rumour because the well of true wit is truth itself the gathering of the precious drops of right reason wisdom's lightning and no soul possessing and dispensing it can justly be a target for the world however well armed the world confronting her our temporary world that old credulity and stone hurling urchin in one supposes it possible for a woman to be mentally active up to the point of spiritual clarity and also fleshly vile a guide to life and a biter at the fruits of death both open mind and hypocrite it has not yet been taught to appreciate a quality certifying to sound citizenship as authoritatively as acres of land in fee simple or coffers of bonds shares and stocks and a more imperishable guarantee the multitudes of evil reports which it takes for proof are marshalled against her without question of the nature of the victim her temptress beauty being a sufficiently presumptive delinquent it does not pretend to know the whole or naked body of the facts it knows enough for its furry dubiousness and excepting the sentimental of men a rocket headed horde ever at the heels of fair faces for ignition and up starring away at a hint of tearfulness excepting further by chance a solid champion man or some generous woman capable of faith in the pelted solitary of her sex our temporary world blows direct east on her shivering person the scandal is warrant for that the circumstances of the scandal emphasize the warrant and how clever she is cleverness is an attribute of the selecter missionary lieutenants of satan we pray to be defended from her cleverness she flashes bits of speech that catch men in their unguarded corner the wary stuff their ears the stolid bid her best sayings rebound on her reputation nevertheless the world as christian remembers its professions and a portion of it joins the burly in morals by extending to her a rough old charitable mercifulness better than sentimental ointment but the heaviest blow she has to bear to a character swimming for life that the lady in question was much quoted the diaries and memoirs testify hearsay as well as hearing was at work to produce the abundance and it was a novelty in england where in company the men are the pointed talkers and the women conversationally fair circassians they are or they know that they should be it comes to the same happily our civilization has not prescribed the veil to them the mutes have here and there a sketch or label attached to their names they are 'strikingly handsome' they are 'very good looking' occasionally they are noted as 'extremely entertaining' in what manner is inquired by a curious posterity that in so many matters is left unendingly to jump the empty and gaping figure of interrogation over its own full stop great ladies must they be at the web of politics for us to hear them cited discoursing henry wilmers is not content to quote the beautiful mrs warwick he attempts a portrait mrs warwick is 'quite grecian' she might 'pose for a statue' he presents her in carpenter's lines with a dab of school box colours effective to those whom the keepsake fashion can stir she has a straight nose red lips raven hair black eyes rich complexion a remarkably fine bust and she walks well and has an agreeable voice likewise 'delicate extremities' the writer was created for popularity had he chosen to bring his art into our literary market perry wilkinson is not so elaborate he describes her in his 'recollections' as a splendid brune eclipsing all the blondes coming near her and 'what is more the beautiful creature can talk' he wondered for she was young new to society subsequently he is rather ashamed of his wonderment and accounts for it by 'not having known she was irish' she 'turns out to be dan merion's daughter' we may assume that he would have heard if she had any whiff of a brogue her sounding of the letter r a trifle scrupulously is noticed by lady pennon 'and last not least the lovely mrs warwick twenty minutes behind the dinner hour and r r really fearing she was late' after alluding to the soft influence of her beauty and ingenuousness on the vexed hostess the kindly old marchioness adds that it was no wonder she was late 'for just before starting from home she had broken loose from her husband for good and she entered the room absolutely houseless' she was not the less 'astonishingly brilliant' her observations were often 'so unexpectedly droll i laughed till i cried' lady pennon became in consequence one of the stanch supporters of mrs warwick others were not so easily won perry wilkinson holds a balance when it goes beyond a question of her wit and beauty henry wilmers puts the case aside and takes her as he finds her his cousin the clever and cynical dorset wilmers whose method of conveying his opinions without stating them was famous repeats on two occasions when her name appears in his pages 'handsome lively witty' and the stressed repetition of calculated brevity while a fiery scandal was abroad concerning the lady implies weighty substance the reservation of a constable's truncheon that could legally have knocked her character down to the pavement we have not to ask what he judged but dorset wilmers was a political opponent of the eminent peer who yields the second name to the scandal and politics in his day flushed the conceptions of men his short references to 'that warwick dannisburgh affair' are not verbally malicious he gets wind of the terms of lord dannisburgh's will and testament noting them without comment the oddness of the instrument in one respect may have served his turn we have no grounds for thinking him malignant the death of his enemy closes his allusions to mrs warwick he was growing ancient and gout narrowed the circle he whirled in had he known this 'handsome lively witty' apparition as a woman having political and social views of her own he would not one fancies have been so stingless our england exposes a sorry figure in his reminiscences he struck heavily round and about him wherever he moved he had by nature a tarnishing eye that cast discolouration his unadorned harsh substantive statements excluding the adjectives give his memoirs the appearance of a body of facts attractive to the historic muse which has learnt to esteem those brawny sturdy giants marching club on shoulder independent of henchman in preference to your panoplied knights with their puffy squires once her favourites and wind filling to her columns ultimately found indigestible his exhibition of his enemy lord dannisburgh is of the class of noble portraits we see swinging over inn portals grossly unlike in likeness the possibility of the man's doing or saying this and that adumbrates the improbability he had something of the character capable of it too much good sense for the performance we would think so and still the shadow is round our thoughts lord dannisburgh was a man of ministerial tact official ability pagan morality an excellent general manager if no genius in statecraft but he was careless of social opinion unbuttoned and a laugher we know that he could be chivalrous toward women notwithstanding the perplexities he brought on them and this the dorset diary does not show his chronicle is less mischievous as regards mrs warwick than the paragraphs of perry wilkinson a gossip presenting an image of perpetual chatter like the waxen faced street advertizements of light and easy dentistry he has no belief no disbelief names the pro party and the con recites the case and discreetly over discreetly and pictures the trial tells the list of witnesses records the verdict so the case went and some thought one thing some another thing only it is reported for positive that a miniature of the incriminated lady was cleverly smuggled over to the jury and juries sitting upon these eases ever since their bedazzlement by phryne as you know and then he relates an anecdote of the husband said to have been not a bad fellow before he married his diana and the naming of the goddess reminds him that the second person in the indictment is now everywhere called 'the elderly shepherd' but immediately after the bridal bells this husband became sour and insupportable and either she had the trick of putting him publicly in the wrong or he lost all shame in playing the churlish domestic tyrant the instances are incredible of a gentleman perry wilkinson gives us two or three one on the authority of a personal friend who witnessed the scene at the warwick whist table where the fair diana would let loose her silvery laugh in the intervals she was hardly out of her teens and should have been dancing instead of fastened to a table a difference of fifteen years in the ages of the wedded pair accounts poorly for the husband's conduct however solemn a business the game of whist we read that he burst out at last with bitter mimicry 'yang yang yang' and killed the bright laugh shot it dead she had outraged the decorum of the square table only while the cards were making perhaps her too dead ensuing silence as of one striving to bring back the throbs to a slain bird in her bosom allowed the gap between the wedded pair to be visible for it was dated back to prophecy as soon as the trumpet proclaimed it but a multiplication of similar instances which can serve no other purpose than that of an apology is a miserable vindication of innocence the more we have of them the darker the inference in delicate situations the chatterer is noxious mrs warwick had numerous apologists those trusting to her perfect rectitude were rarer the liberty she allowed herself in speech and action must have been trying to her defenders in a land like ours for here and able to throw its shadow on our giddy upper circle the rigour of the game of life relaxed though it may sometimes appear would satisfy the staidest whist player she did not wish it the reverse even when claiming a space for laughter 'the breath of her soul' as she called it and as it may be felt in the early youth of a lively nature she especially with her multitude of quick perceptions and imaginative avenues her rapid summaries her sense of the comic demanded this aerial freedom we have it from perry wilkinson that the union of the divergent couple was likened to another union always in a court of law there was a distinction most analogies will furnish one and here we see england and ireland changeing their parts until later after the breach when the englishman and irishwoman resumed a certain resemblance to the yoked islands henry wilmers i have said deals exclusively with the wit and charm of the woman he treats the scandal as we might do in like manner if her story had not to be told but these are not reporting columns very little of it shall trouble them the position is faced and that is all the position is one of the battles incident to women their hardest it asks for more than justice from men for generosity our civilization not being yet of the purest that cry of hounds at her disrobing by law is instinctive she runs and they give tongue she is a creature of the chase let her escape unmangled it will pass in the record that she did once publicly run and some old dogs will persist in thinking her cunninger than the virtuous which never put themselves in such positions but ply the distaff at home never should reputation of woman trail a scent how true and true also that the women of waxwork never do and that the women of happy marriages do not nor the women of holy nunneries nor the women lucky in their arts it is a test of the civilized to see and hear and add no yapping to the spectacle thousands have reflected on a diarist's power to cancel our burial service not alone the cleric's good work is upset by him but the sexton's as well he howks the grave and transforms the quiet worms busy on a single poor peaceable body into winged serpents that disorder sky and earth with a deadly flight of zig zags like military rockets among the living and if these are given to cry too much to have their tender sentiments considered it cannot be said that history requires the flaying of them a gouty diarist a sheer gossip diarist may thus in the bequest of a trail of reminiscences explode our temples for our very temples have powder in store our treasuries our homesteads alive with dynamitic stuff nay disconcert our inherited veneration dislocate the intimate connexion between the tugged flaxen forelock and a title no similar blame is incurred by henry wilmers no blame whatever one would say if he had been less copious or not so subservient in recording the lady's utterances for though the wit of a woman may be terse quite spontaneous as this lady's assuredly was here and there she is apt to spin it out of a museful mind at her toilette or by the lonely fire and sometimes it is imitative admirers should beware of holding it up to the withering glare of print she herself quoting an obscure maximmonger says of these lapidary sentences that they have merely 'the value of chalk eggs which lure the thinker to sit' and tempt the vacuous to strain for the like one might add besides flattering the world to imagine itself richer than it is in eggs that are golden henry wilmers notes a multitude of them 'the talk fell upon our being creatures of habit and how far it was good she said it is there that we see ourselves crutched between love grown old and indifference ageing to love' critic ears not present at the conversation catch an echo of maxims and aphorisms overchannel notwithstanding a feminine thrill in the irony of 'ageing to love' the quotation ranks rather among the testimonies to her charm she is fresher when speaking of the war of the sexes for one sentence out of many though we find it to be but the clever literary clothing of a common accusation 'men may have rounded seraglio point they have not yet doubled cape turk' it is war and on the male side ottoman war her experience reduced her to think so positively her main personal experience was in the social class which is primitively venatorial still canine under its polish she held a brief for her beloved ireland she closes a discussion upon irish agitation by saying rather neatly 'you have taught them it is english as well as common human nature to feel an interest in the dog that has bitten you' the dog periodically puts on madness to win attention we gather then that england in an angry tremour tries him with water gruel to prove him sane of the irish priest and she was not of his retinue when he was deemed a revolutionary henry wilmers notes her saying 'be in tune with him he is in the key note for harmony he is shepherd doctor nurse comforter anecdotist and fun maker to his poor flock and you wonder they see the burning gateway of their heaven in him conciliate the priest' it has been partly done done late when the poor flock have found their doctoring and shepherding at other hands their 'bulb food and fiddle' that she petitioned for to keep them from a complete shaving off their patch of bog and scrub soil without any perception of the tremulous transatlantic magnification of the fiddle and the splitting discord of its latest inspiriting jig and she will not have the consequences of the 'weariful old irish duel between honour and hunger judged by bread and butter juries' she had need to be beautiful to be tolerable in days when englishmen stood more openly for the strong arm to maintain the union her troop of enemies was of her summoning ordinarily her topics were of wider range and those of a woman who mixed hearing with reading and observation with her musings she has no doleful ejaculatory notes of the kind peculiar to women at war containing one third of speculative substance to two of sentimental a feminine plea for comprehension and a squire and it was probably the reason as there is no reason to suppose an emotional cause why she exercised her evident sway over the mind of so plain and straightforward an englishman as henry wilmers she told him that she read rapidly 'a great deal at one gulp' and thought in flashes a way with the makers of phrases she wrote she confessed laboriously the desire to prune compress overcharge was a torment to the nervous woman writing under a sharp necessity for payment her songs were shot off on the impulsion prose was the heavy task 'to be pointedly rational' she said 'is a greater difficulty for me than a fine delirium' she did not talk as if it would have been so he remarks one is not astonished at her appearing an 'actress' to the flat minded but the basis of her woman's nature was pointed flame in the fulness of her history we perceive nothing histrionic capricious or enthusiastic in her youth she never trifled with feeling and if she did so with some showy phrases and occasionally proffered commonplaces in gilt as she was much excited to do her moods of reflection were direct always large and honest universal as well as feminine her saying that 'a woman in the pillory restores the original bark of brotherhood to mankind' is no more than a cry of personal anguish she has golden apples in her apron she says of life 'when i fail to cherish it in every fibre the fires within are waning' and that drives like rain to the roots she says of the world generously if with tapering idea 'from the point of vision of the angels this ugly monster only half out of slime must appear our one constant hero' it can be read maliciously but abstain she says of romance 'the young who avoid that region escape the title of fool at the cost of a celestial crown' of poetry 'those that have souls meet their fellows there' but she would have us away with sentimentalism sentimental people in her phrase 'fiddle harmonics on the strings of sensualism' to the delight of a world gaping for marvels of musical execution rather than for music for our world is all but a sensational world at present in maternal travail of a soberer a braver a brighter eyed her reflections are thus to be interpreted it seems to me she says 'the vices of the world's nobler half in this day are feminine' we have to guard against 'half conceptions of wisdom hysterical goodness an impatient charity' against the elementary state of the altruistic virtues distinguishable as the sickness and writhings of our egoism to cast its first slough idea is there the funny part of it is our finding it in books of fiction composed for payment manifestly this lady did not 'chameleon' her pen from the colour of her audience she was not of the uniformed rank and file marching to drum and fife as gallant interpreters of popular appetite and going or gone to soundlessness and the icy shades touches inward are not absent 'to have the sense of the eternal in life is a short flight for the soul to have had it is the soul's vitality' and also 'palliation of a sin is the hunted creature's refuge and final temptation our battle is ever between spirit and flesh spirit must brand the flesh that it may live' you are entreated to repress alarm she was by preference light handed and her saying of oratory that 'it is always the more impressive for the spice of temper which renders it untrustworthy' is light enough on politics she is rhetorical and swings she wrote to spur a junior politician 'it is the first business of men the school to mediocrity to the covetously ambitious a sty to the dullard his amphitheatre arms of titans to the desperately enterprising olympus to the genius' what a woman thinks of women is the test of her nature she saw their existing posture clearly yet believed as men disincline to do that they grow she says that 'in their judgements upon women men are females voices of the present sexual dilemma' they desire to have 'a still woman who can make a constant society of her pins and needles' they create by stoppage a volcano and are amazed at its eruptiveness 'we live alone and do not much feel it till we are visited' love is presumably the visitor of the greater loneliness of women she says 'it is due to the prescribed circumscription of their minds of which they become aware in agitation were the walls about them beaten down they would understand that solitariness is a common human fate and the one chance of growth like space for timber' as to the sensations of women after the beating down of the walls she owns that the multitude of the timorous would yearn in shivering affright for the old prison nest according to the sage prognostic of men but the flying of a valiant few would form a vanguard and we are informed that the beginning of a motive life with women must be in the head equally with men by no means a truism when she wrote also that 'men do not so much fear to lose the hearts of thoughtful women as their strict attention to their graces' the present market is what men are for preserving an observation of still reverberating force generally in her character of the feminine combatant there is a turn of phrase like a dimple near the lips showing her knowledge that she was uttering but a tart measure of the truth she had always too much lambent humour to be the dupe of the passion wherewith as she says 'we lash ourselves into the persuasive speech distinguishing us from the animals' the instances of her drollery are rather hinted by the diarists for the benefit of those who had met her and could inhale the atmosphere at a word drolleries humours reputed witticisms are like odours of roast meats past with the picking of the joint idea is the only vital breath they have it rarely or it eludes the chronicler to say of the great erratic and forsaken lady a after she had accepted the consolations of bacchus that her name was properly signified in asterisks 'as she was now nightly an ariadne in heaven through her god' sounds to us a roundabout with wit somewhere and fun nowhere sitting at the roast we might have thought differently perry wilkinson is not happier in citing her reply to his compliment on the reviewers' unanimous eulogy of her humour and pathos the 'merry clown and poor pantaloon demanded of us in every work of fiction' she says lamenting the writer's compulsion to go on producing them for applause until it is extremest age that knocks their knees we are informed by lady pennon of 'the most amusing description of the first impressions of a pretty english simpleton in paris' and here is an opportunity for ludicrous contrast of the french and english styles of pushing flatteries 'piping to the charmed animal' as mrs warwick terms it in another place but lady pennon was acquainted with the silly woman of the piece and found her amusement in the 'wonderful truth' of that representation diarists of amusing passages are under an obligation to paint us a realistic revival of the time or we miss the relish the odour of the roast and more a slice of it is required unless the humorous thing be preternaturally spirited to walk the earth as one immortal among a number less numerous than the mythic gods 'he gives good dinners' a candid old critic said when asked how it was that he could praise a certain poet in an island of chills and fogs coelum crebris imbribus ac nebulis foedum the comic and other perceptions are dependent on the stirring of the gastric juices and such a revival by any of us would be impolitic were it a possible attempt before our systems shall have been fortified by philosophy then may it be allowed to the diarist simply to relate and we can copy from him then ah then moreover will the novelist's art now neither blushless infant nor executive man have attained its majority we can then be veraciously historical honestly transcriptive rose pink and dirty drab will alike have passed away philosophy is the foe of both and their silly cancelling contest perpetually renewed in a shuffle of extremes as it always is where a phantasm falseness reigns will no longer baffle the contemplation of natural flesh smother no longer the soul issuing out of our incessant strife philosophy bids us to see that we are not so pretty as rose pink not so repulsive as dirty drab and that instead of everlastingly shifting those barren aspects the sight of ourselves is wholesome bearable fructifying finally a delight do but perceive that we are coming to philosophy the stride toward it will be a giant's a century a day and imagine the celestial refreshment of having a pure decency in the place of sham real flesh a soul born active wind beaten but ascending honourable will fiction then appear honourable a fount of life an aid to life quick with our blood why when you behold it you love it and you will not encourage it or only when presented by dead hands worse than that alternative dirty drab your recurring rose pink is rebuked by hideous revelations of the filthy foul for nature will force her way and if you try to stifle her by drowning she comes up not the fairest part of her uppermost peruse your realists really your castigators for not having yet embraced philosophy as she grows in the flesh when discreetly tended nature is unimpeachable flower eke yet not too decoratively a flower you must have her with the stem the thorns the roots and the fat bedding of roses in this fashion she grew says historical fiction thus does she flourish now would say the modern transcript reading the inner as well as exhibiting the outer and how may you know that you have reached to philosophy you touch her skirts when you share her hatred of the sham decent her derision of sentimentalism you are one with her when but i would not have you a thousand years older get to her if in no other way by the sentimental route that very winding path which again and again brings you round to the point of original impetus where you have to be unwound for another whirl your point of original impetus being the grossly material not at all the spiritual it is most true that sentimentalism springs from the former merely and badly aping the latter fine flower or pinnacle flame spire of sensualism that it is could it do other and accompanying the former it traverses tracts of desert here and there couching in a garden catching with one hand at fruits with another at colours imagining a secret ahead and goaded by an appetite sustained by sheer gratifications fiddle in harmonics as it may it will have these gratifications at all costs should none be discoverable at once you are at the cave of despair beneath the funereal orb of glaucoma in the thick midst of poniarded slit throat rope dependant figures placarded across the bosom disillusioned infidel agnostic miserrimus that is the sentimental route to advancement spirituality does not light it evanescent dreams are its oil lamps often with wick askant in the socket a thousand years you may count full many a thousand by this route before you are one with divine philosophy whereas a single flight of brains will reach and embrace her give you the savour of truth the right use of the senses reality's infinite sweetness for these things are in philosophy and the fiction which is the summary of actual life the within and without of us is prose or verse plodding or soaring philosophy's elect handmaiden to such an end let us bend our aim to work knowing that every form of labour even this flimsiest as you esteem it should minister to growth if in any branch of us we fail in growth there is you are aware an unfailing aboriginal democratic old monster that waits to pull us down certainly the branch possibly the tree and for the welfare of life we fall you are acutely conscious of yonder old monster when he is mouthing at you in politics be wary of him in the heart especially be wary of the disrelish of brainstuff you must feed on something matter that is not nourishing to brains can help to constitute nothing but the bodies which are pitched on rubbish heaps brainstuff is not lean stuff the brainstuff of fiction is internal history and to suppose it dull is the profoundest of errors how deep you will understand when i tell you that it is the very football of the holiday afternoon imps below they kick it for pastime they are intelligences perverted the comic of it the adventurous the tragic they make devilish to kindle their ogygian hilarity but sharply comic adventurous instructively tragic it is in the interwinding with human affairs to give a flavour of the modern day reviving that of our poet between whom and us yawn time's most hollow jaws surely we owe a little to time to cheer his progress a little to posterity and to our country dozens of writers will be in at yonder yawning breach if only perusers will rally to the philosophic standard they are sick of the woodeny puppetry they dispense as on a race course to the roaring frivolous well if not dozens half dozens gallant pens are alive one can speak of them in the plural i venture to say that they would be satisfied with a dozen for audience for a commencement they would perish of inanition unfed unapplauded amenable to the laws perchance for an assault on their last remaining pair of ears or heels to hold them fast but the example is the thing sacrifices must be expected the example might one hopes create a taste a great modern writer of clearest eye and head now departed capable in activity of presenting thoughtful women thinking men groaned over his puppetry that he dared not animate them flesh though they were with the fires of positive brainstuff he could have done it and he is of the departed had he dared he would for he was titan enough have raised the art in dignity on a level with history to an interest surpassing the narrative of public deeds as vividly as man's heart and brain in their union excel his plain lines of action to eruption the everlasting pantomime suggested by mrs warwick in her exclamation to perry wilkinson is derided not unrighteously by our graver seniors they name this art the pasture of idiots a method for idiotizing the entire population which has taken to reading and which soon discovers that it can write likewise that sort of stuff at least the forecast may be hazarded that if we do not speedily embrace philosophy in fiction the art is doomed to extinction under the shining multitude of its professors they are fast capping the candle instead therefore of objurgating the timid intrusions of philosophy invoke her presence i pray you history without her is the skeleton map of events fiction a picture of figures modelled on no skeleton anatomy but each with philosophy in aid blooms and is humanly shapely to demand of us truth to nature excluding philosophy is really to bid a pumpkin caper as much as legs are wanted for the dance philosophy is required to make our human nature credible and acceptable fiction implores you to heave a bigger breast and take her in with this heavenly preservative helpmate her inspiration and her essence you have to teach your imagination of the feminine image you have set up to bend your civilized knees to that it must temper its fastidiousness shun the grossness of the over dainty or to speak in the philosophic tongue you must turn on yourself resolutely track and seize that burrower and scrub and cleanse him by which process during the course of it you will arrive at the conception of the right heroical woman for you to worship and if you prove to be of some spiritual stature you may reach to an ideal of the heroical feminine type for the worship of mankind an image as yet in poetic outline only on our upper skies 'so well do we know ourselves that we one and all determine to know a purer' says the heroine of my columns philosophy in fiction tells among various other matters of the perils of this intimate acquaintance with a flattering familiar in the 'purer' a person who more than ceases to be of else to us after his ideal shall have led up men from their flint and arrowhead caverns to intercommunicative daylight for when the fictitious creature has performed that service of helping to civilize the world it becomes the most dangerous of delusions causing first the individual to despise the mass and then to join the mass in crushing the individual wherewith let us to our story the froth being out of the bottle chapter ii an irish ball in the assembly rooms of the capital city of the sister island there was a public ball to celebrate the return to erin of a british hero of irish blood after his victorious indian campaign a mighty struggle splendidly ended and truly could it be said that all erin danced to meet him but this was the pick of the dancing past dispute the pick of the supping outside those halls the supping was done in lazarus fashion mainly through an excessive straining of the organs of hearing and vision which imparted the readiness for more declared by physicians to be the state inducing to sound digestion some one spied the figure of the hero at the window and was fed some only to hear the tale chewed the cud of it some told of having seen him mount the steps and sure it was that at an hour of the night no matter when and never mind a drop or two of cloud he would come down them again and have an irish cheer to freshen his pillow for 'tis ireland gives england her soldiers her generals too farther away over field and bogland the whiskies did their excellent ancient service of watering the dry and drying the damp to the toast of 'lord larrian god bless him he's an honour to the old country' and a bit of a sigh to follow hints of a story and loud laughter a drink a deeper sigh settling into conversation upon the brave lord larrian's deeds and an irish regiment he favoured had no taste for the enemy without the backing of his 'boys' not he why he'd never march to battle and they not handy because when he struck he struck hard he said and he has a wound on the right hip and two fingers off his left hand has bled for england to show her what irishmen are when they're well treated the fine old warrior standing at the upper end of the long saloon tall straight grey haired martial in his aspect and decorations was worthy to be the flag pole for enthusiasm his large grey eyes lightened from time to time as he ranged them over the floating couples and dropped a word of inquiry to his aide captain sir lukin dunstane a good model of a cavalry officer though somewhat a giant equally happy with his chief in passing the troops of animated ladies under review he named as many as were known to him reviewing women exquisitely attired for inspection all variously and charmingly smiling is a relief after the monotonous regiments of men ireland had done her best to present the hero of her blood an agreeable change and he too expressed a patriotic satisfaction on hearing that the faces most admired by him were of the native isle he looked upon one that came whirling up to him on a young officer's arm and swept off into the crowd of tops for a considerable while before he put his customary question she was returning on the spin when he said 'who is she' sir lukin did not know 'she 's a new bird she nodded to my wife i'll ask' he manoeuvred a few steps cleverly to where his wife reposed the information he gathered for the behoof of his chief was that the handsome creature answered to the name of miss merion irish aged somewhere between eighteen and nineteen a dear friend of his wife's and he ought to have remembered her but she was a child when he saw her last 'dan merion died i remember about the day of my sailing for india' said the general 'she may be his daughter' the bright cynosure rounded up to him in the web of the waltz with her dark eyes for lady dunstane and vanished again among the twisting columns he made his way handsomely bumped by an apologetic pair to lady dunstane beside whom a seat was vacated for him and he trusted she had not over fatigued herself 'confess' she replied 'you are perishing to know more than lukin has been able to tell you let me hear that you admire her it pleases me and you shall hear what will please you as much i promise you general' 'i do who wouldn't' said he frankly 'she crossed the channel expressly to dance here tonight at the public ball in honour of you' 'where she appears the first person falls to second rank and accepts it humbly' 'that is grandly spoken' 'she makes everything in the room dust round a blazing jewel' 'she makes a poet of a soldier well that you may understand how pleased i am she is my dearest friend though she is younger than i as may be seen she is the only friend i have i nursed her when she was an infant my father and mr dan merion were chums we were parted by my marriage and the voyage to india we have not yet exchanged a syllable she was snapped up of course the moment she entered the room i knew she would be a taking girl how lovely i did not guess you are right she extinguishes the others she used to be the sprightliest of living creatures and to judge by her letters that has not faded she 's in the market general' lord larrian nodded to everything he heard concluding with a mock doleful shake of the head 'my poorest subaltern' he sighed in the theatrical but cordially melancholy style of green age viewing cytherea's market his poorest subaltern was richer than he in the wherewithal to bid for such prizes 'what is her name in addition to merion' 'diana antonia merion tony to me diana to the world' 'she lives over there' 'in england or anywhere wherever she is taken in she will live i hope chiefly with me' 'and honest irish' 'oh she's irish' 'ah' the general was irish to the heels that night before further could be said the fair object of the dialogue came darting on a trip of little runs both hands out all her face one tender sparkle of a smile and her cry proved the quality of her blood 'emmy emmy my heart' 'my dear tony i should not have come but for the hope of seeing you here' lord larrian rose and received a hurried acknowledgement of his courtesy from the usurper of his place 'emmy we might kiss and hug we're in ireland i burn to but you're not still ill dear say no that indian fever must have gone you do look a dash pale my own you're tired' 'one dance has tired me why were you so late' 'to give the others a chance to produce a greater impression by suspense no and no i wrote you i was with the pettigrews we caught the coach we caught the boat we were only two hours late for the ball so we did wonders and good mrs pettigrew is pining somewhere to complete her adornment i was in the crush spying for emmy when mr mayor informed me it was the duty of every irishwoman to dance her toes off if she 'd be known for what she is and twirl a man had me by the waist and i dying to find you' 'who was the man' 'not to save these limbs from the lighted stake could i tell you' 'you are to perform a ceremonious bow to lord larrian' 'chatter first a little' the plea for chatter was disregarded it was visible that the hero of the night hung listening and in expectation he and the beauty were named to one another and they chatted through a quadrille sir lukin introduced a fellow harrovian of old days mr thomas redworth to his wife 'our weather prophet meteorologist' he remarked to set them going 'you remember in india my pointing to you his name in a newspaper letter on the subject he was generally safe for the cricketing days' lady dunstane kindly appeared to call it to mind and she led upon the them queried at times by an abrupt 'eh' and 'i beg pardon' for manifestly his gaze and one of his ears if not the pair were given to the young lady discoursing with lord larrian beauty is rare luckily is it rare or judging from its effect on men and the very stoutest of them our world would be internally more distracted planet than we see to the perversion of business courtesy rights of property and the rest she perceived an incipient victim of the hundreds she anticipated and she very tolerantly talked on 'the weather and women have some resemblance they say is it true that he who reads the one can read the other' lord larrian here burst into a brave old laugh exclaiming 'oh good' mr redworth knitted his thick brows 'i beg pardon ah women weather and women no the one point more variable in women makes all the difference' 'can you tell me what the general laughed at' the honest englishman entered the trap with promptitude 'she said who is she may i ask you' lady dunstane mentioned her name daughter of the famous dan merion the young lady merited examination for her father's sake but when reminded of her laughter moving speech mr redworth bungled it he owned he spoilt it and candidly stated his inability to see the fun 'she said st george's channel in a gale ought to be called st patrick's something i missed some point that quadrille tune the pastourelle or something' 'she had experience of the channel last night' lady dunstane pursued and they both while in seeming converse caught snatches from their neighbours during a pause of the dance the sparkling diana said to lord larrian 'you really decline to make any of us proud women by dancing to night' the general answered 'i might do it on two stilts i can't on one' he touched his veteran leg 'but surely' said she 'there's always an inspiration coming to it from its partner in motion if one of them takes the step' he signified a woeful negative 'my dear young lady you say dark things to grey hairs' she rejoined 'if we were over in england and you fixed on me the stigma of saying dark things i should never speak without being thought obscure' 'it's because you flash too brightly for them' 'i think it is rather the reminiscence of the tooth that received a stone when it expected candy' again the general laughed he looked pleased and warmed 'yes that 's their way that 's their way' and he repeated her words to himself diminishing their importance as he stamped them on his memory but so heartily admiring the lovely speaker that he considered her wit an honour to the old country and told her so irish prevailed up to boiling point lady dunstane not less gratified glanced up at mr redworth whose brows bore the knot of perplexity over a strong stare he too stamped the words on his memory to see subsequently whether they had a vestige of meaning terrifically precocious he thought her lady dunstane in her quick sympathy with her friend read the adverse mind in his face and her reading of the mind was right wrong altogether her deduction of the corresponding sentiment music was resumed to confuse the hearing of the eavesdroppers they beheld a quaint spectacle a gentleman obviously an englishman approached with the evident intention of reminding the beauty of the night of her engagement to him and claiming her as it were in the lion's jaws he advanced a foot withdrew it advanced withdrew eager for his prize not over enterprising in awe of the illustrious general she entertained presumeably quite unaware of the pretender's presence whereupon a voice was heard 'oh if it was minuetting you meant before the lady i'd never have disputed your right to perform sir' for it seemed that there were two claimants in the field an irishman and an englishman and the former having a livelier sense of the situation hung aloof in waiting for her eye the latter directed himself to strike bluntly at his prey and he continued minuetting now rapidly blinking flushed angry conscious of awkwardness and a tangle incapable of extrication he began to blink horribly under the raillery of his rival the general observed him but as an object remote and minute a fly or gnat the face of the brilliant diana was entirely devoted to him she amused lady dunstane had the faint lines of a decorous laugh on her lips as she said 'how odd it is that our men show to such disadvantage in a ball room i have seen them in danger and there they shine first of any and one is proud of them they should always be facing the elements or in action' she glanced at the minuet which had become a petrified figure still palpitating bent forward an interrogative reminder mr redworth reserved his assent to the proclamation of any english disadvantage a whiff of celtic hostility in the atmosphere put him on his mettle 'wherever the man is tried' he said 'my lady' the irish gentleman bowed to lady dunstane 'i had the honour sullivan smith at the castle' she responded to the salute and mr sullivan smith proceeded to tell her half in speech half in dots most luminous of a civil contention between the english gentleman and himself as to the possession of the loveliest of partners for this particular ensuing dance and that they had simultaneously made a rush from the lower courts namely their cards to the upper being the lady and mr sullivan smith partly founded his preferable claim on her irish descent and on his acquaintance with her eminent defunct father one of the ever radiating stars of his quenchless country lady dunstane sympathized with him for his not intruding his claim when the young lady stood pre engaged as well as in humorous appreciation of his imaginative logic 'there will be dancing enough after supper' she said 'if i could score one dance with her i'd go home supperless and feasted' said he 'and that's not saying much among the hordes of hungry troopers tip toe for the signal to the buffet see my lady the gentleman as we call him there he is working his gamut perpetually up to da capo oh but it's a sheep trying to be wolf he 's sheep eyed and he 's wolf fanged pathetic and larcenous oh now who'd believe it the man has dared i'd as soon think of committing sacrilege in a cathedral' the man was actually to quote his indignant rival 'breaching the fortress' and pointing out to diana merion 'her name on his dirty scrap of paper' a shocking sight when the lady's recollection was the sole point to be aimed at and the only umpire 'as if all of us couldn't have written that and hadn't done it' mr sullivan smith groaned disgusted he hated bad manners particularly in cases involving ladies and the bad manners of a saxon fired his antagonism to the race individual members of which he boasted of forgiving and embracing honouring so the man blackened the race for him and the race was excused in the man but his hatred of bad manners was vehement and would have extended to a fellow countryman his own were of the antecedent century therefore venerable diana turned from her pursuer with a comic woeful lifting of the brows at her friend lady dunstane motioned her fan and diana came bending head 'are you bound in honour' 'i don't think i am and i do want to go on talking with the general he is so delightful and modest my dream of a true soldier telling me of his last big battle bit by bit to my fishing' 'put off this person for a square dance down the list and take out mr redworth miss diana merlon mr redworth he will bring you back to the general who must not totally absorb you or he will forfeit his popularity' diana instantly struck a treaty with the pertinacious advocate of his claims to whom on his relinquishing her mr sullivan smith remarked 'oh sir the law of it where a lady's concerned you're one for evictions i should guess and the anti human process it's that letter of the law that stands between you and me and mine and yours but you've got your congee and my blessing on ye' 'it was a positive engagement' said the enemy mr sullivan smith derided him 'and a pretty partner you've pickled for yourself when she keeps her positive engagement' he besought lady dunstane to console him with a turn she pleaded weariness he proposed to sit beside her and divert her she smiled but warned him that she was english in every vein he interjected 'irish men and english women though it's putting the cart before the horse the copper pennies where the gold guineas should be so here's the gentleman who takes the oyster like the lawyer of the fable english is he but we read the last shall be first and english women and irish men make the finest coupling in the universe' 'well you must submit to see an irish woman led out by an english man' said lady dunstane at the same time informing the obedient diana then bestowing her hand on mr redworth to please her friend that he was a schoolfellow of her husband's 'favour can't help coming by rotation except in very extraordinary circumstances and he was ahead of me with you and takes my due and 'twould be hard on me if i weren't thoroughly indemnified' mr sullivan smith bowed 'you gave them just the start over the frozen minute for conversation they were total strangers and he doesn't appear a bad sort of fellow for a temporary mate though he's not perfectly sure of his legs and that we'll excuse to any man leading out such a fresh young beauty of a bright eyes like the stars of a winter's night in the frosty season over columkill or where you will so that's in ireland to be sure of the likeness to her' 'her mother was half english' 'of course she was and what was my observation about the coupling dan merion would make her irish all over and she has a vein of spanish blood in her for he had and she's got the colour but you spoke of their coupling or i did oh a man can hold his own with an english roly poly mate he's not stifled but a woman hasn't his power of resistance to dead weight she's volatile she's frivolous a rattler and gabbler haven't i heard what they say of irish girls over there she marries and it's the end of her sparkling she must choose at home for a perfect harmonious partner' lady dunstane expressed her opinion that her couple danced excellently together 'it'd be a bitter thing to see if the fellow couldn't dance after leading her out' sighed mr sullivan smith 'i heard of her over there they call her the black pearl and the irish lily because she's dark they rack their poor brains to get the laugh of us' 'and i listen to you' said lady dunstane 'ah if all england half a quarter the smallest piece of the land were like you my lady i'd be loyal to the finger nails now is she engaged when i get a word with her' 'she is nineteen or nearly and she ought to have five good years of freedom i think' 'and five good years of serfdom i'd serve to win her' a look at him under the eyelids assured lady dunstane that there would be small chance for mr sullivan smith after a life of bondage if she knew her diana in spite of his tongue his tact his lively features and breadth of shoulders up he sprang diana was on mr redworth's arm 'no refreshments' she said and 'this is my refreshment' taking the seat of mr sullivan smith who ejaculated 'i must go and have that gentleman's name' he wanted a foe 'you know you are ready to coquette with the general at any moment tony' said her friend 'yes with the general' 'he is a noble old man' 'superb and don't say old man with his uniform and his height and his grey head he is like a glorious october day just before the brown leaves fall' diana hummed a little of the air of planxty kelly the favourite of her childhood as lady dunstane well remembered they smiled together at the scenes and times it recalled 'do you still write verses tony' 'i could about him at one part of the fight he thought he would be beaten he was overmatched in artillery and it was a cavalry charge he thundered on them riding across the field to give the word of command to the couple of regiments riddled to threads that gained the day that is life when we dare death to live i wonder at men who are men being anything but soldiers i told you madre my own emmy i forgave you for marrying because it was a soldier' 'perhaps a soldier is to be the happy man but you have not told me a word of yourself what has been done with the old crossways' 'the house you know is mine and it's all i have ten acres and the house furnished and let for less than two hundred a year oh how i long to evict the tenants they can't have my feeling for the place where i was born they're people of tolerably good connections middling wealthy i suppose of the name of warwick and as far as i can understand they stick there to be near the sussex downs for a nephew who likes to ride on them i've a half engagement barely legible to visit them on an indefinite day and can't bear the idea of strangers masters in the old house i must be driven there for shelter for a roof some month and i could make a pilgrimage in rain or snow just to doat on the outside of it that's your tony' 'she's my darling' 'i hear myself speak but your voice or mine madre it's one soul be sure i am giving up the ghost when i cease to be one soul with you dear and dearest no secrets never a shadow of a deception or else i shall feel i am not fit to live was i a bad correspondent when you were in india' 'pretty well copious letters when you did write' 'i was shy i knew i should be writing to emmy and another and only when i came to the flow could i forget him he is very finely built and i dare say he has a head i read of his deeds in india and quivered but he was just a bit in the way men are the barriers to perfect naturalness at least with girls i think you wrote to me in the same tone as ever and at first i had a struggle to reply and i who have such pride in being always myself' two staring semi circles had formed one to front the hero the other the beauty these half moons imperceptibly dissolved to replenish and became a fixed obstruction 'yes they look' diana made answer to lady dunstane's comment on the curious impertinence she was getting used to it and her friend had a gratification in seeing how little this affected her perfect naturalness 'you are often in the world dinners dances' she said 'people are kind' 'any proposals' 'nibbles' 'quite heart free' 'absolutely' diana's unshadowed bright face defied all menace of an eclipse the block of sturdy gazers began to melt the general had dispersed his group of satellites by a movement with the mayoress on his arm construed as the signal for procession to the supper table chapter iii the interior of mr redworth and the exterior of mr sullivan smith 'it may be as well to take mr redworth's arm you will escape the crush for you' said lady dunstane to diana 'i don't sup yes go you must eat and he is handiest to conduct you' diana thought of her chaperon and the lateness of the hour she murmured to soften her conscience 'poor mrs pettigrew' and once more mr redworth outwardly imperturbable was in the maelstrom of a happiness resembling tempest he talked and knew not what he uttered to give this matchless girl the best to eat and drink was his business and he performed it oddly for a man who had no loaded design marshalling the troops in his active and capacious cranium he fell upon calculations of his income present and prospective while she sat at the table and he stood behind her others were wrangling for places chairs plates glasses game pie champagne she had them the lady under his charge to a certainty would have them so far good and he had seven hundred pounds per annum seven hundred and fifty in a favourable aspect at a stretch 'yes the pleasantest thing to me after working all day is an opera of carini's' she said in full accord with her taste 'and tellio for tenor certainly' a fair enough sum for a bachelor four hundred personal income and a prospect of higher dividends to increase it three hundred odd from his office and no immediate prospects of an increase there no one died there no elderly martyr for the advancement of his juniors could be persuaded to die they were too tough to think of retiring say seven hundred and fifty eight hundred if the commerce of the country fortified the bank his property was embarked in or eight fifty or nine ten 'i could call him my poet also' mr redworth agreed with her taste in poets 'his letters are among the best ever written or ever published the raciest english i know frank straight out capital descriptions the best english letter writers are as good as the french you don't think so in their way of course i dare' say we don't sufficiently cultivate the art we require the supple tongue a closer intercourse of society gives' eight or ten hundred comfortable enough for a man in chambers to dream of entering as a householder on that sum in these days would be stark nonsense and a man two removes from a baronetcy has no right to set his reckoning on deaths if he does he becomes a sort of meditative assassin but what were the fates about when they planted a man of the ability of tom redworth in a government office clearly they intended him to remain a bachelor for life and they sent him over to ireland on inspection duty for a month to have sight of an irish beauty 'think war the finest subject for poets' he exclaimed 'flatly no i don't think it i think exactly the reverse it brings out the noblest traits in human character i won't own that even it brings out some but under excitement when you have not always the real man pray don't sneer at domestic life well there was a suspicion of disdain yes i can respect the hero military or civil with this distinction that the military hero aims at personal reward ' 'he braves wounds and death' interposed diana 'whereas the civilian hero ' 'pardon me let me deny that the soldier hero aims at a personal reward' she again interposed 'he gets it' 'if he is not beaten' 'and then he is no longer a hero' 'he is to me' she had a woman's inveterate admiration of the profession of aims mr redworth endeavoured to render practicable an opening in her mind to reason he admitted the grandeur of the poetry of homer we are a few centuries in advance of homer we do not slay damsels for a sacrifice to propitiate celestial wrath nor do we revel in details of slaughter he reasoned with her he repeated stories known to him of civilian heroes and won her assent to the heroical title for their deeds but it was languid or not so bright as the deeds deserved or as the young lady could look and he insisted on the civilian hero impelled by some unconscious motive to make her see the thing he thought also the thing he was his plain mind and matter of fact nature possibly she caught a glimpse of that after a turn of fencing in which he was impressed by the vibration of her tones when speaking of military heroes she quitted the table saying 'an argument between one at supper and another handing plates is rather unequal if eloquence is needed as pat said to the constable when his hands were tied you beat me with the fists but my spirit is towering and kicks freely' eight hundred a thousand a year two thousand are as nothing in the calculation of a householder who means that the mistress of the house shall have the choicest of the fruits and flowers of the four quarters and thomas redworth had vowed at his first outlook on the world of women that never should one of the sisterhood coming under his charge complain of not having them in profusion consequently he was a settled bachelor in the character of disengaged and unaspiring philosophical bachelor he reviewed the revelations of her character betrayed by the beautiful virgin devoted to the sanguine coat the thrill of her voice in speaking of soldier heroes shot him to the yonder side of a gulf not knowing why for he had no scheme desperate or other in his head the least affrighted of men was frightened by her tastes and by her aplomb her inoffensiveness in freedom of manner and self sufficiency sign of purest breeding and by her easy peerless vivacity her proofs of descent from the blood of dan merion a wildish blood the candour of the look of her eyes in speaking her power of looking forthright at men and looking the thing she spoke and the play of her voluble lips the significant repose of her lips in silence her weighing of the words he uttered for a moment before the prompt apposite reply down to her simple quotation of pat alarmed him he did not ask himself why his manly self was not intruded on his cogitations a mere eight hundred or thousand per annum had no place in that midst he beheld her quietly selecting the position of dignity to suit her an eminent military man or statesman or wealthy nobleman she had but to choose a war would offer her the decorated soldier she wanted a war such are women of this kind the thought revolted him and pricked his appetite for supper he did service by mrs pettigrew to which lady miss merion as she said promoted him at the table and then began to refresh in person standing 'malkin that's the fellow's name' he heard close at his ear mr sullivan smith had drained a champagne glass bottle in hand and was priming the successor to it he cocked his eye at mr redworth's quick stare 'malkin' and now we'll see whether the interior of him is grey or black or tabby or tortoise shell or any other colour of the malkin breed' he explained to mr redworth that he had summoned mr malkin to answer to him as a gentleman for calling miss merion a jilt 'the man sir said in my hearing she jilted him and that's to call the lady a jilt there's not a point of difference not a shade i overheard him i happened by the blessing of providence to be by when he named her publicly jilt and it's enough that she's a lady to have me for her champion the same if she had been an esquimaux squaw i'll never live to hear a lady insulted' 'you don't mean to say you're the donkey to provoke a duel' mr redworth burst out gruffly through turkey and stuffing 'and an irish lady the young beauty of erin' mr sullivan smith was flowing on he became frigid he politely bowed 'two sir if you haven't the grace to withdraw the offensive term before it cools and can't be obliterated' 'fiddle and go to the deuce' mr redworth cried 'would a soft slap o' the cheek persuade you sir' 'try it outside and don't bother me with nonsense of that sort at my supper if i'm struck i strike back i keep my pistols for bandits and law breakers here' said mr redworth better inspired as to the way of treating an ultra of the isle 'touch glasses you're a gentleman and won't disturb good company by and by' the pleasing prospect of by and by renewed in mr sullivan smith his composure they touched the foaming glasses upon which in a friendly manner mr sullivan smith proposed that they should go outside as soon as mr redworth had finished supper quite finished supper for the reason that the term 'donkey' affixed to him was like a minster cap of schooldays ringing bells on his topknot and also that it stuck in his gizzard mr redworth declared the term to be simply hypothetical 'if you fight you're a donkey for doing it but you won't fight' 'but i will fight' 'he won't fight' 'then for the honour of your country you must but i'd rather have him first for i haven't drunk with him and it should be a case of necessity to put a bullet or a couple of inches of steel through the man you've drunk with and what's in your favour she danced with ye she seemed to take to ye and the man she has the smallest sugar melting for is sacred if he's not sweet to me if he retracts' 'hypothetically no' 'but supposititiously' 'certainly' 'then we grasp hands on it it's malkin or nothing' said mr sullivan smith swinging his heel moodily to wander in search of the foe how one sane man could name another a donkey for fighting to clear an innocent young lady's reputation passed his rational conception sir lukin hastened to mr redworth to have a talk over old schooldays and fellows 'i'll tell you what' said the civilian 'there are irishmen and irishmen i've met cool heads and long heads among them and you and i knew jack derry who was good at most things but the burlesque irishman can't be caricatured nature strained herself in a 'fit of absurdity to produce him and all that art can do is to copy' this was his prelude to an account of mr sullivan smith whom as a specimen he rejoiced to have met 'there's a chance of mischief' said sir lukin 'i know nothing of the man he calls malkin i'll inquire presently' he talked of his prospects and of the women fair ones in his opinion besides miss merion were parading he sketched two or three of his partners with a broad brush of epithets 'it won't do for miss merion's name to be mixed up in a duel' said redworth 'not if she's to make her fortune in england' said sir lukin 'it's probably all smoke' the remark had hardly escaped him when a wreath of metaphorical smoke and fire and no mean report startled the company of supping gentlemen at the pitch of his voice mr sullivan smith denounced mr malkin in presence for a cur masquerading as a cat 'and that is not the scoundrel's prime offence for what d' ye think he trumps up an engagement to dance with a beautiful lady and because she can't remember binds her to an oath for a dance to come and then holding her prisoner to 'm he sulks the dirty dogcat goes and sulks and he won't dance and won't do anything but screech up in corners that he's jilted he said the word dozens of gentlemen heard the word and i demand an apology of misterr malkin or and none of your guerrier nodding and bravado mister malkin at me if you please the case is for settlement between gentlemen' the harassed gentleman of the name of malkin driven to extremity by the worrying stood in braced preparation for the english attitude of defence his tormentor drew closer to him 'mind i give you warning if you lay a finger on me i'll knock you down' said he most joyfully mr sullivan smith uttered a low melodious cry 'for a specimen of manners in an assembly of ladies and gentlemen i ask ye' he addressed the ring about him to put his adversary entirely in the wrong before provoking the act of war and then as one intending gently to remonstrate he was on the point of stretching out his finger to the shoulder of mr malkin when redworth seized his arm saying 'i 'm your man me first you're due to me' mr sullivan smith beheld the vanishing of his foe in a cloud of faces now was he wroth on patently reasonable grounds he threatened saxondom man up man down he challenged the race of short legged thickset wooden gated curmudgeons and let it be pugilism if their white livers shivered at the notion of powder and ball redworth in the struggle to haul him away received a blow from him 'and you've got it you would have it' roared the celt 'excuse yourself to the company for a misdirected effort' redworth said and he observed generally 'no irish gentleman strikes a blow in good company' 'but that's true as writ and i offer excuses if you'll come along with me and a couple of friends the thing has been done before by torchlight and neatly' 'come along and come alone' said redworth a way was cleared for them sir lukin hurried up to redworth who had no doubt of his ability to manage mr sullivan smith he managed that fine hearted but purely sensational fellow so well that lady dunstane and diana after hearing in some anxiety of the hubbub below beheld them entering the long saloon amicably with the nods and looks of gentlemen quietly accordant a little later lady dunstane questioned redworth and he smoothed her apprehensions delivering himself much to her comfort thus 'in no case would any lady's name have been raised the whole affair was nonsensical he's a capital fellow of a kind capable of behaving like a man of the world and a gentleman only he has or thinks he has like lots of his countrymen a raw wound something that itches to be grazed champagne on that irishmen as far as i have seen of them are like horses bundles of nerves and you must manage them as you do with all nervous creatures with firmness but good temper you must never get into a fury of the nerves yourself with them spur and whip they don't want they'll be off with you in a jiffy if you try it they want the bridle rein that seems to me the secret of irish character we english are not bad horsemen it's a wonder we blunder so in our management of such a people' 'i wish you were in a position to put your method to the proof' said she he shrugged 'there's little chance of it' to reward him for his practical discretion she contrived that diana should give him a final dance and the beautiful gill smiled quickly responsive to his appeal he was moreover sensible in her look and speech that he had advanced in her consideration to be no longer the mere spinning stick a young lady's partner by which he humbly understood that her friend approved him a gentle delirium enfolded his brain a householder's life is often begun on eight hundred a year on less on much less sometimes on nothing but resolution to make a fitting income carving out a fortune eight hundred may stand as a superior basis that sum is a distinct point of vantage if it does not mean a carriage and parisian millinery and a station for one of the stars of society it means at any rate security and then the heart of the man being strong and sound 'yes' he replied to her 'i like my experience of ireland and the irish and better than i thought i should st george's channel ought to be crossed oftener by both of us' 'i'm always glad of the signal' said diana he had implied the people of the two islands he allowed her interpretation to remain personal for the sake of a creeping deliciousness that it carried through his blood 'shall you soon be returning to england' he ventured to ask 'i am lady dunstane's guest for some months' 'then you will sir lukin has an estate in surrey he talks of quitting the service' 'i can't believe it' his thrilled blood was chilled she entertained a sentiment amounting to adoration for the profession of arms gallantly had the veteran general and hero held on into the night that the festivity might not be dashed by his departure perhaps to a certain degree to prolong his enjoyment of a flattering scene at last sir lukin had the word from him and came to his wife diana slipped across the floor to her accommodating chaperon whom for the sake of another five minutes with her beloved emma she very agreeably persuaded to walk in the train of lord larrian and forth they trooped down a pathway of nodding heads and curtsies resembling oak and birch trees under a tempered gale even to the shedding of leaves for here a turban was picked up by sir lukin there a jewelled ear ring by the self constituted attendant mr thomas redworth at the portico rang a wakening cheer really worth hearing the rain it rained and hats were formless' as in the first conception of the edifice backs were damp boots liquidly musical the pipe of consolation smoked with difficulty with much pulling at the stem but the cheer arose magnificently and multiplied itself touching at the same moment the heavens and diana's heart at least drawing them together for she felt exalted enraptured as proud of her countrymen as of their hero 'that's the natural shamrock after the artificial' she heard mr redworth say behind her she turned and sent one of her brilliant glances flying over him in gratitude for a timely word well said and she never forgot the remark nor he the look chapter iv containing hints of diana's experiences and of what they led to a fortnight after this memorable ball the principal actors of both sexes had crossed the channel back to england and old ireland was left to her rains from above and her undrained bogs below her physical and her mental vapours her ailments and her bog bred doctors as to whom the governing country trusted they would be silent or discourse humorously the residence of sir lukin dunstane in the county of surrey inherited by him during his recent term of indian services was on the hills where a day of italian sky or better a day of our breezy south west washed from the showery night gives distantly a tower to view and a murky web not without colour the ever flying banner of the metropolis the smoke of the city's chimneys if you prefer plain language at a first inspection of the house lady dunstane did not like it and it was advertized to be let and the auctioneer proclaimed it in his dialect her taste was delicate she had the sensitiveness of an invalid twice she read the stalking advertizement of the attractions of copsley and hearing diana call it 'the plush of speech' she shuddered she decided that a place where her husband's family had lived ought not to stand forth meretriciously spangled and daubed like a show booth at a fair for a bait though the grandiloquent man of advertizing letters assured sir lukin that a public agape for the big and gaudy mouthful is in no milder way to be caught as it is apparently the case she withdrew the trumpeting placard retract we likewise 'banner of the metropolis' that plush of speech haunts all efforts to swell and illuminate citizen prose to a princely poetic yet lady dunstane herself could name the bank of smoke when looking north eastward from her summerhouse the flag of london and she was a person of the critical mind well able to distinguish between the simple metaphor and the superobese a year of habitation induced her to conceal her dislike of the place in love cat's love she owned here she confessed to diana she would wish to live to her end it seemed remote where an invigorating upper air gave new bloom to her cheeks but she kept one secret from her friend copsley was an estate of nearly twelve hundred acres extending across the ridge of the hills to the slopes north and south seven counties rolled their backs under this commanding height and it would have tasked a pigeon to fly within an hour the stretch of country visible at the copsley windows sunrise to right sunset leftward the borders of the grounds held both flaming horizons so much of the heavens and of earth is rarely granted to a dwelling the drawback was the structure which had no charm scarce a face 'it is written that i should live in barracks' lady dunstane said the colour of it taught white to impose a sense of gloom her cat's love of the familiar inside corners was never able to embrace the outer walls her sensitiveness too was racked by the presentation of so pitiably ugly a figure to the landscape she likened it to a coarse featured country wench whose cleaning and decorating of her countenance makes complexion grin and ruggedness yawn dirty dilapidated hung with weeds and parasites it would have been more tolerable she tried the effect of various creepers and they were as a staring paint what it was like then she had no heart to say one may however fall on a pleasurable resignation in accepting great indemnities as diana bade her believe when the first disgust began to ebb 'a good hundred over there would think it a paradise for an asylum' she signified london her friend bore such reminders meekly they were readers of books of all sorts political philosophical economical romantic and they mixed the diverse readings in thought after the fashion of the ardently youthful romance affected politics transformed economy irradiated philosophy they discussed the knotty question why things were not done the things being confessedly to do and they cut the knot men men calling themselves statesmen declined to perform that operation because forsooth other men objected to have it performed on them and common humanity declared it to be for the common weal if so then it is clearly indicated as a course of action we shut our eyes against logic and the vaunted laws of economy they are the knot we cut or would cut had we the sword diana did it to the tune of garryowen or planxty kelly o for a despot the cry was for a beneficent despot naturally a large minded benevolent despot in short a despot to obey their bidding thoughtful young people who think through the heart soon come to this conclusion the heart is the beneficent despot they would be he cures those miseries he creates the novel harmony he sees all difficulties through his own sanguine hues he is the musical poet of the problem demanding merely to have it solved that he may sing clear proof of the necessity for solving it immediately thus far in their pursuit of methods for the government of a nation to make it happy diana was leader her fine ardour and resonance and more than the convincing ring of her voice the girl's impassioned rapidity in rushing through any perceptible avenue of the labyrinth or beating down obstacles to form one and coming swiftly to some solution constituted her the chief of the pair of democratic rebels in questions that clamoured for instant solution by dint of reading solid writers using the brains they possessed it was revealed to them gradually that their particular impatience came perhaps of the most earnest desire to get to a comfortable termination of the inquiry the heart aching for mankind sought a nest for itself at this point lady dunstane took the lead diana had to be tugged to follow she could not accept a 'perhaps' that cast dubiousness on her disinterested championship she protested a perfect certainty of the single aim of her heart outward but she reflected she discovered that her friend had gone ahead of her the discovery was reached and even acknowledged before she could persuade herself to swallow the repulsive truth o self self self are we eternally masking in a domino that reveals your hideous old face when we could be most positive we had escaped you eternally the desolating answer knelled nevertheless the poor the starving the overtaxed in labour they have a right to the cry of now now they have and if a cry could conduct us to the secret of aiding healing feeding elevating them we might swell the cry as it is we must lay it on our wits patiently to track and find the secret and meantime do what the individual with his poor pittance can a miserable contribution sighed the girl old self was perceived in the sigh she was haunted after all one must live one's life placing her on a lower pedestal in her self esteem the philosophy of youth revived her and if the abatement of her personal pride was dispiriting she began to see an advantage in getting inward eyes 'it's infinitely better i should know it emmy i'm a reptile pleasure here pleasure there i'm always thinking of pleasure i shall give up thinking and take to drifting neither of us can do more than open purses and mine's lean if the old crossways had no tenant it would be a purse all mouth and charity is haunted like everything we do only i say with my whole strength yes i am sure in spite of the men professing that they are practical the rich will not move without a goad i have and hold you shall hunger and covet until you are strong enough to force my hand that 's the speech of the wealthy and they are christians in name well i thank heaven i'm at war with myself' 'you always manage to strike out a sentence worth remembering tony' said lady dunstane 'at war with ourselves means the best happiness we can have' it suited her frail as her health was and her wisdom striving to the spiritual of happiness war with herself was far from happiness in the bosom of diana she wanted external life action fields for energies to vary the struggle it fretted and rendered her ill at ease in her solitary rides with sir lukin through a long winter season she appalled that excellent but conventionally minded gentleman by starting nay supporting theories next to profane in the consideration of a land owner she spoke of reform of the repeal of the corn laws as the simple beginning of the grants due to the people she had her ideas of course from that fellow redworth an occasional visitor at copsley and a man might be a donkey and think what he pleased since he had a vocabulary to back his opinions a woman sir lukin held was by nature a mute in politics of the thing called a radical woman he could not believe that she was less than monstrous 'with a nose' he said and doubtless horse teeth hatchet jaws slatternly in the gown slipshod awful as for a girl an unmarried handsome girl admittedly beautiful her interjections echoing a man were ridiculous and not a little annoying now and them for she could be piercingly sarcastic her vocabulary in irony was a quiverful he admired her and liked her immensely complaining only of her turn for unfeminine topics he pardoned her on the score of the petty difference rankling between them in reference to his abandonment of his profession for here she was patriotically wrong headed everybody knew that he had sold out in order to look after his estates of copsley and dunena secondly and in the first place to nurse and be a companion to his wife he had left her but four times in five months he had spent just three weeks of that time away from her in london no one could doubt of his having kept his pledge although his wife occupied herself with books and notions and subjects foreign to his taste his understanding too he owned and redworth had approved of his retirement had a contempt for soldiering 'quite as great as yours for civilians i can tell you' sir lukin said dashing out of politics to the vexatious personal subject her unexpressed disdain was ruffling 'mr redworth recommends work he respects the working soldier' said diana sir lukin exclaimed that he had been a working soldier he was ready to serve if his country wanted him he directed her to anathematize peace instead of scorning a fellow for doing the duties next about him and the mention of peace fetched him at a bound back to politics he quoted a distinguished tory orator to the effect that any lengthened term of peace bred maggots in the heads of the people 'mr redworth spoke of it he translated something from aristophanes for a retort' said diana 'well we're friends eh' sir lukin put forth a hand she looked at him surprised at the unnecessary call for a show of friendship she touched his hand with two tips of her fingers remarking 'i should think so indeed' he deemed it prudent to hint to his wife that diana merion appeared to be meditating upon mr redworth 'that is a serious misfortune if true' said lady dunstane she thought so for two reasons mr redworth generally disagreed in opinion with diana and contradicted her so flatly as to produce the impression of his not even sharing the popular admiration of her beauty and further she hoped for diana to make a splendid marriage the nibbles threatened to be snaps and bites there had been a proposal in an epistle a quaint effusion from a gentleman avowing that he had seen her and had not danced with her on the night of the irish ball he was rejected but diana groaned over the task of replying to the unfortunate applicant so as not to wound him 'shall i have to do this often i wonder' she said 'unless you capitulate' said her friend diana's exclamation 'may i be heart free for another ten years' encouraged lady dunstane to suppose her husband quite mistaken in the spring diana went on a first pilgrimage to her old home the crossways and was kindly entertained by the uncle and aunt of a treasured nephew mr augustus warwick she rode with him on the downs a visit of a week humanized her view of the intruders she wrote almost tenderly of her host and hostess to lady dunstane they had but 'the one fault of spoiling their nephew' him she described as a 'gentlemanly official' a picture of him his age was thirty four he seemed 'fond of her scenery' then her pen swept over the downs like a flying horse lady dunstane thought no more of the gentlemanly official he was a barrister who did not practise in nothing the man for diana letters came from the house of the pettigrews in kent from london from halford manor in hertfordshire from lockton grange in lincolnshire after which they ceased to be the thrice weekly and reading the latest of them lady dunstane imagined a flustered quill the letter succeeding the omission contained no excuse and it was brief there was a strange interjection as to the wearifulness of constantly wandering like a leaf off the tree diana spoke of looking for a return of the dear winter days at copsley that was her station either she must have had some disturbing experience or copsley was dear for a redworth reason thought the anxious peruser musing dreaming putting together divers shreds of correspondence and testing them with her intimate knowledge of diana's character lady dunstane conceived that the unprotected beautiful girl had suffered a persecution it might be an insult she spelt over the names of the guests at the houses lord wroxeter was of evil report captain rampan a turf captain had the like notoriety and it is impossible in a great house for the hostess to spread her aegis to cover every dame and damsel present she has to depend on the women being discreet the men civilized 'how brutal men can be' was one of diana's incidental remarks in a subsequent letter relating simply to masculine habits in those days the famous ancestral plea of 'the passion for his charmer' had not been altogether socially quashed down among the provinces where the bottle maintained a sort of sway and the beauty which inflamed the sons of men was held to be in coy expectation of violent effects upon their boiling blood there were one hears that there still are remnants of the pristine male who if resisted in their suing conclude that they are scorned and it infuriates them some also whose 'passion for the charmer' is an instinct to pull down the standard of the sex by a bully imposition of sheer physical ascendancy whenever they see it flying with an air of gallant independence and some who dedicate their lives to a study of the arts of the lord of reptiles until they have worked the crisis for a display of him in person assault or siege they have achieved their triumphs they have dominated a frailer system of nerves and a young woman without father or brother or husband to defend her is cryingly a weak one therefore inviting to such an order of heroes lady dunstane was quick witted and had a talkative husband she knew a little of the upper social world of her time she was heartily glad to have diana by her side again not a word of any serious experience was uttered only on one occasion while they conversed something being mentioned of her tolerance a flush of swarthy crimson shot over diana and she frowned with the outcry 'oh i have discovered that i can be a tigress' her friend pressed her hand saying 'the cause a good one' 'women have to fight' diana said no more there had been a bad experience of her isolated position in the world lady dunstane now indulged a partial hope that mr redworth might see in this unprotected beautiful girl a person worthy of his esteem he had his opportunities and evidently he liked her she appeared to take more cordially to him she valued the sterling nature of the man but they were a hopeless couple they were so friendly both ladies noticed in him an abstractedness of look often when conversing as of a man in calculation they put it down to an ambitious mind yet diana said then and said always that it was he who had first taught her the art of observing on the whole the brilliant marriage seemed a fairer prospect for her how reasonable to anticipate lady dunstane often thought when admiring the advance of diana's beauty in queenliness for never did woman carry her head more grandly more thrillingly make her presence felt and if only she had been an actress showing herself nightly on a london stage she would before now have met the superb appreciation melancholy to reflect upon diana regained her happy composure at copsley she had as she imagined no ambition the dulness of the place conveyed a charm to a nature recovering from disturbance to its clear smooth flow air light books and her friend these good things she had they were all she wanted she rode she walked with sir lukin or mr redworth for companion or with saturday and sunday guests lord larrian her declared admirer among them 'twenty years younger' he said to her shrugging with a merry smile drawn a little at the corners to sober sourness and she vowed to her friend that she would not have had the heart to refuse him 'though' said she 'speaking generally i cannot tell you what a foreign animal a husband would appear in my kingdom' her experience had wakened a sexual aversion of some slight kind enough to make her feminine pride stipulate for perfect independence that she might have the calm out of which imagination spreads wing imagination had become her broader life and on such an earth under such skies a husband who is not the fountain of it certainly is a foreign animal he is a discordant note he contracts the ethereal world deadens radiancy he is gross fact a leash a muzzle harness a hood whatever is detestable to the free limbs and senses it amused lady dunstane to hear diana say one evening when their conversation fell by hazard on her future that the idea of a convent was more welcome to her than the most splendid marriage 'for' she added 'as i am sure i shall never know anything of this love they rattle about and rave about i shall do well to keep to my good single path and i have a warning within me that a step out of it will be a wrong one for me dearest' she wished her view of the yoke to be considered purely personal drawn from no examples and comparisons the excellent sir lukin was passing a great deal of his time in london his wife had not a word of blame for him he was a respectful husband and attentive when present but so uncertain owing to the sudden pressure of engagements that diana bound on a second visit to the crossways doubted whether she would be able to quit her friend whose condition did not allow of her being left solitary at copsley he came nevertheless a day before diana's appointed departure on her round of visits she was pleased with him and let him see it for the encouragement of a husband in the observance of his duties one of the horses had fallen lame so they went out for a walk at lady dunstane's request it was a delicious afternoon of spring with the full red disk of sun dropping behind the brown beech twigs she remembered long afterward the sweet simpleness of her feelings as she took in the scent of wild flowers along the lanes and entered the woods jaws of another monstrous and blackening experience he fell into the sentimental vein and a man coming from that heated london life to these glorified woods might be excused for doing so though it sounded to her just a little ludicrous in him she played tolerantly second to it she quoted a snatch of poetry and his whole face was bent to her with the petition that she would repeat the verse much struck was this giant ex dragoon ah how fine grand he would rather hear that than any opera it was diviner 'yes the best poetry is' she assented 'on your lips' he said she laughed 'i am not a particularly melodious reciter' he vowed he could listen to her eternally eternally his face on a screw of the neck and shoulders was now perpetually three quarters fronting ah she was going to leave 'yes and you will find my return quite early enough' said diana stepping a trifle more briskly his fist was raised on the length of the arm as if in invocation 'not in the whole of london is there a woman worthy to fasten your shoe buckles my oath on it i look i can't spy one' such was his flattering eloquence she told him not to think it necessary to pay her compliments 'and here of all places' they were in the heart of the woods she found her hand seized her waist even then so impossible is it to conceive the unimaginable even when the apparition of it smites us she expected some protesting absurdity or that he had seen something in her path what did she hear and from her friend's husband if stricken idiotic he was a gentleman the tigress she had detected in her composition did not require to be called forth half a dozen words direct sharp as fangs and teeth with the eyes burning over them sufficed for the work of defence 'the man who swore loyalty to emma' her reproachful repulsion of eyes was unmistakeable withering as masterful as a superior force on his muscles what thing had he been taking her for she asked it within and he of himself in a reflective gasp those eyes of hers appeared as in a cloud with the wrath above she had the look of a goddess in anger he stammered pleaded across her flying shoulder oh horrible loathsome pitiable to hear 'a momentary aberration her beauty he deserved to be shot could not help admiring quite lost his head on his honour never again' once in the roadway and copsley visible she checked her arrowy pace for breath and almost commiserated the dejected wretch in her thankfulness to him for silence nothing exonerated him but at least he had the grace not to beg secresy that would have been an intolerable whine of a poltroon adding to her humiliation he abstained he stood at her mercy without appealing she was not the woman to take poor vengeance but oh she was profoundly humiliated shamed through and through the question was i guilty of any lightness anything to bring this on me would not be laid and how she pitied her friend this house her heart's home was now a wreck to her nay worse a hostile citadel the burden of the task of meeting emma with an open face crushed her like very guilt yet she succeeded after an hour in her bedchamber she managed to lock up her heart and summon the sprite of acting to her tongue and features which ready attendant on the suffering female host performed his liveliest throughout the evening to emma's amusement and to the culprit ex dragoon's astonishment in whom to tell the truth of him her sparkle and fun kindled the sense of his being less criminal than he had supposed with a dim vision of himself as the real proven donkey for not having been a harmless dash more so but to be just as well as penetrating this was only the effect of her personal charm on his nature so it spurred him a moment when it struck this doleful man that to have secured one kiss of those fresh and witty sparkling lips he would endure forfeits pangs anything save the hanging of his culprit's head before his emma reflection washed him clean secresy is not a medical restorative by no means a good thing for the baffled amorously adventurous cavalier unless the lady's character shall have been firmly established in or over his hazy wagging noddle reflection informed him that the honourable generous proud girl spared him for the sake of the house she loved after a night of tossing he rose right heartily repentant he showed it in the best manner not dramatically on her accepting his offer to drive her down to the valley to meet the coach a genuine illumination of pure gratitude made a better man of him both to look at and in feeling she did not hesitate to consent and he had half expected a refusal she talked on the way quite as usual cheerfully if not altogether so spiritedly a flash of her matchless wit now and then reduced him to that abject state of man beside the fair person he has treated high cavalierly which one craves permission to describe as pulp he was utterly beaten the sight of redworth on the valley road was a relief to them both he had slept in one of the houses of the valley and spoke of having had the intention to mount to copsley sir lukin proposed to drive him back he glanced at diana still with that calculating abstract air of his and he was rallied he confessed to being absorbed in railways the new lines of railways projected to thread the land and fast mapping it 'you 've not embarked money in them' said sir lukin the answer was 'i have all i possess' and redworth for a sharp instant set his eyes on diana indifferent to sir lukin's bellow of stupefaction at such gambling on the part of a prudent fellow he asked her where she was to be met where written to during the summer in case of his wishing to send her news she replied 'copsley will be the surest i am always in communication with lady dunstane' she coloured deeply the recollection of the change of her feeling for copsley suffused her maiden mind the strange blush prompted an impulse in redworth to speak to her at once of his venture in railways but what would she understand of them as connected with the mighty stake he was playing for he delayed the coach came at a trot of the horses admired by sir lukin round a corner she entered it her maid followed the door banged the horses trotted she was off her destiny of the crossways tied a knot barred a gate and pointed to a new direction of the road on that fine spring morning when beech buds were near the burst cowslips yellowed the meadow flats and skylarks quivered upward for many long years redworth had in his memory for a comment on procrastination and excessive scrupulousness in his calculating faculty the blue back of a coach he declined the vacated place beside sir lukin promising to come and spend a couple of days at copsley in a fortnight saturday week he wanted he said to have a talk with lady dunstane evidently he had railways on the brain and sir lukin warned his wife to be guarded against the speculative mania and advise the man if she could chapter v concerning the scrupulous gentleman who came too late on the saturday of his appointment redworth arrived at copsley with a shade deeper of the calculating look under his thick brows habitual to him latterly he found lady dunstane at her desk pen in hand the paper untouched and there was an appearance of trouble about her somewhat resembling his own as he would have observed had he been open minded enough to notice anything except that she was writing a letter he begged her to continue it he proposed to read a book till she was at leisure 'i have to write and scarcely know how' said she clearing her face to make the guest at home and taking a chair by the fire 'i would rather chat for half an hour' she spoke of the weather frosty but tonic bad for the last days of hunting good for the farmer and the country let us hope redworth nodded assent it might be surmised that he was brooding over those railways in which he had embarked his fortune ah those railways she was not long coming to the wailful exclamation upon them both to express her personal sorrow at the disfigurement of our dear england and lead to a little modest offering of a woman's counsel to the rash adventurer for thus could she serviceably put aside her perplexity awhile those railways when would there be peace in the land where one single nook of shelter and escape from them and the english blunt as their senses are to noise and hubbub would be revelling in hisses shrieks puffings and screeches so that travelling would become an intolerable affliction 'i speak rather as an invalid' she admitted 'i conjure up all sorts of horrors the whistle in the night beneath one's windows and the smoke of trains defacing the landscape hideous accidents too they will be wholesale and past help imagine a collision i have borne many changes with equanimity i pretend to a certain degree of philosophy but this mania for cutting up the land does really cause me to pity those who are to follow us they will not see the england we have seen it will be patched and scored disfigured a sort of barbarous maori visage england in a new zealand mask you may call it the sentimental view in this case i am decidedly sentimental i love my country i do love quiet rural england well and i love beauty i love simplicity all that will be destroyed by the refuse of the towns flooding the land barring accidents as lukin says there seems nothing else to save us' redworth acquiesced 'nothing' 'and you do not regret it' he was asked 'not a bit we have already exchanged opinions on the subject simplicity must go and the townsman meet his equal in the countryman as for beauty i would sacrifice that to circulate gumption a bushelful of nonsense is talked pro and con it always is at an innovation what we are now doing is to take a longer and a quicker stride that is all' 'and establishing a new field for the speculator' 'yes and i am one and this is the matter i wanted to discuss with you lady dunstane' said redworth bending forward the whole man devoted to the point of business she declared she was complimented she felt the compliment and trusted her advice might be useful faintly remarking that she had a woman's head and 'not less' was implied as much as 'not more' in order to give strength to her prospective opposition all his money she heard was down on the railway table he might within a year have a tolerable fortune and of course he might be ruined he did not expect it still he fronted the risks 'and now' said he 'i come to you for counsel i am not held among my acquaintances to be a marrying man as it's called' he paused lady dunstane thought it an occasion to praise him for his considerateness 'you involve no one but yourself you mean' her eyes shed approval 'still the day may come i say only that it may and the wish to marry is a rosy colouring equal to a flying chariot in conducting us across difficulties and obstructions to the deed and then one may have to regret a previous rashness' these practical men are sometimes obtuse she dwelt on that vision of the future he listened and resumed 'my view of marriage is that no man should ask a woman to be his wife unless he is well able to support her in the comforts not to say luxuries she is accustomed to' his gaze had wandered to the desk it fixed there 'that is miss merion's writing' he said 'the letter' said lady dunstane and she stretched out her hand to press down a leaf of it 'yes it is from her' 'is she quite well' 'i suppose she is she does not speak of her health' he looked pertinaciously in the direction of the letter and it was not rightly mannered that letter of all others was covert and sacred to the friend it contained the weightiest of secrets 'i have not written to her' said redworth he was astonishing 'to whom to diana you could very well have done so only i fancy she knows nothing has never given a thought to railway stocks and shares she has a loathing for speculation' 'and speculators too i dare say' 'it is extremely probable' lady dunstane spoke with an emphasis for the man liked diana and would be moved by the idea of forfeiting her esteem 'she might blame me if i did anything dishonourable' 'she certainly would' 'she will have no cause' lady dunstane began to look as at a cloud charged with remote explosions and still for the moment she was unsuspecting but it was a flitting moment when he went on and very singularly droning to her ear 'the more a man loves a woman the more he should be positive before asking her that she will not have to consent to a loss of position and i would rather lose her than fail to give her all not be sure as far as a man can be sure of giving her all i think she's worthy of' then the cloud shot a lightning flash and the doors of her understanding swung wide to the entry of a great wonderment a shock of pain succeeded it her sympathy was roused so acutely that she slipped over the reflective rebuke she would have addressed to her silly delusion concerning his purpose in speaking of his affairs to a woman though he did not mention diana by name diana was clearly the person and why had he delayed to speak to her because of this venture of his money to make him a fortune for the assurance of her future comfort here was the best of men for the girl not displeasing to her a good strong trustworthy man pleasant to hear and to see only erring in being a trifle too scrupulous in love and a fortnight back she would have imagined he had no chance and now she knew that the chance was excellent in those days with this revelation in diana's letter which said that all chance was over 'the courtship of a woman' he droned away 'is in my mind not fair to her until a man has to the full enough to sanction his asking her to marry him and if he throws all he possesses on a stake to win her give her what she has a right to claim he ought only at present the prospect seems good he ought of course to wait well the value of the stock i hold has doubled and it increases i am a careful watcher of the market i have friends brokers and railway directors i can rely on them' 'pray' interposed lady dunstane 'specify i am rather in a mist the exact point upon which you do me the honour to consult me' she ridiculed herself for having imagined that such a man would come to consult her upon a point of business 'it is' he replied 'this whether as affairs now stand with me i have an income from my office and personal property say between thirteen and fourteen hundred a year to start with whether you think me justified in asking a lady to share my lot' 'why not but will you name the lady' 'then i may write at once in your judgement yes the lady i have not named her i had no right besides the general question first in fairness to the petitioner you might reasonably stipulate for more for a friend she could make a match as you have said' he muttered of 'brilliant' and 'the highest' and his humbleness of the honest man enamoured touched lady dunstane she saw him now as the man of strength that she would have selected from a thousand suitors to guide her dear friend she caught at a straw 'tell me it is not diana' 'diana merion' as soon as he had said it he perceived pity and he drew himself tight for the stroke 'she's in love with some one' 'she is engaged' he bore it well he was a big chested fellow and that excruciating twist within of the revolution of the wheels of the brain snapping their course to grind the contrary to that of the heart was revealed in one short lift and gasp a compression of the tremendous change he underwent 'why did you not speak before' said lady dunstane her words were tremulous 'i should have had no justification' 'you might have won her' she could have wept her sympathy and her self condolence under disappointment at diana's conduct joined to swell the feminine flood the poor fellow's quick breathing and blinking reminded her of cruelty in a retrospect she generalized to ease her spirit of regret by hinting it without hurting 'women really are not puppets they are not so excessively luxurious it is good for young women in the early days of marriage to rough it a little' she found herself droning as he had done he had ears for nothing but the fact 'then i am too late' 'i have heard it to day' 'she is engaged positively' lady dunstane glanced backward at the letter on her desk she had to answer the strangest of letters that had ever come to her and it was from her dear tony the baldest intimation of the weightiest piece of intelligence which a woman can communicate to her heart's friend the task of answering it was now doubled 'i fear so i fancy so' she said and she longed to cast eye over the letter again to see if there might possibly be a loophole behind the lines 'then i must make my mind up to it' said redworth 'i think i'll take a walk' she smiled kindly 'it will be our secret' 'i thank you with all my heart lady dunstane' he was not a weaver of phrases in distress his blunt reserve was eloquent of it to her and she liked him the better could have thanked him too for leaving her promptly when she was alone she took in the contents of the letter at a hasty glimpse it was of one paragraph and fired its shot like a cannon with the muzzle at her breast 'my own emmy i have been asked in marriage by mr warwick and have accepted him signify your approval for i have decided that it is the wisest thing a waif can do we are to live at the crossways for four months of the year so i shall have dada in his best days and all my youngest dreams my sunrise and morning dew surrounding me my old home for my new one i write in haste to you first burning to hear from you send your blessing to yours in life and death through all transformations 'tony' that was all not a word of the lover about to be decorated with the title of husband no confession of love nor a single supplicating word to her friend in excuse for the abrupt decision to so grave a step her previous description of him as a 'gentlemanly official' in his appearance conjured him up most distastefully true she might have made a more lamentable choice a silly lordling or a hero of scandals but if a gentlemanly official was of stabler mould he failed to harmonize quite so well with the idea of a creature like tony perhaps mr redworth also failed in something where was the man fitly to mate her mr redworth however was manly and trustworthy of the finest saxon type in build and in character he had great qualities and his excess of scrupulousness was most pitiable she read 'the wisest thing a waif can do' it bore a sound of desperation avowedly tony had accepted him without being in love or was she masking the passion no had it been a case of love she would have written very differently to her friend lady dunstane controlled the pricking of the wound inflicted by diana's novel exercise in laconics where the fullest flow was due to tenderness and despatched felicitations upon the text of the initial line 'wonders are always happening' she wrote to hide vexation beneath surprise naturally betraying it 'i must hope and pray that you have not been precipitate' her curiosity to inspect the happiest of men the most genuine part of her letter was expressed coldly when she had finished the composition she perused it and did not recognize herself in her language though she had been so guarded to cover the wound her tony dealt their friendship in some degree injuring their sex for it might now after such an example verily seem that women are incapable of a translucent perfect confidence their impulses caprices desperations tricks of concealment trip a heart whole friendship well to morrow if not to day the tripping may be expected lady dunstane resigned herself sadly to a lowered view of her tony's character this was her unconscious act of reprisal her brilliant beloved tony dazzling but in beauty and the gifted mind stood as one essentially with the common order of women she wished to be settled mr warwick proposed and for the sake of living at the crossways she accepted him she the lofty scorner of loveless marriages who had said how many times that nothing save love excused it she degraded their mutual high standard of womankind diana was in eclipse full three parts the bulk of the gentlemanly official she had chosen obscured her but i have written very carefully thought lady dunstane dropping her answer into the post bag she had indeed been so care ful that to cloak her feelings she had written as another person women with otiose husbands have a task to preserve friendship redworth carried his burden through the frosty air at a pace to melt icicles in greenland he walked unthinkingly right ahead to the red west as he discovered when pausing to consult his watch time was left to return at the same pace and dress for dinner he swung round and picked up remembrances of sensations he had strewn by the way she knew these woods he was walking in her footprints she was engaged to be married yes his principle never to ask a woman to marry him never to court her without bank book assurance of his ability to support her in cordial comfort was right he maintained it and owned himself a donkey for having stuck to it between him and his excellent principle there was war without the slightest division warned of the danger of losing her he would have done the same again confessing himself donkey for his pains the principle was right because it was due to the woman his rigid adherence to the principle set him belabouring his donkey ribs as the proper due to himself for he might have had a chance all through two winters the opportunities had been numberless here in this beech wood near that thornbush on the juniper slope from the corner of chalk and sand in junction to the corner of clay and chalk all the length of the wooded ridge he had reminders of her presence and his priceless chances and still the standard of his conduct said no while his heart bled he felt that a chance had been more sagacious than lady dunstane from his not nursing a wound he divined in the abruptness of diana's resolution to accept a suitor a sober reason and a fitting one for the wish that she might be settled and had he spoken if he had spoken to her she might have given her hand to him to a dishonourable brute a blissful brute but a worse than donkey yes his principle was right and he lashed with it and prodded with it drove himself out into the sour wilds where bachelordom crops noxious weeds without a hallowing luminary and clung to it bruised and bleeding though he was the gentleness of lady dunstane soothed him during the term of a visit that was rather like purgatory sweetened by angelical tears he was glad to go wretched in having gone she diverted the incessant conflict between his insubordinate self and his castigating but avowedly sovereign principle away from her he was the victim of a flagellation so dire that it almost drove him to revolt against the lord he served and somehow the many memories at copsley kept him away sir lukin when speaking of diana's 'engagement to that fellow warwick' exalted her with an extraordinary enthusiasm exceedingly hard for the silly beast who had lost her to bear for the present the place dearest to redworth of all places on earth was unendurable meanwhile the value of railway investments rose in the market fast as asparagus heads for cutting a circumstance that added stings to reflection had he been only a little bolder a little less the fanatical devotee of his rule of masculine honour less the slave to the letter of success but why reflect at all here was a goodly income approaching perhaps a seat in parliament a station for the airing of his opinions and a social status for the wife now denied to him the wife was denied to him he could conceive of no other the tyrant ridden reticent tenacious creature had thoroughly wedded her in mind her view of things had a throne beside his own even in their differences he perceived agreeing or disagreeing the motions of her brain as he did with none other of women and this it is which stamps character on her divides her from them upraises and enspheres he declined to live with any other of the sex before he could hear of the sort of man mr warwick was a perpetual object of his quest the bridal bells had rung and diana antonia merion lost her maiden name she became the mrs warwick of our footballing world why she married she never told possibly in amazement at herself subsequently she forgot the specific reason that which weighs heavily in youth and commits us to desperate action will be a trifle under older eyes to blunter senses a more enlightened understanding her friend emma probed for the reason vainly it was partly revealed to redworth by guess work and a putting together of pieces yet quite luminously as it were by touch of tentacle feelers one evening that he passed with sir lukin dunstane when the lachrymose ex dragoon and son of idlesse had rather more than dined chapter vi the couple six months a married woman diana came to copsley to introduce her husband they had run over italy 'the italian peninsula' she quoted him in a letter to lady dunstane and were furnishing their london house her first letters from italy appeared to have a little bloom of sentiment augustus was mentioned as liking this and that in the land of beauty he patronized art and it was a pleasure to hear him speak upon pictures and sculptures he knew a great deal about them 'he is an authority' her humour soon began to play round the fortunate man who did not seem to the reader's mind to bear so well a sentimental clothing his pride was in being very english on the continent and diana's instances of his lofty appreciations of the garden of art and nature and statuesque walk through it would have been more amusing if her friend could have harmonized her idea of the couple a description of 'a bit of a wrangle between us' at lucca where an italian post master on a journey of inspection claimed a share of their carriage and audaciously attempted entry was laughable but jarred would she some day lose her relish for ridicule and see him at a distance he was generous diana said she saw fine qualities in him it might be that he was lavish on his bridal tour she said he was unselfish kind affable with his equals he was cordial to the acquaintances he met perhaps his worst fault was an affected superciliousness before the foreigner not uncommon in those days 'you are to know dear emmy that we english are the aristocracy of europeans' lady dunstane inclined to think we were nevertheless in the mouth of a 'gentlemanly official' the frigid arrogance added a stroke of caricature to his deportment on the other hand the reports of him gleaned by sir lukin sounded favourable he was not taken to be preternaturally stiff nor bright but a goodish sort of fellow good horseman good shot good character in short the average englishman excelling as a cavalier a slayer and an orderly subject that was a somewhat elevated standard to the patriotic emma only she would never have stipulated for an average to espouse diana would he understand her and value the best in her another and unanswered question was how could she have condescended to wed with an average there was transparently some secret not confided to her friend he appeared lady dunstane's first impression of him recurred on his departure her unanswered question drummed at her ears though she remembered that tony's art in leading him out had moderated her rigidly judicial summary of the union during a greater part of the visit but his requiring to be led out was against him considering the subjects his talk was passable the subjects treated of politics pictures continental travel our manufactures our wealth and the reasons for it excellent reasons well weighed he was handsome as men go rather tall not too stout precise in the modern fashion of his dress and the pair of whiskers encasing a colourless depression up to a long thin straight nose and closed lips indicating an aperture the contraction of his mouth expressed an intelligence in the attitude of the firmly negative the lips opened to smile the teeth were faultless an effect was produced if a cold one the colder for the unparticipating northern eyes eyes of that half cloud and blue which make a kind of hueless grey and are chiefly striking in an authoritative stage without contradicting for he was exactly polite his look signified a person conscious of being born to command in fine an aristocrat among the 'aristocracy of europeans' his differences of opinion were prefaced by a 'pardon me' and pausing smile of the teeth then a succinctly worded sentence or two a perfect settlement of the dispute he disliked argumentation he said so and diana remarked it of him speaking as a wife who merely noted a characteristic inside his boundary he had neat phrases opinions in packets beyond it apparently the world was void of any particular interest sir lukin whose boundary would have shown a narrower limitation had it been defined stood no chance with him tory versus whig he tried a wrestle and was thrown they agreed on the topic of wine mr warwick had a fine taste in wine their after dinner sittings were devoted to this and the alliterative cognate theme equally dear to the gallant ex dragoon from which it resulted that lady dunstane received satisfactory information in a man's judgement of him 'warwick is a clever fellow and a thorough man of the world i can tell you emmy' sir lukin further observed that he was a gentlemanly fellow 'a gentlemanly official' diana's primary dash of portraiture stuck to him so true it was as for her she seemed to have forgotten it not only did she strive to show him to advantage by leading him out she played second to him subserviently fondly she quite submerged herself content to be dull if he might shine and her talk of her husband in her friend's blue chamber boudoir of the golden stars where they had discussed the world and taken counsel in her maiden days implied admiration of his merits he rode superbly he knew law he was prepared for any position he could speak really eloquently she had heard him at a local meeting and he loved the old crossways almost as much as she did 'he has promised me he will never ask me to sell it' she said with a simpleness that could hardly have been acted when she was gone lady dunstane thought she had worn a mask in the natural manner of women trying to make the best of their choice and she excused her poor tony for the artful presentation of him at her own cost but she could not excuse her for having married the man her first and her final impression likened him to a house locked up and empty a london house conventionally furnished and decorated by the upholsterer and empty of inhabitants how a brilliant and beautiful girl could have committed this rashness was the perplexing riddle the knottier because the man was idle and diana had ambition she despised and dreaded idleness in men empty of inhabitants even to the ghost both human and spiritual were wanting the mind contemplating him became reflectively stagnant i must not be unjust lady dunstane hastened to exclaim at a whisper that he had at least proved his appreciation of tony whom he preferred to call diana as she gladly remembered and the two were bound together for a moment warmly by her recollection of her beloved tony's touching little petition 'you will invite us again' and then there had flashed in tony's dear dark eyes the look of their old love drowning they were not to be thought of separately she admitted that the introduction to a woman of her friend's husband is crucially trying to him he may well show worse than he is yet his appreciation of tony in espousing her was rather marred by sir lukin's report of him as a desperate admirer of beautiful woman it might be for her beauty only not for her spiritual qualities at present he did not seem aware of their existence but to be entirely just she had hardly exhibited them or a sign of them during the first interview and sitting with his hostess alone he had seized the occasion to say that he was the happiest of men he said it with the nearest approach to fervour she had noticed perhaps the very fact of his not producing a highly favourable impression should be set to plead on his behalf such as he was he was himself no simulator she longed for mr redworth's report of him her compassion for redworth's feelings when beholding the woman he loved another man's wife did not soften the urgency of her injunction that he should go speedily and see as much of them as he could 'because' she gave her reason 'i wish diana to know she has not lost a single friend through her marriage and is only one the richer' redworth buckled himself to the task he belonged to the class of his countrymen who have a dungeon vault for feelings that should not be suffered to cry abroad and into this oubliette he cast them letting them feed as they might or perish it was his heart down below and in no voluntary musings did he listen to it to sustain the thing grimly lord of himself he stood emotionless before the world some worthy fellows resemble him and they are called deep hearted he was dungeon deep the prisoner underneath might clamour and leap none heard him or knew of him nor did he ever view the day diana's frank 'ah mr redworth how glad i am to see you' was met by the calmest formalism of the wish for her happiness he became a guest at her london house and his report of the domesticity there and notably of the lord of the house pleased lady dunstane more than her husband's he saw the kind of man accurately as far as men are to be seen on the surface and she could say assentingly without anxiety 'yes yes' to his remarks upon mr warwick indicative of a man of capable head in worldly affairs commonplace beside his wife the noble gentleman for diana was yet unborn they tacitly agreed meantime one must not put a mortal husband to the fiery ordeal of his wife's deserts they agreed likewise 'you may be sure she is a constant friend' lady dunstane said for his comfort and she reminded herself subsequently of a shade of disappointment at his imperturbable rejoinder 'i could calculate on it' for though not at all desiring to witness the sentimental fit she wished to see that he held an image of diana surely a woman to kindle poets and heroes the princes of the race and it was a curious perversity that the two men she had moved were merely excellent emotionless ordinary men with heads for business elsewhere out of england diana would have been a woman for a place in song exalted to the skies here she had the destiny to inflame mr redworth and mr warwick two railway directors bent upon scoring the country to the likeness of a child's lines of hop scotch in a gravel yard as with all invalids the pleasure of living backward was haunted by the tortures it evoked and two years later she recalled this outcry against the fates she would then have prayed for diana to inflame none but such men as those two the original error was of course that rash and most inexplicable marriage a step never alluded to by the driven victim of it lady dunstane heard rumours of dissensions diana did not mention them she spoke of her husband as unlucky in railway ventures and of a household necessity for money nothing further one day she wrote of a government appointment her husband had received ending the letter 'so there is the end of our troubles' her friend rejoiced and afterward looking back at her satisfaction saw the dire beginning of them lord dannisburgh's name as one of the admirers of mrs warwick was dropped once or twice by sir lukin he had dined with the warwicks and met the eminent member of the cabinet at their table there is no harm in admiration especially on the part of one of a crowd observing a star no harm can be imputed when the husband of a beautiful woman accepts an appointment from the potent minister admiring her so lady dunstane thought for she was sure of diana to her inmost soul but she soon perceived in sir lukin that the old dog world was preparing to yelp on a scent he of his nature belonged to the hunting pack and with a cordial feeling for the quarry he was quite with his world in expecting to see her run and readiness to join the chase no great scandal had occurred for several months the world was in want of it and he too with a very cordial feeling for the quarry piously hoping she would escape already had his nose to ground collecting testimony in the track of her he said little to his wife but his world was getting so noisy that he could not help half pursing his lips as with the soft whistle of an innuendo at the heels of it redworth was in america engaged in carving up that hemisphere she had no source of information but her husband's chance gossip and london was death to her and diana writing faithfully twice a week kept silence as to lord dannisburgh except in naming him among her guests she wrote this which might have a secret personal signification 'we women are the verbs passive of the alliance we have to learn and if we take to activity with the best intentions we conjugate a frightful disturbance we are to run on lines like the steam trains or we come to no station dash to fragments i have the misfortune to know i was born an active i take my chance' once she coupled the names of lord larrian and lord dannisburgh remarking that she had a fatal attraction for antiques the death of her husband's uncle and illness of his aunt withdrew her to the crossways where she remained nursing for several months reading diligently as her letters showed and watching the approaches of the destroyer she wrote like her former self subdued by meditation in the presence of that inevitable the world ceased barking lady dunstane could suppose mr warwick to have now a reconciling experience of his wife's noble qualities he probably did value them more he spoke of her to sir lukin in london with commendation 'she is an attentive nurse' he inherited a considerable increase of income when he and his wife were the sole tenants of the crossways but disliking the house for reasons hard to explain by a man previously professing to share her attachment to it he wished to sell or let the place and his wife would do neither she proposed to continue living in their small london house rather than be cut off from the crossways which he said was ludicrous people should live up to their position and he sneered at the place and slightly wounded her for she was open to a wound when the cold fire of a renewed attempt at warmth between them was crackling and showing bits of flame after she had given proof of her power to serve service to himself and his relatives affected him he deferred to her craze for the crossways and they lived in a larger london house 'up to their position' which means ever a trifle beyond it and gave choice dinner parties to the most eminent his jealousy slumbered having ideas of a seat in parliament at this period and preferment superior to the post he held mr warwick deemed it sagacious to court the potent patron lord dannisburgh could be and his wife had his interests at heart the fork tongued world said the cry revived stories of lord d and mrs w whipped the hot pursuit the moral repute of the great whig lord and the beauty of the lady composed inflammable material 'are you altogether cautious' lady dunstane wrote to diana and her friend sent a copious reply 'you have the fullest right to ask your tony anything and i will answer as at the judgement bar you allude to lord dannisburgh he is near what dada's age would have been and is i think i can affirm next to my dead father and my emmy my dearest friend i love him i could say it in the streets without shame and you do not imagine me shameless whatever his character in his younger days he can be honestly a woman's friend believe me i see straight to his heart he has no disguise and unless i am to suppose that marriage is the end of me i must keep him among my treasures i see him almost daily it is not possible to think i can be deceived and as long as he does me the honour to esteem my poor portion of brains by coming to me for what he is good enough to call my counsel i shall let the world wag its tongue between ourselves i trust to be doing some good i know i am of use in various ways no doubt there is a danger of a woman's head being turned when she reflects that a powerful minister governing a kingdom has not considered her too insignificant to advise him and i am sensible of it i am i assure you dearest on my guard against it that would not attach me to him as his homely friendliness does he is the most amiable cheerful benignant of men he has no feeling of an enemy though naturally his enemies are numerous and venomous he is full of observation and humour how he would amuse you in many respects accord with you and i should not have a spark of jealousy some day i shall beg permission to bring him to copsley at present during the session he is too busy as you know me his crystal spring of wisdom he can favour with no more than an hour in the afternoon or a few minutes at night or i get a pencilled note from the benches of the house with an anecdote or news of a division i am sure to be enlivened 'so i have written to you fully simply frankly have perfect faith in your tony who would she vows to heaven die rather than disturb it and her heart's beloved' the letter terminated with one of lord dannisburgh's anecdotes exciting to merriment in the season of its freshness and a postscript of information 'augustus expects a mission about a month uncertain whether i accompany him' mr warwick departed on his mission diana remained in london lady dunstane wrote entreating her to pass the month her favourite time of the violet yielding to the cowslip at copsley the invitation could not be accepted but the next day diana sent word that she had a surprise for the following sunday and would bring a friend to lunch if sir lukin would meet them at the corner of the road in the valley leading up to the heights at a stated hour lady dunstane gave the listless baronet his directions observing 'it's odd she never will come alone since her marriage' 'queer' said he of the serenest absence of conscience and that there must be something not entirely right going on he strongly inclined to think chapter vii the crisis it was a confirmed suspicion when he beheld lord dannisburgh on the box of a four in hand and the peerless diana beside him cockaded lackeys in plain livery and the lady's maid to the rear but lord dannisburgh's visit was a compliment and the freak of his driving down under the beams of aurora on a sober sunday morning capital fun so with a gaiety that was kept alive for the invalid emma to partake of it they rattled away to the heights and climbed them and diana rushed to the arms of her friend whispering and cooing for pardon if she startled her guilty of a little whiff of blarney lord dannisburgh wanted so much to be introduced to her and she so much wanted her to know him and she hoped to be graciously excused for thus bringing them together 'that she might be chorus to them' chorus was a pretty fiction on the part of the thrilling and topping voice she was the very radiant diana of her earliest opening day both in look and speech a queenly comrade and a spirit leaping and shining like a mountain water she did not seduce she ravished the judgement was taken captive and flowed with her as to the prank of the visit emma heartily enjoyed it and hugged it for a holiday of her own and doating on the beautiful darkeyed fresh creature who bore the name of the divine huntress she thought her a true dian in stature step and attributes the genius of laughter superadded none else on earth so sweetly laughed none so spontaneously victoriously provoked the healthful openness her delicious chatter and her museful sparkle in listening equally quickened every sense of life adorable as she was to her friend emma at all times she that day struck a new fountain in memory and it was pleasant to see the great lord's admiration of this wonder one could firmly believe in their friendship and his winning ideas from the abounding bubbling well a recurrent smile beamed on his face when hearing and observing her certain dishes provided at the table were diana's favourites and he relished them asking for a second help and remarking that her taste was good in that as in all things they lunched eating like boys they walked over the grounds of copsley and into the lanes and across the meadows of the cowslip rattling chatting enlivening the frosty air happy as children biting to the juices of ripe apples off the tree but tony was the tree the dispenser of the rosy gifts she had a moment of reflection only a moment and emma felt the pause as though a cloud had shadowed them and a spirit had been shut away both spoke of their happiness at the kiss of parting that melancholy note at the top of the wave to human hearts conscious of its enforced decline was repeated by them and diana's eyelids blinked to dismiss a tear 'you have no troubles' emma said 'only the pain of the good bye to my beloved' said diana 'i have never been happier never shall be now you know him you think with me i knew you would you have seen him as he always is except when he is armed for battle he is the kindest of souls and soul i say he is the one man among men who gives me notions of a soul in men' the eulogy was exalted lady dunstane made a little mouth for oh in correction of the transcendental touch though she remembered their foregone conversations upon men strange beings that they are and understood diana's meaning 'really really honour' diana emphasized her extravagant praise to print it fast 'hear him speak of ireland' 'would he not speak of ireland in a tone to catch the irishwoman' 'he is past thoughts of catching dearest at that age men are pools of fish or what you will they are not anglers next year if you invite us we will come again' 'but you will come to stay in the winter' 'certainly but i am speaking of one of my holidays' they kissed fervently the lady mounted the grey and portly lord followed her sir lukin flourished his whip and emma was left to brood over her friend's last words 'one of my holidays' not a hint to the detriment of her husband had passed the stray beam balefully illuminating her marriage slipped from her involuntarily sir lukin was troublesome with his ejaculations that evening and kept speculating on the time of the arrival of the four in hand in london upon which he thought a great deal depended they had driven out of town early and if they drove back late they would not be seen as all the cacklers were sure then to be dressing for dinner and he would not pass the clubs 'i couldn't suggest it' he said 'but dannisburgh's an old hand but they say he snaps his fingers at tattle and laughs well it doesn't matter for him perhaps but a game of two oh it'll be all right they can't reach london before dusk and the cat's away' 'it's more than ever incomprehensible to me how she could have married that man' said his wife 'i've long since given it up' said he diana wrote her thanks for the delightful welcome telling of her drive home to smoke and solitude with a new host of romantic sensations to keep her company she wrote thrice in the week and the same addition of one to the ordinary number next week then for three weeks not a line sir lukin brought news from london that warwick had returned nothing to explain the silence a letter addressed to the crossways was likewise unnoticed the supposition that they must be visiting on a round appeared rational but many weeks elapsed until sir lukin received a printed sheet in the superscription of a former military comrade who had marked a paragraph it was one of those journals now barely credible dedicated to the putrid of the upper circle wherein initials raised sewer lamps and asmodeus lifted a roof leering hideously thousands detested it and fattened their crops on it domesticated beasts of superior habits to the common will indulge themselves with a luxurious roll in carrion for a revival of their original instincts society was largely a purchaser the ghastly thing was dreaded as a scourge hailed as a refreshment nourished as a parasite it professed undaunted honesty and operated in the fashion of the worms bred of decay success was its boasted justification the animal world when not rigorously watched will always crown with success the machine supplying its appetites the old dog world took signal from it the one legged devil god waved his wooden hoof and the creatures in view the hunt was uproarious why should we seem better than we are down with hypocrisy cried the censor morum spicing the lamentable derelictions of this and that great person male and female the plea of corruption of blood in the world to excuse the public chafing of a grievous itch is not less old than sin and it offers a merry day of frisky truant running to the animal made unashamed by another and another stripped branded and stretched flat sir lukin read of mr and mrs w and a distinguished peer of the realm the paragraph was brief it had a flavour promise of more to come pricked curiosity he read it enraged feeling for his wife and again indignant feeling for diana his third reading found him out he felt for both but as a member of the whispering world much behind the scenes he had a longing for the promised insinuations just to know what they could say or dared say the paper was not shown to lady dunstane a run to london put him in the tide of the broken dam of gossip the names were openly spoken and swept from mouth to mouth of the scandalmongers gathering matter as they flew he knocked at diana's door where he was informed that the mistress of the house was absent more than official gravity accompanied the announcement her address was unknown sir lukin thought it now time to tell his wife he began with a hesitating circumlocution in order to prepare her mind for bad news she divined immediately that it concerned diana and forcing him to speak to the point she had the story jerked out to her in a sentence it stopped her heart the chill of death was tasted in that wavering ascent from oblivion to recollection why had not diana come to her she asked herself and asked her husband who as usual was absolutely unable to say under compulsory squeezing he would have answered that she did not come because she could not fib so easily to her bosom friend and this he thought notwithstanding his personal experience of diana's generosity but he had other personal experiences of her sex and her sex plucked at the bright star and drowned it the happy day of lord dannisburgh's visit settled in emma's belief as the cause of mr warwick's unpardonable suspicions and cruelty arguing from her own sensations of a day that had been like the return of sweet health to her frame she could see nothing but the loveliest freakish innocence in diana's conduct and she recalled her looks her words every fleeting gesture even to the ingenuousness of the noble statesman's admiration of her for the confusion of her unmanly and unworthy husband and emma was nevertheless a thoughtful person only her heart was at the head of her thoughts and led the file whose reasoning was accurate on erratic tracks all night her heart went at fever pace she brought the repentant husband to his knees and then doubted strongly doubted whether she would whether in consideration for her friend she could intercede with diana to forgive him in the morning she slept heavily sir lukin had gone to london early for further tidings she awoke about midday and found a letter on her pillow it was diana's then while her fingers eagerly tore it open her heart the champion rider over night sank it needed support of facts and feared them not in distrust of that dear persecuted soul but because the very bravest of hearts is of its nature a shivering defender sensitive in the presence of any hostile array much craving for material support until the mind and spirit displace it depute it to second them instead of leading she read by a dull november fog light a mixture of the dreadful and the comforting and dwelt upon the latter in abandonment hugged it though conscious of evil and the little that there was to veritably console the close of the letter struck the blow after bluntly stating that mr warwick had served her with a process and that he had no case without suborning witnesses diana said 'but i leave the case and him to the world ireland or else america it is a guiltless kind of suicide to bury myself abroad he has my letters they are such as i can own to you and ask you to kiss me and kiss me when you have heard all the evidence all that i can add to it kiss me you know me too well to think i would ask you to kiss criminal lips but i cannot face the world in the dock yes not where i am expected to smile and sparkle on pain of incurring suspicion if i show a sign of oppression i cannot do that i see myself wearing a false grin your tony no i do well to go this is my resolution and in consequence my beloved my only truly loved on earth i do not come to you to grieve you as i surely should nor would it soothe me dearest this will be to you the best of reasons it could not soothe me to see myself giving pain to emma i am like a pestilence and let me swing away to the desert for there i do no harm i know i am right i have questioned myself it is not cowardice i do not quail i abhor the part of actress i should do it well too well destroy my soul in the performance is a good name before such a world as this worth that sacrifice a convent and self quenching cloisters would seem to me like holy dew but that would be sleep and i feel the powers of life never have i felt them so mightily if it were not for being called on to act and mew i would stay fight meet a bayonet hedge of charges and rebut them i have my natural weapons and my cause it must be confessed that i have also more knowledge of men and the secret contempt it must be the best of them entertain for us oh and we confirm it if we trust them but they have been at a wicked school 'i will write from whatever place you shall have letters and constant i write no more now in my present mood i find no alternative between rageing and drivelling i am henceforth dead to the world never dead to emma till my breath is gone poor flame i blow at a bed room candle by which i write in a brown fog and behold what i am though not even serving to write such a tangled scrawl as this i am of no mortal service in two days i shall be out of england within a week you shall hear where i long for your heart on mine your dear eyes you have faith in me and i fly from you i must be mad yet i feel calmly reasonable i know that this is the thing to do some years hence a grey woman may return to hear of a butterfly diana that had her day and disappeared better than a mewing and courtseying simulacrum of the woman i drivel again adieu i suppose i am not liable to capture and imprisonment until the day when my name is cited to appear i have left london this letter and i quit the scene by different routes i would they were one my beloved i have an ache i think i am wronging you i am not mistress of myself and do as something within me wiser than i dictates you will write kindly write your whole heart it is not compassion i want i want you i can bear stripes from you let me hear emma's voice the true voice this running away merits your reproaches it will look like i have more to confess the tigress in me wishes it were i should then have a reckless passion to fold me about and the glory infernal if you name it so and so it would be of suffering for and with some one else as it is i am utterly solitary sustained neither from above nor below except within myself and that is all fire and smoke like their new engines i kiss this miserable sheet of paper yes i judge that i have run off a line and what a line which hardly shows a trace for breathing things to follow until they feel the transgression in wreck how immensely nature seems to prefer men to women but this paper is happier than the writer 'your tony' that was the end emma kissed it in tears they had often talked of the possibility of a classic friendship between women the alliance of a mutual devotedness men choose to doubt of she caught herself accusing tony of the lapse from friendship hither should the true friend have flown unerringly the blunt ending of the letter likewise dealt a wound she reperused it perused and meditated the flight of mrs warwick she heard that cry fatal but she had no means of putting a hand on her 'your tony' the coldness might be set down to exhaustion it might yet her not coming to her friend for counsel and love was a positive weight in the indifferent scale she read the letter backwards and by snatches here and there many perusals and hours passed before the scattered creature exhibited in its pages came to her out of the flying threads of the web as her living tony whom she loved and prized and was ready to defend gainst the world by that time the fog had lifted she saw the sky on the borders of milky cloudfolds her invalid's chill sensitiveness conceived a sympathy in the baring heavens and lying on her sofa in the drawing room she gained strength of meditative vision weak though she was to help through ceasing to brood on her wound and herself she cast herself into her dear tony's feelings and thus it came that she imagined tony would visit the crossways where she kept souvenirs of her father his cane and his writing desk and a precious miniature of him hanging above it before leaving england forever the fancy sprang to certainty every speculation confirmed it had sir lukin been at home she would have despatched him to the crossways at once the west wind blew and gave her a view of the downs beyond the weald from her southern window she thought it even possible to drive there and reach the place on the chance of her vivid suggestion some time after nightfall but a walk across the room to try her forces was too convincing of her inability she walked with an ebony silver mounted stick a present from mr redworth she was leaning on it when the card of thomas redworth was handed to her chapter viii in which is exhibited how a practical man and a divining woman learn to respect one another 'you see you are my crutch' lady dunstane said to him raising the stick in reminder of the present he offered his arm and hurriedly informed her to dispose of dull personal matter that he had just landed she looked at the clock 'lukin is in town you know the song alas i scarce can go or creep while lukin is away i do not doubt you have succeeded in your business over there ah now i suppose you have confidence in your success i should have predicted it had you come to me' she stood either musing or in weakness and said abruptly 'will you object to lunching at one o'clock' 'the sooner the better' said redworth she had sighed her voice betrayed some agitation strange in so serenely minded a person his partial acquaintance with the herculean sir lukin's reputation in town inspired a fear of his being about to receive admission to the distressful confidences of the wife and he asked if mrs warwick was well the answer sounded ominous with its accompaniment of evident pain 'i think her health is good' had they quarrelled he said he had not heard a word of mrs warwick for several months 'i heard from her this morning' said lady dunstane and motioned him to a chair beside the sofa where she half reclined closing her eyes the sight of tears on the eyelashes frightened him she roused herself to look at the clock 'providence or accident you are here' she said 'i could not have prayed for the coming of a truer' man mrs warwick is in great danger you know our love she is the best of me heart and soul her husband has chosen to act on vile suspicions baseless i could hold my hand in the fire and swear she has enemies or the jealous fury is on the man i know little of him he has commenced an action against her he will rue it but she you understand this of women at least they are not cowards in all things but the horror of facing a public scandal my poor girl writes of the hatefulness of having to act the complacent put on her accustomed self she would have to go about a mark for the talkers and behave as if nothing were in the air full of darts oh that general whisper it makes a coup de massue a gale to sink the bravest vessel and a woman must preserve her smoothest front chat smile or else well she shrinks from it i should too she is leaving the country' 'wrong' cried redworth 'wrong indeed she writes that in two days she will be out of it judge her as i do though you are a man i pray you have seen the hunted hare it is our education we have something of the hare in us when the hounds are full cry our bravest our best have an impulse to run by this poor wat far off upon a hill shakespeare would have the divine comprehension i have thought all round it and come back to him she is one of shakespeare's women another character but one of his own another hermione i dream of him seeing her with that eye of steady flame the bravest and best of us at bay in the world need an eye like his to read deep and not be baffled by inconsistencies' insensibly redworth blinked his consciousness of an exalted compassion for the lady was heated by these flights of advocacy to feel that he was almost seated beside the sovereign poet thus eulogized and he was of a modest nature 'but you are practical' pursued lady dunstane observing signs that she took for impatience 'you are thinking of what can be done if lukin were here i would send him to the crossways without a moment's delay on the chance the mere chance it shines to me if i were only a little stronger i fear i might break down and it would be unfair to my husband he has trouble enough with my premature infirmities already i am certain she will go to the crossways tony is one of the women who burn to give last kisses to things they love and she has her little treasures hoarded there she was born there her father died there she is three parts irish superstitious in affection i know her so well at this moment i see her there if not she has grown unlike herself' 'have you a stout horse in the stables' redworth asked 'you remember the mare bertha you have ridden her' 'the mare would do and better than a dozen horses' he consulted his watch 'let me mount bertha i engage to deliver a letter at the crossways to night' lady dunstane half inclined to act hesitation in accepting the aid she sought but said 'will you find your way' he spoke of three hours of daylight and a moon to rise 'she has often pointed out to me from your ridges where the crossways lies about three miles from the downs near a village named storling on the road to brasted the house has a small plantation of firs behind it and a bit of river rare for sussex to the right an old straggling red brick house at crossways a stone's throw from a fingerpost on a square of green roads to brasted london wickford riddlehurst i shall find it write what you have to say my lady and confide it to me she shall have it to night if she's where you suppose i 'll go with your permission and take a look at the mare sussex roads are heavy in this damp weather and the frost coming on won't improve them for a tired beast we haven't our rails laid down there yet' 'you make me admit some virtues in the practical' said lady dunstane and had the poor fellow vollied forth a tale of the everlastingness of his passion for diana it would have touched her far less than his exact memory of diana's description of her loved birthplace she wrote 'i trust my messenger to tell you how i hang on you i see my ship making for the rocks you break your emma's heart it will be the second wrong step i shall not survive it the threat has made me incapable of rushing to you as i might have had strength to do yesterday i am shattered and i wait panting for mr redworth's return with you he has called by accident as we say trust to him if ever heaven was active to avert a fatal mischance it is to day you will not stand against my supplication it is my life i cry for i have no more time he starts he leaves me to pray like the mother seeing her child on the edge of the cliff come this is your breast my tony and your soul warns you it is right to come do rightly scorn other counsel the coward's come with our friend the one man known to me who can be a friend of women 'your emma' redworth was in the room 'the mare 'll do it well' he said 'she has had her feed and in five minutes will be saddled at the door' 'but you must eat dear friend' said the hostess 'i'll munch at a packet of sandwiches on the way there seems a chance and the time for lunching may miss it' 'you understand' 'everything i fancy' 'if she is there' 'one break in the run will turn her back' the sensitive invalid felt a blow in his following up the simile of the hunted hare for her friend but it had a promise of hopefulness and this was all that could be done by earthly agents under direction of spiritual as her imagination encouraged her to believe she saw him start after fortifying him with a tumbler of choice bordeaux thinking how tony would have said she was like a lady arming her knight for battle on the back of the mare he passed her window after lifting his hat and he thumped at his breast pocket to show her where the letter housed safely the packet of provision bulged on his hip absurdly and blessedly to her sight not unlike the man in his combination of robust serviceable qualities as she reflected during the later hours until the sun fell on smouldering november woods and sensations of the frost he foretold bade her remember that he had gone forth riding like a huntsman his great coat lay on a chair in the hall and his travelling bag was beside it he had carried it up from the valley expecting hospitality and she had sent him forth half naked to weather a frosty november night she called in the groom whose derision of a great coat for any gentleman upon bertha meaning work for the mare appeased her remorsefulness brisby the groom reckoned how long the mare would take to do the distance to storling with a rider like mr redworth on her back by seven brisby calculated mr redworth would be knocking at the door of the three ravens inn at storling when the mare would have a decent grooming and mr redworth was not the gentleman to let her be fed out of his eye more than that brisby had some acquaintance with the people of the inn he begged to inform her ladyship that he was half a sussex man though not exactly born in the county his parents had removed to sussex after the great event and the downs were his first field of horse exercise and no place in the world was like them fair weather or foul summer or winter and snow ten feet deep in the gullies the grandest air in england he had heard say his mistress kept him to the discourse for the comfort of hearing hard bald matter of fact and she was amused and rebuked by his assumption that she must be entertaining an anxiety about master's favourite mare but ah that diana had delayed in choosing a mate had avoided her disastrous union with perhaps a more imposing man to see the true beauty of masculine character in mr redworth as he showed himself to day how could he have doubted succeeding one grain more of faith in his energy and diana might have been mated to the right husband for her an open minded clear faced english gentleman her speculative ethereal mind clung to bald matter of fact to day she would have vowed that it was the sole potentially heroical even brisby partook of the reflected rays and he was very benevolently considered by her she dismissed him only when his recounting of the stages of bertha's journey began to fatigue her and deaden the medical efficacy of him and his like stretched on the sofa she watched the early sinking sun in south western cloud and the changes from saffron to intensest crimson the crown of a november evening and one of frost redworth struck on a southward line from chalk ridge to sand where he had a pleasant footing in familiar country under beeches that browned the ways along beside a meadowbrook fed by the heights through pines and across deep sand ruts to full view of weald and downs diana had been with him here in her maiden days the coloured back of a coach put an end to that dream he lightened his pocket surveying the land as he munched a favourable land for rails and she had looked over it and he was now becoming a wealthy man and she was a married woman straining the leash his errand would not bear examination it seemed such a desperate long shot he shut his inner vision on it and pricked forward when the burning sunset shot waves above the juniper and yews behind him he was far on the weald trotting down an interminable road that the people opposing railways were not people of business was his reflection and it returned persistently for practical men even the most devoted among them will think for themselves their army which is the rational calls them to its banners in opposition to the sentimental and redworth joined it in the abstract summoning the horrible state of the roads to testify against an enemy wanting almost in common humaneness a slip of his excellent stepper in one of the half frozen pits of the highway was the principal cause of his confusion of logic she was half on her knees beyond the market town the roads were so bad that he quitted them and with the indifference of an engineer struck a line of his own southeastward over fields and ditches favoured by a round horizon moon on his left so for a couple of hours he went ahead over rolling fallow land to the meadow flats and a pale shining of freshets then hit on a lane skirting the water and reached an amphibious village five miles from storling he was informed and a clear traverse of lanes not to be mistaken 'if he kept a sharp eye open' the sharpness of his eyes was divided between the sword belt of the starry hunter and the shifting lanes that zig tagged his course below the downs were softly illumined still it amazed him to think of a woman like diana warwick having an attachment to this district so hard of yield mucky featureless fit but for the rails she sided with her friend in detesting reasonable women too the moon stood high on her march as he entered storling he led his good beast to the stables of the three ravens thanking her and caressing her the ostler conjectured from the look of the mare that he had been out with the hounds and lost his way it appeared to redworth singularly that near the ending of a wild goose chase his plight was pretty well described by the fellow however he had to knock at the door of the crossways now in the silent night time a certainly empty house to his fancy he fed on a snack of cold meat and tea standing and set forth clearly directed 'if he kept a sharp eye open' hitherto he had proved his capacity and he rather smiled at the repetition of the formula to him of all men a turning to the right was taken one to the left and through the churchyard out of the gate round to the right and on by this route after an hour he found himself passing beneath the bare chestnuts of the churchyard wall of storling and the sparkle of the edges of the dead chestnut leaves at his feet reminded him of the very ideas he had entertained when treading them the loss of an hour strung him to pursue the chase in earnest and he had a beating of the heart as he thought that it might be serious he recollected thinking it so at copsley the long ride and nightfall with nothing in view had obscured his mind to the possible behind the thick obstruction of the probable again the possible waved its marsh light to help in saving her from a fatal step supposing a dozen combinations of the conditional mood became his fixed object since here he was of that there was no doubt and he was not here to play the fool though the errand were foolish he entered the churchyard crossed the shadow of the tower and hastened along the path fancying he beheld a couple of figures vanishing before him he shouted he hoped to obtain directions from these natives the moon was bright the gravestones legible but no answer came back and the place appeared to belong entirely to the dead 'i've frightened them' he thought they left a queerish sensation in his frame a ride down to sussex to see ghosts would be an odd experience but an undigested dinner of tea is the very grandmother of ghosts and he accused it of confusing him sight and mind out of the gate now for the turning to the right and on he turned he must have previously turned wrongly somewhere and where a light in a cottage invited him to apply for the needed directions the door was opened by a woman who had never heard tell of the crossways nor had her husband nor any of the children crowding round them a voice within ejaculated 'crassways' and soon upon the grating of a chair an old man whom the woman named her lodger by way of introduction presented himself with his hat on saying 'i knows the spot they calls crassways' and he led redworth understood the intention that a job was to be made of it and submitting said 'to the right i think' he was bidden to come along if he wanted 'they crassways' and from the right they turned to the left and further sharp round and on to a turn where the old man otherwise incommunicative said 'there down thik theer road and a post in the middle' 'i want a house not a post' roared redworth spying a bare space the old man despatched a finger travelling to his nob 'naw there's ne'er a house but that's crassways for four roads if it 's crassways you wants' they journeyed backward they were in such a maze of lanes that the old man was master and redworth vowed to be rid of him at the first cottage this however they were long in reaching and the old man was promptly through the garden gate hailing the people and securing 'information before redworth could well hear he smiled at the dogged astuteness of a dense headed old creature determined to establish a claim to his fee they struck a lane sharp to the left 'you're sussex' redworth asked him and was answered 'naw the sheers' emerging from deliberation the old man said 'ah'm a hampshireman' 'a capital county' 'heigh' the old man heaved his chest 'once' 'why what has happened to it' 'once it were a capital county i say hah you asks me what have happened to it you take and go and look at it now and down heer'll be no better soon i tells 'em when ah was a boy old hampshire was a proud country wi' the old coaches and the old squires and harvest homes and christmas merryings cutting up the land there's no pride in livin' theer nor anywhere as i sees now' 'you mean the railways' 'it's the devil come up and abroad ower all england' exclaimed the melancholy ancient patriot a little cheering was tried on him but vainly he saw with unerring distinctness the triumph of the foul potentate nay his personal appearance 'in they theer puffin' engines' the country which had produced andrew hedger as he stated his name to be would never show the same old cricketing commons it did when he was a boy old england he declared was done for when redworth applied to his watch under the brilliant moonbeams he discovered that he had been listening to this natural outcry of a decaying and shunted class full three quarters of an hour and the crossways was not in sight he remonstrated the old man plodded along 'we must do as we're directed' he said further walking brought them to a turn any turn seemed hopeful another turn offered the welcome sight of a blazing doorway on a rise of ground off the road approaching it the old man requested him to 'bide a bit' and stalked the ascent at long strides a vigorous old fellow redworth waited below observing how he joined the group at the lighted door and as it was apparent put his question of the whereabout of the crossways finally in extreme impatience he walked up to the group of spectators they were all and andrew hedger among them the most entranced and profoundly reverent observing the dissection of a pig unable to awaken his hearing redworth jogged his arm and the shake was ineffective until it grew in force 'i've no time to lose have they told you the way' andrew hedger yielded his arm he slowly withdrew his intent fond gaze from the fair outstretched white carcase and with drooping eyelids he said 'ah could eat hog a solid hower' he had forgotten to ask the way intoxicated by the aspect of the pig and when he did ask it he was hard of understanding given wholly to his last glimpses redworth got the directions he would have dismissed mr andrew hedger but there was no doing so 'i'll show ye on to the crossways house' the latter said implying that he had already earned something by showing him the crossways post 'hog's my feed' said andrew hedger the gastric springs of eloquence moved him to discourse and he unburdened himself between succulent pauses 'they've killed him early he 's fat and he might ha' been fatter but he's fat they've got their christmas ready that they have lord you should see the chitterlings and the sausages hung up to and along the beams that's a crown for any dwellin' they runs 'em round the top of the room it's like a may day wreath in old times home fed hog they've a treat in store they have and snap your fingers at the world for many a long day and the hams they cure their own hams at that house old style that's what i say of a hog he's good from end to end and beats a christian hollow everybody knows it and owns it' redworth was getting tired in sympathy with current conversation he said a word for the railways they would certainly make the flesh of swine cheaper bring a heap of hams into the market but andrew hedger remarked with contempt that he had not much opinion of foreign hams nobody knew what they fed on hog he said would feed on anything where there was no choice they had wonderful stomachs for food only when they had a choice they left the worst for last and home fed filled them with stuff to make good meat and fat 'what we calls prime bacon' as it is not right to damp a native enthusiasm redworth let him dilate on his theme and mused on his boast to eat hog a solid hour which roused some distant classic recollection an odd jumble they crossed the wooden bridge of a flooded stream 'now ye have it' said the hog worshipper 'that may be the house i reckon' a dark mass of building with the moon behind it shining in spires through a mound of firs met redworth's gaze the windows all were blind no smoke rose from the chimneys he noted the dusky square of green and the finger post signalling the centre of the four roads andrew hedger repeated that it was the crossways house ne'er a doubt redworth paid him his expected fee whereupon andrew shouldering off wished him a hearty good night and forthwith departed at high pedestrian pace manifestly to have a concluding look at the beloved anatomy there stood the house absolutely empty thought redworth the sound of the gate bell he rang was like an echo to him the gate was unlocked he felt a return of his queer churchyard sensation when walking up the garden path in the shadow of the house here she was born here her father died and this was the station of her dreams as a girl at school near london and in paris her heart was here he looked at the windows facing the downs with dead eyes the vivid idea of her was a phantom presence and cold assuring him that the bodily diana was absent had lady dunstane guessed rightly he might perhaps have been of service anticipating the blank silence he rang the house bell it seemed to set wagging a weariful tongue in a corpse the bell did its duty to the last note and one thin revival stroke for a finish as in days when it responded livingly to the guest he pulled and had the reply just the same with the faint terminal touch resembling exactly a 'there' at the close of a voluble delivery in the negative absolutely empty he pulled and pulled the bell wagged wagged this had been a house of a witty host a merry girl junketting guests a house of hilarious thunders lightnings of fun and fancy death never seemed more voiceful than in that wagging of the bell for conscience' sake as became a trusty emissary he walked round to the back of the house to verify the total emptiness his apprehensive despondency had said that it was absolutely empty but upon consideration he supposed the house must have some guardian likely enough an old gardener and his wife lost in deafness double shotted by sleep there was no sign of them the night air waxed sensibly crisper he thumped the backdoors blank hollowness retorted on the blow he banged and kicked the violent altercation with wood and wall lasted several minutes ending as it had begun flesh may worry but is sure to be worsted in such an argument 'well my dear lady' redworth addressed lady dunstane aloud while driving his hands into his pockets for warmth 'we've done what we could the next best thing is to go to bed and see what morning brings us' the temptation to glance at the wild divinings of dreamy witted women from the point of view of the practical man was aided by the intense frigidity of the atmosphere in leading him to criticize a sex not much used to the exercise of brains 'and they hate railways' he associated them in the matter of intelligence with andrew hedger and company they sank to the level of the temperature in his esteem as regarded their intellects he approved their warmth of heart the nipping of the victim's toes and finger tips testified powerfully to that round to the front of the house at a trot he stood in moonlight then for involuntarily he now did everything running with a dash up the steps he seized the sullen pendant bell handle and worked it pumpwise till he perceived a smaller bell knob beside the door at which he worked piston wise pump and piston the hurly burly and the tinkler created an alarm to scare cat and mouse and cardinal spider all that run or weave in desolate houses with the good result of a certain degree of heat to his frame he ceased panting no stir within nor light that white stare of windows at the moon was undisturbed the downs were like a wavy robe of shadowy grey silk no wonder that she had loved to look on them and it was no wonder that andrew hedger enjoyed prime bacon bacon frizzling fat rashers of real homefed on the fire none of your foreign suggested a genial refreshment and resistance to antagonistic elements nor was it granting health granting a sharp night the temperature at least fifteen below zero an excessive boast for a man to say he could go on eating for a solid hour these were notions darting through a half nourished gentleman nipped in the frame by a severely frosty night truly a most beautiful night she would have delighted to see it here the downs were like floating islands like fairy laden vapours solid as andrew hedger's hour of eating visionary as too often his desire redworth muttered to himself after taking the picture of the house and surrounding country from the sward that he thought it about the sharpest night he had ever encountered in england he was cold hungry dispirited and astoundingly stricken with an incapacity to separate any of his thoughts from old andrew hedger nature was at her pranks upon him he left the garden briskly as to the legs and reluctantly he would have liked to know whether diana had recently visited the house or was expected it could be learnt in the morning but his mission was urgent and he on the wings of it he was vexed and saddened scarcely had he closed the garden gate when the noise of an opening window arrested him and he called the answer was in a feminine voice youngish not disagreeable though not diana's he heard none of the words but rejoined in a bawl 'mrs warwick mr redworth' that was loud enough for the deaf or the dead the window closed he went to the door and waited it swung wide to him and o marvel of a woman's divination of a woman there stood diana chapter ix shows how a position of delicacy for a lady and gentleman was met in simple fashion without hurt to either redworth's impulse was to laugh for very gladness of heart as he proffered excuses for his tremendous alarums and in doing so the worthy gentleman imagined he must have persisted in clamouring for admission because he suspected that if at home she would require a violent summons to betray herself it was necessary to him to follow his abashed sagacity up to the mark of his happy animation 'had i known it was you' said diana bidding him enter the passage she wore a black silk mantilla and was warmly covered she called to her maid danvers whom redworth remembered a firm woman of about forty wrapped like her mistress in head covering cloak scarf and shawl telling her to scour the kitchen for firewood diana led into a sitting room 'i need not ask you have come from lady dunstane' she said 'is she well' 'she is deeply anxious' 'you are cold empty houses are colder than out of doors you shall soon have a fire' she begged him to be seated the small glow of candle light made her dark rich colouring orange in shadow 'house and grounds are open to a tenant' she resumed 'i say good bye to them to morrow morning the old couple who are in charge sleep in the village to night i did not want them here you have quitted the government service i think' 'a year or so since' 'when did you return from america' 'two days back' 'and paid your visit to copsley immediately' 'as early as i could' 'that was true friendliness you have a letter for me' 'i have' he put his hand to his pocket for the letter 'presently' she said she divined the contents and nursed her resolution to withstand them danvers had brought firewood and coal orders were given to her and in spite of the opposition of the maid and intervention of the gentleman diana knelt at the grate observing 'allow me to do this i can lay and light a fire' he was obliged to look on she was a woman who spoke her meaning she knelt handling paper firewood and matches like a housemaid danvers proceeded on her mission and redworth eyed diana in the first fire glow he could have imagined a madonna on an old black spanish canvas the act of service was beautiful in gracefulness and her simplicity in doing the work touched it spiritually he thought as she knelt there that never had he seen how lovely and how charged with mystery her features were the dark large eyes full on the brows the proud line of a straight nose in right measure to the bow of the lips reposeful red lips shut and their curve of the slumber smile at the corners her forehead was broad the chin of a sufficient firmness to sustain that noble square the brows marked by a soft thick brush to the temples her black hair plainly drawn along her head to the knot revealed by the mantilla fallen on her neck elegant in plainness the classic poet would have said of her hair and dress she was of the women whose wits are quick in everything they do that which was proper to her position complexion and the hour surely marked her appearance unaccountably this night the fair fleshly presence over weighted her intellectual distinction to an observer bent on vindicating her innocence or rather he saw the hidden in the visible owner of such a woman and to lose her redworth pitied the husband the crackling flames reddened her whole person gazing he remembered lady dunstane saying of her once that in anger she had the nostrils of a war horse the nostrils now were faintly alive under some sensitive impression of her musings the olive cheeks pale as she stood in the doorway were flushed by the fire beams though no longer with their swarthy central rose tropic flower of a pure and abounding blood as it had seemed she was now beset by battle his pity for her and his eager championship overwhelmed the spirit of compassion for the foolish wretched husband dolt the man must be redworth thought and he asked inwardly did the miserable tyrant suppose of a woman like this that she would be content to shine as a candle in a grated lanthorn the generosity of men speculating upon other men's possessions is known yet the man who loves a woman has to the full the husband's jealousy of her good name and a lover that without the claims of the alliance can be wounded on her behalf is less distracted in his homage by the personal luminary to which man's manufacture of balm and incense is mainly drawn when his love is wounded that contemplation of her incomparable beauty with the multitude of his ideas fluttering round it did somewhat shake the personal luminary in redworth he was conscious of pangs the question bit him how far had she been indiscreet or wilful and the bite of it was a keen acid to his nerves a woman doubted by her husband is always and even to her champions in the first hours of the noxious rumour until they had solidified in confidence through service a creature of the wilds marked for our ancient running nay more than a cynical world these latter will be sensible of it the doubt casts her forth the general yelp drags her down she runs like the prey of the forest under spotting branches clear if we can think so but it has to be thought in devotedness her character is abroad redworth bore a strong resemblance to his fellowmen except for his power of faith in this woman nevertheless it required the superbness of her beauty and the contrasting charm of her humble posture of kneeling by the fire to set him on his right track of mind he knew and was sure of her he dispersed the unhallowed fry in attendance upon any stirring of the reptile part of us to look at her with the eyes of a friend and if a little mouse of a thought scampered out of one of the chambers of his head and darted along the passages fetching a sweat to his brows well whatsoever the fact his heart was hers he hoped he could be charitable to women she rose from her knees and said 'now please give me the letter' he was entreated to excuse her for consigning him to firelight when she left the room danvers brought in a dismal tallow candle remarking that her mistress had not expected visitors her mistress had nothing but tea and bread and butter to offer him danvers uttered no complaint of her sufferings happy in being the picture of them 'i'm not hungry' said he a plate of andrew hedger's own would not have tempted him the foolish frizzle of bacon sang in his ears as he walked from end to end of the room an illusion of his fancy pricked by a frost edged appetite but the anticipated contest with diana checked and numbed the craving was warwick a man to proceed to extremities on a mad suspicion what kind of proof had he redworth summoned the portrait of mr warwick before him and beheld a sweeping of close eyes in cloud a long upper lip in cloud the rest of him was all cloud as usual with these conjurations of a face the index of the nature conceived by him displayed itself and no more but he took it for the whole physiognomy and pronounced of the husband thus delineated that those close eyes of the long upper lip would both suspect and proceed madly he was invited by danvers to enter the dining room there diana joined him 'the best of a dinner on bread and butter is that one is ready for supper soon after it' she said swimming to the tea tray 'you have dined' 'at the inn' he replied 'the three ravens when my father's guests from london flooded the crossways the three ravens provided the overflow with beds on nights like this i have got up and scraped the frost from my window panes to see them step into the old fly singing some song of his the inn had a good reputation for hospitality in those days i hope they treated you well' 'excellently' said redworth taking an enormous mouthful while his heart sank to see that she who smiled to encourage his eating had been weeping but she also consumed her bread and butter 'that poor maid of mine is an instance of a woman able to do things against the grain' she said 'danvers is a foster child of luxury she loves it great houses plentiful meals and the crowd of twinkling footmen's calves yet you see her here in a desolate house consenting to cold and i know not what terrors of ghosts poor soul i have some mysterious attraction for her she would not let me come alone i should have had to hire some old storling grannam or retain the tattling keepers of the house she loves her native country too and disdains the foreigner my tea you may trust' redworth had not a doubt of it he was becoming a tea taster the merit of warmth pertained to the beverage 'i think you get your tea from scoppin's in the city' he said that was the warehouse for mrs warwick's tea they conversed of teas the black the green the mixtures each thinking of the attack to come and the defence meantime the cut bread and butter having flown redwerth attacked the loaf he apologized 'oh pay me a practical compliment' diana said and looked really happy at his unfeigned relish of her simple fare she had given him one opportunity in speaking of her maid's love of native country but it came too early 'they say that bread and butter is fattening' he remarked 'you preserve the mean' said she he admitted that his health was good for some little time to his vexation at the absurdity she kept him talking of himself so flowing was she and so sweet the motion of her mouth in utterance that he followed her lead and he said odd things and corrected them he had to describe his ride to her 'yes the view of the downs from dewhurst' she exclaimed 'or any point along the ridge emma and i once drove there in summer with clotted cream from her dairy and we bought fresh plucked wortleberries and stewed them in a hollow of the furzes and ate them with ground biscuits and the clotted cream iced and thought it a luncheon for seraphs then you dropped to the road round under the sand heights and meditated railways' 'just a notion or two' 'you have been very successful in america' 'successful perhaps we exclude extremes in our calculations of the still problematical' 'i am sure' said she 'you always have faith in your calculations' her innocent archness dealt him a stab sharper than any he had known since the day of his hearing of her engagement he muttered of his calculations being human he was as much of a fool as other men more 'oh no' said she 'positively' 'i cannot think it' 'i know it' 'mr redworth you will never persuade me to believe it' he knocked a rising groan on the head and rejoined 'i hope i may not have to say so to night' diana felt the edge of the dart 'and meditating railways you scored our poor land of herds and flocks and night fell and the moon sprang up and on you came it was clever of you to find your way by the moonbeams' 'that's about the one thing i seem fit for' 'but what delusion is this in the mind of a man succeeding in everything he does' cried diana curious despite her wariness 'is there to be the revelation of a hairshirt ultimately a journal of confessions you succeeded in everything you aimed at and broke your heart over one chance miss' 'my heart is not of the stuff to break' he said and laughed off her fortuitous thrust straight into it 'another cup yes i came' 'by night' said she 'and cleverly found your way and dined at the three ravens and walked to the crossways and met no ghosts' 'on the contrary or at least i saw a couple' 'tell me of them we breed them here we sell them periodically to the newspapers' 'well i started them in their natal locality i saw them going down the churchyard and bellowed after them with all my lungs i wanted directions to the crossways i had missed my way at some turning in an instant they were vapour' diana smiled 'it was indeed a voice to startle delicate apparitions so do roar hyrcanean tigers pyramus and thisbe slaying lions one of your ghosts carried a loaf of bread and dropped it in fright one carried a pound of fresh butter for home consumption they were in the churchyard for one in passing to kneel at her father's grave and kiss his tombstone' she bowed her head forgetful of her guard the pause presented an opening redworth left his chair and walked to the mantelpiece it was easier to him to speak not facing her 'you have read lady dunstane's letter' he began she nodded 'i have' 'can you resist her appeal to you' 'i must' 'she is not in a condition to bear it well you will pardon me mrs warwick' 'fully fully' 'i venture to offer merely practical advice you have thought of it all but have not felt it in these cases the one thing to do is to make a stand lady dunstane has a clear head she sees what has to be endured by you consider she appeals to me to bring you her letter would she have chosen me or any man for her messenger if it had not appeared to her a matter of life and death you count me among your friends' 'one of the truest' 'here are two then and your own good sense for i do not believe it to be a question of courage' 'he has commenced let him carry it out' said diana her desperation could have added the cry and give me freedom that was the secret in her heart she had struck on the hope for the detested yoke to be broken at any cost 'i decline to meet his charges i despise them if my friends have faith in me and they may i want nothing more' 'well i won't talk commonplaces about the world' said redworth 'we can none of us afford to have it against us consider a moment to your friends you are the diana merion they knew and they will not suffer an injury to your good name without a struggle but if you fly you leave the dearest you have to the whole brunt of it 'they will if they love me' 'they will but think of the shock to her lady dunstane reads you ' 'not quite no not if she even wishes me to stay' said diana he was too intent on his pleading to perceive a signification 'she reads you as clearly in the dark as if you were present with her' 'oh why am i not ten years older' diana cried and tried to face round to him and stopped paralyzed 'ten years older i could discuss my situation as an old woman of the world and use my wits to defend myself' 'and then you would not dream of flight before it' 'no she does not read me no she saw that i might come to the crossways she no one but myself can see the wisdom of my holding aloof in contempt of this baseness' 'and of allowing her to sink under that which your presence would arrest her strength will not support it' 'emma oh cruel' diana sprang up to give play to her limbs she dropped on another chair 'go i must i cannot turn back she saw my old attachment to this place it was not difficult to guess who but i can see the wisest course for me' 'it comes to this that the blow aimed at you in your absence will strike her and mortally' said redworth 'then i say it is terrible to have a friend' said diana with her bosom heaving 'friendship i fancy means one heart between two' his unstressed observation hit a bell in her head and set it reverberating she and emma had spoken written the very words she drew forth her emma's letter from under her left breast and read some half blinded lines redworth immediately prepared to leave her to her feelings trustier guides than her judgement in this crisis 'adieu for the night mrs warwick' he said and was guilty of eulogizing the judgement he thought erratic for the moment 'night is a calm adviser let me presume to come again in the morning i dare not go back without you' she looked up as they faced together each saw that the other had passed through a furnace scorching enough to him though hers was the delicacy exposed the reflection had its weight with her during the night 'danvers is getting ready a bed for you she is airing linen' diana said but the bed was declined and the hospitality was not pressed the offer of it seemed to him significant of an unwary cordiality and thoughtlessness of tattlers that might account possibly for many things supposing a fool or madman or malignants to interpret them 'then good night' said she they joined hands he exacted no promise that she would be present in the morning to receive him and it was a consolation to her desire for freedom until she reflected on the perfect confidence it implied and felt as a quivering butterfly impalpably pinned chapter x the conflict of the night her brain was a steam wheel throughout the night everything that could be thought of was tossed nothing grasped the unfriendliness of the friends who sought to retain her recurred for look to fly could not be interpreted as a flight it was but a stepping aside a disdain of defending herself and a wrapping herself in her dignity women would be with her she called on the noblest of them to justify the course she chose and they did in an almost audible murmur and o the rich reward a black archway gate swung open to the glittering fields of freedom emma was not of the chorus emma meditated as an invalid how often had emma bewailed to her that the most grievous burden of her malady was her fatal tendency to brood sickly upon human complications she could not see the blessedness of the prospect of freedom to a woman abominably yoked what if a miserable woman were dragged through mire to reach it married the mire was her portion whatever she might do that man but pass him and that other the dear the kind careless high hearted old friend he could honestly protest his guiltlessness and would smilingly leave the case to go its ways of this she was sure that her decision and her pleasure would be his they were tied to the stake she had already tasted some of the mortal agony did it matter whether the flames consumed her reflecting on the interview with redworth though she had performed her part in it placidly her skin burned it was the beginning of tortures if she stayed in england by staying to defend herself she forfeited her attitude of dignity and lost all chance of her reward and name the sort of world it is dear friends for which we are to sacrifice our one hope of freedom that we may preserve our fair fame in it diana cried aloud 'my freedom' feeling as a butterfly flown out of a box to stretches of sunny earth beneath spacious heavens her bitter marriage joyless in all its chapters indefensible where the man was right as well as where insensately wrong had been imprisonment she excused him down to his last madness if only the bonds were broken here too in this very house of her happiness with her father she had bound herself to the man voluntarily quite inexplicably voluntarily as we say but there must be a spell upon us at times upon young women there certainly is the wild brain of diana armed by her later enlightenment as to the laws of life and nature dashed in revolt at the laws of the world when she thought of the forces natural and social urging young women to marry and be bound to the end it should be a spotless world which is thus ruthless but were the world impeccable it would behave more generously the world is ruthless dear friends because the world is hypocrite the world cannot afford to be magnanimous or even just her dissensions with her husband their differences of opinion and puny wranglings hoistings of two standards reconciliations for the sake of decency breaches of the truce and his detested meanness the man behind the mask and glimpses of herself too the half known half suspected developing creature claiming to be diana and unlike her dreamed diana deformed by marriage irritable acerb rebellious constantly justifiable against him but not in her own mind and therefore accusing him of the double crime of provoking her and perverting her these were the troops defiling through her head while she did battle with the hypocrite world one painful sting was caused by the feeling that she could have loved whom an ideal had he the imagined but unvisioned been her yoke fellow would she now lie raising caged beast cries in execration of the yoke she would not now be seeing herself as hare serpent tigress the hypothesis was reviewed in negatives she had barely a sense of softness just a single little heave of the bosom quivering upward and leadenly sinking when she glanced at a married diana heartily mated the regrets of the youthful for a life sailing away under medical sentence of death in the sad eyes of relatives resemble it she could have loved good bye to that a woman's brutallest tussle with the world was upon her she was in the arena of the savage claws flung there by the man who of all others should have protected her from them and what had she done to deserve it she listened to the advocate pleading her case she primed him to admit the charges to say the worst in contempt of legal prudence and thereby expose her transparent honesty the very things awakening a mad suspicion proved her innocence but was she this utterly simple person oh no she was the diana of the pride in her power of fencing with evil by no means of the order of those ninny young women who realize the popular conception of the purely innocent she had fenced and kept her guard of this it was her angry glory to have the knowledge but she had been compelled to fence such are men in the world of facts that when a woman steps out of her domestic tangle to assert because it is a tangle her rights to partial independence they sight her for their prey or at least they complacently suppose her accessible wretched at home a woman ought to bury herself in her wretchedness else may she be assured that not the cleverest wariest guard will cover her character against the husband her cause was triumphant against herself she decided not to plead it for this reason that the preceding court which was the public and only positive one had entirely and justly exonerated her but the holding of her hand by the friend half a minute too long for friendship and the over friendliness of looks letters frequency of visits would speak within her she had a darting view of her husband's estimation of them in his present mood she quenched it they were trifles things that women of the world have to combat the revelation to a fair minded young woman of the majority of men being naught other than men and some of the friendliest of men betraying confidence under the excuse of temptation is one of the shocks to simplicity which leave her the alternative of misanthropy or philosophy diana had not the heart to hate her kind so she resigned herself to pardon and to the recognition of the state of duel between the sexes active enough in her sphere of society the circle hummed with it many lived for it could she pretend to ignore it her personal experience might have instigated a less clear and less intrepid nature to take advantage of the opportunity for playing the popular innocent who runs about with astonished eyes to find herself in so hunting a world and wins general compassion if not shelter in unsuspected and unlicenced places there is perpetually the inducement to act the hypocrite before the hypocrite world unless a woman submits to be the humbly knitting housewife unquestioningly worshipful of her lord for the world is ever gracious to an hypocrisy that pays homage to the mask of virtue by copying it the world is hostile to the face of an innocence not conventionally simpering and quite surprised the world prefers decorum to honesty 'let me be myself whatever the martyrdom' she cried in that phase of young sensation when to the blooming woman the putting on of a mask appears to wither her and reduce her to the show she parades yet in common with her sisterhood she owned she had worn a sort of mask the world demands it of them as the price of their station that she had never worn it consentingly was the plea for now casting it off altogether showing herself as she was accepting martyrdom becoming the first martyr of the modern woman's cause a grand position and one imaginable to an excited mind in the dark which does not conjure a critical humour as light does to correct the feverish sublimity she was then this martyr a woman capable of telling the world she knew it and of confessing that she had behaved in disdain of its rigider rules according to her own ideas of her immunities o brave but was she holding the position by flight it involved the challenge of consequences not an evasion of them she moaned her mental steam wheel stopped fatigue brought sleep she had sensationally led her rebellious wits to the crossways distilling much poison from thoughts on the way and there for the luxury of a still seeming indecision she sank into oblivion chapter xi recounts the journey in a chariot with a certain amount of dialogue and a small incident on the road in the morning the fight was over she looked at the signpost of the crossways whilst dressing and submitted to follow obediently as a puppet the road recommended by friends though a voice within that she took for the intimations of her reason protested that they were wrong that they were judging of her case in the general and unwisely disastrously for her the mistaking of her desires for her reasons was peculiar to her situation 'so i suppose i shall some day see the crossways again' she said to conceive a compensation in the abandonment of freedom the night's red vision of martyrdom was reserved to console her secretly among the unopened lockers in her treasury of thoughts it helped to sustain her and she was too conscious of things necessary for her sustainment to bring it to the light of day and examine it she had a pitiful bit of pleasure in the gratification she imparted to danvers by informing her that the journey of the day was backward to copsley 'if i may venture to say so ma'am i am very glad' said her maid 'you must be prepared for the questions of lawyers danvers' 'oh ma'am they'll get nothing out of me and their wigs won't frighten me' 'it is usually their baldness that is most frightening my poor danvers' 'nor their baldness ma'am' said the literal maid 'i never cared for their heads or them i've been in a case before' 'indeed' exclaimed her mistress and she had a chill danvers mentioned a notorious case adding 'they got nothing out of me' 'in my case you will please to speak the truth' said diana and beheld in the looking glass the primming of her maid's mouth the sight shot a sting 'understand that there is to be no hesitation about telling the truth of what you know of me' said diana and the answer was 'no ma'am' for danvers could remark to herself that she knew little and was not a person to hesitate she was a maid of the world with the quality of faithfulness by nature to a good mistress redworth's further difficulties were confined to the hiring of a conveyance for the travellers and hot water bottles together with a postillion not addicted to drunkenness he procured a posting chariot an ancient and musty of a late autumnal yellow unrefreshed by paint the only bottles to be had were dutch schiedam his postillion inspected at storling carried the flag of habitual inebriation on his nose and he deemed it adviseable to ride the mare in accompaniment as far as riddlehurst notwithstanding the postillion's vows upon his honour that he was no drinker the emphasis to a gentleman acquainted with his countrymen was not reassuring he had hopes of enlisting a trustier fellow at riddlehurst but he was disappointed and while debating upon what to do for he shrank from leaving two women to the conduct of that inflamed troughsnout brisby despatched to storling by an afterthought of lady dunstane's rushed out of the riddlehurst inn taproom and relieved him of the charge of the mare he was accommodated with a seat on a stool in the chariot 'my triumphal car' said his captive she was very amusing about her postillion danvers had to beg pardon for laughing 'you are happy' observed her mistress but redworth laughed too and he could not boast of any happiness beyond the temporary satisfaction nor could she who sprang the laughter boast of that little she said to herself in the midst of the hilarity 'wherever i go now in all weathers i am perfectly naked' and remembering her readings of a certain wonderful old quarto book in her father's library by an eccentric old scottish nobleman wherein the wearing of garments and sleeping in houses is accused as the cause of human degeneracy she took a forced merry stand on her return to the primitive healthful state of man and woman and affected scorn of our modern ways of dressing and thinking whence it came that she had some of her wildest seizures of iridescent humour danvers attributed the fun to her mistress's gladness in not having pursued her bent to quit the country redworth saw deeper and was nevertheless amazed by the airy hawk poise and pounce down of her wit as she ranged high and low now capriciously generalizing now dropping bolt upon things of passage the postillion jogging from rum to gin the rustics baconly agape the horse kneed ostlers she touched them to the life in similes and phrases and next she was aloft derisively philosophizing but with a comic afflatus that dispersed the sharpness of her irony in mocking laughter the afternoon refreshments at the inn of the county market town and the english idea of public hospitality as to manner and the substance provided for wayfarers were among the themes she made memorable to him she spoke of everything tolerantly just naming it in a simple sentence that fell with a ring and chimed their host's ready acquiescence in receiving orders his contemptuous disclaimer of stuff he did not keep his flat indifference to the sheep he sheared and the phantom half crown flickering in one eye of the anticipatory waiter the pervading and confounding smell of stale beer over all the apartments the prevalent notion of bread butter tea milk sugar as matter for the exercise of a native inventive genius these were reviewed in quips of metaphor 'come we can do better at an inn or two known to me' said redworth 'surely this is the best that can be done for us when we strike them with the magic wand of a postillion' said she 'it depends as elsewhere on the individuals entertaining us' 'yet you admit that your railways are rapidly polishing off the individual' 'they will spread the metropolitan idea of comfort' 'i fear they will feed us on nothing but that big word it booms a curfew bell for every poor little light that we would read by' seeing their beacon nosed postillion preparing too mount and failing in his jump redworth was apprehensive and questioned the fellow concerning potation 'lord sir they call me half a horse but i can't 'bids water' was the reply with the assurance that he had not 'taken a pailful' habit enabled him to gain his seat 'it seems to us unnecessary to heap on coal when the chimney is afire but he may know the proper course' diana said convulsing danvers and there was discernibly to redworth under the influence of her phrases a likeness of the flaming 'half horse' with the animals all smoking in the frost to a railway engine 'your wrinkled centaur' she named the man of course he had to play second to her and not unwillingly but he reflected passingly on the instinctive push of her rich and sparkling voluble fancy to the initiative which women do not like in a woman and men prefer to distantly admire english women and men feel toward the quick witted of their species as to aliens having the demerits of aliens wordiness vanity obscurity shallowness an empty glitter the sin of posturing a quick witted woman exerting her wit is both a foreigner and potentially a criminal she is incandescent to a breath of rumour it accounted for her having detractors a heavy counterpoise to her enthusiastic friends it might account for her husband's discontent the reduction of him to a state of mere masculine antagonism what is the husband of a vanward woman he feels himself but a diminished man the english husband of a voluble woman relapses into a dreary mute ah for the choice of places redworth would have yielded her the loquent lead for the smallest of the privileges due to him who now rejected all except the public scourging of her the conviction was in his mind that the husband of this woman sought rather to punish than be rid of her but a part of his own emotion went to form the judgement furthermore lady dunstane's allusion to her 'enemies' made him set down her growing crops of backbiters to the trick she had of ridiculing things english if the english do it themselves it is in a professionally robust a jocose kindly way always with a glance at the other things great things they excel in and it is done to have the credit of doing it they are keen to catch an inimical tone they will find occasion to chastise the presumptuous individual unless it be the leader of a party therefore a power for they respect a power redworth knew their quaintnesses without overlooking them he winced at the acid of an irony that seemed to spring from aversion and regretted it for her sake he had to recollect that she was in a sharp strung mood bitterly surexcited moreover he reminded himself of her many and memorable phrases of enthusiasm for england shakespeareland as she would sometimes perversely term it to sink the country in the poet english fortitude english integrity the english disposition to do justice to dependents adolescent english ingenuousness she was always ready to laud only her enthusiasm required rousing by circumstances it was less at the brim than her satire hence she made enemies among a placable people he felt that he could have helped her under happier conditions the beautiful vision she had been on the night of the irish ball swept before him and he looked at her smiling 'why do you smile' she said 'i was thinking of mr sullivan smith' 'ah my dear compatriot and think too of lord larrian' she caught her breath instead of recreation the names brought on a fit of sadness it deepened shy neither smiled nor rattled any more she gazed across the hedgeways at the white meadows and bare twigged copses showing their last leaves in the frost 'i remember your words observation is the most enduring of the pleasures of life and so i have found it' she said there was a brightness along her under eyelids that caused him to look away the expected catastrophe occurred on the descent of a cutting in the sand where their cordial postillion at a trot bumped the chariot against the sturdy wheels of a waggon which sent it reclining for support upon a beech tree's huge intertwisted serpent roots amid strips of brown bracken and pendant weeds while he exhibited one short stump of leg all boot in air no one was hurt diana disengaged herself from the shoulder of danvers and mildly said 'that reminds me i forgot to ask why we came in a chariot' redworth was excited on her behalf but the broken glass had done no damage nor had danvers fainted the remark was unintelligible to him apart from the comforting it had been designed to give he jumped out and held a hand for them to do the same 'i never foresaw an event more positively' said he 'and it was nothing but a back view that inspired you all the way' said diana a waggoner held the horses another assisted redworth to right the chariot the postillion had hastily recovered possession of his official seat that he might as soon as possible feel himself again where he was most intelligent and was gay in stupidity indifferent to what happened behind him diana heard him counselling the waggoner as to the common sense of meeting small accidents with a cheerful soul 'lord' he cried 'i been pitched a somerset in my time and taken up for dead and that didn't beat me' disasters of the present kind could hardly affect such a veteran but he was painfully disconcerted by redworth's determination not to entrust the ladies any farther to his guidance danvers had implored for permission to walk the mile to the town and thence take a fly to copsley her mistress rather sided with the postillion who begged them to spare him the disgrace of riding in and delivering a box at the red lion 'what'll they say and they know arthur dance well there' he groaned 'what arthur chariotin' a box and me a better man to his work now than i been for many a long season fit for double the journey a bit of a shake always braces me up i could read a newspaper right off small print and all come along sir and hand the ladies in' danvers vowed her thanks to mr redworth for refusing they walked ahead the postillion communicated his mixture of professional and human feelings to the waggoners and walked his horses in the rear meditating on the weak heartedness of gentryfolk and the means for escaping being chaffed out of his boots at the old red lion where he was to eat drink and sleep that night ladies might be fearsome after a bit of a shake he would not have supposed it of a gentleman he jogged himself into an arithmetic of the number of nips of liquor he had taken to soothe him on the road in spite of the gentleman 'for some of 'em are sworn enemies of poor men as yonder one ne'er a doubt' diana enjoyed her walk beneath the lingering brown red of the frosty november sunset with the scent of sand earth strong in the air 'i had to hire a chariot because there was no two horse carriage' said redworth 'and i wished to reach copsley as early as possible' she replied smiling that accidents were fated as a certain marriage had been the comparison forced itself on her reflections 'but this is quite an adventure' said she reanimated by the brisker flow of her blood 'we ought really to be thankful for it in days when nothing happens' redworth accused her of getting that idea from the perusal of romances 'yes our lives require compression like romances to be interesting and we object to the process' she said 'real happiness is a state of dulness when we taste it consciously it becomes mortal a thing of the seasons but i like my walk how long these november sunsets burn and what hues they have there is a scientific reason only don't tell it me now i understand why you always used to choose your holidays in november' she thrilled him with her friendly recollection of his customs 'as to happiness the looking forward is happiness' he remarked 'oh the looking back back' she cried 'forward that is life' 'and backward death if you will and still at is happiness death and our postillion' 'ay i wonder why the fellow hangs to the rear' said redworth turning about 'it's his cunning strategy poor creature so that he may be thought to have delivered us at the head of the town for us to make a purchase or two if we go to the inn on foot' said diana 'we 'll let the manoeuvre succeed' redworth declared that she had a head for everything and she was flattered to hear him so passing from the southern into the western road they saw the town lights beneath an amber sky burning out sombrely over the woods of copsley and entered the town the postillion following chapter xii between emma and diana diana was in the arms of her friend at a late hour of the evening and danvers breathed the amiable atmosphere of footmen once more professing herself perished this maid of the world who could endure hardships and loss of society for the mistress to whom she was attached no sooner saw herself surrounded by the comforts befitting her station than she indulged in the luxury of a wailful dejectedness the better to appreciate them she was unaffectedly astonished to find her outcries against the cold and the journeyings to and fro interpreted as a serving woman's muffled comments on her mistress's behaviour lady dunstane's maid bartlett and mrs bridges the housekeeper and foster the butler contrived to let her know that they could speak an if they would and they expressed their pity of her to assist her to begin the speaking she bowed in acceptance of fosters offer of a glass of wine after supper but treated him and the other two immediately as though they had been interrogating bigwigs 'they wormed nothing out of me' she said to her mistress at night undressing her 'but what a set they are they've got such comfortable places they've all their days and hours for talk of the doings of their superiors they read the vilest of those town papers and they put their two and two together of what is happening in and about and not one of the footmen thinks of staying because it 's so dull and they and the maids object did one ever hear to the three uppers retiring when they 've done dining to the private room to dessert' 'that is the custom' observed her mistress 'foster carries the decanter ma'am and mrs bridges the biscuits and bartlett the plate of fruit and they march out in order' 'the man at the head of the procession probably' 'oh yes and the others though they have everything except the wine and dessert don't like it when i was here last they were new and hadn't a word against it now they say it's invidious lady dunstane will be left without an under servant at copsley soon i was asked about your boxes ma'am and the moment i said they were at dover that instant all three peeped they let out a mouse to me they do love to talk' her mistress could have added 'and you too my good danvers' trustworthy though she knew the creature to be in the main 'now go and be sure you have bedclothes enough before you drop asleep' she said and danvers directed her steps to gossip with bartlett diana wrapped herself in a dressing gown lady dunstane had sent her and sat by the fire thinking of the powder of tattle stored in servants' halls to explode beneath her and but for her choice of roads she might have been among strangers the liking of strangers best is a curious exemplification of innocence 'yes i was in a muse' she said raising her head to emma whom she expected and sat armed to meet unaccountably iron nerved 'i was questioning whether i could be quite as blameless as i fancy if i sit and shiver to be in england you will tell me i have taken the right road i doubt it but the road is taken and here i am but any road that leads me to you is homeward my darling' she tried to melt determining to be at least open with her 'i have not praised you enough for coming' said emma when they had embraced again 'praise a little your truest friend of women your letter gave the tug i might have resisted it' 'he came straight from heaven but cruel tony where is your love' 'it is unequal to yours dear i see i could have wrestled with anything abstract and distant from being certain but here i am' 'but my own dear girl you never could have allowed this infamous charge to be undefended' 'i think so i've an odd apathy as to my character rather like death when one dreams of flying the soul what does it matter i should have left the flies and wasps to worry a corpse and then good bye gentility i should have worked for my bread i had thoughts of america i fancy i can write and americans one hears are gentle to women' 'ah tony there's the looking back and of all women you' 'or else dear well perhaps once on foreign soil in a different air i might might have looked back and seen my whole self not shattered as i feel it now and come home again compassionate to the poor persecuted animal to defend her perhaps that was what i was running away for i fled on the instinct often a good thing to trust' 'i saw you at the crossways' 'i remembered i had the dread that you would though i did not imagine you would reach me so swiftly my going there was an instinct too i suppose we are all instinct when we have the world at our heels forgive me if i generalize without any longer the right to be included in the common human sum pariah and taboo are words we borrow from barbarous tribes they stick to me' 'my tony you look as bright as ever and you speak despairingly' 'call me enigma i am that to myself emmy' 'you are not quite yourself to your friend' 'since the blow i have been bewildered i see nothing upright it came on me suddenly stunned me a bolt out of a clear sky as they say he spared me a scene there had been threats and yet the sky was clear or seemed when we have a man for arbiter he is our sky' emma pressed her tony's unresponsive hand feeling strangely that her friend ebbed from her 'has he to mislead him' she said colouring at the breach in the question 'proofs he has the proofs he supposes' 'not to justify suspicion' 'he broke open my desk and took my letters' 'horrible but the letters' emma shook with a nervous revulsion 'you might read them' 'basest of men that is the unpardonable cowardice' exclaimed emma 'the world will read them dear' said diana and struck herself to ice she broke from the bitter frigidity in fury 'they are letters none very long sometimes two short sentences he wrote at any spare moment on my honour as a woman i feel for him most the letters i would bear any accusation rather than that exposure letters of a man of his age to a young woman he rates too highly the world reads them do you hear it saying it could have excused her for that fiddle faddle with a younger a young lover and had i thought of a lover i had no thought of loving or being loved i confess i was flattered to you emma i will confess you see the public ridicule and half his age he and i would have appeared a romantic couple confess i said well dear the stake is lighted for a trial of its effect on me it is this he was never a dishonourable friend but men appear to be capable of friendship with women only for as long as we keep out of pulling distance of that line where friendship ceases they may step on it we must hold back a league i have learnt it you will judge whether he disrespects me as for him he is a man at his worst not one of the worst at his best better than very many there now emma you have me stripped and burning there is my full confession except for this yes one thing further that i do rage at the ridicule and could choose but for you to have given the world cause to revile me or think me romantic something or somebody to suffer for would really be agreeable it is a singular fact i have not known what this love is that they talk about and behold me marched into smithfield society's heretic if you please i must own i think it hard' emma chafed her cold hand softly 'it is hard i understand it' she murmured 'and is your sunday visit to us in the list of offences' 'an item' 'you gave me a happy day' 'then it counts for me in heaven' 'he set spies on you' 'so we may presume' emma went through a sphere of tenuious reflections in a flash 'he will rue it perhaps now he may now be regretting his wretched frenzy and tony could pardon she has the power of pardoning in her heart' 'oh certainly dear but tell me why it is you speak to night rather unlike the sedate philosophical emma in a tone well tolerably sentimental' 'i am unaware of it' said emma who could have retorted with a like reproach 'i am anxious i will not say at present for your happiness for your peace and i have a hope that possibly a timely word from some friend lukin or another might induce him to consider' 'to pardon me do you mean' cried diana flushing sternly 'not pardon suppose a case of faults on both sides' 'you address a faulty person my dear but do you know that you are hinting at a reconcilement' 'might it not be' 'open your eyes to what it involves i trust i can pardon let him go his ways do his darkest or repent but return to the roof of the basest of men who was guilty of the unpardonable cowardice you expect me to be superhuman when i consent to that i shall be out of my woman's skin which he has branded go back to him' she was taken with a shudder of head and limbs 'no i really have the power of pardoning and i am bound to for among my debts to him this present exemption that is like liberty dragging a chain or say an escaped felon wearing his manacles should count i am sensible of my obligation the price i pay for it is an immovable patch attractive to male idiots i have heard and a mark of scorn to females between the two the remainder of my days will be lively out out damned spot but it will not and not on the hand on the forehead we'll talk of it no longer i have sent a note with an enclosure to my lawyers i sell the crossways if i have the married woman's right to any scrap of property for money to scatter fees' 'my purse dear tony' exclaimed emma 'my house you will stay with me why do you shake your head with me you are safe' she spied at the shadows in her friend's face 'ever since your marriage tony you have been strange in your trick of refusing to stay with me and you and i made our friendship the pledge of a belief in eternity we vowed it come i do talk sentimentally but my heart is in it i beg you all the reasons are with me to make my house your home you will you know i am rather lonely' diana struggled to keep her resolution from being broken by tenderness and doubtless poor sir lukin had learnt his lesson still her defensive instincts could never quite slumber under his roof not because of any further fear that they would have to be summoned it was chiefly owing to the consequences of his treacherous foolishness for this half home with her friend thenceforward denied to her she had accepted a protector called husband rashly past credence in the retrospect but it had been her propelling motive and the loathings roused by her marriage helped to sicken her at the idea of a lengthened stay where she had suffered the shock precipitating her to an act of insanity 'i do not forget you were an heiress emmy and i will come to you if i need money to keep my head up as for staying two reasons are against it if i am to fight my battle i must be seen i must go about wherever i am received so my field is london that is obvious and i shall rest better in a house where my story is not known' two or three questions ensued diana had to fortify her fictitious objection by alluding to her maid's prattle of the household below and she excused the hapless overfed idle people of those regions to emma it seemed a not unnatural sensitiveness she came to a settled resolve in her thoughts as she said 'they want a change london is their element' feeling that she deceived this true heart however lightly and necessarily diana warmed to her forgiving her at last for having netted and dragged her back to front the enemy an imposition of horrors of which the scene and the travelling with redworth the talking of her case with her most intimate friend as well had been a distempering foretaste they stood up and kissed parting for the night an odd world where for the sin we have not participated in we must fib and continue fibbing she reflected she did not entirely cheat her clearer mind for she perceived that her step in flight had been urged both by a weak despondency and a blind desperation also that the world of a fluid civilization is perforce artificial but her mind was in the background of her fevered senses and when she looked in the glass and mused on uttering the word 'liar' to the lovely image her senses were refreshed her mind somewhat relieved the face appeared so sovereignly defiant of abasement thus did a nature distraught by pain obtain some short lull of repose thus moreover by closely reading herself whom she scourged to excess that she might in justice be comforted she gathered an increasing knowledge of our human constitution and stored matter for the brain chapter xiii touching the first days of her probation the result of her sleeping was that diana's humour locked up overnight insisted on an excursion as she lay with half buried head and open eyelids thinking of the firm of lawyers she had to see and to whom and to the legal profession generally she would be under outward courtesies nothing other than 'the woman warwick' she pursued the woman warwick unmercifully through a series of interviews with her decorous and crudely minded defenders accurately perusing them behind their senior staidness her scorching sensitiveness sharpened her intelligence in regard to the estimate of discarded wives entertained by men of business and plain men of the world and she drove the woman warwick down their ranks amazed by the vision of a puppet so unlike to herself in reality though identical in situation that woman reciting her side of the case gained a gradual resemblance to danvers she spoke primly perpetually the creature aired her handkerchief she was bent on softening those sugarloaves the hard business men applying to her for facts facts were treated as unworthy of her mere stuff of the dustheap mutton bones old shoes she swam above them in a cocoon of her spinning sylphidine unseizable and between perplexing and mollifying the slaves of facts she saw them at their heels a tearful fry abjectly imitative of her melodramatic performances the spectacle was presented of a band of legal gentlemen vociferating mightily for swords and the onset like the austrian empress's magyars to vindicate her just and holy cause our law courts failing they threatened parliament and for a last resort the country we are not going to be the woman warwick without a stir my brethren emma an early riser that morning for the purpose of a private consultation with mr redworth found her lying placidly wakeful to judge by appearances 'you have not slept my dear child' 'perfectly' said diana giving her hand and offering the lips 'i'm only having a warm morning bath in bed' she added in explanation of a chill moisture that the touch of her exposed skin betrayed for whatever the fun of the woman warwick there had been sympathetic feminine horrors in the frame of the sentient woman emma fancied she kissed a quiet sufferer a few remarks very soon set her wildly laughing both were laughing when danvers entered the room rather guilty being late and the sight of the prim visaged maid she had been driving among the lawyers kindled diana's comic imagination to such a pitch that she ran riot in drolleries carrying her friend headlong on the tide 'i have not laughed so much since you were married' said emma 'nor i dear proving that the bar to it was the ceremony' said diana she promised to remain at copsley three days 'then for the campaign in mr redworth's metropolis i wonder whether i may ask him to get me lodgings a sitting room and two bedrooms the crossways has a board up for letting i should prefer to be my own tenant only it would give me a hundred pounds more to get a substitute's money i should like to be at work writing instantly ink is my opium and the pen my nigger and he must dig up gold for me it is written danvers you can make ready to dress me when i ring' emma helped the beautiful woman to her dressing gown and the step from her bed she had her thoughts and went down to redworth at the breakfast table marvelling that any husband other than a madman could cast such a jewel away the material loveliness eclipses intellectual qualities in such reflections 'he must be mad' she said compelled to disburden herself in a congenial atmosphere which however she infrigidated by her overflow of exclamatory wonderment a curtain that shook voluminous folds luring redworth to dreams of the treasure forfeited he became rigidly practical 'provision will have to be made for her lukin must see mr warwick she will do wisely to stay with friends in town mix in company women are the best allies for such cases who are her solicitors' 'they are mine braddock thorpe and simnel' 'a good firm she is in safe hands with them i dare say they may come to an arrangement' 'i should wish it she will never consent' redworth shrugged a woman's 'never' fell far short of outstripping the sturdy pedestrian time to his mind diana saw him drive off to catch the coach in the valley regulated to meet the train and much though she liked him she was not sorry that he had gone she felt the better clad for it she would have rejoiced to witness the departure on wings of all her friends except emma to whom her coldness overnight had bound her anew warmly in contrition and yet her friends were well beloved by her but her emotions were distraught emma told her that mr redworth had undertaken to hire a suite of convenient rooms and to these she looked forward the nest among strangers where she could begin to write earning bread an idea that with the pride of independence conjured the pleasant morning smell of a bakery about her she passed three peaceable days at copsley at war only with the luxury of the house on the fourth a letter to lady dunstane from redworth gave the address of the best lodgings he could find and diana started for london she had during a couple of weeks besides the first fresh exercising of her pen as well as the severe gratification of economy a savage exultation in passing through the streets on foot and unknown save for the plunges into the office of her solicitors she could seem to herself a woman who had never submitted to the yoke what a pleasure it was after finishing a number of pages to start eastward toward the lawyer regions full of imaginary cropping incidents and from that churchyard westward against smoky sunsets or in welcome fogs an atom of the crowd she had an affection for the crowd they clothed her she laughed at the gloomy forebodings of danvers concerning the perils environing ladies in the streets after dark alone the lights in the streets after dark and the quick running of her blood combined to strike sparks of fancy and inspirit the task of composition at night this new strange solitary life cut off from her adulatory society both by the shock that made the abyss and by the utter foreignness threw her in upon her natural forces recasting her and thinning away her memory of her past days excepting girlhood into the remote she lived with her girlhood as with a simple little sister they were two in one and she corrected the dreams of the younger protected and counselled her very sagely advising her to love truth and look always to reality for her refreshment she was ready to say that no habitable spot on our planet was healthier and pleasanter than london as to the perils haunting the head of danvers her experiences assured her of a perfect immunity from them and the maligned thoroughfares of a great city she was ready to affirm contrasted favourably with certain hospitable halls the long suffering fates permitted her for a term to enjoy the generous delusion subsequently a sweet surprise alleviated the shock she had sustained emma dunstane's carriage was at her door and emma entered her sitting room to tell her of having hired a house in the neighbourhood looking on the park she begged to have her for guest sorrowfully anticipating the refusal at least they were to be near one another 'you really like this life in lodgings' asked emma to whom the stiff furniture and narrow apartments were a dreariness the miserably small fire of the sitting room an aspect of cheerless winter 'i do' said diana 'yes' she added with some reserve and smiled at her damped enthusiasm 'i can eat when i like walk work and i am working my legs and my pen demand it let me be independent besides i begin to learn something of the bigger world outside the one i know and i crush my mincing tastes in return for that i get a sense of strength i had not when i was a drawing room exotic much is repulsive but i am taken with a passion for reality' they spoke of the lawyers and the calculated period of the trial of the husband too in his inciting belief in the falseness of his wife 'that is his excuse' diana said her closed mouth meditatively dimpling the comers over thoughts of his grounds for fury he had them though none for the incriminating charge the sphinx mouth of the married woman at war and at bay must be left unriddled she and the law differed in their interpretation of the dues of wedlock but matters referring to her case were secondary with diana beside the importance of her storing impressions her mind required to hunger for something and this reality which frequently she was forced to loathe she forced herself proudly to accept despite her youthfulness her philosophy swallowed it in the lump as the great serpent his meal she hoped to digest it sleeping likewise her visits of curiosity to the law courts where she stood spying and listening behind a veil gave her a great deal of tough substance to digest there she watched the process of the tortures to be applied to herself and hardened her senses for the ordeal she saw there the ribbed and shanked old skeleton world on which our fair fleshly is moulded after all your fool's paradise is not a garden to grow in charon's ferry boat is not thicker with phantoms they do not live in mind or soul chiefly women people it a certain class of limp men women for the most part they are sown there and put their garden under the magnifying glass of intimacy what do we behold a world not better than the world it curtains only foolisher her conversations with lady dunstane brought her at last to the point of her damped enthusiasm she related an incident or two occurring in her career of independence and they discussed our state of civilization plainly and gravely save for the laughing peals her phrases occasionally provoked as when she named the intruders and disturbers of solitarily faring ladies 'cupid's footpads' her humour was created to swim on waters where a prescribed and cultivated prudery should pretend to be drowning 'i was getting an exalted idea of english gentlemen emmy rich and rare were the gems she wore i was ready to vow that one might traverse the larger island similarly respected i praised their chivalry i thought it a privilege to live in such a land i cannot describe to you how delightful it was to me to walk out and home generally protected i might have been seriously annoyed but that one of the clerks articled he called himself of our lawyers happened to be by he offered to guard me and was amusing with his modest tiptoe air no i trust to the english common man more than ever he is a man of honour i am convinced he is matchless in any other country except ireland the english gentleman trades on his reputation' he was condemned by an afflicted delicacy the sharpest of critical tribunals emma bade her not to be too sweeping from a bad example 'it is not a single one' said diana 'what vexes me and frets me is that i must be a prisoner or allow danvers to mount guard and i can't see the end of it and danvers is no magician she seems to know her countrymen though she warded one of them off by saying to me this is the crossing my lady he fled' lady dunstane affixed the popular title to the latter kind of gentleman she was irritated on her friend's behalf and against the worrying of her sisterhood thinking in her heart nevertheless that the passing of a face and figure like diana's might inspire honourable emotions pitiable for being hapless 'if you were with me dear you would have none of these annoyances' she said pleading forlornly diana smiled to herself 'no i should relapse into softness this life exactly suits my present temper my landlady is respectful and attentive the little housemaid is a willing slave danvers does not despise them pugnaciously they make a home for me and i am learning daily do you know the less ignorant i become the more considerate i am for the ignorance of others i love them for it' she squeezed emma's hand with more meaning than her friend apprehended 'so i win my advantage from the trifles i have to endure they are really trifles and i should once have thought them mountains' for the moment diana stipulated that she might not have to encounter friends or others at lady dunstane's dinner table and the season not being favourable to those gatherings planned by lady dunstane in her project of winning supporters there was a respite during which sir lukin worked manfully at his three clubs to vindicate diana's name from the hummers and hawers gaining half a dozen hot adherents and a body of lukewarm sufficiently stirred to be desirous to see the lady he worked with true champion zeal although an interview granted him by the husband settled his opinion as to any possibility of the two ever coming to terms also it struck him that if he by misadventure had been a woman and the wife of such a fellow by jove his apostrophe to the father of the gods of pagandom signifying the amount of matter warwick would have had reason to complain of in earnest by ricochet his military mind rebounded from his knowledge of himself to an ardent faith in mrs warwick's innocence for as there was no resemblance between them there must he deduced be a difference in their capacity for enduring the perpetual company of a prig a stick a petrified poser moreover the novel act of advocacy and the nature of the advocacy had effect on him and then he recalled the scene in the winter beech woods and diana's wild deer eyes her perfect generosity to a traitor and fool how could he have doubted her glimpses of the corrupting cause for it partly penetrated his density a conqueror of ladies in mid career doubts them all of course he had meant no harm nothing worse than some petty philandering with the loveliest woman of her time and by jove it was worth the rebuff to behold the beauty in her wrath the reflections of lothario however much tending tardily to do justice to a particular lady cannot terminate wholesomely but he became a gallant partisan his portrayal of mr warwick to his wife and his friends was fine caricature 'the fellow had his hand up at my first word stood like a sentinel under inspection understand sir lukin that i receive you simply as an acquaintance as an intermediary permit me to state that you are taking superfluous trouble the case must proceed it is final she is at liberty in the meantime to draw on my bankers for the provision she may need at the rate of five hundred pounds per annum he spoke of the lady now bearing my name he was within an inch of saying dishonouring i swear i heard the dis and he caught himself up he again declined any attempt towards reconciliation it could only be founded on evasion of the truth to be made patent on the day of trial half his talk was lawyers' lingo the fellow's teeth looked like frost if lot's wife had a brother his name's warwick how diana merion who could have had the pick of the best of us ever came to marry a fellow like that passes my comprehension queer creatures as women are he can ride that's about all he can do i told him mrs warwick had no thought of reconciliation then sir lukin you will perceive that we have no standpoint for a discussion i told him the point was for a man of honour not to drag his wife before the public as he had no case to stand on less than nothing you should have seen the fellow's face he shot a sneer up to his eyelids and flung his head back so i said good day he marches me to the door with his compliments to lady dunstane i could have floored him for that bless my soul what fellows the world is made of when here's a man calling himself a gentleman who just because he gets in a rage with his wife for one thing or another and past all competition the handsomest woman of her day and the cleverest the nicest the best of the whole boiling has her out for a public horsewhipping and sets all the idiots of the kingdom against her i tried to reason with him he made as if he were going to sleep standing' sir lukin gratified lady dunstane by his honest championship of diana and now in his altered mood the thrice indebted rogue was just cloudily conscious of a desire to propitiate his dear wife by serving her friend he began a crusade against the scandal newspapers going with an irish military comrade straight to the editorial offices and leaving his card and a warning that the chastisement for print of the name of the lady in their columns would be personal and condign captain carew mahony albeit unacquainted with mrs warwick had espoused her cause she was a woman she was an irishwoman she was a beautiful woman she had therefore three positive claims on him as a soldier and a man other irish gentlemen animated by the same swelling degrees were awaking to the intimation that they might be wanted some words were dropped here and there by general lord larrian he regretted his age and infirmities a goodly regiment for a bodyguard might have been selected to protect her steps in the public streets when it was bruited that the general had sent her a present of his great newfoundland dog leander to attend on her and impose a required respect but as it chanced that her address was unknown to the volunteer constabulary they had to assuage their ardour by thinking the dog luckier than they the report of the dog was a fact he arrived one morning at diana's lodgings with a soldier to lead him and a card to introduce the hercules of dogs a very ideal of the species toweringly big benevolent reputed a rescuer of lives disdainful of dog fighting devoted to his guardian's office with a majestic paw to give and the noblest satisfaction in receiving caresses ever expressed by mortal male enfolded about the head kissed patted hugged snuggled informed that he was his new mistress's one love and darling she despatched a thrilling note of thanks to lord larrian sure of her touch upon an irish heart the dog leander soon responded to the attachment of a mistress enamoured of him 'he is my husband' she said to emma and started a tear in the eyes of her smiling friend 'he promises to trust me and never to have the law of me and to love my friends as his own so we are certain to agree' in rain snow sunshine through the parks and the streets he was the shadow of diana commanding on the whole apart from some desperate attempts to make him serve as introducer a civilized behaviour in the legions of cupid's footpads but he helped innocently enough to create an enemy chapter xiv giving glimpses of diana under her cloud before the world and of her further apprenticeship as the day of her trial became more closely calculable diana's anticipated alarms receded with the deadening of her heart to meet the shock she fancied she had put on proof armour unconscious that it was the turning of the inward flutterer to steel which supplied her cuirass and shield the necessity to brave society in the character of honest defendant caused but a momentary twitch of the nerves her heart beat regularly like a serviceable clock none of her faculties abandoned her save songfulness and none belied her excepting a disposition to tartness almost venomous in the sarcastic shafts she let fly at friends interceding with mr warwick to spare his wife when she had determined to be tried a strange fit of childishness overcame her powers of thinking and was betrayed in her manner of speaking though to herself her dwindled humour allowed her to appear the towering britomart she pouted contemptuously on hearing that a mr sullivan smith a remotely recollected figure had besought mr warwick for an interview and gained it by stratagem 'to bring the man to his senses' but an ultra irishman did not compromise her battle front as the busybody supplications of a personal friend like mr redworth did and that the latter without consulting her should be 'one of the plaintive crew whining about the heels of the plaintiff for a mercy she disdained and rejected' was bitter to her taste 'he does not see that unless i go through the fire there is no justification for this wretched character of mine' she exclaimed truce treaty withdrawal signified publicly pardon not exoneration by any means and now that she was in armour she had no dread of the public so she said redworth's being then engaged upon the canvass of a borough added to the absurdity of his meddling with the dilemmas of a woman 'dear me emma think of stepping aside from the parliamentary road to entreat a husband to relent and arrange the domestic alliance of a contrary couple quixottry is agreeable reading a silly performance' lady dunstane pleaded his friendship she had to quit the field where such darts were showering the first dinner party was aristocratic easy to encounter lord and lady crane lady pennon lord and lady esquart lord larrian mr and mrs montvert of halford manor lady singleby sir walter capperston friends admirers of diana patrons in the phrase of the time of her father were the guests lady pennon expected to be amused and was gratified for diana had only to open her mouth to set the great lady laughing she petitioned to have mrs warwick at her table that day week because the marquis was dying to make her acquaintance and begged to have all her sayings repeated to him vowed she must be salt in the desert 'and remember i back you through thick and thin' said lady pennon to which diana replied 'if i am salt in the desert you are the spring' and the old lady protested she must put that down for her book the witty mrs warwick of whom wit was expected had many incitements to be guilty of cheap wit and the beautiful mrs warwick being able to pass anything she uttered gave good and bad alike under the impulsion to give out something that the stripped and shivering mrs warwick might find a cover in applause she discovered the social uses of cheap wit she laid ambushes for anecdotes a telling form of it among a people of no conversational interlocution especially in the circles depending for dialogue upon perpetual fresh supplies of scandal which have plentiful crops yet not sufficient the old dinner and supper tables at the crossways furnished her with an abundant store and recollection failing she invented irish anecdotes are always popular in england as promoting besides the wholesome shake of the sides a kindly sense of superiority anecdotes also are portable unlike the lightning flash which will not go into the pocket they can be carried home they are disbursable at other tables these were diana's weapons she was perforce the actress of her part in happier times when light of heart and natural her vogue had not been so enrapturing doubtless cleopatra in her simple egyptian uniform would hardly have won such plaudits as her stress of barbaric oriental splendours evoked for her on the swan and serpent nile barge not from posterity at least it is a terrible decree that all must act who would prevail and the more extended the audience the greater need for the mask and buskin from lady pennon's table diana passed to lady crane's lady esquart's lady singleby's the duchess of raby's warmly clad in the admiration she excited she appeared at princess therese paryli's first ball of the season and had her circle not of worshippers only she did not dance the princess a fair austrian benevolent to her sisterhood an admirer of diana's contrasting complexion would have had her dance once in a quadrille of her forming but yielded to the mute expression of the refusal wherever mrs warwick went her arts of charming were addressed to the women men may be counted on for falling bowled over by a handsome face and pointed tongue women require some wooing from their ensphered and charioted sister particularly if she is clouded and old women excellent buttresses must be suavely courted now to woo the swimming matron and court the settled dowager she had to win forgiveness for her beauty and this was done easily done by forbearing to angle with it in the press of nibblers they ranged about her individually unnoticed seeming unaware of its effect where it kindled she smote a number of musical female chords compassion among them a general grave affability of her eyes and smiles was taken for quiet pleasure in the scene her fitful intentness of look when conversing with the older ladies told of the mind within at work upon what they said and she was careful that plain dialogue should make her comprehensible to them nature taught her these arts through which her wit became extolled entirely on the strength of her reputation and her beauty did her service by never taking aim abroad they are the woman's arts of self defence as legitimately and honourably hers as the manful use of the fists with a coarser sex if it had not been nature that taught her the practice of them in extremity the sagacious dowagers would have seen brazenness rather than innocence or an excuseable indiscretion in the part she was performing they are not lightly duped by one of their sex few tasks are more difficult than for a young woman under a cloud to hoodwink old women of the world they are the prey of financiers but time has presented them a magic ancient glass to scan their sex in at princess paryli's ball two young men of singular elegance were observed by diana little though she concentered her attention on any figures of the groups she had the woman's faculty transiently bestowed by perfervid jealousy upon men of distinguishing minutely in the calmest of indifferent glances she could see without looking and when her eyes were wide they had not to dwell to be detective it did not escape her that the englishman of the two hurried for the chance of an introduction nor that he suddenly after putting a question to a man beside him retired she spoke of them to emma as they drove home 'the princess's partner in the first quadrille hungarian i suppose he was like a tartar modelled by a greek supple as the scythian's bow braced as the string he has the air of a born horseman and valses perfectly i won't say he was handsomer than a young englishman there but he had the advantage of soldierly training how different is that quick springy figure from our young men's lounging style it comes of military exercise and discipline' 'that was count jochany a cousin of the princess and a cavalry officer' said emma 'you don't know the other i am sure the one you mean must be percy dacier' his retiring was explained the hon percy dacier was the nephew of lord dannisburgh often extolled to her as the promising youngster of his day with the reserve that he wasted his youth for the young gentleman was decorous and studious ambitious according to report a politician taking to politics much too seriously and exclusively to suit his uncle's pattern for the early period of life uncle and nephew went their separate ways rarely meeting though their exchange of esteem was cordial thinking over his abrupt retirement from the crowded semicircle diana felt her position pinch her she knew not why lady dunstane was as indefatigable by day as by night in the business of acting goddess to her beloved tony whom she assured that the service instead of exhausting gave her such healthfulness as she had imagined herself to have lost for ever the word was passed and invitations poured in to choice conversational breakfasts private afternoon concerts all the humming season's assemblies mr warwick's treatment of his wife was taken by implication for lunatic wherever she was heard or seen he had no case a jury of some hundreds of both sexes ready to be sworn pronounced against him only the personal enemies of the lord in the suit presumed to doubt and they exercised the discretion of a minority but there is an upper middle class below the aristocratic boasting an aristocracy of morals and eminently persuasive of public opinion if not commanding it previous to the relaxation by amendment of a certain legal process this class was held to represent the austerity of the country at present a relaxed austerity is represented and still the bulk of the members are of fair repute though not quite on the level of their pretensions they were then while more sharply divided from the titular superiors they are socially absorbing very powerful to brand a woman's character whatever her rank might be having innumerable agencies and avenues for that high purpose to say nothing of the printing press lady dunstane's anxiety to draw them over to the cause of her friend set her thinking of the influential mrs cramborne wathin with whom she was distantly connected the wife of a potent serjeant at law fast mounting to the bench and knighthood the centre of a circle and not strangely that despite her deficiency in the arts and graces for she had wealth and a cook a husband proud of his wine cellar and the ambition to rule all the rewards together with the expectations of the virtuous she was a lady of incisive features bound in stale parchment complexion she had none but she had spotlessness of skin and sons and daughters just resembling her like cheaper editions of a precious quarto of a perished type you discerned the imitation of the type you acknowledged the inferior compositor mr cramborne wathin was by birth of a grade beneath his wife he sprang behind a curtain of horror from tradesmen the bench was in designation for him to wash out the stain but his children suffered in large hands and feet short legs excess of bone prominences misplaced their mother inspired them carefully with the religion she opposed to the pretensions of a nobler blood while instilling into them that the blood they drew from her was territorial far above the vulgar her appearance and her principles fitted her to stand for the puritan rich of the period emerging by the aid of an extending wealth into luxurious worldliness and retaining the maxims of their forefathers for the discipline of the poor and erring lady dunstane called on her ostensibly to let her know she had taken a house in town for the season and in the course of the chat mrs cramborne wathin was invited to dinner 'you will meet my dear friend mrs warwick' she said and the reply was 'oh i have heard of her' the formal consultation with mr cramborne wathin ended in an agreement to accept lady dunstane's kind invitation considering her husband's plenitude of old legal anecdotes and her own diligent perusal of the funny publications of the day that she might be on the level of the wits and celebrities she entertained mrs cramborne wathin had a right to expect the leading share in the conversation to which she was accustomed every honour was paid to them they met aristocracy in the persons of lord larrian of lady rockden colonel purlby the pettigrews but neither of them held the table for a moment the topics flew and were no sooner up than down they were unable to get a shot they had to eat in silence occasionally grinning because a woman labouring under a stigma would rattle rattle as if the laughter of the company were her due and decency beneath her notice some one alluded to a dog of mrs warwick's whereupon she trips out a story of her dog's amazing intelligence 'and pray' said mrs cramborne wathin across the table merely to slip in a word 'what is the name of this wonderful dog' 'his name is leander' said diana 'oh leander i don't think i hear myself calling to a dog in a name of three syllables two at the most' no so i call hero if i want him to come immediately' said diana and the gentlemen to mrs cramborne wathin's astonishment acclaimed it mr redworth at her elbow explained the point to her disgust that was diana's offence if it should seem a small one let it be remembered that a snub was intended and was foiled and foiled with an apparent simplicity enough to exasperate had there been no laughter of men to back the countering stroke a woman under a cloud she talked pushed to shine she would be heard would be applauded her chronicler must likewise admit the error of her giving way to a petty sentiment of antagonism on first beholding mrs cramborne wathin before whom she at once resolved to be herself for a holiday instead of acting demurely to conciliate probably it was an antagonism of race the shrinking of the skin from the burr but when tremendous powers are invoked we should treat any simple revulsion of our blood as a vice the gods of this world's contests demand it of us in relation to them that the mind and not the instincts shall be at work otherwise the course of a prudent policy is never to invoke them but avoid the upper class was gained by her intrepidity her charm and her elsewhere offending wit however the case might go it is chivalrous but not alas inflammable in support of innocence the class below it is governed in estimates of character by accepted patterns of conduct yet where innocence under persecution is believed to exist the members animated by that belief can be enthusiastic enthusiasm is a heaven sent steeplechaser and takes a flying leap of the ordinary barriers it is more intrusive than chivalry and has a passion to communicate its ardour two letters from stranger ladies reached diana through her lawyers and lady dunstane anonymous letters not so welcome being male effusions arrived at her lodgings one of them comical almost over the verge to pathos in its termination 'to me you will ever be the goddess diana my faith in woman' he was unacquainted with her she had not the heart to think the writers donkeys how they obtained her address was a puzzle they stole in to comfort her slightly they attached her to her position of defendant by the thought of what would have been the idea of her character if she had flown a reflection emanating from inexperience of the resources of sentimentalists if she had flown she was borne along by the tide like a butterfly that a fish may gobble unless a friendly hand shall intervene and could it in nature she was past expectation of release the attempt to imagine living with any warmth of blood in her vindicated character for the sake of zealous friends consigned her to a cold and empty house upon a foreign earth she had to set her mind upon the mysterious enshrouded twelve with whom the verdict would soon be hanging that she might prompt her human combativeness to desire the vindication at such a price as she would have to pay for it when emma dunstane spoke to her of the certainty of triumphing she suggested a possible dissentient among the fateful twelve merely to escape the drumming sound of that hollow big word the irreverent imp of her humour came to her relief by calling forth the twelve in the tone of the clerk of the court and they answered to their names of trades and crafts after the manner of titania's elves and were questioned as to their fitness by education habits enlightenment to pronounce decisively upon the case in dispute the case being plainly stated they replied that the long habit of dealing with scales enabled them to weigh the value of evidence the most delicate moreover they were englishmen and anything short of downright bullet facts went to favour the woman for thus we light the balance of legal injustice toward the sex we conveniently wink ma'am a rough old fashioned way for us is it a breach of promise she may reckon on her damages we have daughters of our own is it a suit for divorce well we have wives of our own and we can lash or we can spare that's as it may be but we'll keep the couple tied let 'em hate as they like if they can't furnish pork butchers' reasons for sundering because the man makes the money in this country my goodness what a funny people sir it 's our way of holding the balance ma'am but would it not be better to rectify the law and the social system dear sir why ma'am we find it comfortabler to take cases as they come in the style of our fathers but don't you see my good man that you are offering scapegoats for the comfort of the majority well ma'am there always were scapegoats and always will be we find it comes round pretty square in the end 'and i may be the scapegoat emmy it is perfectly possible the grocer the pork butcher drysalter stationer tea merchant et caetera they sit on me i have studied the faces of the juries and mr braddock tells me of their composition and he admits that they do justice roughly a rough and tumble country to quote him though he says they are honest in intention' 'more shame to the man who drags you before them if he persists' emma rejoined 'he will i know him i would not have him draw back now' said diana catching her breath 'and dearest do not abuse him for if you do you set me imagining guiltiness oh heaven suppose me publicly pardoned no i have kinder feelings when we stand opposed it is odd and rather frets my conscience to think of the little resentment i feel hardly any he has not cause to like his wife i can own it and i am sorry for him heartily no two have ever come together so naturally antagonistic as we two we walked a dozen steps in stupefied union and hit upon crossways from that moment it was tug and tug he me i him by resisting i made him a tyrant and he by insisting made me a rebel and he was the maddest of tyrants a weak one my dear he was also a double dealer or no perhaps not in design he was moved at one time by his interests at another by his idea of his honour he took what i could get for him and then turned and drubbed me for getting it' 'this is the creature you try to excuse' exclaimed indignant emma 'yes because but fancy all the smart things i said being called my sallies can a woman live with it because i behaved i despised him too much and i showed it he is not a contemptible man before the world he is merely a very narrow one under close inspection i could not or did not conceal my feeling i showed it not only to him to my friend husband grew to mean to me stifler lung contractor iron mask inquisitor everything anti natural he suffered under my sallies and it was the worse for him when he did not perceive their drift he is an upright man i have not seen marked meanness one might build up a respectable figure in negatives i could add a row of noughts to the single number he cherishes enough to make a millionnaire of him but strike away the first the rest are wind which signifies that if you do not take his estimate of himself you will think little of his negative virtues he is not eminently that is to say not saliently selfish not rancorous not obtrusive tata ta ta but dull dull as a woollen nightcap over eyes and ears and mouth oh an executioner's black cap to me dull and suddenly staring awake to the idea of his honour i rendered him ridiculous i had caught a trick of using men's phrases dearest now that the day of trial draws nigh you have never questioned me and it was like you to spare me pain but now i can speak of him and myself' diana dropped her voice here was another confession the proximity of the trial acted like fire on her faded recollection of incidents it may be that partly the shame of alluding to them had blocked her woman's memory for one curious operation of the charge of guiltiness upon the nearly guiltless is to make them paint themselves pure white to the obliteration of minor spots until the whiteness being acknowledged or the ordeal imminent the spots recur and press upon their consciences she resumed in a rapid undertone 'you know that a certain degree of independence had been if not granted by him conquered by me i had the habit of it obedience with him is imprisonment he is a blind wall he received a commission greatly to his advantage and was absent he seems to have received information of some sort he returned unexpectedly at a late hour and attacked me at once middling violent my friend and that he is was coming from the house for a ten minutes' talk as usual on his way home to refresh him after the long sitting and bear baiting he had nightly to endure now let me confess i grew frightened mr warwick was off his head as they say crazy and i could not bear the thought of those two meeting while he raged i threw open the window and put the lamp near it to expose the whole interior cunning as a veteran intriguer horrible but it had to be done to keep them apart he asked me what madness possessed me to sit by an open window at midnight in view of the public with a damp wind blowing i complained of want of air and fanned my forehead i heard the steps on the pavement i stung him to retort loudly and i was relieved the steps passed on so the trick succeeded the trick it was the worst i was guilty of but it was a trick and it branded me trickster it teaches me to see myself with an abyss in my nature full of infernal possibilities i think i am hewn in black rock a woman who can do as i did by instinct needs to have an angel always near her if she has not a husband she reveres' 'we are none of us better than you dear tony only some are more fortunate and many are cowards' emma said 'you acted prudently in a wretched situation partly of your own making partly of the circumstances but a nature like yours could not sit still and moan that marriage was to blame the english notion of women seems to be that we are born white sheep or black circumstances have nothing to do with our colour they dread to grant distinctions and to judge of us discerningly is beyond them whether the fiction that their homes are purer than elsewhere helps to establish the fact i do not know there is a class that does live honestly and at any rate it springs from a liking for purity but i am sure that their method of impressing it on women has the dangers of things artificial they narrow their understanding of human nature and that is not the way to improve the breed' 'i suppose we women are taken to be the second thoughts of the creator human nature's fringes mere finishing touches not a part of the texture' said diana 'the pretty ornamentation however i fancy i perceive some tolerance growing in the minds of the dominant sex our old lawyer mr braddock who appears to have no distaste for conversations with me assures me he expects the day to come when women will be encouraged to work at crafts and professions for their independence that is the secret of the opinion of us at present our dependency give us the means of independence and we will gain it and have a turn at judging you my lords you shall behold a world reversed whenever i am distracted by existing circumstances i lay my finger on the material conditions and i touch the secret individually it may be moral with us collectively it is material gross wrongs gross hungers i am a married rebel and thereof comes the social rebel i was once a dancing and singing girl you remember the night of the dublin ball a channel sea in uproar stirred by witches flows between' 'you are as lovely as you were then i could say lovelier' said emma 'i have unconquerable health and i wish i could give you the half of it dear i work late into the night and i wake early and fresh in the morning i do not sing that is all a few days more and my character will be up before the bull's head to face him in the arena the worst of a position like mine is that it causes me incessantly to think and talk of myself i believe i think less than i talk but the subject is growing stale as those who are long dying feel i dare say if they do not take it as the compensation for their departure' the bull's head or british jury of twelve with the wig on it was faced during the latter half of a week of good news first mr thomas redworth was returned to parliament by a stout majority for the borough of orrybridge the hon percy dacier delivered a brilliant speech in the house of commons necessarily pleasing to his uncle lord larrian obtained the command of the rock the house of the crossways was let to a tenant approved by mr braddock diana received the opening proof sheets of her little volume and an instalment of the modest honorarium and finally the plaintiff in the suit involving her name was adjudged to have not proved his charge she heard of it without a change of countenance she could not have wished it the reverse she was exonerated but she was not free far from that and she revenged herself on the friends who made much of her triumph and overlooked her plight by showing no sign of satisfaction there was in her bosom a revolt at the legal consequences of the verdict or blunt acquiescence of the law in the conditions possibly to be imposed on her unless she went straight to the relieving phial and the burden of keeping it under set her wildest humour alight somewhat as redworth remembered of her on the journey from the crossways to copsley this ironic fury coming of the contrast of the outer and the inner would have been indulged to the extent of permanent injury to her disposition had not her beloved emma immediately after the tension of the struggle ceased required her tenderest aid lady dunstane chanted victory and at night collapsed by the advice of her physician she was removed to copsley where diana's labour of anxious nursing restored her through love to a saner spirit the hopefulness of life must bloom again in the heart whose prayers are offered for a life dearer than its own to be preserved a little return of confidence in sir lukin also refreshed her when she saw that the poor creature did honestly in his shaggy rough male fashion reverence and cling to the flower of souls he named as his wife his piteous groans of self accusation during the crisis haunted her and made the conduct and nature of men a bewilderment to her still young understanding save for the knot of her sensations hardly a mental memory but a sullen knot which she did not disentangle to charge him with his complicity in the blind rashness of her marriage she might have felt sisterly as warmly as she compassionated him it was midwinter when dame gossip who keeps the exotic world alive with her fanning whispers related that the lovely mrs warwick had left england on board the schooner yacht clarissa with lord and lady esquart for a voyage in the mediterranean and behind her hand that the reason was urgent inasmuch as she fled to escape the meshes of the terrific net of the marital law brutally whirled to capture her by the man her husband chapter xv introduces the hon percy dacier the gods of this world's contests against whom our poor stripped individual is commonly in revolt are as we know not miners they are reapers and if we appear no longer on the surface they cease to bruise us they will allow an arena character to be cleansed and made presentable while enthusiastic friends preserve discretion it is of course less than magnanimity they are not proposed to you for your worship they are little gods temporary as that great wave their parent human mass of the hour but they have one worshipful element in them which is the divine insistency upon there being two sides to a case to every case and the people so far directed by them may boast of healthfulness let the individual shriek the innocent triumphant have in honesty to admit the fact one side is vanquished according to decree of law but the superior council does not allow it to be extinguished diana's battle was fought shadowily behind her for the space of a week or so with some advocates on behalf of the beaten man then it became a recollection of a beautiful woman possibly erring misvalued by a husband who was neither a man of the world nor a gracious yokefellow nor anything to match her she however once out of the public flames had to recall her scorchings to be gentle with herself under a defeat she would have been angrily self vindicated the victory of the ashen laurels drove her mind inward to gird at the hateful yoke in compassion for its pair of victims quite earnestly by such means yet always bearing a comical eye on her subterfuges she escaped the extremes of personal blame those advocates of her opponent in and out of court compelled her honest heart to search within and own to faults but were they not natural faults it was her marriage it was marriage in the abstract her own mistake and the world's clumsy machinery of civilization these were the capital offenders not the wife who would laugh ringingly and would have friends of the other sex and shot her epigrams at the helpless despot and was at times yes vixenish a nature driven to it but that was the word she was too generous to recount her charges against the vanquished if his wretched jealousy had ruined her the secret high tribunal within her bosom which judged her guiltless for putting the sword between their marriage tie when they stood as one because a quarrelling couple could not in honour play the embracing pronounced him just pardonable she distinguished that he could only suppose manlikely one bad cause for the division to this extent she used her unerring brains more openly than on her night of debate at the crossways the next moment she was off in vapour meditating grandly on her independence of her sex and the passions love she did not know it she was not acquainted with either the criminal or the domestic god and persuaded herself that she never could be she was a diana of coldness preferring friendship she could be the friend of men there was another who could be the friend of women her heart leapt to redworth conjuring up his clear trusty face at their grasp of hands when parting she thought of her visions of her future about the period of the dublin ball and acknowledged despite the erratic step to wedlock a gain in having met and proved so true a friend his face figure character lightest look lightest word all were loyal signs of a man of honour cold as she he was the man to whom she could have opened her heart for inspection rejoicing in her independence of an emotional sex the impulsive woman burned with a regret that at their parting she had not broken down conventional barriers and given her cheek to his lips in the anti insular fashion with a brotherly friend and why not when both were cold spirit to spirit she did delightfully refreshed by her capacity to do so without a throb he had held her hands and looked into her eyes half a minute like a dear comrade as little arousing her instincts of defensiveness as the clearing heavens and sisterly love for it was his due a sister's kiss he needed a sister and should have one in her emma's recollected talk of 'tom redworth' painted him from head to foot brought the living man over the waters to the deck of the yacht a stout champion in the person of tom redworth was left on british land but for some reason past analysis intermixed that is among a swarm of sensations diana named her champion to herself with the formal prefix perhaps because she knew a man's christian name to be dangerous handling they differed besides frequently in opinion when the habit of thinking of him as mr redworth would be best women are bound to such small observances and especially the beautiful of the sisterhood whom the world soon warns that they carry explosives and must particularly guard against the ignition of petty sparks she was less indiscreet in her thoughts than in her acts as is the way with the reflective daughter of impulse though she had fine mental distinctions what she could offer to do 'spirit to spirit' for instance held nothing to her mind of the intimacy of calling the gentleman plain tom in mere contemplation of him her friend and champion was a volunteer far from a mercenary and he deserved the reward if she could bestow it unalarmed they were to meet in egypt meanwhile england loomed the home of hostile forces ready to shock had she been a visible planet and ready to secrete a virus of her past history had she been making new she was happily away borne by a whiter than swan's wing on the sapphire mediterranean her letters to emma were peeps of splendour for the invalid her way of life on board the yacht and sketches of her host and hostess as lovers in wedlock on the other side of our perilous forties sketches of the bays the towns the people priests dames cavaliers urchins infants shifting groups of supple southerners flashed across the page like a web of silk and were dashed off redolent of herself as lightly as the silvery spray of the blue waves she furrowed telling without allusions to the land behind her that she had dipped in the wells of blissful oblivion emma dunstane as is usual with those who receive exhilarating correspondence from makers of books condemned the authoress in comparison and now first saw that she had the gift of writing only one cry 'italy eden of exiles' betrayed the seeming of a moan she wrote of her poet and others immediately thither had they fled with adieu to england how many have waved the adieu and it is england nourishing england protecting them england clothing them in the honours they wear only the posturing lower natures on the level of their buskins can pluck out the pocket knife of sentimental spite to cut themselves loose from her at heart in earnest the higher bleed as they may too pressingly feel their debt diana had the celtic vivid sense of country in england she was irish by hereditary and by wilful opposition abroad gazing along the waters observing comparing reflecting above all reading of the struggles at home the things done and attempted her soul of generosity made her though not less irish a daughter of britain it is at a distance that striving countries should be seen if we would have them in the pure idea and this young woman of fervid mind a reader of public speeches and speculator on the tides of politics desirous further to feel herself rather more in the pure idea began to yearn for england long before her term of holiday exile had ended she had been flattered by her friend her 'wedded martyr at the stake' as she named him to believe that she could exercise a judgement in politics could think even speak acutely on public affairs the reports of speeches delivered by the men she knew or knew of set her thrilling and she fancied the sensibility to be as independent of her sympathy with the orators as her political notions were sovereignty above a sex devoted to trifles and the feelings of a woman who had gone through fire she fancied it confidently notwithstanding a peculiar intuition that the plunge into the nobler business of the world would be a haven of safety for a woman with blood and imagination when writing to emma 'mr redworth's great success in parliament is good in itself whatever his views of present questions and i do not heed them when i look to what may be done by a man of such power in striking at unjust laws which keep the really numerically better half of the population in a state of slavery if he had been a lawyer it must be a lawyer's initiative a lawyer's bill mr percy dacier also spoke well as might have been expected and his uncle's compliment to him was merited should you meet him sound him he has read for the bar and is younger than mr redworth the very young men and the old are our hope the middleaged are hard and fast for existing facts we pick our leaders on the slopes the incline and decline of the mountain not on the upper table land midway where all appears to men so solid so tolerably smooth save for a few excrescences roughnesses gradually to be levelled at their leisure which induces one to protest that the middle age of men is their time of delusion it is no paradox they may be publicly useful in a small way i do not deny it at all they must be near the gates of life the opening or the closing for their minds to be accessible to the urgency of the greater questions otherwise the world presents itself to them under too settled an aspect unless of course vesuvian revolution shakes the land and that touches only their nerves i dream of some old judge there is one if having caught we could keep him but i dread so tricksy a pilot you have guessed him the ancient puck we have laughed all day over the paper telling us of his worrying the lords lady esquart congratulates her husband on being out of it puck 'biens ride' and bewigged might perhaps except that at the critical moment he would be sure to plead allegiance to oberon however the work will be performed by some one i am prophetic when maidens are grandmothers when your tony is wearing a perpetual laugh in the unhusbanded regions where there is no institution of the wedding tie' for the reason that she was not to participate in the result of the old judge's or young hero's happy championship of the cause of her sex she conceived her separateness high aloof and actually supposed she was a contemplative simply speculative political spirit impersonal albeit a woman this as emma smiling at the lines had not to learn was always her secret pride of fancy the belief in her possession of a disengaged intellect the strange illusion so clearly exposed to her correspondent was maintained through a series of letters very slightly descriptive dated from the piraeus the bosphorus the coasts of the crimea all more or less relating to the latest news of the journals received on board the yacht and of english visitors fresh from the country she now seemed fond of calling 'home' politics and gentle allusions to the curious exhibition of 'love in marriage' shown by her amiable host and hostess 'these dear esquarts who are never tired of one another but courtly courting tempting me to think it possible that a fortunate selection and a mutual deference may subscribe to human happiness filled the paragraphs reviews of her first literary venture were mentioned once 'i was well advised by mr redworth in putting antonia for authoress she is a buff jerkin to the stripes and i suspect that the signature of d e m written in full would have cawed woefully to hear that her style is affected her characters nullities her cleverness forced etc etc as it is i have much the same contempt for poor antonia's performance cease penning little fool she writes with some comprehension of the passion of love i know her to be a stranger to the earliest cry so you see dear that utter ignorance is the mother of the art dialogues occasionally pointed she has a sister who may do better but why was i not apprenticed to a serviceable profession or a trade i perceive now that a hanger on of the market had no right to expect a happier fate than mine has been' on the nile in the winter of the year diana met the hon percy dacier he was introduced to her at cairo by redworth the two gentlemen had struck up a house of commons acquaintanceship and finding themselves bound for the same destination had grown friendly redworth's arrival had been pleasantly expected she remarked on dacier's presence to emma without sketch or note of him as other than much esteemed by lord and lady esquart these with diana redworth dacier the german eastern traveller schweizerbarth and the french consul and egyptologist duriette composed a voyaging party up the river of which expedition redworth was lady dunstane's chief writer of the records his novel perceptiveness and shrewdness of touch made them amusing and his tenderness to the beauty's coquettry between the two foreign rivals moved a deeper feeling the german had a guitar the frenchman a voice diana joined them in harmony they complained apart severally of the accompaniment and the singer our english criticized them apart and that is at any rate to occupy a post though it contributes nothing to entertainment at home the esquarts had sung duets diana had assisted redworth's manly chest notes at the piano each of them declined to be vocal diana sang alone for the credit of the country italian and french songs irish also she was in her mood of planxty kelly and garryowen all the way 'madame est irlandaise' redworth heard the frenchman say and he owned to what was implied in the answering tone of the question 'we should be dull dogs without the irish leaven' so tony in exile still managed to do something for her darling erin the solitary woman on her heights at copsley raised an exclamation of 'oh that those two had been or could be united' she was conscious of a mystic symbolism in the prayer she was not apprehensive of any ominous intervention of another writing from venice diana mentioned mr percy dacier as being engaged to an heiress 'a miss asper niece of a mighty shipowner mr quintin manx lady esquart tells me money fabulous and necessary to a younger son devoured with ambition the elder brother lord creedmore is a common nimrod always absent in hungary russia america hunting somewhere mr dacier will be in the cabinet with the next ministry' no more of him a new work by antonia was progressing the summer in south tyrol passed like a royal procession before young eyes for diana and at the close of it descending the stelvio idling through the valtelline como lake was reached diana full of her work living the double life of the author at bellagio one afternoon mr percy dacier appeared she remembered subsequently a disappointment she felt in not beholding mr redworth either with him or displacing him if engaged to a lady he was not an ardent suitor nor was he a pointedly complimentary acquaintance his enthusiasm was reserved for italian scenery she had already formed a sort of estimate of his character as an indifferent observer may do and any woman previous to the inflaming of her imagination if that is in store for her and she now fell to work resetting the puzzle it became as soon her positive conclusions had to be shaped again 'but women never can know young men' she wrote to emma after praising his good repute as one of the brotherhood 'he drops pretty sentences now and then no compliments milky nuts of course he has a head or he would not be where he is and that seems always to me the most enviable place a young man can occupy' she observed in him a singular conflicting of a buoyant animal nature with a curb of studiousness as if the fardels of age were piling on his shoulders before youth had quitted its pastures his build of limbs and his features were those of the finely bred english he had the english taste for sports games manly diversions and in the bloom of life under thirty his head was given to bend the head bending on a tall upright figure where there was breadth of chest told of weights working she recollected his open look larger than inquiring at the introduction to her and it recurred when she uttered anything specially taking what it meant was past a guess though comparing it with the frank directness of redworth's eyes she saw the difference between a look that accepted her and one that dilated on two opinions her thought of the gentleman was of a brilliant young charioteer in the ruck of the race watchful for his chance to push to the front and she could have said that a dubious consort might spoil a promising career it flattered her to think that she sometimes prompted him sometimes illumined he repeated sentences she had spoken 'i shall be better able to describe mr dacier when you and i sit together my emmy and a stroke here and there completes the painting set descriptions are good for puppets living men and women are too various in the mixture fashioning them even the external presentment to be livingly rendered in a formal sketch i may tell you his eyes are pale blue his features regular his hair silky brownish his legs long his head rather stooping only the head his mouth commonly closed these are the facts and you have seen much the same in a nursery doll such literary craft is of the nursery so with landscapes the art of the pen we write on darkness is to rouse the inward vision instead of labouring with a drop scene brush as if it were to the eye because our flying minds cannot contain a protracted description that is why the poets who spring imagination with a word or a phrase paint lasting pictures the shakespearian the dantesque are in a line two at most he lends an attentive ear when i speak agrees or has a quaint pucker of the eyebrows dissenting inwardly he lacks mental liveliness cheerfulness i should say and is thankful to have it imparted one suspects he would be a dull domestic companion he has a veritable thirst for hopeful views of the world and no spiritual distillery of his own he leans to depression why the broken reed you call your tony carries a cargo all of her manufacture she reeks of secret stills and here is a young man a sapling oak inclined to droop his nature has an air of imploring me que je d'arrose i begin to perform mrs dr pangloss on purpose to brighten him the mind the views he is not altogether deficient in conversational gaiety and he shines in exercise but the world is a poor old ball bounding down a hill to an irish melody in the evening generally by request so far of mr percy dacier of whom i have some hopes distant perhaps delusive that he may be of use to our cause he listens it is an auspicious commencement' lugano is the italian lake most lovingly encircled by mountain arms and every height about it may be scaled with esce the heights have their nest of waters below for a home scene the southern swiss peaks with celestial monta rosa in prospect it was there that diana reawakened after the trance of a deadly draught to the glory of the earth and her share in it she wakened like the princess of the kiss happily not to kisses to no sign touch or call that she could trace backward the change befell her without a warning after writing deliberately to her friend emma she laid down her pen and thought of nothing and into this dreamfulness a wine passed filling her veins suffusing her mind quickening her soul and coming whence out of air out of the yonder of air she could have imagined a seraphic presence in the room that bade her arise and live take the cup of the wells of youth arrested at her lips by her marriage quit her wintry bondage for warmth light space the quick of simple being and the strange pure ecstasy was not a transient electrification it came in waves on a continuous tide looking was living walking flying she hardly knew that she slept the heights she had seen rosy at eve were marked for her ascent in the dawn sleep was one wink and fresh as the dewy field and rockflowers on her way upward she sprang to more and more of heaven insatiable happily chirruping over her possessions the threading of the town among the dear common people before others were abroad was a pleasure and pleasant her solitariness threading the gardens at the base of the rock only she astir and the first rough steps of the winding footpath the first closed buds the sharper air the uprising of the mountain with her ascent and pleasant too was her hunger and the nibble at a little loaf of bread a linnet sang in her breast an eagle lifted her feet the feet were verily winged as they are in a season of youth when the blood leaps to light from the pressure of the under forces like a source at the wellheads and the whole creature blooms vital in every energy as a spirit to be a girl again was magical she could fancy her having risen from the dead and to be a girl with a woman's broader vision and receptiveness of soul with knowledge of evil and winging to ethereal happiness this was a revelation of our human powers she attributed the change to the influences of nature's beauty and grandeur nor had her woman's consciousness to play the chrysalis in any shy recesses of her heart she was nowhere veiled or torpid she was illumined like the salvatore she saw in the evening beams and mounted in the morning's and she had not a spot of seeresy all her nature flew and bloomed she was bird flower flowing river a quivering sensibility unweighted enshrouded desires and hopes would surely have weighted and shrouded her she had none save for the upper air the eyes of the mountain which was the dream her past life or this ethereal existence but this ran spontaneously and the other had often been stimulated her vivaciousness on the nile boat for a recent example she had not a doubt that her past life was the dream or deception and for the reason that now she was compassionate large of heart toward all beneath her let them but leave her free they were forgiven even to prayers for their well being the plural number in the case was an involuntary multiplying of the single coming of her incapacity during this elevation and rapture of the senses to think distinctly of that one who had discoloured her opening life freedom to breathe gaze climb grow with the grasses fly with the clouds to muse to sing to be an unclaimed self dispersed upon earth air sky to find a keener transfigured self in that radiation she craved no more bear in mind her beauty her charm of tongue her present state of white simplicity in fervour was there ever so perilous a woman for the most guarded and clearest eyed of young men to meet at early morn upon a mountain side chapter xvi treats of a midnight bell and of a scene of early morning on a round of the mountains rising from osteno south eastward of lugano the esquart party rose from the natural grotto and headed their carriages up and down the defiles halting for a night at rovio a little village below the generoso lively with waterfalls and watercourses and they fell so in love with the place that after roaming along the flowery borderways by moonlight they resolved to rest there two or three days and try some easy ascents in the diurnal course of nature being pleasantly tired they had the avowed intention of sleeping there so they went early to their beds and carelessly wished one another good night none of them supposing slumber to be anywhere one of the warlike arts a paradoxical thing you must battle for and can only win at last when utterly beaten hard by their inn close enough for a priestly homily to have been audible stood a church campanile wherein hung a bell not ostensibly communicating with the demons of the pit in daylight rather a merry comrade but at night when the children of nerves lay stretched he threw off the mask as soon as they had fairly nestled he smote their pillows a shattering blow loud for the retold preluding quarters incredibly clanging the number ten then he waited for neighbouring campanili to box the ears of slumber's votaries in turn whereupon under pretence of excessive conscientiousness or else oblivious of his antecedent damnable misconduct or perhaps in actual league and trapdoor conspiracy with the surging goblin hosts beneath us he resumed his blaring strokes a sonorous recapitulation of the number all the others likewise it was an alarum fit to warn of attila or alaric and not simply the maniacal noise invaded the fruitful provinces of sleep like hun and vandal the irrational repetition ploughed the minds of those unhappy somnivolents leaving them worse than sheared by barbarians disrupt as by earthquake with the unanswerable question to providence why why twice designing slumberers are such infants when they have undressed and stretched themselves flat it seems that they have really gone back to their mothers' breasts and they fret at whatsoever does not smack of nature or custom the cause of a repetition so senseless in its violence and so unnecessary set them querying and kicking until the inevitable quarters recommenced then arose an insurgent rabble in their bosoms it might be the loosened imps of darkness urging them to speculate whether the proximate monster about to dole out the eleventh hour in uproar would again forget himself and repeat his dreary arithmetic a second time for they were unaware of his religious obligation following the hour of the district to inform them of the tardy hour of rome they waited in suspense curiosity enabling them to bear the first crash callously his performance was the same and now they took him for a crazy engine whose madness had infected the whole neighbourhood now was the moment to fight for sleep in contempt of him and they began by simulating an entry into the fortress they were to defend plunging on their pillows battening down their eyelids breathing with a dreadful regularity alas it came to their knowledge that the bell was in possession and they the besiegers every resonant quarter was anticipated up to the blow without averting its murderous abruptness and an executioner midnight that sounded in addition to the reiterated quarters four and twenty ringing hammerstrokes with the aching pause between the twelves left them the prey of the legions of torturers which are summed though not described in the title of a sleepless night from that period the curse was milder but the victims raged they swam on vasty deeps they knocked at rusty gates they shouldered all the weapons of black insomnia's armoury and became her soldiery doing her will upon themselves of her originally sprang the inspired teaching of the doom of men to excruciation in endlessness she is the fountain of the infinite ocean whereon the exceedingly sensitive soul is tumbled everlastingly with the diversion of hot pincers to appease its appetite for change dacier was never the best of sleepers he had taken to exercise his brains prematurely not only in learning but also in reflection and a reflectiveness that is indulged before we have a rigid mastery of the emotions or have slain them is apt to make a young man more than commonly a child of nerves nearly as much so as the dissipated with the difference that they are hilarious while wasting their treasury which he is not and he may recover under favouring conditions which is a point of vantage denied to them physically he had stout reserves for he had not disgraced the temple his intemperateness lay in the craving to rise and lead a precocious ambition this apparently modest young man started with an aim and if in the distance and with but a slingstone like the slender shepherd fronting the philistine all his energies were in his aim at government he had hung on the fringe of an administration his party was out and he hoped for higher station on its return to power many perplexities were therefore buzzing about his head among them at present one sufficiently magnified and voracious to swallow the remainder he added force to the interrogation as to why that bell should sound its inhuman strokes twice by asking himself why he was there to hear it a strange suspicion of a bewitchment might have enlightened him if he had been a man accustomed to yield to the peculiar kind of sorcery issuing from that sex he rather despised the power of women over men and nevertheless he was there listening to that bell instead of having obeyed the call of his family duties when the latter were urgent he had received letters at lugano summoning him home before he set forth on his present expedition the noisy alarum told him he floundered in quags like a silly creature chasing a marsh lamp but was it so was it not on the contrary a serious pursuit of the secret of a woman's character oh a woman and her character ordinary women and their characters might set to work to get what relationship and likeness they could they had no secret to allure this one had she had the secret of lake waters under rock unfathomable in limpidness he could not think of her without shooting at nature and nature's very sweetest and subtlest for comparison as to her sex his active man's contempt of the petticoated secret attractive to boys and graylings made him believe that in her he hunted the mind and the spirit perchance a double mind a twilighted spirit but not a mere woman she bore no resemblance to the bundle of women well she was worth studying she had ideas and could give ear to ideas furthermore a couple of the members of his family inclined to do her injustice at least they judged her harshly owing he thought to an inveterate opinion they held regarding lord dannisburgh's obliquity in relation to women he shared it and did not concur in their verdict upon the woman implicated that is to say knowing something of her now he could see the possibility of her innocence in the special charm that her mere sparkle of features and speech and her freshness would have for a man like his uncle the possibility pleaded strongly on her behalf while the darker possibility weighted by his uncle's reputation plucked at him from below she was delightful to hear delightful to see and her friends loved her and had faith in her so clever a woman might be too clever for her friends the circle he moved in hummed of women prompting novices as well as veterans to suspect that the multitude of them and notably the fairest yet more the cleverest concealed the serpent somewhere she certainly had not directed any of her arts upon him besides he was half engaged and that was a burning perplexity not because of abstract scruples touching the necessity for love in marriage the young lady great heiress though she was and willing as she allowed him to assume graceful too reputed a beauty struck him cold he fancied her transparent only arctic her transparency displayed to him all the common virtues and a serene possession of the inestimable and eminent one outweighing all but charm wit ardour intercommunicative quickness and kindling beauty airy grace were qualities that a man it seemed had to look for in women spotted by a doubt of their having the chief and priceless however he was not absolutely plighted nor did it matter to him whether this or that woman concealed the tail of the serpent and trail excepting the singular interest this woman managed to excite and so deeply as set him wondering how that resurrection bell might be affecting her ability to sleep was she sleeping or waking his nervous imagination was a torch that alternately lighted her lying asleep with the innocent like a babe and tossing beneath the overflow of her dark hair hounded by haggard memories she fluttered before him in either aspect and another perplexity now was to distinguish within himself which was the aspect he preferred great nature brought him thus to drink of her beauty under the delusion that the act was a speculation on her character the bell with its clash throb and long swoon of sound reminded him of her name diana an attribute or a derision it really mattered nothing to him save for her being maligned and if most unfairly then that face of the varying expressions and the rich voice and the remembered gentle and taking words coming from her appealed to him with a supplicating vividness that pricked his heart to leap he was dozing when the bell burst through the thin division between slumber and wakefulness recounting what seemed innumerable peals hard on his cranium gray daylight blanched the window and the bed his watch said five of the morning he thought of the pleasure of a bath beneath some dashing spray showers and jumped up to dress feeling a queer sensation of skin in his clothes the sign of a feverish night and yawning he went into the air leftward the narrow village street led to the footway along which he could make for the mountain wall he cast one look at the head of the campanile silly as an owlish roysterer's glazed stare at the young aurora and hurried his feet to check the yawns coming alarmingly fast in the place of ideas his elevation above the valley was about the kneecap of the generoso waters of past rain clouds poured down the mountain sides like veins of metal here and there flinging off a shower on the busy descent only dubiously animate in the lack lustre of the huge bulk piled against a yellow east that wafted fleets of pinky cloudlets overhead he mounted his path to a level with inviting grassmounds where water circled running from scoops and cups to curves and brook streams and in his fancy calling to him to hear them to dip in them was his desire to roll and shiver braced by the icy flow was the spell to break that baleful incantation of the intolerable night so he struck across a ridge of boulders wreck of a landslip from the height he had hugged to the open space of shadowed undulations and soon had his feet on turf heights to right and to left and between them aloft a sky the rosy wheelcourse of the chariot of morn and below among the knolls choice of sheltered nooks where waters whispered of secresy to satisfy diana herself they have that whisper and waving of secresy in secret scenery they beckon to the bath and they conjure classic visions of the pudency of the goddess irate or unsighted the semi mythological state of mind built of old images and favouring haunts was known to dacier the name of diana playing vaguely on his consciousness helped to it he had no definite thought of the mortal woman when the highest grass roll near the rock gave him view of a bowered source and of a pool under a chain of cascades bounded by polished shelves and slabs the very spot for him he decided at the first peep and at the second with fingers instinctively loosening his waist coat buttons for a commencement he shouldered round and strolled away though not at a rapid pace nor far before he halted that it could be no other than she the figure he had seen standing beside the pool he was sure why had he turned thoughts thick and swift as a blush in the cheeks of seventeen overcame him and queen of all the thought bringing the picture of this mountain solitude to vindicate a woman shamefully assailed she who found her pleasure in these haunts of nymph and goddess at the fresh cold bosom of nature must be clear as day she trusted herself to the loneliness here and to the honour of men from a like irreflective sincereness she was unable to imagine danger where her own impelling thirst was pure the thoughts it will be discerned were but flashes of a momentary vivid sensibility where a woman's charm has won half the battle her character is an advancing standard and sings victory let her do no more than take a quiet morning walk before breakfast but why had he turned his back on her there was nothing in his presence to alarm nothing in her appearance to forbid the motive and the movement were equally quaint incomprehensible to him for after putting himself out of sight he understood the absurdity of the supposition that she would seek the secluded sylvan bath for the same purpose as he yet now he was debarred from going to meet her she might have an impulse to bathe her feet her name was diana yes and a married woman and a proclaimed one and notwithstanding those brassy facts he was ready to side with the evidence declaring her free from stain and further to swear that her blood was diana's nor had dacier ever been particularly poetical about women the present diana had wakened his curiosity had stirred his interest in her pricked his admiration but gradually until a sleepless night with its flock of raven fancies under that dominant bell ended by colouring her the moment she stood in his eyes as freshly as the morning heavens we are much influenced in youth by sleepless nights they disarm they predispose us to submit to soft occasion and in our youth occasion is always coming he heard her voice she had risen up the grass mound and he hung brooding half way down she was dressed in some texture of the hue of lavender a violet scarf loosely knotted over the bosom opened on her throat the loop of her black hair curved under a hat of gray beaver memorably radiant was her face they met exchanged greetings praised the beauty of the morning and struck together on the bell she laughed 'i heard it at ten i slept till four i never wake later i was out in the air by half past were you disturbed' he alluded to his troubles with the bell 'it sounded like a felon's heart in skeleton ribs' he said 'or a proser's tongue in a hollow skull' said she he bowed to her conversible readiness and at once fell into the background as he did only with her to perform accordant bass in their dialogue for when a woman lightly caps our strained remarks we gallantly surrender the leadership lest she should too cuttingly assert her claim some sweet wild cyclamen flowers were at her breast she held in her left hand a bunch of buds and blown cups of the pale purple meadow crocus he admired them she told him to look round he confessed to not having noticed them in the grass what was the name colchicum in botany she said 'these are plucked to be sent to a friend otherwise i'm reluctant to take the life of flowers for a whim wild flowers i mean i am not sentimental about garden flowers they are cultivated for decoration grown for clipping' 'i suppose they don't carry the same signification' said dacier in the tone of a pupil to such themes 'they carry no feeling' said she 'and that is my excuse for plucking these where they seem to spring like our town dream of happiness i believe they are sensible of it too but these must do service to my invalid friend who cannot travel are you ever as much interested in the woes of great ladies as of country damsels i am not not unless they have natural distinction you have met lady dunstane' the question sounded artless dacier answered that he thought he had seen her somewhere once and diana shut her lips on a rising under smile 'she is the coeur d'or of our time the one soul i would sacrifice these flowers to' 'a bit of a blue stocking i think i have heard said' 'she might have been admitted to the hotel rambouillet without being anything of a precieuse she is the woman of the largest heart now beating' 'mr redworth talked of her' 'as she deserved i am sure' 'very warmly' 'he would' 'he told me you were the damon and pythias of women' 'her one fault is an extreme humility that makes her always play second to me and as i am apt to gabble i take the lead and i am froth in comparison i can reverence my superiors even when tried by intimacy with them she is the next heavenly thing to heaven that i know court her if ever you come across her or have you a man's horror of women with brains' 'am i expressing it' said he 'do not breathe london or paris here on me' she fanned the crocuses under her chin 'the early morning always has this i wish i had a word touch whisper gleam beat of wings i envy poets now more than ever of eden i was going to say prose can paint evening and moonlight but poets are needed to sing the dawn that is because prose is equal to melancholy stuff gladness requires the finer language otherwise we have it coarse anything but a reproduction you politicians despise the little distinctions twixt tweedledum and tweedledee i fancy' of the poetic sort dacier's uncle certainly did for himself he confessed to not having thought much on them 'but how divine is utterance' she said 'as we to the brutes poets are to us' he listened somewhat with the head of the hanged a beautiful woman choosing to rhapsodize has her way and is not subjected to the critical commentary within us he wondered whether she had discoursed in such a fashion to his uncle 'i can read good poetry' said he 'if you would have this valley or mountain cleft one should call it described only verse could do it for you' diana pursued and stopped glanced at his face and smiled she had spied the end of a towel peeping out of one of his pockets 'you came out for a bath go back by all means and mount that rise of grass where you first saw me and down on the other side a little to the right you will find the very place for a bath at a corner of the rock a natural fountain a bubbling pool in a ring of brushwood with falling water so tempting that i could have pardoned a push about five feet deep lose no time' he begged to assure her that he would rather stroll with her it had been only a notion of bathing by chance when he pocketed the towel 'dear me' she cried 'if i had been a man i should have scurried off at a signal of release quick as a hare i once woke up in a field with my foot on its back' dacier's eyebrows knotted a trifle over her eagerness to dismiss him he was not used to it but rather to be courted by women and to condescend 'i shall not long i'm afraid have the pleasure of walking beside you and hearing you i had letters at lugano my uncle is unwell i hear' 'lord dannisburgh' the name sprang from her lips unhesitatingly his nodded affirmative altered her face and her voice 'it is not a grave illness' 'they rather fear it' 'you had the news at lugano' he answered the implied reproach 'i can be of no service' 'but surely' 'it's even doubtful that he would be bothered to receive me we hold no views in common excepting one' 'could i' she exclaimed 'o that i might if he is really ill but if it is actually serious he would perhaps have a wish i can nurse i know i have the power to cheer him you ought indeed to be in england' dacier said he had thought it better to wait for later reports 'i shall drive to lugano this afternoon and act on the information i get there probably it ends my holiday' 'will you do me the favour to write me word and especially tell me if you think he would like to have me near him' said diana 'and let him know that if he wants nursing or cheerful companionship i am at any moment ready to come' the flattery of a beautiful young woman to wait on him would be very agreeable to lord dannisburgh dacier conceived her offer to go was possibly purely charitable but the prudence of her occupation of the post obscured whatever appeared admirable in her devotedness her choice of a man like lord dannisburgh for the friend to whom she could sacrifice her good name less falteringly than she gathered those field flowers was inexplicable and she herself a darker riddle at each step of his reading he promised curtly to write 'i will do my best to hit a flying address' 'your club enables me to hit a permanent one that will establish the communication' said diana 'we shall not sleep another night at rovio lady esquart is the lightest of sleepers and if you had a restless time she and her husband must have been in purgatory besides permit me to say you should be with your party the times are troublous not for holidays your holiday has had a haunted look creditably to your conscience as a politician these corn law agitations' 'ah but no politics here' said dacier 'politics everywhere in the courts of faery they are not discord to me' 'but not the last day the last hour' he pleaded 'well only do not forget your assurance to me that you would give some thoughts to ireland and the cause of women has it slipped from your memory' 'if i see the chance of serving you you may trust to me' she sent up an interjection on the misfortune of her not having been born a man it was to him the one smart of sourness in her charm as a woman among the boulder stones of the ascent to the path he ventured to propose a little masculine assistance in a hand stretched mutely although there was no great need for help her natural kindliness checked the inclination to refuse it when their hands disjoined she found herself reddening she cast it on the exertion her heart was throbbing it might be the exertion likewise he walked and talked much more airily along the descending pathway as if he had suddenly become more intimately acquainted with her she listened trying to think of the manner in which he might be taught to serve that cause she had at heart and the colour deepened on her cheeks till it set fire to her underlying consciousness blood to spirit a tremour of alarm ran through her his request for one of the crocuses to keep as a souvenir of the morning was refused 'they are sacred they were all devoted to my friend when i plucked them' he pointed to a half open one with the petals in disparting pointing to junction and compared it to the famous tiptoe ballet posture arms above head and fingers like swallows meeting in air of an operatic danseuse of the time 'i do not see it because i will not see it' she said and she found a personal cooling and consolement in the phrase we have this power of resisting invasion of the poetic by the commonplace the spirit by the blood if we please though you men may not think that we have her alarmed sensibilities bristled and made head against him as an enemy she fancied for the aforesaid reason because she chose that it was on account of the offence to her shy morning pleasure by his londonizing at any other moment her natural liveliness and trained social ease would have taken any remark on the eddies of the tide of converse and so she told herself and did not the less feel wounded adverse armed he seemed somehow to have dealt a mortal blow to the happy girl she had become again the woman she was protested on behalf of the girl while the girl in her heart bent lowered sad eyelids to the woman and which of them was wiser of the truth she could not have said for she was honestly not aware of the truth but she knew she was divided in halves with one half pitying the other one rebuking and all because of the incongruous comparison of a wild flower to an opera dancer absurd indeed we human creatures are the silliest on earth most certainly dacier had observed the blush and the check to her flowing tongue did not escape him as they walked back to the inn down the narrow street of black rooms where the women gossiped at the fountain and the cobbler threaded on his doorstep his novel excitement supplied the deficiency sweeping him past minor reflections he was however surprised to hear her tell lady esquart as soon as they were together at the breakfast table that he had the intention of starting for england and further surprised and slightly stung too when on the poor lady's moaning over her recollection of the midnight bell and vowing she could not attempt to sleep another night in the place diana declared her resolve to stay there one day longer with her maid and explore the neighbourhood for the wild flowers in which it abounded lord and lady esquart agreed to anything agreeable to her after excusing themselves for the necessitated flight piteously relating the story of their sufferings my lord could have slept but he had remained awake to comfort my lady 'true knightliness' diana said in praise of these long married lovers and she asked them what they had talked of during the night 'you my dear partly' said lady esquart 'for an opiate' 'an invocation of the morning' said dacier lady esquart looked at diana and at him she thought it was well that her fair friend should stay it was then settled for diana to rejoin them the next evening at lugano thence to proceed to luino on the maggiore 'i fear it is good bye for me' dacier said to her as he was about to step into the carriage with the esquarts 'if you have not better news of your uncle it must be' she replied and gave him her hand promptly and formally hardly diverting her eyes from lady esquart to grace the temporary gift with a look the last of her he saw was a waving of her arm and finger pointing triumphantly at the bell in the tower it said to an understanding unpractised in the feminine mysteries 'i can sleep through anything' what that revealed of her state of conscience and her nature his efforts to preserve the lovely optical figure blocked his guessing he was with her friends who liked her the more they knew her and he was compelled to lean to their view of the perplexing woman 'she is a riddle to the world' lady esquart said 'but i know that she is good it is the best of signs when women take to her and are proud to be her friend' my lord echoed his wife she talked in this homely manner to stop any notion of philandering that the young gentleman might be disposed to entertain in regard to a lady so attractive to the pursuit as diana's beauty and delicate situation might make her seem 'she is an exceedingly clever person and handsomer than report which is uncommon' said dacier becoming voluble on town topics miss asper incidentally among them he denied lady esquart's charge of an engagement the matter hung his letters at lugano summoned him to england instantly 'i have taken leave of mrs warwick but tell her i regret et caetera' he said 'and by the way as my uncle's illness appears to be serious the longer she is absent the better perhaps' 'it would never do' said lady esquart understanding his drift immediately 'we winter in rome she will not abandon us i have her word for it next easter we are in paris and so home i suppose there will be no hurry before we are due at cowes we seem to have become confirmed wanderers for two of us at least it is likely to be our last great tour' dacier informed her that he had pledged his word to write to mrs warwick of his uncle's condition and the several appointed halting places of the esquarts between the lakes and florence were named to him thus all things were openly treated all had an air of being on the surface the communications passing between mrs warwick and the hon percy dacier might have been perused by all the world none but that portion of it sage in suspiciousness which objects to such communications under any circumstances could have detected in their correspondence a spark of coming fire or that there was common warmth she did not feel it nor did he the position of the two interdicted it to a couple honourably sensible of social decencies and who were be it added kept apart the blood is the treacherous element in the story of the nobly civilized of which secret diana a wife and no wife a prisoner in liberty a blooming woman imagining herself restored to transcendent maiden ecstacies the highest youthful poetic had received some faint intimation when the blush flamed suddenly in her cheeks and her heart knelled like the towers of a city given over to the devourer she had no wish to meet him again without telling herself why she would have shunned the meeting disturbers that thwarted her simple happiness in sublime scenery were best avoided she thought so the more for a fitful blur to the simplicity of her sensations and a task she sometimes had in restoring and toning them after that sweet morning time in rovio chapter xvii 'the princess egeria' london say what we will of it is after all the head of the british giant and if not the liveliest in bubbles it is past competition the largest broth pot of brains anywhere simmering on the hob over the steadiest of furnaces too and the oceans and the continents as you know are perpetual and copious contributors either to the heating apparatus or to the contents of the pot let grander similes besought this one fits for the smoky receptacle cherishing millions magnetic to tens of millions more with its caked outside of grime and the inward substance incessantly kicking the lid prankish but never casting it off a good stew you perceive not a parlous boiling weak as we may be in our domestic cookery our political has been sagaciously adjusted as yet to catch the ardours of the furnace without being subject to their volcanic activities that the social is also somewhat at fault we have proof in occasional outcries over the absence of these or those particular persons famous for inspiriting it sticks and clogs the improvising songster is missed the convivial essayist the humorous dean the travelled cynic and he the one of his day the iridescent irishman whose remembered repartees are a feast sharp and ringing at divers tables descending from the upper to the fat citizen's where instead of coming in the sequence of talk they are exposed by blasting like fossil teeth of old deluge sharks in monotonous walls of our chalk quarries nor are these the less welcome for the violence of their introduction among a people glad to be set burning rather briskly awhile by the most unexpected of digs in the ribs dan merion to give an example that was dan merion's joke with the watchman and he said that other thing to the marquis of kingsbury when the latter asked him if he had ever won a donkey race and old dan is dead and we are the duller for it which leads to the question is genius hereditary and the affirmative and negative are respectively maintained rather against the yes is the dispute until a member of the audience speaks of dan merion's having left a daughter reputed for a sparkling wit not much below the level of his own why are you unaware that the mrs warwick of that scandal case of warwick versus dannisburgh was old dan merion's girl and his only child it is true for a friend had it from a man who had it straight from mr braddock of the firm of braddock thorpe and simnel her solicitors in the action who told him he could sit listening to her for hours and that she was as innocent as day a wonderful combination of a good woman and a clever woman and a real beauty only her misfortune was to have a furiously jealous husband and they say he went mad after hearing the verdict diana was talked of in the london circles a witty woman is such salt that where she has once been tasted she must perforce be missed more than any of the absent the dowering heavens not having yet showered her like very plentifully upon us then it was first heard that percy dacier had been travelling with her miss asper heard of it her uncle mr quintin manx the millionnaire was an acquaintance of the new judge and titled dignitary sir cramborne wathin and she visited lady wathin at whose table the report in the journals of the nile boat party was mentioned lady wathin's table could dispense with witty women and for that matter witty men the intrusion of the spontaneous on the stereotyped would have clashed she preferred as hostess the old legal anecdotes sure of their laugh and the citations from the manufactories of fun in the press which were current and instantly intelligible to all her guests she smiled suavely on an impromptu pun because her experience of the humorous appreciation of it by her guests bade her welcome the upstart nothing else impromptu was acceptable mrs warwick therefore was not missed by lady wathin 'i have met her' she said 'i confess i am not one of the fanatics about mrs warwick she has a sort of skill in getting men to clamour if you stoop to tickle them they will applaud it is a way of winning a reputation' when the ladies were separated from the gentlemen by the stream of claret miss asper heard lady wathin speak of mrs warwick again an allusion to lord dannisburgh's fit of illness in the house of lords led to her saying that there was no doubt he had been fascinated and that in her opinion mrs warwick was a dangerous woman sir cramborne knew something of mr warwick 'poor man' she added a lady present put a question concerning mrs warwick's beauty 'yes' lady wathin said 'she has good looks to aid her judging from what i hear and have seen her thirst is for notoriety sooner or later we shall have her making a noise you may be certain yes she has the secret of dressing well in the french style' a simple newspaper report of the expedition of a nileboat party could stir the powers to take her up and turn her on their wheel in this manner but others of the sons and daughters of london were regretting her prolonged absence the great and exclusive whitmonby who had dined once at lady wathin's table and vowed never more to repeat that offence to his patience lamented bitterly to henry wilmers that the sole woman worthy of sitting at a little sunday evening dinner with the cream of the choicest men of the time was away wasting herself in that insane modern chase of the picturesque he called her a perverted celimene redworth had less to regret than the rest of her male friends as he was receiving at intervals pleasant descriptive letters besides manuscript sheets of antonia's new piece of composition to correct the proofs for the press and he read them critically he thought he read them with a watchful eye to guard them from the critics antonia whatever her faults as a writer was not one of the order whose muse is the public taste she did at least draw her inspiration from herself and there was much to be feared in her work if a sale was the object otherwise redworth's highly critical perusal led him flatly to admire this was like her and that was like her and here and there a phrase gave him the very play of her mouth the flash of her eyes could he possibly wish or bear to have anything altered but she had reason to desire an extended sale of the work her aim in the teeth of her independent style was at the means of independence a feminine method of attempting to conciliate contraries and after despatching the last sheets to the printer he meditated upon the several ways which might serve to assist her the main way running thus in his mind we have a work of genius genius is good for the public what is good for the public should be recommended by the critics it should be how then to come at them to get it done as he was not a member of the honourable literary craft and regarded its arcana altogether externally it may be confessed of him that he deemed the incorruptible corruptible not of course with filthy coin slid into sticky palms critics are human and exceedingly beyond the common lot when touched and they are excited by mysterious hints of loftiness in authorship by rumours of veiled loveliness whispers of a general anticipation and also editors can jog them redworth was rising to be a railway king of a period soon to glitter with rails iron in the concrete golden in the visionary he had already his court much against his will the powerful magnetic attractions of those who can help the world to fortune was exercised by him in spite of his disgust of sycophants he dropped words to right and left of a coming work by antonia and who was antonia ah there hung the riddle an exalted personage so much so that he dared not name her even in confidence to ladies he named the publishers to men he said he was at liberty to speak of her only as the most beautiful woman of her time his courtiers of both sexes were recommended to read the new story the princess egeria oddly one great lady of his court had heard a forthcoming work of this title spoken of by percy dacier not a man to read silly fiction unless there was meaning behind the lines that is rich scandal of the aristocracy diversified by stinging epigrams to the address of discernible personages she talked of the princess egeria nay laid her finger on the identical princess others followed her dozens were soon flying with the torch a new work immediately to be published from the pen of the duchess of stars and the princess who lends her title to the book is a living portrait of the princess of highest eminence the hope of all civilization orders for copies of the princess egeria reached the astonished publishers before the book was advertized speaking to editors redworth complimented them with friendly intimations of the real authorship of the remarkable work appearing he used a certain penetrative mildness of tone in saying that 'he hoped the book would succeed' it deserved to it was original but the originality might tell against it all would depend upon a favourable launching of such a book 'mrs warwick mrs warwick' said the most influential of editors mr marcus tonans 'what that singularly handsome woman the dannisburgh affair she's whitmonby's heroine if she writes as cleverly as she talks her work is worth trumpeting' he promised to see that it went into good hands for the review and a prompt review an essential point none of your long digestions of the contents diana's indefatigable friend had fair assurances that her book would be noticed before it dropped dead to the public appetite for novelty he was anxious next notwithstanding his admiration of the originality of the conception and the cleverness of the writing lest the literary reviews should fail 'to do it justice' he used the term for if they wounded her they would take the pleasure out of success and he had always present to him that picture of the beloved woman kneeling at the fire grate at the crossways which made the thought of her suffering any wound his personal anguish so crucially sweet and saintly had her image then been stamped on him he bethought him in consequence while sitting in the house of commons engaged upon the affairs of the nation and honestly engaged for he was a vigilant worker that the irish secretary charles raiser with whom he stood in amicable relations had an interest to the extent of reputed ownership in the chief of the literary reviews he saw raiser on the benches and marked him to speak for him looking for him shortly afterward the man was gone 'off to the opera if he's not too late for the drop' a neighbour said smiling queerly as though he ought to know and then redworth recollected current stories of raiser's fantastical devotion to the popular prima donna of the angelical voice he hurried to the opera and met the vomit and heard in the crushroom how divine she had been that night a fellow member of the house tolerably intimate with raiser informed him between frightful stomachic roulades of her final aria of the likeliest place where raiser might be found when the opera was over not at his club nor at his chambers on one of the bridges westminster he fancied there was no need for redworth to run hunting the man at so late an hour but he was drawn on by the similarity in dissimilarity of this devotee of a woman who could worship her at a distance and talk of her to everybody not till he beheld raiser's tall figure cutting the bridge parapet with a star over his shoulder did he reflect on the views the other might entertain of the nocturnal solicitation to see 'justice done' to a lady's new book in a particular review and the absurd outside of the request was immediately smothered by the natural simplicity and pressing necessity of its inside he crossed the road and said 'ah' in recognition 'were you at the opera this evening' 'oh just at the end' said raiser pacing forward 'it's a fine night did you hear her' 'no too late' raiser pressed ahead to meditate by himself as was his wont finding redworth beside him he monologuized in his depths 'they'll kill her she puts her soul into it gives her blood there 's no failing of the voice you see how it wears her she's doomed half a year's rest on como somewhere she might be saved she won't refuse to work' 'have you spoken to her' said redworth 'and next to berlin vienna a horse would be i i don't know her' raiser replied 'some of their women stand it she's delicately built you can't treat a lute like a drum without destroying the instrument we look on at a murder' the haggard prospect from that step of the climax checked his delivery redworth knew him to be a sober man in office a man with a head for statecraft he had made a weighty speech in the house a couple of hours back this opera cantatrice no beauty though gentle thrilling winning was his corner of romance 'do you come here often' he asked 'yes i can't sleep' 'london at night from the bridge looks fine by the way' 'it 's lonely here that's the advantage' said rainer 'i keep silver in my pocket for poor girls going to their homes and i'm left in peace an hour later there's the dawn down yonder' 'by the way' redworth interposed and was told that after these nights of her singing she never slept till morning he swallowed the fact sympathized and resumed 'i want a small favour' 'no business here please' 'not a bit of it you know mrs warwick you know of her she 's publishing a book i want you to use your influence to get it noticed quickly if you can' 'warwick oh yes a handsome woman ah yes the dannisburgh affair yes what did i hear they say she 's thick with percy dacier at present who was talking of her yes old lady dacier so she 's a friend of yours' 'she's an old friend' said redworth composing himself for the dose he had taken was not of the sweetest and no protestations could be uttered by a man of the world to repel a charge of tattlers 'the truth is her book is clever i have read the proofs she must have an income and she won't apply to her husband and literature should help her if she 's fairly treated she 's irish by descent merion's daughter witty as her father it's odd you haven't met her the mere writing of the book is extraordinarily good if it 's put into capable hands for review that's all it requires and full of life bright dialogue capital sketches the book's a piece of literature only it must have competent critics' so he talked while rainer ejaculated 'warwick warwick' in the irritating tone of dozens of others 'what did i hear of her husband he has a post yes yes some one said the verdict in that case knocked him over heart disease or something' he glanced at the dark thames water 'take my word for it the groves of academe won't compare with one of our bridges at night if you seek philosophy you see the london above and the london below round us the sleepy city and the stars in the water looking like souls of suicides i caught a girl with a bad fit on her once i had to lecture her it's when we become parsons we find out our cousinship with these poor peripatetics whose last philosophy is a jump across the parapet the bridge at night is a bath for a public man but choose another leave me mine' redworth took the hint he stated the title of mrs warwick's book and imagined from the thoughtful cast of rainer's head that he was impressing the princess egeria on his memory rainer burst out with clenched fists 'he beats her the fellow lives on her and beats her strikes that woman he drags her about to every capital in europe to make money for him and the scoundrel pays her with blows' in the course of a heavy tirade against the scoundrel redworth apprehended that it was the cantatrice's husband he expressed his horror and regret paused and named the princess egeria and a certain critical review another outburst seemed to be in preparation nothing further was to be done for the book at that hour so with a blunt 'good night' he left charles rainer pacing and thought on his walk home of the strange effects wrought by women unwittingly upon men englishmen those women or some of them as little knowing it as the moon her traditional influence upon the tides he thought of percy dacier too in his bed he could have wished himself peregrinating a bridge the princess egeria appeared with the reviews at her heels a pack of clappers causing her to fly over editions clean as a doe the gates and hedges to quote mr sullivan smith who knew not a sentence of the work save what he gathered of it from redworth at their chance meeting on piccadilly pavement and then immediately he knew enough to blow his huntsman's horn in honour of the sale his hallali rang high 'here's another irish girl to win their laurels 'tis one of the blazing successes a most enthralling work beautifully composed and where is she now mr redworth since she broke away from that husband of hers that wears the clothes of the worst tailor ever begotten by a thread on a needle as i tell every soul of 'em in my part of the country' 'you have seen him' said redworth 'why sir wasn't he on show at the court he applied to for relief and damages as we heard when we were watching the case daily scarce drawing our breath for fear the innocent and one of our own blood would be crushed sure there he stood ay and looking the very donkey for a woman to flip off her fingers like the dust from my great uncle's prise of snuff she's a glory to the old country and better you than another i'd say since it wasn't an irishman to have her but what induced the dear lady to take him is the question we 're all of us asking and it's mournful to think that somehow you contrive to get the pick of us in the girls if ever we 're united 'twill be by a trick of circumvention of that sort pretty sure there's a turn in the market when they shut their eyes and drop to the handiest and london's a vortex that poor dear dull old dublin can't compete with i 'll beg you for the address of the lady her friend lady dunstane' mr sullivan smith walked with redworth through the park to the house of commons discoursing of rails and his excellent old friend's rise to the top rung of the ladder and beanstalk land so elevated that one had to look up at him with watery eyes as if one had flung a ball at the meridian sun arrived at famed st stephen's he sent in his compliments to the noble patriot and accepted an invitation to dinner 'and mind you read the princess egeria' said redworth 'again and again my friend the book is bought' sullivan smith slapped his breastpocket 'there's a bit of erin in it' 'it sprouts from erin' 'trumpet it' 'loud as cavalry to the charge' once with the title stamped on his memory the zealous irishman might be trusted to become an ambulant advertizer others personal friends adherents courtiers of redworth's were active lady pennon and henry wilmers in the upper circle whitmonby and westlake in the literary spread the fever for this new book the chief interpreter of public opinion caught the way of the wind and headed the gale editions of the book did really run like fires in summer furze and to such an extent that a simple literary performance grew to be respected in great britain as representing money chapter xviii the authoress the effect of a great success upon diana at her second literary venture was shown in the transparent sedateness of a letter she wrote to emma dunstane as much as in her immediate and complacent acceptance of the magical change of her fortunes she spoke one thing and acted another but did both with a lofty calm that deceived the admiring friend who clearly saw the authoress behind her mask and feared lest she should be too confidently trusting to the powers of her pen to support an establishment 'if the public were a perfect instrument to strike on i should be tempted to take the wonderful success of my princess at her first appearance for a proof of natural aptitude in composition and might think myself the genius i know it to be as little a stradivarius as i am a paganini it is an eccentric machine in tune with me for the moment because i happen to have hit it in the ringing spot the book is a new face appealing to a mirror of the common surface emotions and the kitchen rather than the dairy offers an analogy for the real value of that top skim i have not seen what i consider good in the book once mentioned among the laudatory notices except by your dear hand my emmy be sure i will stand on guard against the vaporous generalizations and other tricks you fear now that you are studying latin for an occupation how good and wise it was of mr redworth to propose it i look upon you with awe as a classic authority and critic i wish i had leisure to study with you what i do is nothing like so solid and durable 'the princess egeria' originally i must have written word of it to you i remember the evening off palermo was conceived as a sketch by gradations she grew into a sort of semi scudery romance and swelled to her present portliness that was done by a great deal of piecing not to say puffing of her frame she would be healthier and have a chance of living longer if she were reduced by a reversal of the processes but how would the judicious clippings and prickings affect our pensive public now that i have furnished a house and have a fixed address under the paws of creditors i feel i am in the wizard circle of my popularity and subscribe to its laws or waken to incubus and the desert have i been rash you do not pronounce if i have bound myself to pipe as others please it need not be entirely and i can promise you it shall not be but still i am sensible when i lift my little quill of having forced the note of a woodland wren into the popular nightingale's which may end in the daw's from straining or worse a toy whistle 'that is in the field of literature otherwise within me deep i am not aware of any transmutation of the celestial into coined gold i sound myself and ring clear incessant writing is my refuge my solace escape out of the personal net i delight in it as in my early morning walks at lugano when i went threading the streets and by the lake away to the heavenly mount like a dim idea worming upward in a sleepy head to bright wakefulness 'my anonymous critic of whom i told you is intoxicating with eulogy the signature apollonius appears to be of literary middle indication he marks passages approved by you i have also had a complimentary letter from mr dacier 'for an instance of this delight i have in writing so strong is it that i can read pages i have written and tear the stuff to strips i did yesterday and resume as if nothing had happened the waves within are ready for any displacement that must be a good sign i do not doubt of excelling my princess and if she received compliments the next may hope for more consider too the novel pleasure of earning money by the labour we delight in it is an answer to your question whether i am happy yes as the savage islander before the ship entered the bay with the fire water my blood is wine and i have the slumbers of an infant i dream wake forget my dream barely dress before the pen is galloping barely breakfast no toilette till noon a savage in good sooth you see my emmy i could not house with the companionable person you hint at the poles can never come together till the earth is crushed she would find my habits intolerable and i hers contemptible though we might both be companionable persons my dear i could not even live with myself my blessed little quill which helps me divinely to live out of myself is and must continue to be my one companion it is my mountain height morning light wings cup from the springs my horse my goal my lancet and replenisher my key of communication with the highest grandest holiest between earth and heaven the vital air connecting them 'in justice let me add that i have not been troubled by hearing of any of the mysterious legal claims et caetera i am sorry to hear bad reports of health i wish him entire felicity no step taken to bridge division the thought of it makes me tigrish 'a new pianist playing his own pieces at lady singleby's concert has given me exquisite pleasure' and set me composing songs not to his music which could be rendered only by sylphs moving to soft recorders in the humour of wildness languor bewitching caprices giving a new sense to melody how i wish you had been with me to hear him it was the most aeolian thing ever caught from a night breeze by the soul of a poet 'but do not suppose me having headlong tendencies to the melting mood the above by the way is a pole settled in paris and he is to be introduced to me at lady pennon's what do you say to my being invited by mr whitmonby to aid him in writing leading articles for the paper he is going to conduct write as you talk and it will do he says i am choosing my themes to write of politics as i talk seems to me like an effort to jump away from my shadow the black dog of consciousness declines to be shaken off if some one commanded me to talk as i write i suspect it would be a way of winding me up to a sharp critical pitch rapidly 'not good news of lord d i have had messages mr dacier conceals his alarm the princess gave great gratification she did me her best service there is it not cruel that the interdict of the censor should force me to depend for information upon such scraps as i get from a gentleman passing my habitation on his way to the house and he is not he never has been sympathetic in that direction he sees my grief and assumes an undertakerly air with some notion of acting in concert one supposes little imagining how i revolt from that crape hatband formalism of sorrow 'one word of her we call our inner i i am not drawing upon her resources for my daily needs not wasting her at all i trust certainly not walling her up to deafen her voice it would be to fall away from you she bids me sign myself my beloved ever ever your tony' the letter had every outward show of sincereness in expression and was endowed to wear that appearance by the writer's impulse to protest with so resolute a vigour as to delude herself lady dunstane heard of mr dacier's novel attendance at concerts the world made a note of it for the gentleman was notoriously without ear for music diana's comparison of her hours of incessant writing to her walks under the dawn at lugano her boast of the similarity of her delight in both deluded her uncorrupted conscience to believe that she was now spiritually as free as in that fair season of the new spring in her veins she was not an investigating physician nor was lady dunstane otherwise they would have examined the material points of her conduct indicators of the spiritual secret always what are the patient's acts the patient's mind was projected too far beyond them to see the fore finger they stretched at her and the friend's was not that of a prying doctor on the look out for betraying symptoms lady dunstane did ask herself why tony should have incurred the burden of a costly household a very costly sir lukin had been at one of tony's little' dinners but her wish to meet the world on equal terms after a long dependency accounted for it in seeming to excuse the guests on the occasion were lady pennon lady singleby mr whitmonby mr percy dacier mr tonans 'some other woman' sir lukin said and himself he reported the cookery as matching the conversation and that was princely the wines not less an extraordinary fact to note of a woman but to hear whitmonby and diana warwick how he told a story neat as a postman's knock and she tipped it with a remark and ran to a second drawing in lady pennon and then dacier 'and me' cried sir lukin 'she made us all toss the ball from hand to hand and all talk up to the mark and none of us noticed that we all went together to the drawing room where we talked for another hour and broke up fresher than we began' 'that break between the men and the women after dinner was tony's aversion and i am glad she has instituted a change' said lady dunstane she heard also from redworth of the unexampled concert of the guests at mrs warwick's dinner parties he had met on one occasion the esquarts the pettigrews mr percy dacier and a miss paynham redworth had not a word to say of the expensive household whatever mrs warwick did was evidently good to him on another evening the party was composed of lady pennon lord larrian miss paynham a clever mrs wollasley mr henry wilmers and again mr percy dacier when diana came to copsley lady dunstane remarked on the recurrence of the name of miss paynham in the list of her guests 'and mr percy dacier's too' said diana smiling 'they are invited each for specific reasons it pleases lord dannisburgh to hear that a way has been found to enliven his nephew and my little dinners are effective i think he wakes yesterday evening he capped flying jests with mr sullivan smith but you speak of miss paynham' diana lowered her voice on half a dozen syllables till the half tones dropped into her steady look 'you approve emmy' the answer was 'i do true or not' 'between us two dear i fear in either case she has been badly used society is big engine enough to protect itself i incline with british juries to do rough justice to the victims she has neither father nor brother i have had no confidences but it wears the look of a cowardly business with two words in his ear i could arm an irishman to do some work of chastisement he would select the rascal's necktie for a cause of quarrel and lords have to stand their ground as well as commoners they measure the same number of feet when stretched their length however vengeance with the heavens though they seem tardy lady pennon has been very kind about it and the esquarts invite her to lockton shoulder to shoulder the tide may be stemmed' 'she would have gone under but for you dear tony' said emma' folding arms round her darling's neck anal kissing her 'bring her here some day' diana did not promise it she had her vision of sir lukin in his fit of lunacy 'i am too weak for london now' emma resumed 'i should like to be useful is she pleasant' 'sprightly by nature she has worn herself with fretting' 'then bring her to stay with me if i cannot keep you she will talk of you to me' 'i will bring her for a couple of days' diana said 'i am too busy to remain longer she paints portraits to amuse herself she ought to be pushed wherever she is received about london while the season is warm one season will suffice to establish her she is pretty near upon six and twenty foolish of course she pays for having had a romantic head heavy payment emmy i drive at laws but hers is an instance of the creatures wanting simple human kindness' 'the good law will come with a better civilization but before society can be civilized it has to be debarbarized' emma remarked and diana sighed over the task and the truism i should have said in younger days because it will not look plainly on our nature and try to reconcile it with our conditions but now i see that the sin is cowardice the more i know of the world the more clearly i perceive that its top and bottom sin is cowardice physically and morally alike lord larrian owns to there being few heroes in an army we must fawn in society what is the meaning of that dread of one example of tolerance o my dear let us give it the right name society is the best thing we have but it is a crazy vessel worked by a crew that formerly practised piracy and now in expiation professes piety fearful of a discovered omnipotence which is in the image of themselves and captain their old habits are not quite abandoned and their new one is used as a lash to whip the exposed of us for a propitiation of the capricious potentate whom they worship in the place of the true god' lady dunstane sniffed 'i smell the leading article' diana joined with her smile 'no the style is rather different' 'have you not got into a trick of composing in speaking at times' diana confessed 'i think i have at times perhaps the daily writing of all kinds and the nightly talking i may be getting strained' 'no tony but longer visits in the country to me would refresh you i miss your lighter touches london is a school but you know it not a school for comedy nor for philosophy that is gathered on my hills with london distantly in view and then occasional descents on it well digested' 'i wonder whether it is affecting me' said diana musing 'a metropolitan hack and while thinking myself free thrice harnessed and all my fun gone am i really as dull as a tract my dear i must be or i should be proving the contrary instead of asking my pitfall is to fancy i have powers equal to the first look out of the eyes of the morning enough of me we talked of mary paynham if only some right good man would marry her' lady dunstane guessed at the right good man in diana's mind 'do you bring them together' diana nodded and then shook doleful negatives to signify no hope 'none whatever if we mean the same person' said lady dunstane bethinking her in the spirit of wrath she felt at such a scheme being planned by diana to snare the right good man that instead of her own true lover redworth it might be only percy dacier so filmy of mere sensations are these little ideas as they flit in converse that she did not reflect on her friend's ignorance of redworth's love of her or on the unlikely choice of one in dacier's high station to reinstate a damsel they did not name the person 'passing the instance which is cruel i will be just to society thus far' said diana 'i was in a boat at richmond last week and leander was revelling along the mud banks and took it into his head to swim out to me and i was moved to take him on board the ladies in the boat objected for he was not only wet but very muddy i was forced to own that their objections were reasonable my sentimental humaneness had no argument against muslin dresses though my dear dog's eyes appealed pathetically and he would keep swimming after us the analogy excuses the world for protecting itself in extreme cases nothing nothing excuses its insensibility to cases which may be pleaded you see the pirate crew turned pious ferocious in sanctity' she added half laughing 'i am reminded by the boat i have unveiled my anonymous critic and had a woeful disappointment he wrote like a veteran he is not much more than a boy i received a volume of verse and a few lines begging my acceptance i fancied i knew the writing and wrote asking him whether i had not to thank him and inviting him to call he seems a nice lad of about two and twenty mad for literature and he must have talent arthur rhodes by name i may have a chance of helping him he was an articled clerk of mr braddock's the same who valiantly came to my rescue once he was with us in the boat' 'bring him to me some day' said lady dunstane miss paynham's visit to copsley was arranged and it turned out a failure the poor young lady came in a flutter thinking that the friend of mrs warwick would expect her to discourse cleverly she attempted it to diana's amazement lady dunstane's opposingly corresponding stillness provoked miss paynham to expatiate for she had sprightliness and some mental reserves of the common order clearly lady dunstane mused while listening amiably tony never could have designed this gabbler for the mate of thomas redworth percy dacier seemed to her the more likely one in that light and she thought so still after sir lukin had introduced him at copsley for a couple of days of the hunting season tony's manner with him suggested it she had a dash of leadership they were not intimate in look or tongue but percy dacier also was too good for miss paynham if that was tony's plan for him lady dunstane thought with the relentlessness of an invalid and recluse's distaste an aspect of penitence she had not demanded but the silly gabbier under a stigma she could not pardon her opinion of miss paynham was diffused in her silence speaking of mr dacier she remarked 'as you say of him tony he can brighten and when you give him a chance he is entertaining he has fine gifts if i were a member of his family i should beat about for a match for him he strikes me as one of the young men who would do better married' 'he is doing very well but the wonder is that he doesn't marry' said diana 'he ought to be engaged lady esquart told me that he was a miss asper great heiress and the daciers want money however there it is' not many weeks later diana could not have spoken of mr percy dacier with this air of indifference without corruption of her inward guide chapter xix a drive in sunlight and a drive in moonlight the fatal time to come for her was in the summer of that year emma had written her a letter of unwonted bright spirits contrasting strangely with an inexplicable oppression of her own that led her to imagine her recent placid life the pause before thunder and to sharp the mood of her solitary friend she flew to copsley finding sir lukin absent as usual they drove out immediately after breakfast on one of those high mornings of the bared bosom of june when distances are given to our eyes and a soft air fondles leaf and grass blade and beauty and peace are overhead reflected if we will rain had fallen in the night here and there hung a milk white cloud with folded sail the south west left it in its bay of blue and breathed below at moments the fresh scent of herb and mould swung richly in warmth the young beech leaves glittered pools of rain water made the roadways laugh the grass banks under hedges rolled their interwoven weeds in cascades of many shaded green to right and left of the pair of dappled ponies and a squirrel crossed ahead a lark went up a little way to ease his heart closing his wings when the burst was over startled black birds darting with a clamour like a broken cockcrow looped the wayside woods from hazel to oak scrub short flights quick spirts everywhere steady sunshine above diana held the reins the whip was an ornament as the plume of feathers to the general officer lady dunstane's ponies were a present from redworth who always chose the pick of the land for his gifts they joyed in their trot and were the very love birds of the breed for their pleasure of going together so like that diana called them the dromios through an old gravel cutting a gateway led to the turf of the down springy turf bordered on a long line clear as a racecourse by golden gorse covers and leftward over the gorse the dark ridge of the fir and heath country ran companionably to the southwest the valley between with undulations of wood and meadow sunned or shaded clumps mounds promontories away to broad spaces of tillage banked by wooded hills and dimmer beyond and farther the faintest shadowiness of heights as a veil to the illimitable yews junipers radiant beeches and gleams of the service tree or the white beam spotted the semicircle of swelling green down black and silver the sun in the valley sharpened his beams on squares of buttercups and made a pond a diamond 'you see tony' emma said for a comment on the scene 'i could envy italy for having you more than you for being in italy' 'feature and colour' said diana 'you have them here and on a scale that one can embrace i should like to build a hut on this point and wait for such a day to return it brings me to life' she lifted her eyelids on her friend's worn sweet face and knowing her this friend up to death past it in her hopes she said bravely 'it is the emma of days and scenes to me it helps me to forget myself as i do when i think of you dearest but the subject has latterly been haunting me i don't know why and ominously as if my nature were about to horrify my soul but i am not sentimentalizing you are really this day and scene in my heart' emma smiled confidingly she spoke her reflection 'the heart must be troubled a little to have the thought the flower i gather here tells me that we may be happy in privation and suffering if simply we can accept beauty i won't say expel the passions but keep passion sober a trotter in harness' diana caressed the ponies' heads with the droop of her whip 'i don't think i know him' she said between sincerity and a suspicion so cloaked and dull that she did not feel it to be the opposite of candour she fancied she was passionless because she could accept the visible beauty which was emma's prescription and test and she forced herself to make much of it cling to it devour it with envy of emma's contemplative happiness through whose grave mind she tried to get to the peace in it imagining that she succeeded the cloaked and dull suspicion weighed within her nevertheless she took it for a mania to speculate on herself there are states of the crimson blood when the keenest wits are childish notably in great hearted women aiming at the majesty of their sex and fearful of confounding it by the look direct and the downright word yet her nature compelled her inwardly to phrase the sentence 'emma is a wife' the character of her husband was not considered nor was the meaning of the exclamation pursued they drove through the gorse into wild land of heath and flowering hawthorn and along by tracts of yew and juniper to another point jutting on a furzy sand mound rich with the mild splendour of english scenery which emma stamped on her friend's mind by saying 'a cripple has little to envy in you who can fly when she has feasts like these at her doors' they had an inclination to boast on the drive home of the solitude they had enjoyed and just then as the road in the wood wound under great beeches they beheld a london hat the hat was plucked from its head a clear faced youth rather flushed dusty at the legs addressed diana 'mr rhodes' she said not discouragingly she was petitioned to excuse him he thought she would wish to hear the news in town last night as early as possible he hesitated and murmured it diana turned to emma 'lord dannisburgh' her paleness told the rest hearing from mr rhodes that he had walked the distance from town and had been to copsley lady dunstane invited him to follow the pony carriage thither where he was fed and refreshed by a tea breakfast as he preferred walking on tea he said 'i took the liberty to call at mrs warwick's house' he informed her 'the footman said she was at copsley i found it on the map i knew the directions and started about two in the morning i wanted a walk' it was evident to her that he was one of the young squires bewitched whom beautiful women are constantly enlisting there was no concealment of it though he stirred a sad enviousness in the invalid lady by descanting on the raptures of a walk out of london in the youngest light of day and on the common objects he had noticed along the roadside and through the woods more sustaining closer with nature than her compulsory feeding on the cream of things 'you are not fatigued' she inquired hoping for that confession at least but she pardoned his boyish vaunting to walk the distance back without any fatigue at all he had a sweeter reward for his pains and if the business of the chronicler allowed him to become attached to pure throbbing felicity wherever it is encountered he might be diverted by the blissful unexpectedness of good fortune befalling mr arthur rhodes in having the honour to conduct mrs warwick to town no imagined happiness even in the heart of a young man of two and twenty could have matched it he was by her side hearing and seeing her not less than four hours to add to his happiness lady dunstane said she would be glad to welcome him again she thought him a pleasant specimen of the self vowed squire diana was sure that there would be a communication for her of some sort at her house in london perhaps a message of farewell from the dying lord now dead mr rhodes had only the news of the evening journals to the effect that lord dannisburgh had expired at his residence the priory hallowmere in hampshire a message of farewell from him she hoped for knowing him as she did it seemed a certainty and she hungered for that last gleam of life in her friend she had no anticipation of the burden of the message awaiting her a consultation as to the despatching of the message had taken place among the members of lord dannisburgh's family present at his death percy dacier was one of them and he settled the disputed point after some time had been spent in persuading his father to take the plain view of obligation in the matter and in opposing the dowager countess his grandmother by stating that he had already sent a special messenger to london lord dannisburgh on his death bed had expressed a wish that mrs warwick would sit with him for an hour one night before the nails were knocked in his coffin he spoke of it twice putting it the second time to percy as a formal request to be made to her and percy had promised him that mrs warwick should have the message he had done his best to keep his pledge aware of the disrelish of the whole family for the lady's name to say nothing of her presence 'she won't come' said the earl 'she'll come' said old lady dacier 'if the woman respects herself she'll hold off it' the earl insisted because of his desire that way he signified in mutterings that the thing was improper and absurd a piece of sentiment sickly senility unlike lord dannisburgh also that percy had been guilty of excessive folly to which lady dacier nodded her assent remarking 'the woman is on her mettle from what i've heard of her she's not a woman to stick at trifles she'll take it as a sort of ordeal by touch and she 'll come' they joined in abusing percy who had driven away to another part of the country lord creedmore the heir of the house was absent hunting in america or he might temporarily have been taken into favour by contrast ultimately they agreed that the woman must be allowed to enter the house but could not be received the earl was a widower his mother managed the family and being hard to convince she customarily carried her point save when it involved percy's freedom of action she was one of the veterans of her sex that age to toughness and the 'hysterical fuss' she apprehended in the visit of this woman to lord dannisburgh's death bed and body did not alarm her for the sake of the household she determined to remain shut up in her room before night the house was empty of any members of the family excepting old lady dacier and the outstretched figure on the bed dacier fled to escape the hearing of the numberless ejaculations re awakened in the family by his uncle's extraordinary dying request they were an outrage to the lady of whom he could now speak as a privileged champion and the request itself had an air of proving her stainless a white soul and efficacious advocate at the celestial gates reading the mind of the dying man so he thought at one moment he had thought so when charged with the message to her had even thought it a natural wish that she should look once on the face she would see no more and say farewell to it considering that in life it could not be requested but the susceptibility to sentimental emotion beside a death bed with a dying man's voice in the ear requires fortification if it is to be maintained' and the review of his uncle's character did not tend to make this very singular request a proof that the lady's innocence was honoured in it his epicurean uncle had no profound esteem for the kind of innocence he had always talked of mrs warwick with warm respect for her dacier knew that he had bequeathed her a sum of money the inferences were either way lord dannisburgh never spoke evilly of any woman and he was perhaps bound to indemnify her materially as well as he could for what she had suffered on the other hand how easy it was to be the dupe of a woman so handsome and clever unlikely too that his uncle would consent to sit at the platonic banquet with her judging by himself dacier deemed it possible for man he was not quick to kindle and had lately seen much of her had found her a lady egeria helpful in counsel prompting inspiriting reviving as well waters and as temperately cool not one sign of native slipperiness nor did she stir the mud in him upon which proud man is built the shadow of the scandal had checked a few shifty sensations rising now and then of their own accord and had laid them with the lady's benign connivance this was good proof in her favour seeing that she must have perceived of late the besetting thirst he had for her company and alone or in the medley equally to see her hear exchange ideas with her and to talk of new books try to listen to music at the opera and at concerts and admire her playing of hostess were novel pleasures giving him fresh notions of life and strengthening rather than disturbing the course of his life's business at any rate she was capable of friendship why not resolutely believe that she had been his uncle's true and simple friend he adopted the resolution thanking her for one recognized fact he hated marriage and would by this time have been in the yoke but for the agreeable deviation of his path to her society since his visit to copsley moreover lady dunstane's idolizing of her friend had influenced him reflecting on it he recovered from the shock which his uncle's request had caused certain positive calculations were running side by side with the speculations in vapour his messenger would reach her house at about four of the afternoon if then at home would she decide to start immediately would she come that was a question he did not delay to answer would she defer the visit death replied to that she would not delay it she would be sure to come at once and what of the welcome she would meet leaving the station at london at six in the evening she might arrive at the priory all impediments counted between ten and eleven at night thence coldly greeted or not greeted to the chamber of death a pitiable and cruel reception for a woman upon such a mission his mingled calculations and meditations reached that exclamatory terminus in feeling and settled on the picture of diana about as clear as light to blinking eyes but enough for him to realize her being there and alone woefully alone the supposition of an absolute loneliness was most possible he had intended to drive back the next day when the domestic storm would be over and take the chances of her coming it seemed now a piece of duty to return at night a traverse of twenty rough up and down miles from itchenford to the heath land rolling on the chalk wave of the surrey borders easily done after the remonstrances of his host were stopped dacier sat in an open carriage facing a slip of bright moon poetical impressions emotions any stirrings of his mind by the sensational stamp on it were new to him and while he swam in them both lulled and pricked by his novel accessibility to nature's lyrical touch he asked himself whether if he were near the throes of death the thought of having diana warwick to sit beside his vacant semblance for an hour at night would be comforting and why had his uncle specified an hour of the night it was a sentiment like the request curious in a man so little sentimental yonder crescent running the shadowy round of the hoop roused comparisons would one really wish to have her beside one in death in life ah but suppose her denied to us in life then the desire for her companionship appears passingly comprehensible enter into the sentiment you see that the hour of darkness is naturally chosen and would even a grand old pagan crave the presence beside his dead body for an hour of the night of a woman he did not esteem dacier answered no the negative was not echoed in his mind he repeated it and to the same deadness he became aware that he had spoken for himself and he had a fit of sourness for who can say he is not a fool before he has been tried by a woman dacier's wretched tendency under vexation to conceive grotesque analogies anti poetic not to say cockney similes which had slightly chilled diana at rovio set him looking at yonder crescent with the hoop as at the shape of a white cat climbing a wheel men of the northern blood will sometimes lend their assent to poetical images even to those that do not stun the mind lie bludgeons and imperatively by much repetition command their assent and it is for a solid exchange and interest in usury with soft poetical creatures when they are so condescending but they are seized by the grotesque in spite of efforts to efface or supplant it he saw the white cat nothing else even to thinking that she had jumped cleverly to catch the wheel he was a true descendant of practical hard grained fighting northerners of gnarled dwarf imaginations chivalrous though they were and heroes to have serviceable and valiant gentlemen for issue without at all tracing back to its origin his detestable image of the white cat on the dead circle he kicked at the links between his uncle and diana warwick whatever they had been particularly at the present revival of them old lady dacier's blunt speech and his father's fixed opinion hissed in his head they were ignorant of his autumnal visit to the italian lakes after the winter's nile boat expedition and also of the degree of his recent intimacy with mrs warwick or else as he knew he would have heard more hissing things her patronage of miss paynham exposed her to attacks where she was deemed vulnerable lady dacier muttered old saws as to the flocking of birds he did not accurately understand it thought it indiscreet at best but in regard to his experience he could tell himself that a woman more guileless of luring never drew breath on the contrary candour said it had always been he who had schemed and pressed for the meeting he was at liberty to do it not being bound in honour elsewhere besides despite his acknowledgement of her beauty mrs warwick was not quite his ideal of the perfectly beautiful woman constance asper came nearer to it he had the english taste for red and white and for cold outlines he secretly admired a statuesque demeanour with a statue's eyes the national approbation of a reserved haughtiness in woman a tempered disdain in her slightly lifted small upperlip and drooped eyelids was shared by him and constance asper if not exactly aristocratic by birth stood well for that aristocratic insular type which seems to promise the husband of it a casket of all the trusty virtues as well as the security of frigidity in the casket such was dacier's native taste consequently the attractions of diana warwick for him were he thought chiefly mental those of a lady egeria she might or might not be good in the vulgar sense she was an agreeable woman an amusing companion very suggestive inciting animating and her past history must be left as her own did it matter to him what he saw was bright a silver crescent on the side of the shadowy ring were it a question of marrying her that was out of the possibilities he remembered moreover having heard from a man who professed to know that mrs warwick had started in married life by treating her husband cavalierly to an intolerable degree 'such as no englishman could stand' the portly old informant thundered describing it and her in racy vernacular she might be a devil of a wife she was a pleasant friend just the soft bit sweeter than male friends which gave the flavour of sex without the artful seductions he required them strong to move him he looked at last on the green walls of the priory scarcely supposing a fair watcher to be within for the contrasting pale colours of dawn had ceased to quicken the brilliancy of the crescent and summer daylight drowned it to fainter than a silver coin in water it lay dispieced like a pulled rag eastward over surrey stood the full rose of morning the priory clock struck four when the summons of the bell had gained him admittance and he heard that mrs warwick had come in the night he looked back through the doorway at the rosy colour and congratulated himself to think that her hour of watching was at an end a sleepy footman was his informant women were in my lord's dressing room he said upstairs at the death chamber dacier paused no sound came to him he hurried to his own room paced about and returned expecting to see no one but the dead he turned the handle and the two circles of a shaded lamp on ceiling and on table met his gaze chapter xx diana a night watch in the chamber of death he stepped into the room and thrilled to hear the quiet voice beside the bed 'who is it' apologies and excuses were on his tongue the vibration of those grave tones checked them 'it is you' she said she sat in shadow her hands joined on her lap an unopened book was under the lamp he spoke in an underbreath 'i have just come i was not sure i should find you here pardon' 'there is a chair' he murmured thanks and entered into the stillness observing her 'you have been watching you must be tired' 'no' 'an hour was asked only one' 'i could not leave him' 'watchers are at hand to relieve you' 'it is better for him to have me' the chord of her voice told him of the gulf she had sunk in during the night the thought of her endurance became a burden he let fall his breath for patience and tapped the floor with his foot he feared to discompose her by speaking the silence grew more fearful as the very speech of death between them 'you came i thought it right to let you know instantly i hoped you would come to morrow' 'i could not delay' 'you have been sitting alone here since eleven' 'i have not found it long' 'you must want some refreshment tea' 'i need nothing' 'it can be made ready in a few minutes' 'i could not eat or drink' he tried to brush away the impression of the tomb in the heavily curtained chamber by thinking of the summer morn outside he spoke of it the rosy sky the dewy grass the piping birds she listened as one hearing of a quitted sphere their breathing in common was just heard if either drew a deeper breath at moments his eyes wandered and shut alternately in his mind death had vaster meanings and doubtfuller life cowered under the shadow or outshone it he glanced from her to the figure in the bed and she seemed swallowed he said 'it is time for you to have rest you know your room i will stay till the servants are up' she replied 'no let this night with him be mine' 'i am not intruding' 'if you wish to remain' no traces of weeping were on her face the lampshade revealed it colourless and lustreless her eyes she was robed in black she held her hands clasped 'you have not suffered' 'oh no' she said it without sighing nor was her speech mournful only brief 'you have seen death before' 'i sat by my father four nights i was a girl then i cried till i had no more tears' he felt a burning pressure behind his eyeballs 'death is natural' he said 'it is natural to the aged when they die honoured' she looked where the dead man lay 'to sit beside the young cut off from their dear opening life' a little shudder swept over her 'oh that' 'you were very good to come we must all thank you for fulfilling his wish' 'he knew it would be my wish' her hands pressed together 'he lies peacefully' 'i have raised the lamp on him and wondered each time so changeless he lies but so like a sleep that will wake we never see peace but in the features of the dead will you look they are beautiful they have a heavenly sweetness' the desire to look was evidently recurrent with her dacier rose their eyes fell together on the dead man as thoughtfully as death allows to the creatures of sensation 'and after' he said in low tones 'i trust to my maker' she replied 'do you see a change since he breathed his last' 'not any' 'you were with him' 'not in the room two minutes later' 'who' 'my father his niece lady cathairn' 'if our lives are lengthened we outlive most of those we would have to close our eyes he had a dear sister' 'she died some years back' 'i helped to comfort him for that loss' 'he told me you did' the lamp was replaced on the table 'for a moment when i withdraw the light from him i feel sadness as if the light we lend to anything were of value to him now' she bowed her head deeply dacier left her meditation undisturbed the birds on the walls outside were audible tweeting chirping he went to the window curtains and tried the shutter bars it seemed to him that daylight would be cheerfuller for her he had a thirst to behold her standing bathed in daylight 'shall i open them' he asked her 'i would rather the lamp' she said they sat silently until she drew her watch from her girdle 'my train starts at half past six it is a walk of thirty five minutes to the station i did it last night in that time' 'you walked here in the dark alone' 'there was no fly to be had the station master sent one of his porters with me we had a talk on the road i like those men' dacier read the hour by the mantelpiece clock 'if you must really go by the early train i will drive you' 'no i will walk i prefer it' 'i will order your breakfast at once' he turned on his heel she stopped him 'no i have no taste for eating or drinking' 'pray' said he in visible distress she shook her head 'i could not i have twenty minutes longer i can find my way to the station it is almost a straight road out of the park gates' his heart swelled with anger at the household for they treatment she had been subjected to judging by her resolve not to break bread in the house they resumed their silent sitting the intervals for a word to pass between them were long and the ticking of the time piece fronting the death bed ruled the chamber scarcely varied the lamp was raised for the final look the leave taking dacier buried his face thinking many things the common multitude in insurrection 'a servant should be told to come now' she said 'i have only to put on my bonnet and i am ready' 'you will take no' 'nothing' 'it is not too late for a carriage to be ordered' 'no the walk' they separated he roused the two women in the dressing room asleep with heads against the wall thence he sped to his own room for hat and overcoat and a sprinkle of cold water descending the stairs he beheld his companion issuing from the chamber of death her lips were shut her eyelids nervously tremulous they were soon in the warm sweet open air and they walked without an interchange of a syllable through the park into the white hawthorn lane glad to breathe her nostrils took long draughts of air but of the change of scene she appeared scarcely sensible at the park gates she said 'there is no necessity four your coming' his answer was 'i think of myself i gain something every step i walk with you' 'to day is thursday' said she 'the funeral is' 'monday has been fixed according to his directions he will lie in the churchyard of his village not in the family vault' 'i know' she said hastily 'they are privileged who follow him and see the coffin lowered he spoke of this quiet little resting place' 'yes it's a good end i do not wonder at his wish for the honour you have done him i could wish it too but more living than dead that is a natural wish' 'it is not to be called an honour' 'i should feel it so an honour to me' 'it is a friend's duty the word is too harsh it was his friend's desire he did not ask it so much as he sanctioned it for to him what has my sitting beside him been' 'he had the prospective happiness' 'he knew well that my soul would be with him as it was last night but he knew it would be my poor human happiness to see him with my eyes touch him with my hand before he passed from our sight' dacier exclaimed 'how you can love' 'is the village church to be seen' she asked 'to the right of those elms that is the spire the black spot below is a yew you love with the whole heart when you love' 'i love my friends' she replied 'you tempt me to envy those who are numbered among them' 'they are not many' 'they should be grateful' 'you have some acquaintance with them all' 'and an enemy had you ever one do you know of one' 'direct and personal designedly i think not we give that title to those who are disinclined to us and add a dash of darker colour to our errors foxes have enemies in the dogs heroines of melodramas have their persecuting villains i suppose that conditions of life exist where one meets the original complexities the bad are in every rank the inveterately malignant i have not found circumstances may combine to make a whisper as deadly as a blow though not of such evil design perhaps if we lived at a court of a magnificent despot we should learn that we are less highly civilized than we imagine ourselves but that is a fire to the passions and the extreme is not the perfect test our civilization counts positive gains unless you take the melodrama for the truer picture of us it is always the most popular with the english and look what a month june is yesterday morning i was with lady dunstane on her heights and i feel double the age he was fond of this wild country we think it a desert a blank whither he has gone because we will strain to see in the utter dark and nothing can come of that but the bursting of the eyeballs' dacier assented 'there's no use in peering beyond the limits' 'no' said she 'the effect is like the explaining of things to a dull head the finishing stroke to the understanding better continue to brood we get to some unravelment if we are left to our own efforts i quarrel with no priest of any denomination that they should quarrel among themselves is comprehensible in their wisdom for each has the specific but they show us their way of solving the great problem and we ought to thank them though one or the other abominate us you are advised to talk with lady dunstane on these themes she is perpetually in the antechamber of death and her soul is perennially sunshine see the pretty cottage under the laburnum curls who lives there' 'his gamekeeper simon rofe' 'and what a playground for the children that bit of common by their garden palings and the pond and the blue hills over the furzes i hope those people will not be turned out' dacier could not tell he promised to do his best for them 'but' said she 'you are the lord here now' 'not likely to be the tenant incomes are wanted to support even small estates' 'the reason is good for courting the income' he disliked the remark and when she said presently 'those windmills make the landscape homely' he rejoined 'they remind one of our wheeling london gamins round the cab from the station' 'they remind you' said she and smiled at the chance discordant trick he had remembering occasions when it had crossed her 'this is homelier than rovio' she said 'quite as nice in its way' 'you do not gather flowers here' 'because my friend has these at her feet' 'may one petition without a rival then for a souvenir' 'certainly if you care to have a common buttercup' they reached the station five minutes in advance of the train his coming manoeuvre was early detected and she drew from her pocket the little book he had seen lying unopened on the table and said 'i shall have two good hours for reading' 'you will not object i must accompany you to town permit it i beg you shall not be worried to talk' 'no i came alone and return alone' 'fasting and unprotected are you determined to take away the worst impression of us do not refuse me this favour' 'as to fasting i could not eat and unprotected no woman is in england if she is a third class traveller that is my experience of the class and i shall return among my natural protectors the most unselfishly chivalrous to women in the whole world' he had set his heart on going with her and he attempted eloquence in pleading but that exposed him to her humour he was tripped 'it is not denied that you belong to the knightly class' she said 'and it is not necessary that you should wear armour and plumes to proclaim it and your appearance would be ample protection from the drunken sailors travelling you say on this line and i may be deplorably mistaken in imagining that i could tame them but your knightliness is due elsewhere and i commit myself to the fortune of war it is a battle for women everywhere under the most favourable conditions among my dear common english i have not my maid with me or else i should not dare' she paid for a third class ticket amused by dacier's look of entreaty and trouble 'of course i obey' he murmured 'i have the habit of exacting it in matters concerning my independence' she said and it arrested some rumbling notions in his head as to a piece of audacity on the starting of the train they walked up and down the platform till the bell rang and the train came rounding beneath an arch 'oh by the way may i ask' he said 'was it your article in whitmonby's journal on a speech of mine last week' 'the guilty writer is confessed' 'let me thank you' 'don't but try to believe it written on public grounds if the task is not too great' 'i may call' 'you will be welcome' 'to tell you of the funeral the last of him' 'do not fail to come' she could have laughed to see him jumping on the steps of the third class carriages one after another to choose her company for her in those pre democratic blissful days before the miry deluge the opinion of the requirements of poor english travellers entertained by the seigneur directors of the class above them was that they differed from cattle in stipulating for seats with the exception of that provision to suit their weakness the accommodation extended to them resembled pens and the seats were emphatically seats of penitence intended to grind the sitter for his mean pittance payment and absence of aspiration to a higher state hard angular wood a low roof a shabby square of window aloof demanding of him to quit the seat he insisted on having if he would indulge in views of the passing scenery such was the furniture of dens where a refinement of castigation was practised on villain poverty by denying leathers to the windows or else buttons to the leathers so that the windows had either to be up or down but refused to shelter and freshen simultaneously dacier selected a compartment occupied by two old women a mother and babe and little maid and a labouring man there he installed her with an eager look that she would not notice 'you will want the window down' he said she applied to her fellow travellers for the permission and struggling to get the window down he was irritated to animadvert on 'these carriages' of the benevolent railway company 'do not forget that the wealthy are well treated or you may be unjust' said she to pacify him his mouth sharpened its line while he tried arts and energies on the refractory window she told him to leave it 'you can't breathe this atmosphere' he cried and called to a porter who did the work remarking that it was rather stiff the door was banged and fastened dacier had to hang on the step to see her in the farewell from the platform he saw the top of her bonnet and why she should have been guilty of this freak of riding in an unwholesome carriage tasked his power of guessing he was too english even to have taken the explanation for he detested the distinguishing of the races in his country and could not therefore have comprehended her peculiar tenacity of the sense of injury as long as enthusiasm did not arise to obliterate it he required a course of lessons in irish sauntering down the lane he called at simon rofe's cottage and spoke very kindly to the gamekeeper's wife that might please diana it was all he could do at present chapter xxi 'the young minister of state' descriptions in the newspapers of the rural funeral of lord dannisburgh had the effect of rousing flights of tattlers with a twittering of the disused name of warwick our social gods renewed their combat and the verdict of the jury was again overhauled to be attacked and maintained the carpers replying to the champions that they held to their view of it as heads of bull dogs are expected to do when they have got a grip of one it is a point of muscular honour with them never to relax their hold they will tell you why they formed that opinion from the first and but for the swearing of a particular witness upon whom the plaintiff had been taught to rely the verdict would have been different to prove their soundness of judgement they could speak from private positive information of certain damnatory circumstances derived from authentic sources visits of a gentleman to the house of a married lady in the absence of the husband oh the british lucretia was very properly not legally at home to the masculine world of that day she plied her distaff in pure seclusion meditating on her absent lord or else a fair proportion of the masculine world which had not yet has not yet 'doubled cape turk' approved her condemnation to the sack there was talk in the feminine world at lady wathin's assemblies the elevation of her husband had extended and deepened her influence on the levels where it reigned before but without strange as we may think it now assisting to her own elevation much aspired for to the smooth and lively upper pavement of society above its tumbled strata she was near that distinguished surface not on it her circle was practically the same as it was previous to the coveted nominal rank enabling her to trample on those beneath it and women like that mrs warwick a woman of no birth no money not even honest character enjoyed the entry undisputed circulated among the highest because people took her rattle for wit and because also our nobility lady wathin feared had no due regard for morality our aristocracy brilliant and ancient though it was merited rebuke she grew severe upon aristocratic scandals whereof were plenty among the frolicsome host just overhead as vexatious as the drawing room party to the lodger in the floor below who has not received an invitation to partake of the festivities and is required to digest the noise but if ambition is oversensitive moral indignation is ever consolatory for it plants us on the judgement seat there indeed we may sitting with the very highest forget our personal disappointments in dispensing reprobation for misconduct however eminent the offenders she was lady wathin and once on an afternoon's call to see poor lady dunstane at her town house she had been introduced to lady pennon a patroness of mrs warwick and had met a snub an icy check bow of the aristocratic head from the top of the spinal column and not a word not a look the half turn of a head devoid of mouth and eyes she practised that forbidding checkbow herself to perfection so the endurance of it was horrible a noli me tangere her husband termed it in his ridiculous equanimity and he might term it what he pleased it was insulting the solace she had was in hearing that hideous radical revolutionary things were openly spoken at mrs warwick's evenings with her friends impudently named 'the elect of london' pleasing to reflect upon mrs warwick as undermining her supporters to bring them some day down with a crash her 'elect of london' were a queer gathering by report of them and mr whitmonby too no doubt a celebrity was the right hand man at these dinner parties of mrs warwick where will not men go to be flattered by a pretty woman he had declined repeated successive invitations to lady wathin's table but there of course he would not have had 'the freedom' that is she rejoiced in thinking defensively and offensively a moral wall enclosed her topics the hon percy dacier had been brought to her thursday afternoon by mr quintin manx and he had one day dined with her and he knew mrs warwick a little he said the opportunity was not lost to convey to him entirely in the interest of sweet constance asper that the moral world entertained a settled view of the very clever woman mrs warwick certainly was he had asked diana on their morning walk to the station whether she had an enemy so prone are men educated by the drama and fiction in the belief that the garden of civilized life must be at the mercy of the old wild devourers to fancy 'villain whispers' an indication of direct animosity lady wathin had no sentiment of the kind but she had become acquainted with the other side of the famous dannisburgh case the unfortunate plaintiff and compassion as well as morality moved her to put on a speaking air when mr warwick's name was mentioned she pictured him to the ladies of her circle as 'one of our true gentlemen in his deportment and his feelings' he was she would venture to say her ideal of an english gentleman 'but now' she added commiseratingly 'ruined ruined in his health and in his prospects' a lady inquired if it was the verdict that had thus affected him lady wathin's answer was reported over moral or substratum london 'he is the victim of a fatal passion for his wife and would take her back to morrow were she to solicit his forgiveness' morality had something to say against this active marital charity attributable it was to be feared to weakness of character on the part of the husband still mrs warwick undoubtedly was one of those women of satanic construction who have the art of enslaving the men unhappy enough to cross their path the nature of the art was hinted with the delicacy of dainty feet which have to tread in mire to get to safety men alas are snared in this way instances too numerous for the good repute of the swinish sex were cited and the question of how morality was defensible from their grossness passed without a tactical reply there is no defence those women come like the cholera morbus and owing to similar causes they will prevail until the ideas of men regarding women are purified nevertheless the husband who could forgive even propose to forgive was deemed by consent generous however weak though she might not have been wholly guilty she had bitterly offended and he despatched an emissary to her the theme one may in their language 'fear' was relished as a sugared acid it was renewed in the late autumn of the year when antonia published her new book entitled the young minister of state the signature of the authoress was now known and from this resurgence of her name in public suddenly a radiation of tongues from the circle of lady wathin declared that the repentant mrs warwick had gone back to her husband's bosom and forgiveness the rumour spread in spite of sturdy denials at odd corners counting the red hot proposal of mr sullivan smith to eat his head and boots for breakfast if it was proved correct it filled a yawn of the clubs for the afternoon soon this wanton rumour was met and stifled by another of more morbific density heavily charged as that which led the sad eliza to her pyre antonia's hero was easily identified the young minister of state could be he only who was now at all her parties always meeting her had been spied walking with her daily in the park near her house on his march down to westminster during the session and who positively went to concerts and sat under fiddlers to be near her it accounted moreover for his treatment of constance asper what effrontery of the authoress to placard herself with him in a book the likeness of the hero to percy dacier once established became striking to glaringness a proof of her ability and more of her audacity still more of her intention to flatter him up to his perdition by the things written of him one would imagine the conversations going on behind the scenes she had the wiles of a cleopatra not without some of the nilene's experiences a youthful antony dacier would be little likely to escape her toils and so promising a young man the sigh the tear for weeping over his destruction almost fell such vivid realizing of the prophesy appeared in its pathetic pronouncement this low rumour or malaria began blowing in the winter and did not travel fast for strangely there was hardly a breath of it in the atmosphere of dacier none in diana's it rose from groups not so rapidly and largely mixing and less quick to kindle whose crazy sincereness battened on the smallest morsel of fact and collected the fictitious by slow absorption but as guardians of morality often doing good duty in their office they are persistent when parliament assembled mr quintin manx a punctual member of the house if nothing else arrived in town he was invited to dine with lady wathin after dinner she spoke to him of the absent constance and heard of her being well and expressed a great rejoicing at that whereupon the burly old shipowner frowned and puffed constance he said had plunged into these new spangle candle and high singing services was all for symbols harps effigies what not lady wathin's countenance froze in hearing of it she led mr quintin to a wall sofa and said 'surely the dear child must have had a disappointment for her to have taken to those foolish displays of religion it is generally a sign' 'well ma'am my lady i let girls go their ways in such things i don't interfere but it's that fellow or nobody with her she has fixed her girl's mind on him and if she can't columbine as a bride she will as a nun young people must be at some harlequinade' 'but it is very shocking and he' 'he plays last and loose warm and cold i'm ready to settle twenty times a nobleman's dowry on my niece and she's a fine girl a handsome girl educated up to the brim fit to queen it in any drawing room he holds her by some arts that don't hold him it seems he's all for politics' 'constance can scarcely be his dupe so far i should think' 'how do you mean' 'everything points to one secret of his conduct' 'a woman' lady wathin's head shook for her sex's pained affirmative mr quintin in the same fashion signified the downright negative 'the fellow's as cold as a fish' 'flattery will do anything there is i fear one' 'widow wife maid' 'married i regret to say' 'well if he'd get over with it' said quintin in whose notions the seductiveness of a married woman could be only temporary for all the reasons pertaining to her state at the same time his view of percy dacier was changed in thinking it possible that a woman could divert him from his political and social interests he looked incredulous 'you have heard of a mrs warwick' said lady wathin 'warwick i have i've never seen her at my broker's in the city yesterday i saw the name on a memorandum of purchase of shares in a concern promising ten per cent and not likely to carry the per annum into the plural he told me she was a grand kind of woman past advising' 'for what amount' 'some thousands i think it was' 'she has no money' lady wathin corrected her emphasis 'or ought to have none' 'she can't have got it from him' 'did you notice her christian name' 'i don't recollect it if i did i thought the woman a donkey' 'would you consider me a busybody were i to try to mitigate this woman's evil influence i love dear constance and should be happy to serve her' 'i want my girl married' said old quintin 'he's one of my parliamentary chiefs with first rate prospects good family good sober fellow at least i thought so by nature i mean barring your incantations he suits me she liking him' 'she admires him i am sure' 'she's dead on end for the fellow' lady wathin felt herself empowered by quintin manx to undertake the release of sweet constance asper's knight from the toils of his enchantress for this purpose she had first an interview with mr warwick and next she hurried to lady dunstane at copsley there after jumbling mr warwick's connubial dispositions and mrs warwick's last book and mr percy dacier's engagement to the great heiress in a gossipy hotch potch she contrived to gather a few items of fact as that the young minister was probably modelled upon mr percy dacier lady dunstane made no concealment of it as soon as she grew sensible of the angling but she refused her help to any reconciliation between mr and mrs warwick she declined to listen to lady wathin's entreaties she declined to give her reasons these bookworm women whose pride it is to fancy that they can think for themselves have a great deal of the heathen in them as morality discovers when it wears the enlistment ribands and applies yo them to win recruits for a service under the direct blessing of providence lady wathin left some darts behind her in the form of moral exclamations and really intended morally for though she did not like mrs warwick she had no wish to wound other than by stopping her further studies of the young minister and conducting him to the young lady loving him besides restoring a bereft husband to his own how sadly pale and worn poor mr warwick appeared the portrayal of his withered visage to lady dunstane had quite failed to gain a show of sympathy and so it is ever with your book worm women pretending to be philosophical you sound them vainly for a manifestation of the commonest human sensibilities they turn over the leaves of a latin book on their laps while you are supplicating them to assist in a work of charity lady wathin's interjectory notes haunted emma's ear yet she had seen nothing in tony to let her suppose that there was trouble of her heart below the surface and her tony when she came to copsley shone in the mood of the day of lord dannisburgh's drive down from london with her she was running on a fresh work talked of composition as a trifle 'i suppose the young minister is mr percy dacier' said emma 'between ourselves he is' diana replied smiling at a secret guessed 'you know my model and can judge of the likeness' 'you write admiringly of him tony' 'and i do admire him so would you emmy if you knew him as well as i do now he pairs with mr redworth he also is the friend of women but he lifts us to rather a higher level of intellectual friendship when the ice has melted and it is thick at first he pours forth all his ideas without reserve and they are deep and noble ever since lord dannisburgh's death and our sitting together we have been warm friends intimate i would say if it could be said of one so self contained in that respect no young man was ever comparable with him and i am encouraged to flatter myself that he unbends to me more than to others' 'he is engaged or partly i hear why does he not marry' 'i wish he would' diana said with a most brilliant candour of aspect emma read in it that it would complete her happiness possibly by fortifying her sense of security and that seemed right her own meditations illumined by the beautiful face in her presence referred to the security of mr dacier 'so then life is going smoothly' said emma 'yes at a good pace and smoothly not a torrent thames like without o'erflowing full it is not lugano and the salvatore perhaps it is better as action is better than musing' 'no troubles whatever' 'none well except an adorer at times i have to take him as my portion an impassioned caledonian has a little bothered me i met him at lady pennon's and have been meeting him as soon as i put foot out of my house ever since if i could impress and impound him to marry mary paynham i should be glad by the way i have consented to let her try at a portrait of me no i have no troubles i have friends the choicest of the nation i have health a field for labour fairish success with it a mind alive such as it is i feel like that midsummer morning of our last drive out together the sun high clearish clouded enough to be cool and still i envy emmy on her sofa mastering latin biting at greek what a wise recommendation that was of mr redworth's he works well in the house he spoke excellently the other night' 'he runs over to ireland this easter' 'he sees for himself and speaks with authority he sees and feels englishmen mean well but they require an extremity of misery to waken their feelings' 'it is coming he says and absit omen' 'mr dacier says he is the one englishman who may always be sure of an irish hearing and he does not cajole them you know but the english defect is really not want of feeling so much as want of foresight they will not look ahead a famine ceasing a rebellion crushed they jog on as before with their dobbin trot and blinker confidence in saxon energy they should study the irish i think it was mr redworth who compared the governing of the irish to the management of a horse the rider should not grow restive when the steed begins to kick calmer firm calm persuasive' 'does mr dacier agree' 'not always he has the inveterate national belief that celtic blood is childish and the consequently illogical disregard of its hold of impressions the irish for i have them in my heart though i have not been among them for long at a time must love you to serve you and will hate you if you have done them injury and they have not wiped it out they with a treble revenge or you with cordial benefits i have told him so again and again ventured to suggest measures' 'he listens to you tony' 'he says i have brains it ends in a compliment' 'you have inspired mr redworth' 'if i have i have lived for some good' altogether her tony's conversation proved to emma that her perusal of the model of the young minister of state was an artist's free open and not discoloured by the personal tincture her heart plainly was free and undisturbed she had the same girl's love of her walks where wildflowers grew if possible a keener pleasure she hummed of her happiness in being at copsley singing her planxty kelly and the puritani by turns she stood on land she was not on the seas emma thought so with good reason she stood on land it was true but she stood on a cliff of the land the seas below and about her and she was enabled to hoodwink her friend because the assured sensation of her firm footing deceived her own soul even while it took short flights to the troubled waters of her firm footing she was exultingly proud she stood high close to danger without giddiness if at intervals her soul flew out like lightning from the rift a mere shot of involuntary fancy it seemed to her the suspicion of instability made her draw on her treasury of impressions of the mornings at lugano her loftiest purest dearest and these reinforced her she did not ask herself why she should have to seek them for aid in other respects her mind was alert and held no sly covers as the fiction of a perfect ignorant innocence combined with common intelligence would have us to suppose that the minds of women can do she was honest as long as she was not directly questioned pierced to the innermost and sanctum of the bosom she could honestly summon bright light to her eyes in wishing the man were married she did not ask herself why she called it up the remorseless progressive interrogations of a jesuit father in pursuit of the bosom's verity might have transfixed it and shown her to herself even then a tossing vessel as to the spirit far away from that firm land she trod so bravely descending from the woody heights upon london diana would have said that her only anxiety concerned young mr arthur rhodes whose position she considered precarious and who had recently taken a drubbing for venturing to show a peep of his head like an early crocus in the literary market her antonia's last book had been reviewed obediently to smart taps from the then commanding baton of mr tonans and mr whitmonby's choice picking of specimens down three columns of his paper a literary review charles rainer's property had suggested that perhaps 'the talented authoress might be writing too rapidly' and another actuated by the public taste of the period for our 'vigorous homely saxon' in one and two syllable words had complained of a 'tendency to polysyllabic phraseology' the remainder a full majority had sounded eulogy with all their band instruments drum trumpet fife trombone her foregoing work had raised her to fame which is the court of a queen when the lady has beauty and social influence and critics are her dedicated courtiers gaping for the royal mouth to be opened and reserving the kicks of their independent manhood for infamous outsiders whom they hoist in the style and particular service of pitchforks they had fallen upon a little volume of verse 'like a body of barn door hens on a stranger chick' diana complained and she chid herself angrily for letting it escape her forethought to propitiate them on the author's behalf young rhodes was left with scarce a feather and what remained to him appeared a preposterous ornament for the decoration of a shivering and welted poet he laughed or tried the mouth of laughter antonia's literary conscience was vexed at the different treatment she had met and so imperatively needed that the reverse of it would have threatened the smooth sailing of her costly household a merry go round of creditors required a corresponding whirligig of receipts she felt mercenary debased by comparison with the well scourged verse mason orpheus of the untenanted city who had done his publishing ingenuously for glory a good instance of the comic pathetic she wrote to emma begging her to take him in at copsley for a few days 'i told you i had no troubles i am really troubled about this poor boy he has very little money and has embarked on literature i cannot induce any of my friends to lend him a hand mr redworth gruffly insists on his going back to his law clerk's office and stool and mr dacier says that no place is vacant the reality of lord dannisburgh's death is brought before me by my helplessness he would have made him an assistant private secretary pending a government appointment rather than let me plead in vain' mr rhodes with his travelling bag was packed off to copsley to enjoy a change of scene after his run of the gauntlet he was very heartily welcomed by lady dunstane both for her tony's sake and his own modest worship of that luminary which could permit of being transparent but chiefly she welcomed him as the living proof of tony's disengagement from anxiety since he was her one spot of trouble and could easily be comforted by reading with her and wandering through the spring woods along the heights he had a happy time midway in air between his accomplished hostess and his protecting goddess his bruises were soon healed each day was radiant to him whether it rained or shone and by his looks and what he said of himself lady dunstane understood that he was in the highest temper of the human creature tuned to thrilling accord with nature it was her generous tony's work she blessed it and liked the youth the better during the stay of mr arthur rhodes at copsley sir lukin came on a visit to his wife he mentioned reports in the scandal papers one that mr p d would shortly lead to the altar the lovely heiress miss a percy dacier and constance asper another that a reconciliation was to be expected between the beautiful authoress mrs w and her husband 'perhaps it's the best thing she can do' sir lukin added lady dunstane pronounced a woman's unforgiving 'never' the revolt of her own sensations assured her of tony's unconquerable repugnance in conversation subsequently with arthur rhodes she heard that he knew the son of mr warwick's attorney a mr fern and he had gathered from him some information of mr warwick's condition of health it had been alarming young fern said it was confirmed heart disease his father frequently saw mr warwick and said he was fretting himself to death it seemed just a possibility that tony's natural compassionateness had wrought on her to immolate herself and nurse to his end the man who had wrecked her life lady dunstane waited for the news at last she wrote touching the report incidentally there was no reply the silence ensuing after such a question responded forcibly chapter xxii between diana and dacier the wind east over bleak land on the third day of the easter recess percy dacier landed from the havre steamer at caen and drove straightway for the sandy coast past fields of colza to brine blown meadows of coarse grass and then to the low dunes and long stretching sands of the ebb in semicircle a desolate place at that season with a dwarf fishing village by the shore an east wind driving landward in streamers every object that had a scrap to fly he made head to the inn where the first person he encountered in the passage was diana's maid danvers who relaxed from the dramatic exaggeration of her surprise at the sight of a real english gentleman in these woebegone regions to inform him that her mistress might be found walking somewhere along the sea shore and had her dog to protect her they were to stay here a whole week danvers added for a conveyance of her private sentiments second thoughts however whispered to her shrewdness that his arrival could only be by appointment she had been anticipating something of the sort for some time dacier butted against the stringing wind that kept him at a rocking incline to his left for a mile he then discerned in what had seemed a dredger's dot on the sands a lady's figure unmistakably she without the corroborating testimony of leander paw deep in the low tide water she was out at a distance on the ebb sands hurtled gyred beaten to all shapes in rolls twists volumes like a blown banner flag by the pressing wind a kerchief tied her bonnet under her chin bonnet and breast ribands rattled rapidly as drummer sticks she stood near the little running ripple of the flat sea water as it hurried from a long streaked back to a tiny imitation of spray when she turned to the shore she saw him advancing but did not recognize when they met she merely looked with wide parted lips this was no appointment 'i had to see you' dacier said she coloured to a deeper red than the rose conjuring wind had whipped in her cheeks her quick intuition of the reason of his coming barred a mental evasion and she had no thought of asking either him or herself what special urgency had brought him 'i have been here four days' 'lady esquart spoke of the place' 'lady esquart should not have betrayed me' 'she did it inadvertently without an idea of my profiting by it' diana indicated the scene in a glance 'dreary country do you think' 'anywhere' said he they walked up the sand heap the roaring easter with its shrieks and whistles at her ribands was not favourable to speech his 'anywhere' had a penetrating significance the fuller for the break that left it vague speech between them was commanded he could not be suffered to remain she descended upon a sheltered pathway running along a ditch the border of pastures where cattle cropped raised heads and resumed their one comforting occupation diana gazed on them smarting from the buffets of the wind she had met 'no play of their tails to day' she said as she slackened her steps 'you left lady esquart well' 'lady esquart i think was well i had to see you i thought you would be with her in berkshire she told me of a little sea side place close to caen' 'you had to see me' 'i miss you now if it's a day' 'i heard a story in london' 'in london there are many stories i heard one is there a foundation for it' 'no' he breathed relieved 'i wanted to see you once before if it was true it would have made a change in my life a gap' 'you do me the honour to like my sunday evenings' 'beyond everything london can offer' 'a letter would have reached me' 'i should have had to wait for the answer there is no truth in it' her choice was to treat the direct assailant frankly or imperil her defence by the ordinary feminine evolutions which might be taken for inviting poor pranks always 'there have been overtures' she said 'forgive me i have scarcely the right to ask speak of it' 'my friends may use their right to take an interest in my fortunes' 'i thought i might on my way to paris turn aside coming by this route' 'if you determined not to lose much of your time' the coolness of her fencing disconcerted a gentleman conscious of his madness she took instant advantage of any circuitous move she gave him no practicable point he was little skilled in the arts of attack and felt that she checked his impetuousness respected her for it chafed at it writhed with the fervours precipitating him here and relapsed on his pleasure in seeing her face hearing her voice 'your happiness i hope is the chief thought in such a case' he said 'i am sure you would consider it' 'i can't quite forget my own' 'you compliment an ambitious hostess' dacier glanced across the pastures 'what was it that tempted you to this place' 'a poet would say it looks like a figure in the shroud it has no features it has a sort of grandeur belonging to death i heard of it as the place where i might be certain of not meeting an acquaintance' 'and i am the intruder' 'an hour or two will not give you that title' 'am i to count the minutes by my watch' 'by the sun we will supply you an omelette and piquette and send you back sobered and friarly to caen for paris at sunset' 'let the fare be spartan i could take my black broth with philosophy every day of the year under your auspices what i should miss' 'you bring no news of the world or the house' 'none you know as much as i know the irish agitation is chronic the corn law threatens to be the same' 'and your chief in personal colloquy' 'he keeps a calm front i may tell you there is nothing i would not confide to you he has let fall some dubious words in private i don't know what to think of them' 'but if he should waver' 'it's not wavering it's the openness of his mind' 'ah the mind we imagine it free the house and the country are the sentient frame governing the mind of the politician more than his ideas he cannot think independently of them nor i of my natural anatomy you will test the truth of that after your omelette and piquette and marvel at the quitting of your line of route for paris as soon as the mind attempts to think independently it is like a kite with the cord cut and performs a series of darts and frisks that have the look of wildest liberty till you see it fall flat to earth the openness of his mind is most honourable to him' 'ominous for his party' 'likely to be good for his country' 'that is the question' 'prepare to encounter it in politics i am with the active minority on behalf of the inert but suffering majority that is my rule it leads unless you have a despotism to the conquering side it is always the noblest i won't say listen to me only do believe my words have some weight this is a question of bread' 'it involves many other questions' 'and how clearly those leaders put their case they are admirable debaters if i were asked to write against them i should have but to quote them to confound my argument i tried it once and wasted a couple of my precious hours' 'they are cogent debaters' dacier assented 'they make me wince now and then without convincing me i own it to you the confession is not agreeable though it's a small matter' 'one's pride may feel a touch with the foils as keenly as the point of a rapier' said diana the remark drew a sharp look of pleasure from him 'does the princess egeria propose to dismiss the individual she inspires when he is growing most sensible of her wisdom' 'a young minister of state should be gleaning at large when holiday is granted him' dacier coloured 'may i presume on what is currently reported' 'parts parts a bit here a bit there' she rejoined 'authors find their models where they can and generally hit on the nearest' 'happy the nearest' 'if you run to interjections i shall cite you a sentence from your latest speech in the house' he asked for it and to school him she consented to flatter with her recollection of his commonest words 'dealing with subjects of this nature emotionally does not advance us a calculable inch' 'i must have said that in relation to hard matter of business' 'it applies there is my hostelry and the spectral form of danvers utterly depaysee have you spoken to the poor soul i can never discover the links of her attachment to my service' 'she knows a good mistress i have but a few minutes if you are relentless may i shall i ever be privileged to speak your christian name' 'my christian name it is pagan in one sphere i am hecate remember that' 'i am not among the people who so regard you' 'the time may come' 'diana' 'constance' 'i break no tie i owe no allegiance whatever to the name' 'keep to the formal title with me we are mrs warwick and mr dacier i think i am two years younger than you socially therefore ten in seniority and i know how this flower of friendship is nourished and may be withered you see already what you have done you have cast me on the discretion of my maid i suppose her trusty but i am at her mercy and a breath from her to the people beholding me as hecate queen of witches i have a sensation of the scirocco it would blow' 'in that event the least i can offer is my whole life' 'we will not conjecture the event' 'the best i could hope for' 'i see i shall have to revise the next edition of the young minister and make an emotional curate of him observe danvers the woman is wretched and now she sees me coming she pretends to be using her wits in studying the things about her as i have directed she is a riddle i have the idea that any morning she may explode and yet i trust her and sleep soundly i must be free though i vex the world's watchdogs so danvers you are noticing how thoroughly frenchwomen do their work' danvers replied with a slight mincing 'they may ma'am but they chatter chatter so' 'the result proves that it is not a waste of energy they manage their fowls too' 'they've no such thing as mutton ma'am' dacier patriotically laughed 'she strikes the apology for wealthy and leisurely landlords' diana said danvers remarked that the poor fed meagrely in france she was not convinced of its being good for them by hearing that they could work on it sixteen hours out of the four and twenty mr percy dacier's repast was furnished to him half an hour later at sunset diana taking danvers beside her walked with him to the line of the country road bearing on caen the wind had sunk a large brown disk paused rayless on the western hills 'a dacier ought to feel at home in normandy and you may have sprung from this neighbourhood' said she simply to chat 'here the land is poorish and a mile inland rich enough to bear repeated crops of colza which tries the soil i hear as for beauty those blue hills you see enfold charming valleys i meditate an expedition to harcourt before i return an english professor of his native tongue at the lycee at caen told me on my way here that for twenty shillings a week you may live in royal ease round about harcourt so we have our bed and board in prospect if fortune fails us danvers 'i would rather die in england ma'am' was the maid's reply dacier set foot on his carriage step he drew a long breath to say a short farewell and he and diana parted they parted as the plainest of sincere good friends each at heart respecting the other for the repression of that which their hearts craved any word of which might have carried them headlong bound together on a mazeppa race with scandal for the hounding wolves and social ruin for the rocks and torrents dacier was the thankfuller the most admiring of the two at the same time the least satisfied he saw the abyss she had aided him in escaping and it was refreshful to look abroad after his desperate impulse prominent as he stood before the world he could not think without a shudder of behaving like a young frenetic of the passion those whose aim is at the leadership of the english people know that however truly based the charges of hypocrisy soundness of moral fibre runs throughout the country and is the national integrity which may condone old sins for present service but will not have present sins to flout it he was in tune with the english character the passion was in him nevertheless and the stronger for a slow growth that confirmed its union of the mind and heart her counsel fortified him her suggestions opened springs her phrases were golden lettered in his memory and more she had worked an extraordinary change in his views of life and aptitude for social converse he acknowledged it with genial candour through her he was encouraged led excited to sparkle with the witty feel new gifts or a greater breadth of nature and thanking her he became thirstily susceptible to her dark beauty he claimed to have found the key of her and he prized it she was not passionless the blood flowed warm proud chaste she was nobly spirited having an intellectual refuge from the besiegings of the blood a rockfortress the 'wife no wife' appeared to him striking the higher elements of the man the commonly masculine also would he espouse her had he the chance to morrow this instant with her to back him he would be doubled in manhood doubled in brain and heart energy to call her wife spring from her and return a man might accept his fate to fight trojan or greek sure of his mark on the enemy but if after all this imputed helen of a decayed paris passed submissive to the legitimate solicitor back to her husband the thought shot dacier on his legs for a look at the blank behind him he vowed she had promised it should not be could it ever be after the ruin the meanly suspicious fellow had brought upon her diana voluntarily reunited to the treacherous cur he sat resolving sombrely that if the debate arose he would try what force he had to save her from such an ignominy and dedicate his life to her let the world wag its tongue so the knot would be cut men unaccustomed to a knot in their system find the prospect of cutting it an extreme relief even when they know that the cut has an edge to wound mortally as well as pacify the wound was not heavy payment for the rapture of having so incomparable a woman his own he reflected wonderingly on the husband as he had previously done and came again to the conclusion that it was a poor creature abjectly jealous of a wife he could neither master nor equal nor attract and thinking of jealousy dacier felt none none of individuals only of facts her marriage her bondage her condemnation to perpetual widowhood angered him as at an unrighteous decree the sharp sweet bloom of her beauty fresh in swarthiness under the whipping easter cried out against that loathed inhumanity or he made it cry being a stranger to the jealousy of men he took the soft assurance that he was preferred above them all competitors were numerous not any won her eyes as he did she revealed nothing of the same pleasures in the shining of the others touched by her magical wand would she have pardoned one of them the 'diana' bursting from his mouth she was not a woman for trifling still less for secresy he was as little the kind of lover both would be ready to take up their burden if the burden was laid on them diana had thus far impressed him meanwhile he faced the cathedral towers of the ancient norman city standing up in the smoky hues of the west and a sentence out of her book seemed fitting to the scene and what he felt he rolled it over luxuriously as the next of delights to having her beside him she wrote of 'thoughts that are bare dark outlines coloured by some odd passion of the soul like towers of a distant city seen in the funeral waste of day' his bluff english anti poetic training would have caused him to shrug at the stuff coming from another pen he might condescendingly have criticized it with a sneer embalmed in humour the words were hers she had written them almost by a sort of anticipation he imagined for he at once fell into the mood they suggested and had a full crop of the 'bare dark outlines' of thoughts coloured by his particular form of passion diana had impressed him powerfully when she set him swallowing and assimilating a sentence ethereally thin in substance of mere sentimental significance that he would antecedently have read aloud in a drawing room picking up the book by hazard as your modern specimen of romantic vapouring mr dacier however was at the time in observation of the towers of caen fresh from her presence animated to some conception of her spirit he drove into the streets desiring half determining to risk a drive back on the morrow the cold light of the morrow combined with his fear of distressing her to restrain him perhaps he thought it well not to risk his gains he was a northerner in blood he may have thought it well not further to run the personal risk immediately chapter xxiii records a visit to diana from one of the world's good women pure disengagement of contemplativeness had selected percy dacier as the model of her young minister of state diana supposed could she otherwise have dared to sketch him she certainly would not have done it now that was a reflection similar to what is entertained by one who has dropped from a precipice to the midway ledge over the abyss where caution of the whole sensitive being is required for simple self preservation how could she have been induced to study and portray him it seemed a form of dementia she thought this while imagining the world to be interrogating her when she interrogated herself she flew to lugano and her celestial salvatore that she might be defended from a charge of the dreadful weakness of her sex surely she there had proof of her capacity for pure disengagement even in recollection the springs of spiritual happiness renewed the bubbling crystal play she believed that a divineness had wakened in her there to strengthen her to the end ward her from any complicity in her sex's culprit blushing dacier's cry of her name was the cause she chose to think of the excessive circumspection she must henceforth practise precariously footing embracing hardest earth the plainest rules to get back to safety not that she was personally endangered or at least not spiritually she could always fly in soul to her heights but she had now to be on guard constantly in the fencing attitude and watchful of herself as well that was admitted with a ready frankness to save it from being a necessitated and painful confession for the voluntary acquiescence if it involved her in her sex claimed an individual exemption 'women are women and i am a woman but i am i and unlike them i see we are weak and weakness tempts in owning the prudence of guarded steps i am armed it is by dissembling feigning immunity that we are imperilled' she would have phrased it so with some anger at her feminine nature as well as at the subjection forced on her by circumstances besides her position and percy dacier's threw the fancied danger into remoteness the world was her stepmother vigilant to become her judge and the world was his taskmaster hopeful of him yet able to strike him down for an offence she saw their situation as he did the course of folly must be bravely taken if taken at all disguise degraded her to the reptiles this was faced consequently there was no fear of it she had very easily proved that she had skill and self possession to keep him rational and therefore they could continue to meet a little outburst of frenzy to a reputably handsome woman could be treated as the froth of a passing wave men have the trick infants their fevers diana's days were spent in reasoning her nights were not so tuneable to the superior mind when asleep she was the sport of elves that danced her into tangles too deliciously unravelled and left new problems for the wise eyed and anxious morning she solved them with the thought that in sleep it was the mere ordinary woman who fell a prey to her tormentors awake she dispersed the swarm her sky was clear gradually the persecution ceased thanks to her active pen a letter from her legal adviser old mr braddock informed her that no grounds existed for apprehending marital annoyance and late in may her household had resumed its customary round she examined her accounts the debit and credit sides presented much of the appearance of male and female in our jog trot civilization they matched middling well with rather too marked a tendency to strain the leash and run frolic on the part of friend debit the wanton male which deepened the blush of the comparison her father had noticed the same funny thing in his effort to balance his tugging accounts 'now then for a look at man and wife' except that he made debit stand for the portly frisky female credit the decorous and contracted other half a prim gentleman of a constitutionally lean habit of body remonstrating with her 'you seem to forget that we are married my dear and must walk in step or bundle into the bench' dan merion used to say diana had not so much to rebuke in mr debit or not at the first reckoning but his ways were curious she grew distrustful of him after dismissing him with a quiet admonition and discovering a series of ambush bills which he must have been aware of when he was allowed to pass as an honourable citizen his answer to her reproaches pleaded the necessitousness of his purchases and expenditure a capital plea and mrs credit was requested by him in a courteous manner to drive her pen the faster so that she might wax to a corresponding size and satisfy the world's idea of fitness in couples she would have costly furniture because it pleased her taste and a french cook for a like reason in justice to her guests and trained servants and her tribe of pensioners flowers she would have profuse and fresh at her windows and over the rooms and the pictures and engravings on the walls were always for the good reason mentioned choice ones and she had a love of old lace she loved colours as she loved cheerfulness and silks and satin hangings indian ivory carvings countless mirrors oriental woods chairs and desks with some feature or a flourish in them delicate tables with antelope legs of approved workmanship in the chronology of european upholstery and marble clocks of cunning device to symbol time mantelpiece decorations illustrated editions of her favourite authors her bed chambers too gave the nest for sleep a dainty cosiness in aerial draperies hence more or less directly the peccant bills credit was reduced to reckon to a nicety the amount she could rely on positively her fixed income from her investments and the letting of the crossways the days of half yearly payments that would magnify her to some proportions beside the alarming growth of her partner who was proud of it and referred her to the treasures she could summon with her pen at a murmur of dissatisfaction his compliments were sincere they were seductive he assured her that she had struck a rich vein in an inexhaustible mine by writing only a very little faster she could double her income counting a broader popularity treble it and so on a tide of success down the widening river to a sea sheer golden behold how it sparkles are we then to stint our winged hours of youth for want of courage to realize the riches we can command debit was eloquent he was unanswerable another calculator an accustomed and lamentably scrupulous arithmetician had been at work for some time upon a speculative summing of the outlay of diana's establishment as to its chances of swamping the income redworth could guess pretty closely the cost of a house hold if his care for the holder set him venturing on aver ages he knew nothing of her ten per cent investment and considered her fixed income a beggarly regiment to marshal against the invader he fancied however in his ignorance of literary profits that a popular writer selling several editions had come to an el dorado there was the mine it required a diligent worker diana was often struck by hearing redworth ask her when her next book might be expected he appeared to have an eagerness in hurrying her to produce and she had to say that she was not a nimble writer his flattering impatience was vexatious he admired her work yet he did his utmost to render it little admirable his literary taste was not that of young arthur rhodes to whom she could read her chapters appearing to take counsel upon them while drinking the eulogies she suspected him of prosaic ally wishing her to make money and though her exchequer was beginning to know the need of it the author's lofty mind disdained such sordidness to be excused possibly for a failing productive energy she encountered obstacles to imaginative composition with the pen in her hand she would fall into heavy musings break a sentence to muse and not on the subject she slept unevenly at night was drowsy by day unless the open air was about her or animating friends redworth's urgency to get her to publish was particularly annoying when she felt how greatly the young minister of state would have been improved had she retained the work to brood over it polish re write passages perfect it her musings embraced long dialogues of that work never printed they sprang up they passed from memory leaving a distaste for her present work the cantatrice far more poetical than the preceding in the opinion of arthur rhodes and the story was more romantic modelled on a prima donna she had met at the musical parties of henry wilmers after hearing redworth tell of charles rainer's quaint passion for the woman or the idea of the woman diana had courted her studied and liked her the picture she was drawing of the amiable and gifted italian of her villain roumanian husband and of the eccentric high minded devoted englishman was good in a fashion but considering the theme she had reasonable apprehension that her cantatrice would not repay her for the time and labour bestowed on it no clever transcripts of the dialogue of the day occurred no hair breadth 'scapes perils by sea and land heroisms of the hero fine shrieks of the heroine no set scenes of catching pathos and humour no distinguishable points of social satire equivalent to a smacking of the public on the chaps which excites it to grin with keen discernment of the author's intention she did not appeal to the senses nor to a superficial discernment so she had the anticipatory sense of its failure and she wrote her best in perverseness of course she wrote slowly she wrote more and more realistically of the characters and the downright human emotions less of the wooden supernumeraries of her story labelled for broad guffaw or deluge tears the grappling natural links between our public and an author her feelings were aloof they flowed at a hint of a scene of the young minister she could not put them into the cantatrice and arthur rhodes pronounced this work poetical beyond its predecessors for the reason that the chief characters were alive and the reader felt their pulses he meant to say they were poetical inasmuch as they were creations the slow progress of a work not driven by the author's feelings necessitated frequent consultations between debit and credit resulting in altercations recriminations discord of the yoked and divergent couple to restore them to their proper trot in harness diana reluctantly went to her publisher for an advance item of the sum she was to receive and the act increased her distaste an idea came that she would soon cease to be able to write at all what then perhaps by selling her invested money and ultimately the crossways she would have enough for her term upon earth necessarily she had to think that short in order to reckon it as nearly enough 'i am sure' she said to herself 'i shall not trouble the world very long' a strange languor beset her scarcely melancholy for she conceived the cheerfulness of life and added to it in company but a nervelessness as though she had been left by the stream on the banks and saw beauty and pleasure sweep along and away while the sun that primed them dried her veins at this time she was gaining her widest reputation for brilliancy of wit only to welcome guests were her evenings ever spent at home she had no intimate understanding of the deadly wrestle of the conventional woman with her nature which she was undergoing below the surface perplexities she acknowledged and the prudence of guardedness 'but as i am sure not to live very long we may as well meet' her meetings with percy dacier were therefore hardly shunned and his behaviour did not warn her to discountenance them it would have been cruel to exclude him from her select little dinners of eight whitmonby westlake henry wilmers and the rest she perhaps aiding schooled him in the conversational art she heard it said of him that the courted discarder of the sex hitherto a mere politician was wonderfully humanized lady pennon fell to talking of him hopefully she declared him to be one of the men who unfold tardily and only await the mastering passion if the passion had come it was controlled his command of himself melted diana how could she forbid his entry to the houses she frequented she was glad to see him he showed his pleasure in seeing her remembering his tentative indiscretion on those foreign sands she reflected that he had been easily checked and the like was not to be said of some others beautiful women in her position provoke an intemperateness that contrasts touchingly with the self restraint of a particular admirer her 'impassioned caledonian' was one of a host to speak of whom and their fits of lunacy even to her friend emma was repulsive she bore with them foiled them passed them and recovered her equanimity but the contrast called to her to dwell on it the self restraint whispered of a depth of passion she was shocked at herself for a singular tremble 'she experienced without any beating of the heart on hearing one day that the marriage of percy dacier and miss asper was at last definitely fixed mary paynham brought her the news she had it from a lady who had come across miss asper at lady wathin's assemblies and considered the great heiress extraordinarily handsome 'a golden miracle' diana gave her words to say 'good looks and gold together are rather superhuman the report may be this time true' next afternoon the card of lady wathin requested mrs warwick to grant her a private interview lady wathin as one of the order of women who can do anything in a holy cause advanced toward mrs warwick unabashed by the burden of her mission and spinally prepared behind benevolent smilings to repay dignity of mien with a similar erectness of dignity they touched fingers and sat the preliminaries to the matter of the interview were brief between ladies physically sensible of antagonism and mutually too scornful of subterfuges in one another's presence to beat the bush lady wathin began 'i am you are aware mrs warwick a cousin of your friend lady dunstane' 'you come to me on business' diana said 'it may be so termed i have no personal interest in it i come to lay certain facts before you which i think you should know we think it better that an acquaintance and one of your sex should state the case to you instead of having recourse to formal intermediaries lawyers ' 'lawyers' 'well my husband is a lawyer it is true in the course of his professional vocations he became acquainted with mr warwick we have latterly seen a good deal of him he is i regret to say seriously unwell' 'i have heard of it' 'he has no female relations it appears he needs more care than he can receive from hirelings' 'are you empowered by him lady wathin' 'i am mrs warwick we will not waste time in apologies he is most anxious for a reconciliation it seems to sir cramborne and to me the most desireable thing for all parties concerned if you can be induced to regard it in that light mr warwick may or may not live but the estrangement is quite undoubtedly the cause of his illness i touch on nothing connected with it i simply wish that you should not be in ignorance of his proposal and his condition' diana bowed calmly 'i grieve at his condition his proposal has already been made and replied to' 'oh but mrs warwick an immediate and decisive refusal of a proposal so fraught with consequences' 'ah but lady wathin you are now outstepping the limits prescribed by the office you have undertaken' 'you will not lend ear to an intercession' 'i will not' 'of course mrs warwick it is not for me to hint at things that lawyers could say on the subject' 'your forbearance is creditable lady wathin' 'believe me mrs warwick the step is i speak in my husband's name as well as my own strongly to be advised' 'if i hear one word more of it i leave the country' 'i should be sorry indeed at any piece of rashness depriving your numerous friends of your society we have recently become acquainted with mr redworth and i know the loss you would be to them i have not attempted an appeal to your feelings mrs warwick' 'i thank you warmly lady wathin for what you have not done' the aristocratic airs of mrs warwick were annoying to lady wathin when she considered that they were borrowed and that a pattern morality could regard the woman as ostracized nor was it agreeable to be looked at through eyelashes under partially lifted brows she had come to appeal to the feelings of the wife at any rate to discover if she had some and was better than a wild adventuress 'our life below is short' she said to which diana tacitly assented 'we have our little term mrs warwick it is soon over' 'on the other hand the platitudes concerning it are eternal' lady wathin closed her eyes that the like effect might be produced on her ears 'ah they are the truths but it is not my business to preach permit me to say that i feel deeply for your husband' 'i am glad of mr warwick's having friends and they are many i hope' 'they cannot behold him perishing without an effort on his behalf' a chasm of silence intervened wifely pity was not sounded in it 'he will question me mrs warwick' 'you can report to him the heads of our conversation lady wathin' 'would you it is your husband's most earnest wish and our house is open to his wife and to him for the purpose and it seems to us that indeed it might avert a catastrophe you would necessarily deplore would you consent to meet him at my house' 'it has already been asked lady wathin and refused' 'but at my house under our auspices' diana glanced at the clock 'nowhere' 'is it not pardon me a wife's duty mrs warwick at least to listen' 'lady wathin i have listened to you' 'in the case of his extreme generosity so putting it for the present mrs warwick that he asks only to be heard personally by his wife it may preclude so much' diana felt a hot wind across her skin she smiled and said 'let me thank you for bringing to an end a mission that must have been unpleasant to you' 'but you will meditate on it mrs warwick will you not give me that assurance' 'i shall not forget it' said diana again the ladies touched fingers with an interchange of the social grimace of cordiality a few words of compassion for poor lady dunstane's invalided state covered lady wathin's retreat she left it struck her ruffled sentiments an icy libertine whom any husband caring for his dignity and comfort was well rid of and if only she could have contrived allusively to bring in the name of mr percy dacier just to show these arrant coquettes or worse that they were not quite so privileged to pursue their intrigues obscurely as they imagined it would have soothed her exasperation she left a woman the prey of panic diana thought of emma and redworth and of their foolish interposition to save her character and keep her bound she might now have been free the struggle with her manacles reduced her to a state of rebelliousness from which issued vivid illuminations of the one means of certain escape an abhorrent hissing cavern that led to a place named liberty her refuge but a hectic place unable to write hating the house which held her a fixed mark for these attacks she had an idea of flying straight to her beloved lugano lake and there hiding abandoning her friends casting off the slave's name she bore and living free in spirit she went so far as to reckon the cost of a small household there and justify the violent step by an exposition of retrenchment upon her large london expenditure she had but to say farewell to emma no other tie to cut one morning on the salvatore heights would wash her clear of the webs defacing and entangling her chapter xxiv indicates a soul prepared for desperation the month was august four days before the closing of parliament and diana fancied it good for arthur rhodes to run down with her to copsley he came to her invitation joyfully reminding her of lady dunstane's wish to hear some chapters of the cantatrice and the ms was packed they started taking rail and fly and winding up the distance on foot august is the month of sober maturity and majestic foliage songless but a crowned and royal robed queenly month and the youngster's appreciation of the homely scenery refreshed diana his delight in being with her was also pleasant she had no wish to exchange him for another and that was a strengthening thought at copsley the arrival of their luggage had prepared the welcome warm though it was diana perceived a change in emma an unwonted reserve a doubtfulness of her eyes in spite of tenderness and thus thrown back on herself thinking that if she had followed her own counsel as she called her impulse in old days there would have been no such present misery she at once and unconsciously assumed a guarded look based on her knowledge of her honest footing it was a little defiant secretly in her bosom it was sharpened to a slight hostility by the knowledge that her mind had been straying the guilt and the innocence combined to clothe her in mail the innocence being positive the guilt so vapoury but she was armed only if necessary and there was no requirement for armour emma did not question at all she saw the alteration in her tony she was too full of the tragic apprehensiveness overmastering her to speak of trifles she had never confided to tony the exact nature and the growth of her malady thinking it mortal and fearing to alarm her dearest a portion of the manuscript was read out by arthur rhodes in the evening the remainder next morning redworth perceptibly was the model of the english hero and as to his person no friend could complain of the sketch his clear eyed heartiness manliness wholesomeness a word of lady dunstane's regarding him and his handsome braced figure were well painted emma forgave the insistance on a certain bluntness of the nose in consideration of the fond limning of his honest and expressive eyes and the 'light on his temples' which they had noticed together she could not so easily forgive the realistic picture of the man an exaggeration she thought of small foibles that even if they existed should not have been stressed the turn for 'calculating' was shown up ridiculously mr cuthbert dering was calculating in his impassioned moods as well as in his cold his head was a long division of ciphers he had statistics for spectacles and beheld the world through them and the mistress he worshipped 'i see' said emma during a pause 'he is a saxon you still affect to have the race en grippe tony' 'i give him every credit for what he is' diana replied 'i admire the finer qualities of the race as much as any one you want to have them presented to you in enamel emmy' but the worst was an indication that the mania for calculating in and out of season would lead to the catastrophe destructive of his happiness emma could not bear that without asking herself whether it could be possible that tony knew the secret or whether she would have laid it bare her sympathy for redworth revolted at the exposure she was chilled she let it pass she merely said 'i like the writing' diana understood that her story was condemned she put on her robes of philosophy to cloak discouragement 'i am glad the writing pleases you' 'the characters are as true as life' cried arthur rhodes 'the cantatrice drinking porter from the pewter at the slips after harrowing the hearts of her audience is dearer to me than if she had tottered to a sofa declining sustenance and because her creatrix has infused such blood of life into her that you accept naturally whatever she does she was exhausted and required the porter like a labourer in the cornfield' emma looked at him and perceived the poet swamped by the admirer taken in conjunction with mr cuthbert dering's frenzy for calculating she disliked the incident of the porter and the pewter 'while the cantatrice swallowed her draught i suppose mr dering counted the cost' she said 'it really might be hinted' said diana the discussion closed with the accustomed pro and con upon the wart of cromwell's nose realism rejoicing in it idealism objecting arthur rhodes was bidden to stretch his legs on a walk along the heights in the afternoon and emma was further vexed by hearing tony complain of redworth's treatment of the lad whom he would not assist to any of the snug little posts he was notoriously able to dispense 'he has talked of mr rhodes to me' said emma 'he thinks the profession of literature a delusion and doubts the wisdom of having poets for clerks' 'john bullish' diana exclaimed 'he speaks contemptuously of the poor boy' 'only inasmuch as the foolishness of the young man in throwing up the law provokes his practical mind to speak' 'he might take my word for the young man's ability i want him to have the means of living that he may write he has genius' 'he may have it i like him and have said so if he were to go back to his law stool i have no doubt that redworth would manage to help him' 'and make a worthy ancient braddock of a youth of splendid promise have i sketched him too saxon' 'it is the lens and hot the tribe tony' the cantatrice was not alluded to any more but emma's disapproval blocked the current of composition already subject to chokings in the brain of the author diana stayed three days at copsley one longer than she had intended so that arthur rhodes might have his fill of country air 'i would keep him but i should be no companion for him' emma said 'i suspect the gallant squire is only to be satisfied by landing me safely' said diana and that small remark grated though emma saw the simple meaning when they parted she kissed her tony many times tears were in her eyes it seemed to diana that she was anxious to make amends for the fit of alienation and she was kissed in return warmly quite forgiven notwithstanding the deadly blank she had caused in the imagination of the writer for pay distracted by the squabbles of debit and credit diana chatted spiritedly to young rhodes on their drive to the train she was profoundly discouraged by emma's disapproval of her work it wanted but that one drop to make a recurrence to the work impossible there it must lie and what of the aspects of her household perhaps after all the redworths of the world are right and literature as a profession is a delusive pursuit she did not assent to it without hostility to the world's redworths 'they have no sensitiveness we have too much we are made of bubbles that a wind will burst and as the wind is always blowing your practical redworths have their crow of us' she suggested advice to arthur rhodes upon the prudence of his resuming the yoke of the law he laughed at such a notion saying that he had some expectations of money to come 'but i fear' said he 'that lady dunstane is very very ill she begged me to keep her informed of your address' diana told him he was one of those who should know it whithersoever she went she spoke impulsively her sentiments of friendliness for the youth being temporarily brightened by the strangeness of emma's conduct in deputing it to him to fulfil a duty she had never omitted 'what can she think i am going to do' on her table at home lay a letter from mr warwick she read it hastily in the presence of arthur rhodes having at a glance at the handwriting anticipated the proposal it contained and the official phrasing her gallant squire was invited to dine with her that evening costume excused they conversed of literature as a profession of poets dead and living of politics which he abhorred and shied at and of his prospects he wrote many rejected pages enjoyed an income of eighty pounds per annum and eked out a subsistence upon the modest sum his pen procured him a sum extremely insignificant but great nature was his own the world was tributary to him the future his bejewelled and expectant bride diana envied his youthfulness nothing is more enviable nothing richer to the mind than the aspect of a cheerful poverty how much nobler it was contrasted with redworth's amassing of wealth when alone she went to her bedroom and tried to write tried to sleep mr warwick's letter was looked at it seemed to indicate a threat but for the moment it did not disturb her so much as the review of her moral prostration she wrote some lines to her lawyers quoting one of mr warwick's sentences that done his letter was dismissed her intolerable languor became alternately a defeating drowsiness and a fever she succeeded in the effort to smother the absolute cause it was not suffered to show a front at the cost of her knowledge of a practised self deception 'i wonder whether the world is as bad as a certain class of writers tell us' she sighed in weariness and mused on their soundings and probings of poor humanity which the world accepts for the very bottom truth if their dredge brings up sheer refuse of the abominable the world imagines those to be at our nature's depths who are impudent enough to expose its muddy shallows she was in the mood for such a kind of writing she could have started on it at once but that the theme was wanting and it may count on popularity a great repute for penetration it is true of its kind though the dredging of nature is the miry form of art when it flourishes we may be assured we have been overenamelling the higher forms she felt and shuddered to feel that she could draw from dark stores hitherto in her works it had been a triumph of the good they revealed a gaping deficiency of the subtle insight she now possessed 'exhibit humanity as it is wallowing sensual wicked behind the mask' a voice called to her she was allured by the contemplation of the wide mouthed old dragon ego whose portrait decently painted establishes an instant touch of exchange between author and public the latter detected and confessing next to the pantomime of humour and pathos a cynical surgical knife at the human bosom seems the surest talisman for this agreeable exchange and she could cut she gave herself a taste of her powers she cut at herself mercilessly and had to bandage the wound in a hurry to keep in life metaphors were her refuge metaphorically she could allow her mind to distinguish the struggle she was undergoing sinking under it the banished of eden had to put on metaphors and the common use of them has helped largely to civilize us the sluggish in intellect detest them but our civilization is not much indebted to that major faction especially are they needed by the pedestalled woman in her conflict with the natural diana saw herself through the haze she conjured up 'am i worse than other women' was a piercing twithought worse would be hideous isolation the not worse abased her sex she could afford to say that the world was bad not that women were sinking deeper an anguish of humiliation smote her to a sense of drowning for what of the poetic ecstasy on her salvatore heights had not been of origin divine had sprung from other than spiritual founts had sprung from the reddened sources she was compelled to conceal could it be she would not believe it but there was matter to clip her wings quench her light in the doubt she fell asleep like the wrecked flung ashore danvers entered her room at an early hour for london to inform her that mr percy dacier was below and begged permission to wait diana gave orders for breakfast to be proposed to him she lay staring at the wall until it became too visibly a reflection of her mind chapter xxv once more the crossways and a change of turnings the suspicion of his having come to impart the news of his proximate marriage ultimately endowed her with sovereign calmness she had need to think it and she did tea was brought to her while she dressed she descended the stairs revolving phrases of happy congratulation and the world's ordinary epigrams upon the marriage tie neatly mixed they read in one another's faces a different meaning from the empty words of excuse and welcome dacier's expressed the buckling of a strong set purpose but grieved by the look of her eyes he wasted a moment to say 'you have not slept you have heard' 'what' said she trying to speculate and that was a sufficient answer 'i hadn't the courage to call last night i passed the windows give me your hand i beg' she gave her hand in wonderment and more wonderingly felt it squeezed her heart began the hammerthump she spoke an unintelligible something saw herself melting away to utter weakness pride reserve simple prudence all going crumbled ruins where had stood a fortress imposing to men was it love her heart thumped shiveringly he kept her hand indifferent to the gentle tension 'this is the point i cannot live without you i have gone on who was here last night forgive me' 'you know arthur rhodes' 'i saw him leave the door at eleven why do you torture me there's no time to lose now you will be claimed come and let us two cut the knot it is the best thing in the world for me the only thing be brave i have your hand give it for good and for heaven's sake don't play the sex be yourself dear soul of a woman i never saw the soul in one but in you i have waited nothing but the dread of losing you sets me speaking now and for you to be sacrificed a second time to that oh no you know you can trust me on my honour i take breath from you you are my better in everything guide goddess dearest heart trust me make me master of your fate' 'but my friend' the murmur hung in her throat he was marvellously transformed he allowed no space for the arts of defence and evasion 'i wish i had the trick of courting there's not time and i 'm a simpleton at the game we can start this evening once away we leave it to them to settle the matter and then you are free and mine to the death' 'but speak speak what is it' diana said 'that if we delay i 'm in danger of losing you altogether' her eyes lightened 'you mean that you have heard he has determined ' 'there's a process of the law but stop it just this one step and it ends whether intended or not it hangs over you and you will be perpetually tormented why waste your whole youth and mine as well for i am bound to you as much as if we had stood at the altar where we will stand together the instant you are free' 'but where have you heard' 'from an intimate friend i will tell you sufficiently intimate from lady wathin nothing of a friend but i see this woman at times she chose to speak of it to me it doesn't matter why she is in his confidence and pitched me a whimpering tale let those people chatter but it 's exactly for those people that you are hanging in chains all your youth shrivelling let them shout their worst it's the bark of a day and you won't hear it half a year and it will be over and i shall bring you back the husband of the noblest bride in christendom you don't mistrust me' 'it is not that' said she 'but now drop my hand i am imprisoned' 'it's asking too much i've lost you too many times i have the hand and i keep it i take nothing but the hand it's the hand i want i give you mine i love you now i know what love is and the word carries nothing of its weight tell me you do not doubt my honour' 'not at all but be rational i must think and i cannot while you keep my hand' he kissed it 'i keep my own against the world' a cry of rebuke swelled to her lips at his conqueror's tone it was not uttered for directness was in his character and his wooing loyal save for bitter circumstances delicious to hear and so narrow was the ring he had wound about her senses that her loathing of the circumstances pushed her to acknowledge within her bell of a heart her love for him he was luckless enough to say 'diana' it rang horridly of her husband she drew her hand to loosen it with repulsing brows 'not that name' dacier was too full of his honest advocacy of the passionate lover to take a rebuff there lay his unconscious mastery where the common arts of attack would have tripped him with a quick witted woman and where a man of passion not allowing her to succumb in dignity would have alarmed her to the breaking loose from him 'lady dunstane calls you tony' 'she is my dearest and oldest friend' 'you and i don't count by years you are the dearest to me on earth tony' she debated as to forbidding that name the moment's pause wrapped her in a mental hurricane out of which she came with a heart stopped her olive cheeks ashen hued she had seen that the step was possible 'oh percy percy are we mad' 'not mad we take what is ours tell me have i ever ever disrespected you you were sacred to me and you are though now the change has come look back on it it is time lost years that are dust but look forward and you cannot imagine our separation what i propose is plain sense for us two since rovio i have been at your feet have i not some just claim for recompense tell me tony' the sweetness of the secret name the privileged name in his mouth stole through her blood melting resistance she had consented the swarthy flaming of her face avowed it even more than the surrender of her hand he gained much by claiming little he respected her gave her no touches of fright and shame and it was her glory to fall with pride an attempt at a caress would have awakened her view of the whitherward but she was treated as a sovereign lady rationally advised 'is it since rovio percy' 'since the morning when you refused me one little flower' 'if i had given it you might have been saved' 'i fancy i was doomed from the beginning' 'i was worth a thought' 'worth a life worth ten thousand' 'you have reckoned it all like a sane man family position the world the scandal' 'all i have long known that you were the mate for me you have to weather a gale tony it won't last my dearest it won't last many months i regret the trial for you but i shall be with you burning for the day to reinstate you and show you the queen you are' 'yes we two can have no covert dealings percy' said diana they would be hateful baseness rejecting any baseness it seemed to her that she stood in some brightness the light was of a lurid sort she called on her heart to glory in it as the light of tried love the love that defied the world her heart rose she and he would at a single step give proof of their love for one another and this kingdom of love how different from her recent craven languors this kingdom awaited her was hers for one word and beset with the oceans of enemies it was unassailable if only they were true to the love they vowed no human force could subvert it and she doubted him as little as of herself this new kingdom of love never entered by her acclaiming her was well nigh unimaginable in spite of the many hooded messengers it had despatched to her of late she could hardly believe that it had come 'but see me as i am' she said she faltered it through her direct gaze on him 'with chains to strike off certainly it is done' he replied 'rather heavier than those of the slave market i am the deadest of burdens it means that your enemies personal if you have any and political you have numbers will raise a cry realize it you may still be my friend i forgive the bit of wildness' she provoked a renewed kissing of her hand for magnammity in love is an overflowing danger and when he said 'the burden you have to bear outweighs mine out of all comparison what is it to a man a public man or not the woman is always the victim that's why i have held myself in so long her strung frame softened she half yielded to the tug on her arm 'is there no talking for us without foolishness' she murmured the foolishness had wafted her to sea far from sight of land 'now sit and speak soberly discuss the matter yes my hand but i must have my wits leave me free to use them till we choose our path let it be the brains between us as far as it can you ask me to join my fate to yours it signifies a sharp battle for you dear friend perhaps the blighting of the most promising life in england one question is can i countervail the burden i shall be by such help to you as i can afford burden is no word i rake up a buried fever i have partially lived it down and instantly i am covered with spots the old false charges and this plain offence make a monster of me' 'and meanwhile you are at the disposal of the man who falsely charged you and armed the world against you' said dacier 'i can fly the world is wide' 'time slips your youth is wasted if you escape the man he will have triumphed in keeping you from me and i thirst for you i look to you for aid and counsel i want my mate you have not to be told how you inspire me i am really less than half myself without you if i am to do anything in the world it must be with your aid you beside me our hands are joined one leap do you not see that after well it cannot be friendship it imposes rather more on me than i can bear you are not the woman to trifle nor i tony the man for it with a woman like you you are my spring of wisdom you interdict me altogether can you or we unite our fates like these hands now try to get yours away' her effort ended in a pressure resistance nay to hesitate at the joining of her life with his after her submission to what was a scorching fire in memory though it was less than an embrace accused her of worse than foolishness 'well then' said she 'wait three days deliberate oh try to know yourself for your clear reason to guide you let us be something better than the crowd abusing us not simple creatures of impulse as we choose to call the animal what if we had to confess that we took to our heels the moment the idea struck us three days we may then pretend to a philosophical resolve then come to me or write to me' 'how long is it since the old rovio morning tony' 'an age' 'date my deliberations from that day' the thought of hers having to be dated possibly from an earlier day robbed her of her summit of feminine isolation and she trembled chilled and flushed she lost all anchorage 'so it must be to morrow' said he reading her closely 'not later better at once but women are not to be hurried' 'oh don't class me percy pray i think of you not of myself' 'you suppose that in a day or two i might vary' she fixed her eyes on him expressing certainty of his unalterable stedfastness the look allured it changed her head shook she held away and said 'no leave me leave me dear dear friend percy my dearest i will not play the sex i am yours if if it is your wish it may as well be to morrow here i am useless i cannot write not screw a thought from my head i dread that process of the law a second time to morrow if it must be but no impulses fortune is blind she may be kind to us the blindness of fortune is her one merit and fools accuse her of it and they profit by it i fear we all of us have our turn of folly we throw the stake for good luck i hope my sin is not very great i know my position is desperate i feel a culprit but i am sure i have courage perhaps brains to help at any rate i may say this i bring no burden to my lover that he does not know of' dacier pressed her hand 'money we shall have enough my uncle has left me fairly supplied' 'what would he think' said diana half in a glimpse of meditation 'think me the luckiest of the breeched i fancy i hear him thanking you for making a man of me' she blushed some such phrase might have been spoken by lord dannisburgh 'i have but a poor sum of money' she said 'i may be able to write abroad here i cannot if i am to be persecuted' 'you shall write with a new pen' said dacier 'you shall live my darling tony you have been held too long in this miserable suspension neither maid nor wife neither woman nor stockfish ah shameful but we 'll right it the step for us is the most reasonable that could be considered you shake your head but the circumstances make it so courage and we come to happiness and that for you and me means work look at the case of lord and lady dulac it's identical except that she is no match beside you and i do not compare her antecedents with yours but she braved the leap and forced the world to swallow it and now you see she's perfectly honoured i know a place on a peak of the maritime alps exquisite in summer cool perfectly solitary no english snow round us pastures at our feet and the mediterranean below there my tony to morrow night we start you will meet me shall i call here well then at the railway station the south eastern for paris say twenty minutes to eight i have your pledge you will come' she sighed it then said it firmly to be worthy of him kind fortune peeping under the edge of her bandaged eyes appeared willing to bestow the beginning of happiness upon one who thought she had a claim to a small taste of it before she died it seemed distinguishingly done to give a bite of happiness to the starving 'i fancied when you were announced that you came for congratulations upon your approaching marriage percy' 'i shall expect to hear them from you to morrow evening at the station dear tony' said he the time was again stated the pledge repeated he forbore entreaties for privileges and won her gratitude they named once more the place of meeting and the hour more significant to them than phrases of intensest love and passion pressing hands sharply for pledge of good faith they sundered she still had him in her eyes when he had gone her old world lay shattered her new world was up without a dawn with but one figure the sun of it to light the swinging strangeness was ever man more marvellously transformed or woman more wildly swept from earth into the clouds so she mused in the hum of her tempest of heart and brain forgetful of the years and the conditions preparing both of them for this explosion she had much to do the arrangements to dismiss her servants write to house agents and her lawyer and write fully to emma write the enigmatic farewell to the esquarts and lady pennon mary paynham arthur rhodes whitmonby stanch in friendship but requiring friendly touches henry wilmers and redworth he was reserved to the last for very enigmatical adieux he would hear the whole story from emma must be left to think as he liked the vague letters were excellently well composed she was going abroad and knew not when she would return bade her friends think the best they could of her in the meantime whitmonby was favoured with an anecdote to be read as an apologue by the light of subsequent events but the letter to emma tasked diana intending to write fully her pen committed the briefest sentences the tenderness she felt for emma wakening her heart to sing that she was loved loved and knew love at last and emma's foreseen antagonism to the love and the step it involved rendered her pleadings in exculpation a stammered confession of guiltiness ignominious unworthy of the pride she felt in her lover 'i am like a cartridge rammed into a gun to be discharged at a certain hour tomorrow' she wrote and she sealed a letter so frigid that she could not decide to post it all day she imagined hearing a distant cannonade the light of the day following was not like earthly light danvers assured her there was no fog in london 'london is insupportable i am going to paris and shall send for you in a week or two' said diana 'allow me to say ma'am that you had better take me with you' said danvers 'are you afraid of travelling by yourself you foolish creature' 'no ma'am but i don't like any hands to undress and dress my mistress but my own' 'i have not lost the art' said diana chafing for a magic spell to extinguish the woman to whom immediately pitying her she said 'you are a good faithful soul i think you have never kissed me kiss me on the forehead' danvers put her lips to her mistress's forehead and was asked 'you still consider yourself attached to my fortunes' 'i do ma'am at home or abroad and if you will take me with you' 'not for a week or so' 'i shall not be in the way ma'am' they played at shutting eyes the petition of danvers was declined which taught her the more and she was emboldened to say 'wherever my mistress goes she ought to have her attendant with her' there was no answer to it but the refusal the hours crumbled slowly each with a blow at the passages of retreat diana thought of herself as another person whom she observed not counselling her because it was a creature visibly pushed by the fates in her own mind she could not perceive a stone of solidity anywhere nor a face that had the appearance of our common life she heard the cannon at intervals the things she said set danvers laughing and she wondered at the woman's mingled mirth and stiffness five o'clock struck her letters were sent to the post her boxes were piled from stairs to door she read the labels for her good bye to the hated name of warwick why ever adopted emma might well have questioned why women are guilty of such unreasoning acts but this was the close to that chapter the hour of six went by between six and seven came a sound of knocker and bell at the street door danvers rushed into the sitting room to announce that it was mr redworth before a word could be mustered redworth was in the room he said 'you must come with me at once' chapter xxvi in which a disappointed lover receives a multitude of lessons dacier welted at the station a good figure of a sentinel over his luggage and a spy for one among the inpouring passengers tickets had been confidently taken the private division of the carriages happily secured on board the boat she would be veiled landed on french soil they threw off disguises breasted the facts and those they lightened he smarted with his eagerness he had come well in advance of the appointed time for he would not have had her hang about there one minute alone strange as this adventure was to a man of prominent station before the world and electrical as the turning point of a destiny that he was given to weigh deliberately and far sightedly diana's image strung him to the pitch of it he looked nowhere but ahead like an archer putting hand for his arrow presently he compared his watch and the terminus clock she should now be arriving he went out to meet her and do service many cabs and carriages were peered into couples inspected ladies and their maids wives and their husbands an august exodus to the continent nowhere the starry she but he had a fund of patience she was now in some block of the streets he was sure of her sure of her courage tony and recreancy could not go together now that he called her tony she was his close comrade known the name was a caress and a promise breathing of her as the rose of sweetest earth he counted it to be a month ere his family would have wind of the altered position of his affairs possibly a year to the day of his making the dear woman his own in the eyes of the world she was dear past computation womanly yet quite unlike the womanish woman unlike the semi males courteously called dashing unlike the sentimental his present passion for her lineaments declared her surpassingly beautiful though his critical taste was rather for the white statue that gave no warmth she had brains and ardour she had grace and sweetness a playful petulancy enlivening our atmosphere and withal a refinement a distinction not to be classed and justly might she dislike the being classed her humour was a perennial refreshment a running well that caught all the colours of light her wit studded the heavens of the recollection of her in his heart he felt that it was a stepping down for the brilliant woman to give him her hand a condescension and an act of valour she who always led or prompted when they conversed had now in her generosity abandoned the lead and herself to him and she deserved his utmost honouring but where was she he looked at his watch looked at the clock they said the same ten minutes to the moment of the train's departure a man may still afford to dwell on the charms and merits of his heart's mistress while he has ten minutes to spare the dropping minutes however detract one by one from her individuality and threaten to sink her in her sex entirely it is the inexorable clock that says she is as other women dacier began to chafe he was unaccustomed to the part he was performing and if she failed him she would not she would be late though no she was in time his long legs crossed the platform to overtake a tall lady veiled and dressed in black he lifted his hat he heard an alarmed little cry and retired the clock said five minutes a secret chiromancy in addition indicating on its face the word fool an odd word to be cast at him it rocked the icy pillar of pride in the background of his nature certainly standing solos at the hour of eight pm he would stand for a fool hitherto he had never allowed a woman to chance to posture him in that character he strode out returned scanned every lady's shape and for a distraction watched the veiled lady whom he had accosted her figure suggested pleasant features either she was disappointed or she was an adept at the shutting of the gates she glided through not without a fearful look around and at him she disappeared dacier shrugged his novel assimilation to the rat rabble of amatory intriguers tapped him on the shoulder unpleasantly a luckless member of the fraternity too the bell the clock and the train gave him his title 'and i was ready to fling down everything for the woman' the trial of a superb london gentleman's resources in the love passion could not have been much keener no sign of her he who stands ready to defy the world and is baffled by the absence of his fair assistant is the fool doubled so completely the fool that he heads the universal shout he does not spare himself the sole consolation he has is to revile the sex women women whom have they not made a fool of his uncle as much as any and professing to know them him also the man proud of escaping their wiles 'for this woman' he went on saying after he had lost sight of her in her sex's trickeries the nearest he could get to her was to conceive that the arrant coquette was now laughing at her utter subjugation and befooling of the man popularly supposed invincible if it were known of him the idea of his being a puppet fixed for derision was madly distempering he had only to ask the affirmative of constance asper to morrow a vision of his determination to do it somewhat comforted him dacier walked up and down the platform passing his pile of luggage solitary and eloquent on the barrow never in his life having been made to look a fool he felt the red heat of the thing as a man who has not blessedly become acquainted with the swish in boyhood finds his untempered blood turn to poison at a blow he cannot healthily take a licking but then it had been so splendid an insanity when he urged diana to fly with him any one but a woman would have appreciated the sacrifice his luggage had to be removed he dropped his porter a lordly fee and drove home from that astonished solitude he strolled to his club curiosity mastering the wrath it was mixed with he left his club and crossed the park southward in the direction of diana's house abusing her for her inveterate attachment to the regions of westminster there she used to receive lord dannisburgh innocently no doubt assuredly quite innocently and her husband had quitted the district still it was rather childish for a woman to be always haunting the seats of parliament her disposition to imagine that she was able to inspire statesmen came in for a share of ridicule for when we know ourselves to be ridiculous a retort in kind unjust upon consideration is balm the woman dragged him down to the level of common men that was the peculiar injury and it swept her undistinguished into the stream of women in appearance as he had proved to the fellows at his club he was perfectly self possessed mentally distracted and bitter hating himself for it snapping at the cause of it she had not merely disappointed she had slashed his high conceit of himself curbed him at the first animal dash forward and he champed the bit with the fury of a thwarted racer twice he passed her house of course no light was shown at her windows they were scanned malignly he held it due to her to call and inquire whether there was any truth in the report of mrs warwick's illness mrs warwick she meant to keep the name a maid servant came to the door with a candle in her hand revealing red eyelids she was not aware that her mistress was unwell her mistress had left home some time after six o'clock with a gentleman she was unable to tell him the gentleman's name william the footman had opened the door to him her mistress's maid mrs danvers had gone to the play with william she thought that mrs danvers might know who the gentleman was the girl's eyelids blinked and she turned aside dacier consoled her with a piece of gold saying he would come and see mrs danvers in the morning his wrath was partially quieted by the new speculations offered up to it he could not conjure a suspicion of treachery in diana warwick and a treachery so foully cynical she had gone with a gentleman he guessed on all sides he struck at walls as in complete obscurity the mystery of her conduct troubling his wits for the many hours was explained by danvers with a sympathy that she was at pains to show she informed him that her mistress was not at all unwell and related of how mr redworth had arrived just when her mistress was on the point of starting for paris and the continent because poor lady dunstane was this very day to undergo an operation under the surgeons at copsley and she did not wish her mistress to be present but mr redworth thought her mistress ought to be there and he had gone down thinking she was there and then came back in hot haste to fetch her and was just in time as it happened by two or three minutes dacier rewarded the sympathetic woman for her intelligence which appeared to him to have shot so far as to require a bribe gratitude to the person soothing his unwontedly ruffled temper was the cause of the indiscretion in the amount he gave it appeared to him that he ought to proceed to copsley for tidings of lady dunstane thither he sped by the handy railway and a timely train he reached the parkgates at three in the afternoon telling his flyman to wait as he advanced by short cuts over the grass he studied the look of the rows of windows she was within and strangely to his clouded senses she was no longer tony no longer the deceptive woman he could in justice abuse he and she so close to union were divided a hand resembling the palpable interposition of fate had swept them asunder having the poorest right not any to reproach her he was disarmed he felt himself a miserable intruder he summoned his passion to excuse him and gained some unsatisfied repose of mind by contemplating its devoted sincerity which roused an effort to feel for the sufferer diana warwick's friend with the pair of surgeons named the most eminent of their day in attendance the case must be serious to vindicate the breaker of her pledge his present plight likewise assured him of that and nearing the house he adopted instinctively the funeral step and mood just sensible of a novel smallness for the fortifying testimony of his passion had to be put aside he was obliged to disavow it for a simpler motive if he applied at the door he stressed the motive produced the sentiment and passed thus naturally into hypocrisy as lovers precipitated by their blood among the crises of human conditions are often forced to do he had come to inquire after lady dunstane he remembered that it had struck him as a duty on hearing of her dangerous illness the door opened before he touched the bell sir lukin knocked against him and stared 'ah who you' he said and took him by the arm and pressed him on along the gravel 'dacier are you redworth's in there come on a step come it's the time for us to pray good god there's mercy for sinners if ever there was a man but oh good god she's in their hands this minute my saint is under the knife' dacier was hurried forward by a powerful hand 'they say it lasts about five minutes four and a half or more my god when they turned me out of her room she smiled to keep me calm she said dear husband the veriest wretch and brutallest husband ever poor woman and a saint a saint on earth emmy' tears burst from him he pulled forth his watch and asked dacier for the time 'a minute's gone in a minute it's three minutes and a half come faster they're at their work it's life or death i've had death about me but for a woman and your wife and that brave soul she bears it so women are the bravest creatures afloat if they make her shriek it'll be only if she thinks i 'm out of hearing no i see her she bears it they mayn't have begun yet it may all be over come into the wood i must pray i must go on my knees' two or three steps in the wood at the mossed roots of a beech he fell kneeling muttering exclaiming the tempest of penitence closed with a blind look at his watch which he left dangling he had to talk to drug his thoughts 'and mind you' said he when he had rejoined dacier and was pushing his arm again rounding beneath the trees to a view of the house 'for a man steeped in damnable iniquity she bears it all for me because i begged her for the chance of her living it's my doing this knife macpherson swears there is a chance thomson backs him but they're at her cutting the pain must be awful the mere pain the gentlest creature ever drew breath and women fear blood and her own and a head she ought to have married the best man alive not a i can't remember her once complaining of me not once a common donkey compared to her all i can do is to pray and she knows the beast i am and has forgiven me there isn't a blessed text of scripture that doesn't cry out in praise of her and they cut and hack' he dropped his head the vehement big man heaved shuddering his lips worked fast 'she is not alone with them unsupported' said dacier sir lukin moaned for relief he caught his watch swinging and stared at it 'what a good fellow you were to come now 's the time to know your friends there's diana warwick true as steel redworth came on her tiptoe for the continent he had only to mention emmy wanted to spare her she would not have sent wanted to spare her the sight i offered to stand by chased me out diana warwick's there worth fifty of me dacier i've had my sword blade tried by indian horsemen and i know what true as steel means she's there and i know she shrinks from the sight of blood my oath on it she won't quiver a muscle next to my wife you may take my word for it dacier diana warwick is the pick of living women i could prove it they go together i could prove it over and over she 's the loyallest woman anywhere her one error was that marriage of hers and how she ever pitched herself into it none of us can guess' after a while he said 'look at your watch' 'nearly twenty minutes gone' 'are they afraid to send out word it's that window' he covered his eyes and muttered sighed he became abruptly composed in appearance 'the worst of a black sheep like me is i'm such an infernal sinner that providence but both surgeons gave me their word of honour that there was a chance a chance but it's the end of me if emmy good god no the knife's enough don't let her be killed it would be murder here am i talking i ought to be praying i should have sent for the parson to help me i can't get the proper words bellow like a rascal trooper strung up for the cat it must be twenty five minutes now who's alive now' dacier thought of the persian queen crying for news of the slaughtered with her mind on her lord and husband 'who is not dead' diana exalted poets and here was an example of the truth of one to nature and of the poor husband's depth of feeling they said not the same thing but it was the same cry de profundis he saw redworth coming at a quick pace redworth raised his hand sir lukin stopped 'he's waving' 'it's good' said dacier 'speak are you sure' 'i judge by the look' redworth stepped unfalteringly 'it's over all well' he said he brushed his forehead and looked sharply cheerful 'my dear fellow my dear fellow' sir lukin grasped his hand 'it's more than i deserve over she has borne it she would have gone to heaven and left me is she safe' 'doing well' 'have you seen the surgeons' 'mrs warwick' 'what did she say' 'a nod of the head' 'you saw her' 'she came to the stairs' 'diana warwick never lies she wouldn't lie not with a nod they've saved emmy do you think' 'it looks well' my girl has passed the worst of it' 'that's over' sir lukin gazed glassily the necessity of his agony was to lean to the belief at a beckoning that providence pardoned him in tenderness for what would have been his loss he realized it and experienced a sudden calm testifying to the positive pardon 'now look here you two fellows listen half a moment' he addressed redworth and dacier 'i've been the biggest scoundrel of a husband unhung and married to a saint and if she's only saved to me i'll swear to serve her faithfully or may a thunderbolt knock me to perdition and thank god for his justice prayers are answered mind you though a fellow may be as black as a sweep take a warning from me i've had my lesson' dacier soon after talked of going the hope of seeing diana had abandoned him the desire was almost extinct sir lukin could not let him go he yearned to preach to him or any one from his personal text of the sinner honourably remorseful on account of and notwithstanding the forgiveness of providence and he implored dacier and redworth by turns to be careful when they married of how they behaved to the sainted women their wives never to lend ear to the devil nor to believe as he had done that there is no such thing as a devil for he had been the victim of him and he knew the devil he loudly proclaimed has a multiplicity of lures and none more deadly than when he baits with a petticoat he had been hooked and had found the devil in person he begged them urgently to keep his example in memory by following this and that wildfire he had stuck himself in a bog a common result with those who would not see the devil at work upon them and it required his dear suffering saint to be at death's doors cut to pieces and gasping to open his eyes but thank heaven they were opened at last now he saw the beast he was a filthy beast unworthy of tying his wife's shoestring no confessions could expose to them the beast he was but let them not fancy there was no such thing as an active devil about the world redworth divined that the simply sensational man abased himself before providence and heaped his gratitude on the awful power in order to render it difficult for the promise of the safety of his wife to be withdrawn he said 'there is good hope' and drew an admonition upon himself 'ah my dear good redworth' sir lukin sighed from his elevation of outspoken penitence 'you will see as i do some day it is the devil think as you like of it when you have pulled down all the institutions of the country what do you expect but ruins that radicalism of yours has its day you have to go through a wrestle like mine to understand it you say the day is fine let's have our game old england pays for it then you'll find how you love the old land of your birth the noblest ever called a nation with your corn law repeals eh dacier you 'll own it was the devil tempted you i hear you apologizing pray god it mayn't be too late' he looked up at the windows 'she may be sinking' 'have no fears' redworth said 'mrs warwick would send for you' 'she would diana warwick would be sure to send next to my wife diana warwick's she'd send never fear i dread that room i'd rather go through a regiment of sabres though it 's over now and diana warwick stood it the worst is over you told me by heaven women are wonderful creatures but she hasn't a peer for courage i could trust her most extraordinary thing that marriage of hers not a soul has ever been able to explain it trust her to the death' redworth left them and sir lukin ejaculated on the merits of diana warwick to dacier he laughed scornfully 'and that's the woman the world attacks for want of virtue why a fellow hasn't a chance with her not a chance she comes out in blazing armour if you unmask a battery i don't know how it might be if she were in love with a fellow i doubt her thinking men worth the trouble i never met the man but if she were to take fire troy 'd be nothing to it i wonder whether we might go in i dread the house' dacier spoke of departing 'no no wait' sir lukin begged him 'i was talking about women they are the devil or he makes most use of them and you must learn to see the cloven foot under their petticoats if you're to escape them there's no protection in being in love with your wife i married for love i am i always have been in love with her and i went to the deuce the music struck up and away i waltzed a woman like diana warwick might keep a fellow straight because she's all round you she's man and woman in brains and legged like a deer and breasted like a swan and a regular sheaf of arrows in her eyes dark women ah but she has a contempt for us you know that's the secret of her redworth 's at the door bad is it bad i never was particularly fond of that house hated it i love it now for emmy's sake i couldn't live in another though i should be haunted rather her ghost than nothing though i'm an infernal coward about the next world but if you're right with religion you needn't fear what i can't comprehend in redworth is his radicalism and getting richer and richer' 'it's not a vow of poverty' said dacier 'he'll find they don't coalesce or his children will once the masses are uppermost it's a bad day dacier when we 've no more gentlemen in the land emmy backs him so i hold my tongue to morrow's a sunday i wish you were staying here i 'd take you to church with me we shirk it when we haven't a care it couldn't do you harm i've heard capital sermons i've always had the good habit of going to church dacier now 's the time for remembering them ah my dear fellow i 'm not a parson it would have been better for me if i had been' and for you too his look added plainly he longed to preach he was impelled to chatter redworth reported the patient perfectly quiet breathing calmly 'laudanum' asked sir lukin 'now there's a poison we've got to bless and we set up in our wisdom for knowing what is good for us' he had talked his hearers into a stupefied assent to anything he uttered 'mrs warwick would like to see you in two or three minutes she will come down' redworth said to dacier 'that looks well eh that looks bravely' sir lukin cried 'diana warwick wouldn't leave the room without a certainty i dread the look of those men i shall have to shake their hands and so i do with all my heart only but god bless them but we must go in if she's coming down' they entered the house and sat in the drawing room where sir lukin took up from the table one of his wife's latin books a persius bearing her marginal notes he dropped his head on it with sobs the voice of diana recalled him to the present she counselled him to control himself in that case he might for one moment go to the chamber door and assure himself by the silence that his wife was resting she brought permission from the surgeons and doctor on his promise to be still redworth supported sir lukin tottering out dacier had risen he was petrified by diana's face and thought of her as whirled from him in a storm bearing the marks of it her underlip hung for short breaths the big drops of her recent anguish still gathered on her brows her eyes were tearless lustreless she looked ancient in youth and distant by a century like a tall woman of the vaults issuing white ringed not of our light she shut her mouth for strength to speak to him he said 'you are not ill you are strong' 'i oh strong i will sit i cannot be absent longer than two minutes the trial of her strength is to come if it were courage we might be sure the day is fine' 'a perfect august day' 'i held her through it i am thankful to heaven it was no other hand than mine she wished to spare me she was glad of her tony when the time came i thought i was a coward i could have changed with her to save her i am a strong woman fit to submit to that work i should not have borne it as she did she expected to sink under it all her dispositions were made for death bequests to servants and to to friends every secret liking they had thought of' diana clenched her hands 'i hope' dacier said 'you shall hear regularly call at sir william's house to morrow he sleeps here to night the suspense must last for days it is a question of vital power to bear the shock she has a mind so like a flying spirit that just before the moment she made mr lanyan thomson smile by quoting some saying of her tony's' 'try by and by to recollect it' said dacier 'and you were with that poor man how did he pass the terrible time i pitied him' 'he suffered he prayed' 'it was the best he could do mr redworth was as he always is at the trial a pillar happy the friend who knows him for one he never thinks of himself in a crisis he is sheer strength to comfort and aid they will drive you to the station with mr thomson he returns to relieve sir william to morrow i have learnt to admire the men of the knife no profession equals theirs in self command and beneficence dr bridgenorth is permanent here' 'i have a fly and go back immediately' said dacier 'she shall hear of your coming adieu' diana gave him her hand it was gently pressed a wonderment at the utter change of circumstances took dacier passingly at the sight of her vanishing figure he left the house feeling he dared have no personal wishes it had ceased to be the lover's hypocrisy with him the crisis of mortal peril in that house enveloped its inmates and so wrought in him as to enshroud the stripped outcrying husband of whom he had no clear recollection save of the man's agony the two women striving against death devoted in friendship were the sole living images he brought away they were a new vision of the world and our life he hoped with diana bled with her she rose above him high beyond his transient human claims he envied redworth the common friendly right to be near her in reflection long after her simplicity of speech washed pure of the blood emotions for token of her great nature during those two minutes of their sitting together was dearer sweeter to the lover than if she had shown by touch or word that a faint allusion to their severance was in her mind and this despite a certain vacancy it created he received formal information of lady dunstane's progress to convalescence by degrees the simply official tone of diana's letters combined with the ceasing of them and the absence of her personal charm to make a gentleman not remarkable for violence in the passion so calmly reasonable as to think the dangerous presence best avoided for a time subject to fits of the passion he certainly was but his position in the world was a counselling spouse jealous of his good name he did not regret his proposal to take the leap he would not have regretted it if taken on the safe side of the abyss however it wore a gruesome look to his cool blood chapter xxvii contains matter for subsequent explosion among the various letters inundating sir lukin dunstane upon the report of the triumph of surgical skill achieved by sir william macpherson and mr lanyan thomson was one from lady wathin dated adlands an estate of mr quintin manx's in warwickshire petitioning for the shortest line of reassurance as to the condition of her dear cousin and an intimation of the period when it might be deemed possible for a relative to call and offer her sincere congratulations a letter deserving a personal reply one would suppose she received the following in a succinct female hand corresponding to its terseness every 't' righteously crossed every 'i' punctiliously dotted as she remarked to constance asper to whom the communication was transferred for perusal 'dear lady wathin lady dunstane is gaining strength the measure of her pulse indicates favourably she shall be informed in good time of your solicitude for her recovery the day cannot yet be named for visits of any kind you will receive information as soon as the house is open 'i have undertaken the task of correspondence and beg you to believe me 'very truly yours 'd a warwick' miss asper speculated on the handwriting of her rival she obtained permission to keep the letter with the intention of transmitting it per post to an advertising interpreter of character in caligraphy such was the character of the fair young heiress exhibited by her performances much more patently than the run of a quill would reveal it she said 'it is rather a pretty hand i think' 'mrs warwick is a practised writer' said lady wathin 'writing is her profession if she has any she goes to nurse my cousin her husband says she is an excellent nurse he says what he can for her but you must be in the last extremity or she is ice his appeal to her has been totally disregarded until he drops down in the street as his doctor expects him to do some day she will continue her course and even then' an adventuress desiring her freedom lady wathin looked she was too devout a woman to say what she thought but she knew the world to be very wicked of mrs warwick her opinion was formed she would not have charged the individual creature with a criminal design all she did was to stuff the person her virtue abhorred with the wickedness of the world and that is a common process in antipathy she sympathized moreover with the beautiful devotedness of the wealthy heiress to her ideal of man it had led her to make the acquaintance of old lady dacier at the house in town where constance asper had first met percy mrs grafton winstanley's house representing neutral territory or debateable land for the occasional intercourse of the upper class and the climbing in the professions or in commerce mrs grafton winstanley being on the edge of aristocracy by birth her husband like mr quintin manx a lord of fleets old lady dacier's bluntness in speaking of her grandson would have shocked lady wathin as much as it astonished had she been less of an ardent absorber of aristocratic manners percy was plainly called a donkey for hanging off and on with a handsome girl of such expectations as miss asper 'but what you can't do with a horse you can't hope to do with a donkey' she added that she had come for the purpose of seeing the heiress of whose points of person she delivered a judgement critically appreciative as a horsefancier's on the racing turf 'if a girl like that holds to it she's pretty sure to get him at last it 's no use to pull his neck down to the water' lady wathin delicately alluded to rumours of an entanglement an admiration he had ahem 'a married woman' the veteran nodded 'i thought that was off she must be a clever intriguer to keep him so long' 'she is undoubtedly clever' said lady wathin and it was mumbled in her hearing 'the woman seems to have a taste for our family' they agreed that they could see nothing to be done the young lady must wither mrs warwick have her day the veteran confided her experienced why to lady wathin 'all the tales you tell of a woman of that sort are sharp sauce to the palates of men' they might be to the men of the dreadful gilded idle class mrs warwick's day appeared indefinitely prolonged judging by percy dacier's behaviour to miss asper lady wathin watched them narrowly when she had the chance a little ashamed of her sex or indignant rather at his display of courtliness in exchange for her open betrayal of her preference it was almost to be wished that she would punish him by sacrificing herself to one of her many brilliant proposals of marriage but such are women precisely because of his holding back he tightened the cord attaching him to her tenacious heart this was the truth for the rest he was gracefully courteous an observer could perceive the charm he exercised he talked with a ready affability latterly with greater social ease evidently not acting the indifferent conqueror or so consummately acting it as to mask the air and yet he was ambitious and he was not rich notoriously was he ambitious and with wealth to back him a great entertaining house troops of adherents he would gather influence be propelled to leadership the vexation of a constant itch to speak to him on the subject and the recognition that he knew it all as well as she tormented lady wathin he gave her comforting news of her dear cousin in the winter 'you have heard from mrs warwick' she said he replied 'i had the latest from mr redworth' 'mrs warwick has relinquished her post' 'when she does you may be sure that lady dunstane is perfectly reestablished' 'she is an excellent nurse' 'the best i believe' 'it is a good quality in sickness' 'proof of good all through' 'her husband might have the advantage of it his state is really pathetic if she has feeling and could only be made aware she might perhaps be persuaded to pass from the friendly to the wifely duty' mr dacier bent his head to listen and he bowed he was fast in the toils and though we have assurance that evil cannot triumph in perpetuity the aspect of it throning provokes a kind of despair how strange if ultimately the lawyers once busy about the uncle were to take up the case of the nephew and this time reverse the issue by proving it for poor mr warwick was emphatic on the question of his honour it excited him dangerously he was long suffering but with the slightest clue terrible the unknotting of the entanglement might thus happen and constance asper would welcome her hero still meanwhile there was actually nothing to be done a deplorable absence of motive villainy apparently an absence of the beneficent power directing events to their proper termination lady wathin heard of her cousin's having been removed to cowes in may for light solent and channel voyages on board lord esquart's yacht she heard also of heavy failures and convulsions in the city of london quite unconscious that the fates or agents of the providence she invoked to precipitate the catastrophe were then beginning cavernously their performance of the part of villain in diana's history diana and emma enjoyed happy quiet sailings under may breezes on the many coloured south western waters heart in heart again the physical weakness of the one the moral weakness of the other creating that mutual dependency which makes friendship a pulsating tie diana's confession had come of her letter to emma when the latter was able to examine her correspondence diana brought her the heap for perusal her own sealed scribble throbbing with all the fatal might have been under her eyes she could have concealed and destroyed it she sat beside her friend awaiting her turn hearing her say at the superscription 'your writing tony' and she nodded she was asked 'shall i read it' she answered 'read' they were soon locked in an embrace emma had no perception of coldness through those brief dry lines her thought was of the matter 'the danger is over now' she said 'yes that danger is over now' 'you have weathered it' 'i love him' emma dropped a heavy sigh in pity of her remotely in compassion for redworth the loving and unbeloved she was too humane and wise of our nature to chide her tony for having her sex's heart she had charity to bestow on women in defence of them against men and the world it was a charity armed with the weapons of battle the wife madly stripped before the world by a jealous husband and left chained to the rock her youth wasting her blood arrested her sensibilities chilled and assailing her under their multitudinous disguises and for whom the world is merciless called forth emma's tenderest commiseration and that wife being tony and stricken with the curse of love in other circumstances the blessing emma bled for her 'but nothing desperate' she said 'no you have saved me' 'i would knock at death's doors again and pass them to be sure of that' 'kiss me you may be sure i would not put my lips to your cheek if there were danger of my faltering' 'but you love him' 'i do and because i love him i will not let him be fettered to me' 'you will see him' 'do not imagine that his persuasions undermined your tony i am subject to panics' 'was it your husband' 'i had a visit from lady wathin she knows him she came as peacemaker she managed to hint at his authority then came a letter from him of supplication interpenetrated with the hint a suffused atmosphere upon that unexpected by me my let me call him so once forgive me lover came oh he loves me or did then percy he had been told that i should be claimed i felt myself the creature i am a wreck of marriage but i fancied i could serve him i saw golden my vanity was the chief traitor cowardice of course played a part in few things that we do where self is concerned will cowardice not be found and the hallucination colours it to seem a lovely heroism that was the second time mr redworth arrived i am always at crossways and he rescues me on this occasion unknowingly' 'there's a divinity' said emma 'when i think of it i perceive that patience is our beneficent fairy godmother who brings us our harvest in the long result' 'my dear does she bring us our labourers' rations to sustain us for the day' said diana' 'poor fare but enough' 'i fear i was born godmotherless' 'you have stores of patience tony only now and then fits of desperation' 'my nature's frailty the gap in it we will give it no fine names they cover our pitfalls i am open to be carried on a tide of unreasonableness when the coward cries out but i can say dear that after one rescue a similar temptation is unlikely to master me i do not subscribe to the world's decrees for love of the monster though i am beginning to understand the dues of allegiance we have ceased to write letters you may have faith in me' 'i have with my whole soul' said emma so the confession closed and in the present instance there were not any forgotten chambers to be unlocked and ransacked for addenda confessions the subjects discoursed of by the two endeared the hours to them they were aware that the english of the period would have laughed a couple of women to scorn for venturing on them and they were not a little hostile in consequence and shot their epigrams profusely applauding the keener that appeared to score the giant bulk of their intolerant enemy who holds the day but not the morrow us too he holds for the day to punish us if we have temporal cravings he scatters his gifts to the abject tossing to us rebels bare dog biscuit but the life of the spirit is beyond his region we have our morrow in his day when we crave nought of him diana and emma delighted to discover that they were each the rebel of their earlier and less experienced years each a member of the malcontent minor faction the salt of earth to whom their salt must serve for nourishment as they admitted relishing it determinedly not without gratification sir lukin was busy upon his estate in scotland they summoned young arthur rhodes to the island that he might have a taste of the new scenes diana was always wishing for his instruction and refreshment and redworth came to spend a saturday and sunday with them and showed his disgust of the idle boy as usual at the same time consulting them on the topic of furniture for the berkshire mansion he had recently bought rather vaunting the spanish pictures his commissioner in madrid was transmitting the pair of rebels vexed by his treatment of the respectful junior took him for an incarnation of their enemy and pecked and worried the man astonishingly he submitted to it like the placable giant yes he was a liberal and furnishing and decorating the house in the stability of which he trusted why not we must accept the world as it is try to improve it by degrees not so humanity will not wait for you the victims are shrieking beneath the bricks of your enormous edifice behind the canvas of your pictures 'but you may really say that luxurious yachting is an odd kind of insurgency' avowed diana 'it's the tangle we are in' 'it's the coat we have to wear and why fret at it for being comfortable' 'i don't half enough when i think of my shivering neighbours' 'money is of course a rough test of virtue' said redworth 'we have no other general test' money the ladies proclaimed it a mere material test diana gazing on sunny sea with an especial disdain and name us your sort of virtue there is more virtue in poverty he denied that inflexibly british he declared money and also the art of getting money to be hereditary virtues deserving of their reward the reward a superior wealth and its fruits yes the power to enjoy and spread enjoyment and let idleness envy both he abused idleness and by implication the dilettante insurgency fostering it however he was compensatingly heterodox in his view of the law's persecution of women their pertinacious harpings on the theme had brought him to that and in consideration of the fact as they looked from yacht to shore of their being rebels participating largely in the pleasures of the tyrant's court they allowed him to silence them and forgave him thoughts upon money and idleness were in confusion with diana she had a household to support in london and she was not working she could not touch the cantatrice while emma was near possibly she again ejaculated the redworths of the world were right the fruitful labours were with the mattock and hoe or the mind directing them it was a crushing invasion of materialism so she proposed a sail to the coast of france and thither they flew touching cherbourg alderney sark guernsey and sighting the low brittany rocks memorable days to arthur rhodes he saw perpetually the one golden centre in new scenes he heard her voice he treasured her sayings her gestures her play of lip and eyelid her lift of head lightest movements were imprinted on him surely as the heavens are mirrored in the quiet seas firmly and richly as earth answers to the sprinkled grain for he was blissfully athirst untroubled by a hope she gave him more than she knew of a present that kept its beating heart into the future a height of sky a belief in nobility permanent through manhood down to age she was his foam born goddess of those leaping waters differently hued crescented a different influence he had a happy week and it charmed diana to hear him tell her so in spite of redworth she had faith in the fruit bearing powers of a time of simple happiness and shared the youth's in reflecting it only the happiness must be simple that of the glass to the lovely face no straining of arms to retain no heaving of the bosom in vacancy his poverty and capacity for pure enjoyment led her to think of him almost clingingly when hard news reached her from the quaint old city of london which despises poverty and authorcraft and all mean adventurers and bows to the lordly merchant the mighty financier redworth's incarnation of the virtues happy days on board the yacht clarissa diana had to recall them with effort they who sow their money for a promising high percentage have built their habitations on the sides of the most eruptive mountain in europe aetna supplies more certain harvests wrecks fewer vineyards and peaceful dwellings the greed of gain is our volcano her wonder leapt up at the slight inducement she had received to embark her money in this company a south american mine collapsed almost within hearing of the trumpets of prospectus after two punctual payments of the half yearly interest a mrs ferdinand cherson an elder sister of the pretty mrs fryar gunnett had talked to her of the cost of things one afternoon at lady singleby's garden party and spoken of the city as the place to help to swell an income if only you have an acquaintance with some of the chief city men the great mine was named and the rush for allotments she knew a couple of the directors they vowed to her that ten per cent was a trifle the fortune to be expected out of the mine was already clearly estimable at forties and fifties for their part they anticipated cent per cent mrs cherson said she wanted money and had therefore invested in the mine it seemed so consequent the cost of things being enormous she and her sister mrs fryar gunnett owned husbands who did their bidding because of their having the brains it might be understood thus five thousand pounds invested would speedily bring five thousand pounds per annum diana had often dreamed of the city of london as the seat of magic and taking the city's contempt for authorcraft and the intangible as from its point of view justly founded she had mixed her dream strangely with an ancient notion of the city's probity her broker's shaking head did not damp her ardour for shares to the full amount of her ability to purchase she remembered her satisfaction at the allotment the golden castle shot up from this fountain mine she had a frenzy for mines and fished in some english with smaller sums 'i am now a miner' she had exclaimed between dismay at her audacity and the pride of it why had she not consulted redworth he would peremptorily have stopped the frenzy in its first intoxicating effervescence she like mrs cherson like all women who have plunged upon the cost of things wanted money she naturally went to the mine address him for counsel in the person of dupe she could not shame was a barrier could she tell him that the prattle of a woman spendthrift as mrs cherson had induced her to risk her money latterly the reports of mrs fryar gunnett were not of the flavour to make association of their names agreeable to his hearing she had to sit down in the buzz of her self reproaches and amazement at the behaviour of that reputable city shrug and recommence the labour of her pen material misfortune had this one advantage it kept her from speculative thoughts of her lover and the meaning of his absence and silence diana's perusal of the incomplete cantatrice was done with the cold critical eye interpreting for the public she was forced to write on nevertheless and exactly in the ruts of the foregoing matter it propelled her no longer perversely of necessity she wrote her best convinced that the work was doomed to unpopularity resolved that it should be at least a victory in style a fit of angry cynicism now and then set her composing phrases as baits for the critics to quote condemnatory of the attractiveness of the work her mood was bad in addition she found whitmonby cool he complained of the coolness of her letter of adieu complained of her leaving london so long how could she expect to be his queen of the london salon if she lost touch of the topics he made no other allusion they were soon on amicable terms at the expense of flattering arts that she had not hitherto practised but westlake revealed unimagined marvels of the odd corners of the masculine bosom he was the man of her circle the neatest in epigram the widest of survey an oriental traveller a distinguished writer and if not personally bewitching remarkably a gentleman of the world he was wounded he said as much it came to this admitting that he had no claims he declared it to be unbearable for him to see another preferred the happier was unmentioned and diana scraped his wound by rallying him he repeated that he asked only to stand on equal terms with the others her preference of one was past his tolerance she told him that since leaving lady dunstane she had seen but whitmonby wilmers and him he smiled sarcastically saying he had never had a letter from her except the formal one of invitation 'powers of blarney have you forsaken a daughter of erin' cried diana 'here is a friend who has a craving for you and i talk sense to him i have written to none of my set since i last left london' she pacified him by doses of cajolery new to her tongue she liked him abhorred the thought of losing any of her friends so the cajoling sentences ran until westlake betrayed an inflammable composition and had to be put out and smoked sullenly her resources were tried in restoring him to reason the months of absence from london appeared to have transformed her world tonans was moderate the great editor rebuked her for her prolonged absence from london not so much because it discrowned her as queen of the salon but candidly for its rendering her service less to him everything she knew of men and affairs was to him stale 'how do you get to the secrets' she asked 'by sticking to the centre of them' he said 'but how do you manage to be in advance and act the prophet' 'because i will have them at any price and that is known' she hinted at the peccant city company 'i think i have checked the mining mania as i did the railway' said he 'and so far it was a public service there's no checking of maniacs' she took her whipping within and without 'on another occasion i shall apply to you mr tonans' 'ah there was a time when you could have been a treasure to me' he rejoined alluding of course to the dannisburgh days in dejection as she mused on those days and on her foolish ambition to have a london house where her light might burn she advised herself with redworth's voice to quit the house arrest expenditure and try for happiness by burning and shining in the spirit devoting herself as arthur rhodes did purely to literature it became almost a decision percy she had still neither written to nor heard from and she dared not hope to meet him she fancied a wish to have tidings of his marriage it would be peace if in desolation now that she had confessed and given her pledge to emma she had so far broken with him as to render the holding him chained a cruelty and his reserve whispered of a rational acceptance of the end between them she thanked him for it an act whereby she was instantly melted to such softness that a dread of him haunted her coward take up your burden for armour she called to her poor dungeoned self wailing to have common nourishment she knew how prodigiously it waxed on crumbs nay on the imagination of small morsels by way of chastizing it she reviewed her life her behaviour to her husband until she sank backward to a depth deprived of air and light that life with her husband was a dungeon to her nature deeper than any imposed by present conditions she was then a revolutionary to reach to the breath of day she had now to be only not a coward and she could breathe as others did 'women who sap the moral laws pull down the pillars of the temple on their sex' emma had said diana perceived something of her personal debt to civilization her struggles passed into the doomed cantatrice occupying days and nights under pressure for immediate payment the silencing of friend debit ridiculously calling himself credit in contempt of sex and conduct on the ground that he was he solely by virtue of being she he had got a trick of singing operatic solos in the form and style of the delightful tenor tellio and they were touching in absurdity most real in unreality exquisitely trilled after tellio's manner 'the tradesmen all beseech ye the landlord cook and maid complete the cantatrice that they may soon be paid' provoked her to laughter in pathos he approached posturing himself operatically with perpetual new verses rhymes to danvers rhymes to madame sybille the cook seeing tellio at one of henry wilmers' private concerts diana's lips twitched to dimples at the likeness her familiar had assumed she had to compose her countenance to talk to him but the moment of song was the trial lady singleby sat beside her and remarked 'you have always fun going on in you' she partook of the general impression that diana warwick was too humorous to nurse a downright passion before leaving she engaged diana to her annual garden party of the closing season and there the meeting with percy occurred not unobserved had they been overheard very little to implicate them would have been gathered he walked in full view across the lawn to her and they presented mask to mask 'the beauty of the day tempts you at last mrs warwick' 'i have been finishing a piece of work' lovely weather beautiful dresses agreed diana wore a yellow robe with a black bonnet and he commented on the becoming hues for the first time he noticed her dress lovely women dacier hesitated one he saw but surely he must admire mrs fryar gunnett and who steps beside her transparently fascinated with visage at three quarters to the rays within her bonnet can it be sir lukin dunstane and beholding none but his charmer dacier withdrew his eyes thoughtfully from the spectacle and moved to woo diana to a stroll she could not restrain her feet she was out of the ring of her courtiers for the moment he had seized his opportunity 'it is nearly a year' he said 'i have been nursing nearly all the time doing the work i do best' 'unaltered' 'a year must leave its marks' 'tony' 'you speak of a madwoman a good eleven months dead let her rest those are the conditions' 'accepted if i may see her' 'honestly accepted' 'imposed fatally i have to own i have felt with you you are the wiser but admitting that surely we can meet i may see you' 'my house has not been shut' 'i respected the house i distrusted myself' 'what restores your confidence' 'the strength i draw from you' one of the beauties at a garden party is lucky to get as many minutes as had passed in quietness diana was met and captured but those last words of percy's renewed her pride in him by suddenly building a firm faith in herself noblest of lovers she thought and brooded on the little that had been spoken the much conveyed for a proof of perfect truthfulness the world had watched them it pronounced them discreet if culpable probably cold to the passion both of dacier's coldness it had no doubt and diana's was presumed from her comical flights of speech she was given to him because of the known failure of her other adorers he in the front rank of politicians attracted her with the lustre of his ambition she him with her mingling of talent and beauty an astute world right in the main owing to perceptions based upon brute nature utterly astray in particulars for the reason that it takes no count of the soul of man or woman hence its glee at a catastrophe its poor stock of mercy and when no catastrophe follows the prophet for the honour of the profession must decry her as cunning beyond aught yet revealed of a serpent sex save for a word or two the watchman might have overheard and trumpeted his report of their interview at diana's house after the first pained breathing when they found themselves alone in that room where they had plighted their fortunes they talked allusively to define the terms imposed on them by reason the thwarted step was unmentioned it was a past madness but wisdom being recognized they could meet it would be hard if that were denied they talked very little of their position both understood the mutual acceptance of it and now that he had seen her and was again under the spell dacier's rational mind together with his delight in her presence compelled him honourably to bow to the terms only as these were severe upon lovers the innocence of their meetings demanded indemnification in frequency 'come whenever you think i can be useful' said diana they pressed hands at parting firmly and briefly not for the ordinary dactylology of lovers but in sign of the treaty of amity she soon learnt that she had tied herself to her costly household chapter xxviii dialogue round the subject of a portrait with some indications of the task for diana an enamoured egeria who is not a princess in her worldly state nor a goddess by origin has to play one of those parts which strain the woman's faculties past naturalness she must never expose her feelings to her lover she must make her counsel weighty otherwise she is little his nymph of the pure wells and what she soon may be the world will say she has also most imperatively to dazzle him without the betrayal of artifice where simple spontaneousness is beyond conjuring but feelings that are constrained becloud the judgement besides arresting the fine jet of delivery wherewith the mastered lover is taught through his ears to think himself prompted and submit to be controlled by a creature super feminine she must make her counsel so weighty in poignant praises as to repress impulses that would rouse her own and her betraying impulsiveness was a subject of reflection to diana after she had given percy dacier metaphorically the key of her house only as true egeria could she receive him she was therefore grateful she thanked and venerated this noblest of lovers for his not pressing to the word of love and so strengthening her to point his mind freshen his moral energies and inspirit him his chivalrous acceptance of the conditions of their renewed intimacy was a radiant knightliness to diana elevating her with a living image for worship he so near once to being the absolute lord of her destinies how to reward him was her sole dangerous thought she prayed and strove that she might give him of her best to practically help him and she had reason to suppose she could do it from the visible effect of her phrases he glistened in repeating them he had fallen into the habit before witnesses too in the presence of miss paynham who had taken earnestly to the art of painting and obtained her dear mrs warwick's promise of a few sittings for the sketch of a portrait near the close of the season 'a very daring thing to attempt' miss paynham said when he was comparing her first outlines and the beautiful breathing features 'even if one gets the face the lips will seem speechless to those who know her' 'if they have no recollection' said dacier 'i mean the endeavour should be to represent them at the moment of speaking' 'put it into the eyes' he looked at the eyes she looked at the mouth 'but it is the mouth more than the eyes' he looked at the face 'where there is character you have only to study it to be sure of a likeness' 'that is the task with one who utters jewels mr dacier' 'bright wit i fear is above the powers of your art' 'still i feel it could be done see now that' diana's lips had opened to say 'confess me a model model i am dissected while i sit for portrayal i must be for a moment like the frog of the two countrymen who were disputing as to the manner of his death when he stretched to yawn upon which they agreed that he had defeated the truth for both of them i am not quite inanimate' 'irish countrymen' said dacier 'the story adds that blows were arrested so confer the nationality as you please' diana had often to divert him from a too intent perusal of her features with sparkles and stories current or invented to serve the immediate purpose miss paynham was mrs warwick's guest for a fortnight and observed them together she sometimes charitably laid down her pencil and left them having forgotten this or that they were conversing of general matters with their usual crisp precision on her return and she was rather like the two countrymen in debating whether it was excess of coolness or discreetness though she was convinced of their inclinations and expected love some day to be leaping up diana noticed that she had no reminder for leaving the room when it was mr redworth present these two had become very friendly according to her hopes and miss paynham was extremely solicitous to draw suggestions from mr redworth and win his approval 'do i appear likely to catch the mouth now do you think mr redworth' he remarked smiling at diana's expressive dimple that the mouth was difficult to catch he did not gaze intently mr redworth was the genius of friendship 'the friend of women' mrs warwick had said of him miss paynham discovered it as regarded herself the portrait was his commission to her kindly proposed secretly of course to give her occupation and the chance of winning a vogue with the face of a famous beauty so many however were mrs warwick's visitors and so lively the chatter she directed that accurate sketching was difficult to an amateurish hand whitmonby sullivan smith westlake henry wilmers arthur rhodes and other gentlemen literary and military were almost daily visitors when it became known that the tedium of the beautiful sitter required beguiling and there was a certainty of finding her at home on mrs warwick's wednesday numerous ladies decorated the group then was heard such a rillet of dialogue without scandal or politics as nowhere else in britain all vowed it subsequently for to the remembrance it seemed magical not a breath of scandal and yet the liveliest flow lady pennon came attended by a mr alexander hepburn a handsome scot at whom dacier shot one of his instinctive keen glances before seeing that the hostess had mounted a transient colour mr hepburn in settling himself on his chair rather too briskly contrived the next minute to break a precious bit of china standing by his elbow and lady pennon cried out with sympathetic anguish 'oh my dear what a trial for you' 'brittle is foredoomed' said diana unruffled she deserved compliments and would have had them if she had not wounded the most jealous and petulant of her courtiers 'then the turk is a sapient custodian' said westlake vexed with her flush at the entrance of the scot diana sedately took his challenge 'we mr westlake have the philosophy of ownership' mr hepburn penitentially knelt to pick up the fragments and westlake murmured over his head 'as long as it is we who are the cracked' 'did we not start from china' 'we were consequently precipitated to stamboul' 'you try to elude the lesson' 'i remember my first paedagogue telling me so when he rapped the book on my cranium' 'the mark of the book is not a disfigurement' it was gently worded and the shrewder for it the mark of the book if not a disfigurement was a characteristic of westlake's fashion of speech whitmonby nodded twice for signification of a palpable hit in that bout and he noted within him the foolishness of obtruding the remotest allusion to our personality when crossing the foils with a woman she is down on it like the lightning quick as she is in her contracted circle politeness guarding her from a riposte mr hepburn apologized very humbly after regaining his chair diana smiled and said 'incidents in a drawing room are prize shots at dulness' 'and in a dining room too' added sullivan smith 'i was one day at a dinner party apparently of undertakers hired to mourn over the joints and the birds in the dishes when the ceiling came down and we all sprang up merry as crickets it led to a pretty encounter and a real prize shot' 'does that signify a duel' asked lady pennon ''twould be the vulgar title to bring it into discredit with the populace my lady' 'rank me one of the populace then i hate duelling and rejoice that it is discountenanced' 'the citizens and not the populace i think mr sullivan smith means' diana said 'the citizen is generally right in morals my father also was against the practice when it raged at its prettiest i have heard him relate a story of a poor friend of his who had to march out for a trifle and said as he accepted the invitation it's all nonsense and walking to the measured length it's all nonsense you know and when lying on the ground at his last gasp i told you it was all nonsense' sullivan smith leaned over to whitmonby and dacier amid the ejaculations and whispered 'a lady's way of telling the story and excuseable to her she had to jonah the adjective what the poor fellow said was ' he murmured the sixty pounder adjective as in the belly of the whale to rightly emphasize his noun whitmonby nodded to the superior relish imparted by the vigour of masculine veracity in narration 'a story for its native sauce piquante' he said 'nothing without it' they had each a dissolving grain of contempt for women compelled by their delicacy to spoil that kind of story which demands the piquant accompaniment to flavour it racily and make it passable for to see insipid mildness complacently swallowed as an excellent thing knowing the rich smack of savour proper to the story is your anecdotal gentleman's annoyance but if the anecdote had supported him sullivan smith would have let the expletive rest major carew mahoney capped mrs warwick's tale of the unfortunate duellist with another that confessed the practice absurd though he approved of it and he cited lord larrian's opinion 'it keeps men braced to civil conduct' 'i would not differ with the dear old lord but no the pistol is the sceptre of the bully' said diana mr hepburn with the widest of eyes on her in perpetuity warmly agreed and the man was notorious among men for his contrary action 'most righteously our princess egeria distinguishes her reign by prohibiting it' said lady singleby 'and how' sullivan smith sighed heavily 'how i'd ask are ladies to be protected from the bully' he was beset 'so it was all for us all in consideration for our benefit' he mournfully exclaimed 'why surely' 'that is the funeral apology of the rod at the close of every barbarous chapter' said diana 'too fine in mind too fat in body that is a consequence with men dear madam the conqueror stands to his weapons or he loses his possessions' 'mr sullivan smith jumps at his pleasure from the special to the general and will be back if we follow him lady pennon it is the trick men charge to women showing that they can resemble us' lady pennon thumped her knee 'not a bit there's no resemblance and they know nothing of us' 'women are a blank to them i believe' said whitmonby treacherously bowing and westlake said 'traces of a singular scrawl have been observed when they were held in close proximity to the fire' 'once on the top of a coach' whitmonby resumed 'i heard a comely dame of the period when summers are ceasing threatened by her husband with a divorce for omitting to put sandwiches in their luncheon basket she made him the inscrutable answer ah poor man you will go down ignorant to your grave we laughed and to this day i cannot tell you why' 'that laugh was from a basket lacking provision and i think we could trace our separation to it' diana said to lady pennon who replied 'they expose themselves they get no nearer to the riddle' miss courtney a rising young actress encouraged by a smile from mrs warwick remarked 'on the stage we have each our parts equally' 'and speaking parts not personae mutae' 'the stage has advanced in verisimilitude' henry wilmers added slyly and diana rejoined 'you recognize a verisimilitude of the mirror when it is in advance of reality flatter the sketch miss paynham for a likeness to be seen probably there are still old conservatives who would prefer the personation of us by boys' 'i don't know' westlake affected dubiousness 'i have heard that a step to the riddle is gained by a serious contemplation of boys' 'serious' 'that is the doubt' 'the doubt throws its light on the step' 'i advise them not to take any leap from their step' said lady pennon 'it would be a way of learning that we are no wiser than our sires but perhaps too painful a way' whitmonby observed 'poor mountford wilts boasted of knowing women and he married to jump into the mouth of the enigma is not to read it' 'you are figures of conceit when you speculate on us mr whitmonby' 'an occupation of our leisure my lady for your amusement' 'the leisure of the humming top a thousand to the minute with the pretence that it sleeps' diana said 'the sacrilegious hand to strip you of your mystery is withered as it stretches' exclaimed westlake 'the sage and the devout are in accord for once' 'and whichever of the two i may be i'm one of them happy to do my homage blindfold' sullivan smith waved the sign of it diana sent her eyes over him and mr hepburn seeing dacier 'that rosy mediaevalism seems the utmost we can expect' an instant she saddened foreboding her words to be ominous because of suddenly thirsting for a modern cry from him the silent she quitted her woman's fit of earnestness and took to the humour that pleased him 'aslauga's knight at his blind man's buff of devotion catches the hem of the tapestry and is found by his lady kissing it in a trance of homage five hours long sir hilary of agincourt returned from the wars to his castle at midnight hears that the chitellaine is away dancing and remains with all his men mounted in the courtyard till the grey morn brings her back adorable we had a flag flying in those days since men began to fret the riddle they have hauled it down half mast soon we shall behold a bare pole and hats on around it that is their solution' a smile circled at the hearing of lady singleby say 'well i am all for our own times however literal the men' 'we are two different species' thumped lady pennon swimming on the theme 'i am sure i read what they write of women and their heroines' lady esquart acquiesced 'we are utter fools or horrid knaves' 'nature's original hieroglyphs which have that appearance to the peruser' westlake assented 'and when they would decipher us and they hit on one of our arts the literary pirouette they perform is memorable' diana looked invitingly at dacier 'but i for one discern a possible relationship and a likeness' 'i think it exists behind a curtain' dacier replied 'before the era of the nursery liberty to grow independence is the key of the secret' 'and what comes after the independence' he inquired whitmonby musing that some distraction of an earnest incentive spoilt mrs warwick's wit informed him 'the two different species then break their shallow armistice and join the shock of battle for possession of the earth and we are outnumbered and exterminated to a certainty so i am against independence' 'socially a mussulman subject to explosions' diana said 'so the eternal duel between us is maintained and men will protest that they are for civilization dear me i should like to write a sketch of the women of the future don't be afraid the far future what a different earth you will see' and very different creatures the gentlemen unanimously surmised westlake described the fairer portion no longer the weaker frightful hosts diana promised him a sweeter picture if ever she brought her hand to paint it 'you would be offered up to the english national hangman jehoiachim sneer' interposed arthur rhodes evidently firing a gun too big for him of premeditated charging as his patroness perceived but she knew him to be smarting under recent applications of the swish of mr sneer and that he rushed to support her she covered him by saying 'if he has to be encountered he kills none but the cripple' wherewith the dead pause ensuing from a dose of outlandish speech in good company was bridged though the youth heard westlake mutter unpleasantly 'jehoiachim' and had to endure a stare of dacier's who did not conceal his want of comprehension of the place he occupied in mrs warwick's gatherings 'they know nothing of us whatever' lady pennon harped on her dictum 'they put us in a case and profoundly study the captive creature' said diana 'but would any man understand this' she dropped her voice and drew in the heads of lady pennon lady singleby lady esquart and miss courtney 'real woman's nature speaks a maid of mine had a follower she was a good girl i was anxious about her and asked her if she could trust him oh yes ma'am she replied i can he's quite like a female i longed to see the young man to tell him he had received the highest of eulogies' the ladies appreciatingly declared that such a tale was beyond the understandings of men miss paynham primmed her mouth admitting to herself her inability to repeat such a tale an act that she deemed not 'quite like a lady' she had previously come to the conclusion that mrs warwick with all her generous qualities was deficient in delicate sentiment owing perhaps to her coldness of temperament like dacier also she failed to comprehend the patronage of mr rhodes it led to suppositions indefinite truly and not calumnious at all but a young poet rather good looking and well built is not the same kind of wing chick as a young actress like miss courtney mrs warwick's latest shieldling he is hardly enrolled for the reason that was assumed to sanction mrs warwick's maid in the encouragement of her follower miss paynham sketched on with her thoughts in her bosom a damsel castigatingly pursued by the idea of sex as the direct motive of every act of every person surrounding her deductively therefore that a certain form of the impelling passion mild or terrible or capricious or it might be less pardonable was unceasingly at work among the human couples up to decrepitude and she too frequently hit the fact to doubt her gift of reading into them mr dacier was plain and the state of young mr rhodes and the scottish gentleman was at least a vehement admirer but she penetrated the breast of mr thomas redworth as well mentally tore his mask of friendship to shreds he was kind indeed in commissioning her to do the portrait his desire for it and his urgency to have the features exactly given besides the infrequency of his visits of late when a favoured gentleman was present were the betraying signs deductively moreover the lady who inspired the passion in numbers of gentlemen and set herself to win their admiration with her lively play of dialogue must be coquettish she could hold them only by coldness anecdotes epigrams drolleries do not bubble to the lips of a woman who is under an emotional spell rather they prove that she has the spell for casting it suited mr dacier miss paynham thought it was cruel to mr redworth at whom of all her circle the beautiful woman looked when speaking to him sometimes tenderly 'beware the silent one of an assembly' diana had written she did not think of her words while miss paynham continued mutely sketching the silent ones with much conversation around them have their heads at work critically perforce the faster if their hands are occupied and the point they lean to do is the pivot of their thoughts miss paynham felt for mr redworth diana was unaware of any other critic present than him she sought to enliven not unsuccessfully notwithstanding his english objection to the pitch of the converse she led and a suspicion of effort to support it just a doubt with all her easy voluble run of the possibility of naturalness in a continuous cleverness but he signified pleasure and in pleasing him she was happy in the knowledge that she dazzled was her sense of safety percy hated scandal he heard none he wanted stirring cheering in her house he had it he came daily and as it was her wish that new themes new flights of converse should delight him and show her exhaustless to preserve her ascendancy she welcomed him without consulting the world he was witness of mr hepburn's presentation of a costly china vase to repair the breach in her array of ornaments and excuse a visit judging by the absence of any blow within he saw not a sign of coquettry some such visit had been anticipated by the prescient woman so there was no reddening she brought about an exchange of sentences between him and her furious admirer sparing either of them a glimpse of which was the sacrifice to the other amusing them both dacier could allow mr hepburn to outsit him and he left them proud of his absolute confidence in her she was mistaken in imagining that her social vivacity mixed with comradeship of the active intellect was the charm which kept mr percy dacier temperate when he well knew her to distinguish him above her courtiers her powers of dazzling kept him tame they did not stamp her mark on him he was one of the order of highly polished men ignorant of women who are impressed for long terms by temporary flashes that hold them bound until a fresh impression comes to confirm or obliterate the preceding affairs of the world he could treat competently he had a head for high politics and the management of men the feminine half of the world was a confusion and a vexation to his intelligence characterless and one woman at last appearing decipherable he fancied it must be owing to her possession of character a thing prized the more in women because of his latent doubt of its existence character that was the mark he aimed at that moved him to homage as neither sparkling wit nor incomparable beauty nor the unusual combination did to be distinguished by a woman of character beauty and wit for jewellery was his minor ambition in life and if fortune now gratified it he owned to the flattery it really seemed by every test that she had the quality since the day when he beheld her by the bedside of his dead uncle and that one on the french sea sands and again at copsley ghostly white out of her wrestle with death bleeding holy sweat of brow for her friend the print of her features had been on him as an index of depth of character imposing respect and admiration a sentiment imperilled by her consent to fly with him her subsequent reserve until they met by an accident that the lady at any rate was not responsible for proved the quality positively and the nature of her character at first suspected vanquished him more by comparison than her vivid intellect which he originally and still lingeringly appreciated in condescension as a singular accomplishment thrilling at times now and then assailably feminine but after her consent to a proposal that caused him retrospective worldly shudders and her composed recognition of the madness a character capable of holding him in some awe was real majesty and it rose to the clear heights with her mental attributes for satellites his tendency to despise women was wholesomely checked by the experience to justify him in saying here is a worthy one she was health to him as well as trusty counsel furthermore where he respected he was a governed man free of the common masculine craze to scale fortresses for the sake of lowering flags whilst under his impression of her character he submitted honourably to the ascendancy of a lady whose conduct suited him and whose preference flattered whose presence was very refreshing whose letters were a stimulant her letters were really running well waters not a lover's delusion of the luminous mind of his lady they sparkled in review and preserved their integrity under critical analysis the reading of them hurried him in pursuit of her from house to house during the autumn and as she did not hint at the shadow his coming cast on her his conscience was easy regarding their future his political anxieties were a mountainous defile curtaining the outlook they met at lockton where he arrived after a recent consultation with his chief of whom and the murmurs of the cabinet he spoke to diana openly in some dejection 'they might see he has been breaking with his party for the last four years' she said 'the plunge to be taken is tremendous' 'but will he he appears too despondent for a header' 'we cannot dance on a quaking floor' 'no it 's exactly that quake of the floor which gives much qualms to me as well' said dacier 'a treble neptune's power' she rejoined for his particular delectation 'enough if he hesitates i forgive him his nausea he awaits the impetus and it will reach him and soon he will not wait for the mob at his heels i am certain a minister who does that is a post and goes down with the first bursting of the dam he has tried compromise and discovered that it does not appease the fates is not even a makeshift mending at this hour he is a man of nerves very sensitively built as quick quicker than a woman i could almost say to feel the tremble of the air forerunner of imperative changes' dacier brightened fondly 'you positively describe him paint him to the life without knowing him' 'i have seen him and if i paint whose are the colours' 'sometimes i repeat you to him and i get all the credit' said dacier 'i glow with pride to think of speaking anything that you repeat' said diana and her eyes were proudly lustreful their love was nourished on these mutual flatteries thin food for passion the innocence of it sanctioned the meetings and the appointments to meet when separated they were interchanging letters formally worded in the apostrophe and the termination but throbbingly full or diana thought so of percy's letters with grateful justice for his manner of opening his heart in amatory correspondence was to confide important secret matters up to which mark she sprang to reply in counsel he proved his affection by trusting her his respect by his tempered style 'a greenland style of writing' she had said of an unhappy gentleman's epistolary compositions resembling it and now the same official baldness was to her mind italianly rich it called forth such volumes flatteries that were thin food for passion appeared the simplest exchanges of courtesy and her meetings with her lover judging by the nature of the discourse they held so consequent to their joint interest in the great crisis anticipated as to rouse her indignant surprise and a turn for downright rebellion when the argus world signified the fact of its having one eye or more wide open debit and credit too her buzzing familiars insisted on an audience at each ear and at the house door on her return to london chapter xxix shows the approaches of the political and the domestic crisis in company there was not much talk of diana between lady dunstane and her customary visitor tom redworth now she was shy in speaking of the love stricken woman and more was in his mind for thought than for speech she some times wondered how much he might know ending with the reflection that little passing around was unknown to him he had to shut his mind against thought against all meditation upon mrs warwick it was based scientifically when speculating and calculating on the material element a talisman men and women crossing the high seas of life he had found most readable under that illuminating inquiry as to their means an inspector of sea worthy ships proceeds in like manner whence would the money come he could not help the bent of his mind but he could avoid subjecting her to the talismanic touch the girl at the dublin ball the woman at the fire grate of the crossways both in one were his diana now and then hearing an ugly whisper his manful sympathy with the mere woman in her imprisoned liberty defended her desperately from charges not distinctly formulated within him 'she's not made of stone' that was a height of self abnegation to shake the poor fellow to his roots but then he had no hopes of his own and he stuck to it her choice of a man like dacier too of whom redworth judged highly showed nobility she irradiated the man but no baseness could be in such an alliance if allied they were bound together for good the tie supposing a villain world not wrong was only not the sacred tie because of impediments the tie he deliberated and said stoutly no men of redworth's nature go through sharp contests though the duration of them is short and the tussle of his worship of this woman with the materialistic turn of his mind was closed by the complete shutting up of the latter under lock and bar so that a man very little of an idealist was able to sustain her in the pure imagination where she did almost belong to him she was his in a sense because she might have been his but for an incredible extreme of folly the dark ring of the eclipse cast by some amazing foolishness round the shining crescent perpetually in secret claimed the whole sphere of her by what might have been while admitting her lost to him in fact to thomas redworth's mind the lack of perfect sanity in his conduct at any period of manhood was so entirely past belief that he flew at the circumstances confirming the charge and had wrestles with the angel of reality who did but set him dreaming backward after flinging him he heard at lady wathin's that mrs warwick was in town for the winter 'mr dacier is also in town' lady wathin said with an acid indication of the needless mention of it 'we have not seen him' she invited redworth to meet a few friends at dinner 'i think you admire miss asper in my idea a very saint among young women and you know what the young women of our day are she will be present she is you are aware england's greatest heiress only yesterday hearing of that poor man mr warwick's desperate attack of illness heart and of his having no relative or friend to soothe his pillow he is lying in absolute loneliness she offered to go and nurse him of course it could not be done it is not her place the beauty of the character of a dear innocent young girl with every gratification at command who could make the offer strikes me as unparalleled she was perfectly sincere she is sincerity she asked at once where is he she wished me to accompany her on a first visit i saw a tear' redworth had called at lady wathin's for information of the state of mr warwick concerning which a rumour was abroad no stranger to the vagrant compassionateness of sentimentalists rich idle conscience pricked or praise catching he was unmoved by the tale that miss asper had proposed to go to mr warwick's sick bed in the uniform of a sister of charity 'speaking french' lady wathin exclaimed and his head rocked as he said 'an englishman would not be likely to know better' 'she speaks exquisite french all european languages mr redworth she does not pretend to wit to my thinking depth of sentiment is a far more feminine accomplishment it assuredly will be found a greater treasure' the modest man modest in such matters was led by degrees to fancy himself sounded regarding miss asper a piece of sculpture glacially decorative of the domestic mansion in person to his thinking and as to the nature of it not a diana with all her faults if diana had any faults in a world and a position so heavily against her he laughed to himself when alone at the neatly implied bitter reproach cast on the wife by the forsaken young lady who proposed to nurse the abandoned husband of the woman bereaving her of the man she loved sentimentalists enjoy these tricks the conceiving or the doing of them the former mainly which are cheaper and equally effective miss asper might be deficient in wit this was a form of practical wit occasionally exhibited by creatures acting on their instincts warwick he pitied and he put compulsion on himself to go and see the poor fellow the subject of so sublime a generosity mr warwick sat in an arm chair his legs out straight on the heels his jaw dragging hollow cheeks his hands loosely joined improving in health he said a demure woman of middle age was in attendance he did not speak of his wife three times he said disconnectedly 'i hear reports' and his eyelids worked redworth talked of general affairs without those consolatory efforts useless between men which are neither medicine nor good honest water he judged by personal feelings in consequence he left an invalid the sourer for his visit next day he received a briefly worded summons from mrs warwick crossing the park on the line to diana's house he met miss paynham who grieved to say that mrs warwick could not give her a sitting and in a still mournfuller tone imagined he would find her at home and alone by this time 'i left no one but mr dacier there' she observed 'mrs warwick will be disengaged to morrow no doubt' he said consolingly her head performed the negative 'they talk politics and she becomes animated loses her pose i will persevere though i fear i have undertaken a task too much for me' 'i am deeply indebted to you for the attempt' redworth bowed to her and set his face to the abbey towers which wore a different aspect in the smoked grey light since his two minutes of colloquy he had previously noticed that meetings with miss paynham produced a similar effect on him a not so very impressionable man and how was it done she told him nothing he did not know or guess diana was alone her manner after the greeting seemed feverish she had not to excuse herself for abruptness when he heard the nature of the subject her counsellor and friend was informed in feminine style that she had requested him to call for the purpose of consulting him with regard to a matter she had decided upon and it was the sale of the crossways she said that it would have gone to her heart once she supposed she had lost her affection for the place or had got the better of her superstitions she spoke lamely as well as bluntly the place was hers she said her own property her husband could not interdict a sale redworth addressed himself to her smothered antagonism 'even if he had rights as they are termed i think you might count on their not being pressed' 'i have been told of illness' she tapped her foot on the floor 'his present state of health is unequal to his ordinary duties' 'emma dunstane is fully supplied with the latest intelligence mr redworth you know the source' 'i mention it simply' 'yes yes what i have to protest is that in this respect i am free the law has me fast but leaves me its legal view of my small property i have no authority over me i can do as i please in this without a collision or the dread of one it is the married woman's perpetual dread when she ventures a step your law originally presumed her a china footed animal and more i have a claim for maintenance' she crimsoned angrily redworth showed a look of pleasure hard to understand 'the application would be sufficient i fancy' he said 'it should have been offered' 'did you not decline it' 'i declined to apply for it i thought but mr redworth another thing concerning us all i want very much to hear your ideas of the prospects of the league because i know you have ideas the leaders are terrible men they fascinate me they appear to move with an army of facts they are certainly carrying the country i am obliged to think them sincere common agitators would not hold together as they do they gather strength each year if their statistics are not illusory an army of phantoms instead of one of facts and they knock at my head without admission i have to confess they must win' 'ultimately it is quite calculable that they will win' said redworth and he was led to discourse of rates and duties and prohibitive tariffs to a woman surprisingly athirst curious for every scrap of intelligence relating to the power organization and schemes of the league 'common sense is the secret of every successful civil agitation' he said 'rap it unremittingly on crowds of the thickest of human heads and the response comes at last to sweep all before it you may reckon that the country will beat the landlords for that is our question is it one of your political themes' 'i am not presumptuous to such a degree a poor scholar' diana replied 'women striving to lift their heads among men deserve the sarcasm' he denied that any sarcasm was intended and the lesson continued when she had shaped in her mind some portion of his knowledge of the subject she reverted casually to her practical business would he undertake to try to obtain a purchaser of the crossways at the price he might deem reasonable she left the price entirely to his judgement and now she had determined to part with the old place the sooner the better she said that smiling and redworth smiled outwardly and inwardly her talk of her affairs was clearer to him than her curiosity for the mysteries of the league he gained kind looks besides warm thanks by the promise to seek a purchaser especially by his avoidance of prying queries she wanted just this excellent automaton fac totum and she referred him to mr braddock for the title deeds et caetera the chirping phrase of ladies happily washing their hands of the mean details of business 'how of your last work' he asked her serenest equanimity rejoined 'as i anticipated it is not popular the critics are of one mind with the public you may have noticed they rarely flower above that rocky surface the cantatrice sings them a false note my next will probably please them less' her mobile lips and brows shot the faint upper wreath of a smile hovering it was designed to display her philosophy 'and what is the name of your next' said he 'i name it the man of two minds if you can allow that to be in nature' 'contra distinguished from the woman' 'oh you must first believe the woman to have one' 'you are working on it' 'by fits and i forgot mr redworth i have mislaid my receipts and must ask you for the address of your wine merchant or will you several dozen of the same wines i can trust him to be in awe of you and the good repute of my table depends on his honesty' redworth took the definite order for a large supply of wine she gave him her hand a lost hand dear to hold needing to be guided he feared for him it was merely a hand cut off from the wrist and he had performed that executive part a wiser man would now have been the lord of it so he felt with his burning wish to protect and cherish the beloved woman while saying 'if we find a speedy bidder for the crossways you will have to thank our railways' 'you' said diana confident in his ability to do every thing of the practical kind her ingenuousness tickled him he missed her comic touches upon men and things but the fever shown by her manner accounted for it as soon as he left her she was writing to the lover who had an hour previously been hearing her voice the note of her theme being party and how to serve it when to sacrifice it to the country she wrote carolling bars of the puritani marches and such will passion do that her choice of music was quite in harmony with her theme the martially amorous melodies of italian opera in those days fostered a passion challenged to intrepidity from the heart of softness gliding at the same time and putting warm blood even into dull arithmetical figures which might be important to her lover her hero fronting battle she condensed redworth's information skilfully heartily giving it and whatever she had imbibed as her own down to the remark 'common sense in questions of justice is a weapon that makes way into human heads and wins the certain majority if we strike with it incessantly' whether anything she wrote was her own mattered little the savour of percy's praise which none could share with her made it instantly all her own besides she wrote to strengthen him she naturally laid her friends and the world under contribution and no other sort of writing was possible percy had not a common interest in fiction still less for high comedy he liked the broad laugh when he deigned to open books of that sort puns and strong flavours and harlequin surprises and her work would not admit of them however great her willingness to force her hand for his amusement consequently her inventiveness deadened she had to cease whipping it 'my poor old london cabhorse of a pen shall go to grass' she sighed looking to the sale of the crossways for money looking no farther those marshalled battalions of debit and credit were in hostile order the weaker simply devoted to fighting for delay when a winged messenger bearing the form of old mr braddock descended to her with the reconciling news that a hermit bachelor an acquaintance of mr redworth's both of whom wore a gloomy hue in her mind immediately had offered a sum for the purchase of the crossways considering the out of the way district mr braddock thought it an excellent price to get she thought the reverse but confessed that double the sum would not have altered her opinion double the sum scarcely counted for the service she required of it for much more than a year the money was paid shortly after into her bank and then she enjoyed the contemptuous felicity of tossing meat to her lions tigers wolves and jackals who but for the fortunate intervention would have been feeding on her these menagerie beasts of prey were the lady's tradesmen debit's hungry brood she had a rapid glimpse of a false position in regarding that legitimate band so scornfully another glimpse likewise of a day to come when they might not be stopped at the door she was running a race with something with what it was unnamed it ran in a shroud at times she surprised her heart violently beating when there had not been a thought to set it in motion she traced it once to the words 'next year' incidentally mentioned 'free' was a word that checked her throbs as at a question of life or death her solitude excepting the hours of sleep if then was a time of irregular breathing the something unnamed running beside her became a dreadful familiar the race between them past contemplation for ghastliness 'but this is your law' she cried to the world while blinding her eyes against a peep of the shrouded features singularly she had but to abandon hope and the shadowy figure vanished the tragic race was ended how to live and think and not to hope the slave of passion had this problem before her other tasks were supportable though one seemed hard at moments and was not passive it attacked her the men and women of her circle derisively unanimously disbelieved in an innocence that forfeited reputation women were complimentarily assumed to be not such gaping idiots and as the weeks advanced a change came over percy the gentleman had grown restless at covert congratulations hollow to his knowledge however much caressing vanity and therefore secretly a wound to it one day after sitting silent he bluntly proposed to break 'this foolish trifling' just in his old manner though not so honourably not very definitely either her hand was taken 'i feared that dumbness' diana said letting her hand go but keeping her composure 'my friend percy i am not a lion tamer and if you are of those animals we break the chapter plainly you think that where there appears to be a choice of fools the woman is distinctly designed for the person drop my hand or i shall repeat the fable of the goose with the golden eggs' 'fables are applicable only in the school room' said he and he ventured on 'tony' 'i vowed an oath to my dear emma as good as to the heavens and that of itself would stay me from being insane again' she released herself 'signor percy you teach me to suspect you of having an idle wish to pluck your plaything to pieces to boast of it ah my friend i fancied i was of more value to you you must come less often even to not at all if you are one of those idols with feet of clay which leave the print of their steps in a room or fall and crush the silly idolizer' 'but surely you know' said he 'we can't have to wait long' he looked full of hopeful meanings 'a reason' she kept down her breath a longdrawn sigh followed through parted lips she had a sensation of horror 'and i cannot propose to nurse him emma will not hear of it' she said 'i dare not hypocrite to that extreme oh no but i must hear nothing as it is i am haunted now let this pass tony me no tonies i am stony to such whimpering business now we are in the van of the struggle all round us it sounds like war last night i had mr tonans dining here he wished to meet you and you must have a private meeting with mr whitmonby he will be useful others as well you are wrong in affecting contempt of the press it perches you on a rock but the swimmer in politics knows what draws the tides your own people your set your class are a drag to you like inherited superstitions to the wakening brain the greater the glory for you see the lead you take you are saving your class they should lead and will if they prove worthy in the crisis their curious error is to believe in the stability of a monumental position' 'perfectly true' cried dacier and the next minute heated by approbation was begging for her hand earnestly she refused it 'but you say things that catch me' he pleaded 'remember it was nearly mine it soon will be mine i heard yesterday from lady wathin well if it pains you' 'speak on' said diana resigned to her thirsty ears 'he is not expected to last through the autumn' 'the calculation is hers' 'not exactly judging from the symptoms' diana flashed a fiery eye into dacier's and rose she was past danger of melting with her imagination darkened by the funeral image but she craved solitude and had to act the callous to dismiss him 'good enough for the day now leave me if you please when we meet again stifle that raven's croak i am not a sister of charity but neither am i a vulture hovering for the horse in the desert to die a poor simile when it is my own and not another's breath that i want nothing in nature only gruesome german stories will fetch comparisons for the yoke of this law of yours it seems the nightmare dream following an ogre's supper' she was not acting the shiver of her frame to morrow was open to him and prospect of better fortune so he departed after squeezing the hand she ceremoniously extended but her woman's intuition warned her that she had not maintained the sovereign impression which was her security and hope had become a flame in her bosom that would no longer take the common extinguisher the race she ran was with a shrouded figure no more but with the figure of the shroud she had to summon paroxysms of a pity hard to feel images of sickness helplessness the vaults the last human silence for the stilling of her passionate heart and when this was partly effected the question am i going to live renewed her tragical struggle who was it under the vaults in the shroud between the planks and with human sensibility to swell the horror passion whispered of a vaster sorrow needed for herself and the hope conjuring those frightful complexities was needed to soothe her she pitied the man but she was an enamoured woman often of late she had been sharply stung relaxed as well by the observations of danvers assisting at her toilette had she beauty and charm beauty and rich health in the young summer blooming of her days and all doomed to waste no insurgency of words arose in denunciation of the wrong done to her nature an undefined heavy feeling of wrong there was just perceptive enough to let her know without gravely shaming that one or another must be slain for peace to come for it is the case in which the world of the laws overloading her is pitiless to women deaf past ear trumpets past intercession detesting and reviling them for a feeble human cry and for one apparent step of revolt piling the pelted stones on them it will not discriminate shades of hue it massacres all the shadowed they are honoured after a fashion at a certain elevation descending from it and purely to breathe common air thus in her mind they are scourged and outcast and alas the very pleading for them excites a sort of ridicule in their advocate how she was utterly even desperately nay personally earnest and her humour closed her lips though comical views of the scourged and outcast coming from the opposite party the huge bully world she would not have tolerated diana raged at a prevailing strength on the part of that huge bully world which seemed really to embrace the atmosphere emma had said 'the rules of christian society are a blessed government for us women we owe it so much that there is not a brick of the fabric we should not prop' emma's talk of obedience to the laws being laws was repeated by the rebel with an involuntary unphrased comparison of the vessel in dock and the vessel at sea when dacier next called to see mrs warwick he heard that she had gone to copsley for a couple of weeks the lesson was emphasized by her not writing and was it the tricky sex or the splendid character of the woman which dealt him this punishment knowing how much diana forfeited for him he was moved to some enthusiasm despite his inclination to be hurt she on her return to london gained a considerable increase of knowledge as to her position in the eye of the world and unlike the result of her meditations derived from the clamouring tradesmen whom she could excuse she was neither illuminated nor cautioned by that dubious look she conscientiously revolted lady pennon hinted a word for her government 'a good deal of what you so capitally call green tea talk is going on my dear' diana replied without pretending to misunderstand 'gossip is a beast of prey that does not wait for the death of the creature it devours they are welcome to my shadow if the liberty i claim casts one and it feeds them' to which the old lady rejoined 'oh i am with you through thick and thin i presented you at court and i stand by you only walk carefully women have to walk with a train you are too famous not to have your troops of watchers' 'but i mean to prove' said diana 'that a woman can walk with her train independent of the common reserves and artifices' 'not on highways my dear' diana praising the speaker referred the whole truth in that to the material element of her metaphor she was more astonished by whitmonby's candid chiding but with him she could fence and men are easily diverted she had sent for him to bring him and percy dacier together to a conference unaware of the project he took the opportunity of their privacy to speak of the great station open to her in london being imperilled and he spoke of 'tongues' and ahem a very little would have induced him to fill that empty vocable with a name she had to pardon the critic in him for an unpleasant review of her hapless cantatrice and as a means of evasion she mentioned the poor book and her slaughter of the heroine that he had complained of 'i killed her i could not let her live you were unjust in accusing the authoress of heartlessness' 'if i did i retract' said he 'she steers too evidently from the centre of the vessel she has the organ in excess' 'proof that it is not squandered' 'the point concerns direction' 'have i made so bad a choice of my friends' 'it is the common error of the sprightly to suppose that in parrying a thrust they blind our eyes' 'the world sees always what it desires to see mr whitmonby' 'the world my dear mrs warwick is a blundering machine upon its own affairs but a cruel sleuth hound to rouse in pursuit' 'so now you have me chased by sight and scent and if i take wing' 'shots volleys you are lawful game the choice you have made of your friends should oblige you to think of them' 'i imagine i do have i offended any or one' 'i will not say that you know the commotion in a french kitchen when the guests of the house declined a particular dish furnished them by command the cook and his crew were loyal to their master but for the love of their art they sent him notice it is ill serving a mad sovereign' diana bowed to the compact little apologue 'i will tell you another story traditional in our family from my great grandmother a spanish woman' she said 'a cavalier serenaded his mistress and rascal mercenaries fell upon him before he could draw sword he battered his guitar on their pates till the lattice opened with a cry and startled them to flight thrice blessed and beloved he called to her above in reference to the noise it was merely a diversion of the accompaniment now there was loyal service to a sovereign' 'you are certainly an angel' exclaimed whitmonby 'i swallow the story and leave it to digestion to discover the appositeness whatever tuneful instrument one of your friends possesses shall solace your slumbers or batter the pate of your enemy but discourage the habitual serenader' 'the musician you must mean is due here now by appointment to meet you' said diana and set him momentarily agape with the name of mr percy dacier that was the origin of the alliance between the young statesman and a newspaper editor whitmonby accepting proposals which suited him quitted the house after an hour of political talk no longer inclined to hint at the 'habitual serenader' but very ready to fall foul of those who did as he proved when the numbers buzzed openly times were masculine the excitement on the eve of so great a crisis and diana's comprehension of it and fine heading cry put that weak matter aside moreover he was taught to suppose himself as welcome a guest as dacier and the cook could stand criticism the wines wonderful to say of a lady's table were trusty the talk on the political evenings and the social and anecdotal supper nights ran always in perfect accord with his ideal of the conversational orchestra an improvized harmony unmatched elsewhere she did not he considered so perfectly assort her dinner guests that was her one fault she had therefore to strain her adroitness to cover their deficiencies and fuse them but what other woman could have done it she led superbly if an irishman was present she kept him from overflooding managed to extract just the flavour of him the smack of salt she did even at whitmonby's table on a red letter sunday evening in concert with him and the dean bring down that cataract the bodleian to the levels of interchanging dialogue by seasonable touches inimitably done and never done before sullivan smith unbridled in the middle of dinner was docile to her 'irishmen' she said pleading on their behalf to whitmonby who pronounced the race too raw for an olympian feast 'are invaluable if you hang them up to smoke and cure' and the master of social converse could not deny that they were responsive to her magic the supper nights were mainly devoted to percy's friends he brought as many as he pleased and as often as it pleased him and it was her pride to provide cleopatra banquets for the lover whose anxieties were soothed by them and to whom she sacrificed her name willingly in return for a generosity that certain chance whispers of her heart elevated to the pitch of measureless so they wore through the session and the autumn clouds heavier the league drumming the cry of ireland 'ominously banshee' as she wrote to emma chapter xxx in which there is a taste of a little dinner and an aftertaste 'but tony lives' emma dunstane cried on her solitary height with the full accent of envy marking the verb and when she wrote enviously to her friend of the life among bright intelligences and of talk worth hearing it was a happy signification that health frail though it might be had grown importunate for some of the play of life diana sent her word to name her day and she would have her choicest to meet her dearest they were in the early days of december not the best of times for improvized gatherings emma wanted however to taste them as they cropped she was also owing to her long isolation timid at a notion of encountering the pick of the london world prepared by tony to behold 'a wonder more than worthy of them' as her friend unadvisedly wrote that was why she came unexpectedly and for a mixture of reasons went to an hotel fatality designed it so she was reproached but she said 'you have to write or you entertain at night i should be a clog and fret you my hotel is maitland's excellent i believe i am to lie on the pillow where a crowned head reposed you will perceive that i am proud as well as comfortable and i would rather meet your usual set of guests' 'the reason why i have been entertaining at night is that percy is harassed and requires enlivening' said diana 'he brings his friends my house is open to them if it amuses him what the world says is past a thought i owe him too much' emma murmured that the world would soon be pacified diana shook her head 'the poor man is better able to go about his affairs and i am honestly relieved it lays a spectre as for me i do not look ahead i serve as a kind of secretary to percy i labour at making abstracts by day and at night preside at my suppertable you would think it monotonous no incident varies the course we run i have no time to ask whether it is happiness it seems to bear a resemblance' emma replied 'he may be everything you tell me he should not have chosen the last night of the opera to go to your box and sit beside you till the fall of the curtain the presence at the opera of a man notoriously indifferent to music was enough in itself' diana smiled with languor 'you heard of that but the opera was the puritani my favourite and he saw me sitting in lady pennon's box alone we were compromised neck deep already i can kiss you my own emmy till i die 'but what the world says is what the wind says besides he has his hopes if i am blackened ever so thickly he can make me white dear me if the world knew that he comes here almost nightly it will and does it matter i am his in soul the rest is waste paper a half printed sheet' 'provided he is worthy of such devotion' 'he is absolute worthiness he is the prince of men i dread to say mine for fear but emmy will not judge him to morrow by contrast with more voluble talkers i can do anything but read poetry now that kills me see him through me in nature character intellect he has no rival whenever i despond and it comes now and then i rebuke myself with this one admonition simply to have known him admit that for a woman to find one who is worthy among the opposite creatures is a happy termination of her quest and in some sort dismisses her to the shades an uncomplaining ferry bird if my end were at hand i should have no cause to lament it we women miss life only when we have to confess we have never met the man to reverence' emma had to hear a very great deal of mr percy diana's comparison of herself to 'the busy bee at a window pane' was more in her old manner and her friend would have hearkened to the marvels of the gentle man less unrefreshed had it not appeared to her that her tony gave in excess for what was given in return she hinted her view 'it is expected of our sex' diana said the work of busy bee at a window pane had at any rate not spoilt her beauty though she had voluntarily profitlessly become this man's drudge and her sprightly fancy her ready humour and darting look all round in discussion were rather deadened but the loss was not perceptible in the circle of her guests present at a dinner little indicating the last were whitmonby in lively trim for shuffling dealing cutting trumping or drawing trumps westlake polishing epigrams under his eyelids henry wilmers who timed an anecdote to strike as the passing hour without freezing the current sullivan smith smoked cured and ready to flavour percy dacier pleasant listener measured speaker and young arthur rhodes the neophyte of the hostess's training of whom she had said to emma 'the dear boy very kindly serves to frank an unlicenced widow' and whom she prompted and made her utmost of with her natural tact these she mixed and leavened the talk was on high levels and low an enchantment to emma dunstane now a story a question opening new routes sharp sketches of known personages a paradox shot by laughter as soon as uttered and all so smoothly not a shadow of the dominant holder forth or a momentary prospect of dead flats the mellow ring of appositeness being the concordant note of deliveries running linked as they flashed and a tolerant philosophy of the sage in the world recurrently the keynote once only had diana to protect her nurseling he cited a funny line from a recent popular volume of verse in perfect a propos looking at sullivan smith who replied that the poets had become too many for him and he read none now diana said 'there are many alexanders but alexander of macedon is not dwarfed by the number' she gave him an opening for a smarter reply but he lost it in a comment against whitmonby's cardinal rule 'the neatest turn of the wrist that ever swung a hero to crack a crown' and he bowed to young rhodes 'i 'll read your versicler to morrow morning early' the latter expressed a fear that the hour was too critical for poetry 'i have taken the dose at a very early hour' said whitmonby to bring conversation to the flow again 'and it effaced the critical mind completely' 'but did not silence the critical nose' observed westlake wilmers named the owner of the longest nose in europe 'potentially indeed a critic' said diana 'nights beside it must be fearful and good matter for a divorce if the poor dear lady could hale it to the doors of the vatican' sullivan smith exclaimed 'but there's character in noses' 'calculable by inches' dacier asked 'more than in any other feature' said lady dunstane 'the riffords are all prodigiously gifted and amusing suspendens omnia naso it should be prayed for in families' 'totum ut to faciant fabulle nasum' rejoined whitmonby 'lady isabella was reading the tale of the german princess who had a sentinel stationed some hundred yards away to whisk off the flies and she owned to me that her hand instinctively travelled upward' 'candour is the best concealment when one has to carry a saddle of absurdity' said diana 'touchstone's poor thing but mine own is godlike in its enveloping fold' 'the most comforting sermon ever delivered on property in poverty' said arthur rhodes westlake assented 'his choice of audrey strikes me as an exhibition of the sure instinct for pasture of the philosophical jester in a forest' 'with nature's woman if he can find her the urban seems equally at home' said lady dunstane 'baron pawle is an example' added whitmonby 'his cook is a pattern wife to him i heard him say at table that she was responsible for all except the wines i wouldn't have them on my conscience with a judge my lady retorted' 'when poor madame de jacquieres was dying' said wilmers 'her confessor sat by her bedside prepared for his ministrations pour commencer mon ami jamais je n'ai fait rien hors nature' lord wadaster had uttered something tolerably similar 'i am a sinner and in good society' sir abraham hartiston a minor satellite of the regent diversified this 'i am a sinner and go to good society' madame la comtesse de la roche aigle the cause of many deaths declared it unwomanly to fear anything save 'les revenants' yet the countess could say the pretty thing 'foot on a flower then think of me' 'sentimentality puts up infant hands for absolution' said diana 'but tell me' lady dunstane inquired generally 'why men are so much happier than women in laughing at their spouses' they are humaner was one dictum they are more frivolous ironically another 'it warrants them for blowing the bugle horn of masculine superiority night and morning from the castle walls' diana said 'i should imagine it is for joy of heart that they still have cause to laugh' said westlake on the other hand are women really pained by having to laugh at their lords curious little speeches flying about the great world affirmed the contrary but the fair speakers were chartered libertines and their laugh admittedly had a biting acid the parasite is concerned in the majesty of the tree 'we have entered botany bay' diana said to emma who answered 'a metaphor is the deus ex machine of an argument' and whitmonby to lighten a shadow of heaviness related allusively an anecdote of the law courts sullivan smith begged permission to 'black cap' it with judge fitzgerald's sentence upon a convicted criminal 'your plot was perfect but for one above' dacier cited an execrable impromptu line of the chief of the opposition in parliament the premier it was remarked played him like an angler his fish on the hook or say mr serjeant rufus his witness in the box 'or a french journalist an english missionary' said westlake and as the instance was recent it was relished the talk of premiers offered whitmonby occasion for a flight to the court of vienna and kaunitz wilmers told a droll story of lord busby's missing the embassy there westlake furnished a sample of the tranquil sententiousness of busby's brother robert during a stormy debate in the house of commons 'i remember' dacier was reminded 'hearing him say when the house resembled a chartist riot let us stand aside and meditate on life if youth could know in the season of its reaping of the pleasures that it is but sowing doctor's bills' latterly a malady had supervened and bob busby had retired from the universal to the special his mysterious case 'assure him that is endemic he may be cured of his desire for the exposition of it' said lady dunstane westlake chimed with her 'yes the charm in discoursing of one's case is over when the individual appears no longer at odds with providence' 'but then we lose our tragedy' said whitmonby 'our comedy too' added diana 'we must consent to be busbied for the sake of the instructive recreations' 'a curious idea though' said sullivan smith 'that some of the grand instructive figures were in their day colossal bores' 'so you see the marvel of the poet's craft at last' diana smiled on him and he vowed 'i'll read nothing else for a month' young rhodes bade him beware of a deluge in proclaiming it they rose from table at ten with the satisfaction of knowing that they had not argued had not wrangled had never stagnated and were digestingly refreshed as it should be among grown members of the civilized world who mean to practise philosophy making the hour of the feast a balanced recreation and a regeneration of body and mind 'evenings like these are worth a pilgrimage' emma said embracing tony outside the drawing room door 'i am so glad i came and if i am strong enough invite me again in the spring to morrow early i start for copsley to escape this london air i shall hope to have you there soon' she was pleased by hearing tony ask her whether she did not think that arthur rhodes had borne himself well for it breathed of her simply friendly soul the gentlemen followed lady dunstane in a troop dacier yielding perforce the last adieu to young rhodes five minutes later diana was in her dressing room where she wrote at night on the rare occasions now when she was left free for composition beginning to dwell on the man of two minds she glanced at the woman likewise divided if not similarly and she sat brooding she did not accuse her marriage of being the first fatal step her error was the step into society without the wherewithal to support her position there girls of her kind airing their wings above the sphere of their birth are cryingly adventuresses as adventuresses they are treated vain to be shrewish with the world rather let us turn and scold our nature for irreflectively rushing to the cream and honey had she subsisted on her small income in a country cottage this task of writing would have been holiday or better if as she preached to mary paynham she had apprenticed herself to some productive craft the simplicity of the life of labour looked beautiful what will not look beautiful contrasted with the fly in the web she had chosen to be one of the flies of life instead of running to composition her mind was eloquent with a sermon to arthur rhodes in redworth's vein more sympathetically of course 'for i am not one of the lecturing mammonites' she could say she was far from that penitentially in the thick of her disdain of the arrogant money betters she pulled out a drawer where her bank book lay and observed it contemplatively jotting down a reflection before the dread book of facts was opened 'gaze on the moral path you should have taken you are asked for courage to commit a sanctioned suicide by walking back to it stripped a skeleton self' she sighed forth 'but i have no courage i never had' the book revealed its tale in a small pencilled computation of the bank clerk's on the peccant side credit presented many pages blanks she seemed to have withdrawn from the struggle with such a partner it signified an immediate appeal to the usurers unless the publisher could be persuaded with three parts of the book in his hands to come to the rescue work roared old debit the sinner turned slavedriver diana smoothed her wrists compressing her lips not to laugh at the simulation of an attitude of combat she took up her pen and strange to think she could have flowed away at once on the stuff that danvers delighted to read wicked princes rogue noblemen titled wantons daisy and lily innocents traitorous marriages murders a gallows dangling a corpse dotted by a moon and a woman bowed beneath she could have written with the certainty that in the upper and the middle as well as in the lower classes of the country there would be a multitude to read that stuff so cordially despite the gaps between them are they one in their literary tastes and why should they not read it her present mood was a craving for excitement for incident wild action the primitive machinery of our species any amount of theatrical heroics pathos and clown gabble a panorama of scenes came sweeping round her she was however harnessed to a different kind of vehicle and had to drag it the sound of the house door shutting imagined perhaps was a fugitive distraction now to animate the man of two minds he is courting but he is burdened with the task of tasks he has an ideal of womanhood and of the union of couples a delicacy extreme as his attachment and he must induce the lady to school herself to his ideal not allowing her to suspect him less devoted to her person while she an exacting idol will drink any quantity of idealization as long as he starts it from a full acceptance of her acknowledged qualities diana could once have tripped the scene along airily she stared at the opening sentence a heavy bit of moralized manufacture fit to yoke beside that on her view of her bank book 'it has come to this i have no head' she cried and is our public likely to muster the slightest taste for comic analysis that does not tumble to farce the doubt reduced her whole ms to a leaden weight composed for sinking percy's addiction to burlesque was a further hindrance for she did not perceive how her comedy could be strained to gratify it there was a knock and danvers entered 'you have apparently a liking for late hours' observed her mistress 'i told you to go to bed' 'it is mr dacier' said danvers 'he wishes to see me' 'yes ma'am he apologized for disturbing you' 'he must have some good reason' what could it be diana's glass approved her appearance she pressed the black swell of hair above her temples rather amazed curious inclined to a beating of the heart chapter xxxi a chapter containing great political news and therewith an intrusion of the love god dacier was pacing about the drawing room as in a place too narrow for him diana stood at the door 'have you forgotten to tell me anything i ought to know' he came up to her and shut the door softly behind her holding her hand 'you are near it i returned but tell me first you were slightly under a shadow this evening dejected' 'did i show it' she was growing a little suspicious but this cunning touch of lover like interest dispersed the shade 'to me you did' 'it was unpardonable to let it be seen' 'no one else could have observed it' her woman's heart was thrilled for she had concealed the dejection from emma 'it was nothing' she said 'a knot in the book i am writing we poor authors are worried now and then but you' his face rippled by degrees brightly to excite a reflection in hers 'shall i tune you with good news i think it will excuse me for coming back' 'very good news' 'brave news as far as it goes' 'then it concerns you' 'me you the country' 'oh do i guess' cried diana 'but speak pray i burn' 'what am i to have for telling it' 'put no price you know my heart i guess or fancy it relates to your chief' dacier smiled in a way to show the lock without the key and she was insensibly drawn nearer to him speculating on the smile 'try again' said he keenly appreciating the blindness to his motive of her studious dark eyes and her open lipped breathing 'percy i must be right' 'well you are he has decided' 'oh that is the bravest possible when did you hear' 'he informed me of his final decision this afternoon' 'and you were charged with the secret all the evening and betrayed not a sign i compliment the diplomatic statesman but when will it be public' 'he calls parliament together the first week of next month' 'the proposal is no more compromises' 'total' diana clapped hands and her aspect of enthusiasm was intoxicating 'he is a wise man and a gallant minister and while you were reading me through i was blind to you' she added meltingly 'i have not made too much of it' said he 'indeed you have not' she was radiant with her dark lightnings yet visibly subject to him under the spell of the news he had artfully lengthened out to excite and overbalance her and her enthusiasm was all pointed to his share in the altered situation as he well knew and was flattered in knowing 'so tony is no longer dejected i thought i could freshen you and get my excuse' 'oh a high wind will make a dead leaf fly like a bird i soar now i do feel proud i have longed for it to have you leading the country not tugged at like a waggon with a treble team uphill we two are a month in advance of all england you stand by him only to hear it for i am sure of it' 'we stand or fall together' her glowing look doated on the faithful lieutenant 'and if the henchman is my hero i am but a waiting woman but i must admire his leader' 'tony' 'ah no' she joined her hands wondering whither her armed majesty had fled 'no softness no payments flatter me by letting me think you came to a head not a silly woman's heart with one name on it as it has not to betray i have been frank you need no proofs' the supplicating hands left her figure an easy prey to the storm and were crushed in a knot on her bosom she could only shrink 'ah percy you undo my praise of you my pride in receiving you' they were speechless perforce 'you see tony my dearest i am flesh and blood after all' 'you drive me to be ice and door bolts' her eyes broke over him reproachfully 'it is not so much to grant' he murmured 'it changes everything between us' 'not me it binds me the faster' 'it makes me a loathsome hypocrite' 'but tony is it so much' 'not if you value it low' 'but how long do you keep me in this rag puppet's state of suspension' 'patience' 'dangling and swinging day and night' 'the rag puppet shall be animated and repaid if i have life i wish to respect my hero have a little mercy our day will come perhaps as wonderfully as this wonderful news my friend drop your hands have you forgotten who i am i want to think percy' 'but you are mine' 'you are abasing your own' 'no by heaven' 'worse dear friend you are lowering yourself to the woman who loves you' 'you must imagine me superhuman' 'i worship you or did' 'be reasonable tony what harm surely a trifle of recompense just to let me feel i live you own you love me then i am your lover' 'my dear friend percy when i have consented to be your paramour this kind of treatment of me will not want apologies' the plain speaking from the wound he dealt her was effective with a gentleman who would never have enjoyed his privileges had he been of a nature unsusceptible to her distinct wish and meaning he sighed 'you know how my family bother me the woman i want the only woman i could marry i can't have' 'you have her in soul' 'body and soul it must be i believe you were made without fire' 'perhaps the element is omitted with some of us happily some think now we can converse there seems to be a measurement of distances required before men and women have a chance with their brains or before a man will understand that he can be advised and seconded when will the cabinet be consulted' 'oh a few days promise me' 'any honourable promise' 'you will not keep me waiting longer than the end of the session' 'probably there will be an appeal to the country' 'in any case promise me have some compassion' 'ah the compassion you do not choose your words percy or forget who is the speaker' 'it is tony who forgets the time she has kept her lover dangling promise and i will wait' 'you hurt my hand sir' 'i could crack the knuckles promise' 'come to me to morrow' 'to morrow you are in your armour triple brass all creation cries out for now we are mounted on barbs and you talk of ambling' 'arthur rhodes might have spoken that' 'rhodes' he shook off the name in disgust 'pet him as much as you like don't' he was unable to phrase his objection she cooled him further with eulogies of the chevaleresque manner of speaking which young mr rhodes could assume till for very wrath of blood not jealousy he had none of any man with her and not passion the little he had was a fitful gust he punished her coldness by taking what hastily could be gathered her shape was a pained submission and she thought where is the woman who ever knows a man as women do think when one of their artifices of evasion with a lover or the trick of imposingness has apparently been subduing him but the pain was less than previously for she was now mistress of herself fearing no abysses dacier released her quickly saying 'if i come tomorrow shall i have the promise' she answered 'be sure i shall not lie' 'why not let me have it before i go' 'my friend to tell you the truth you have utterly distracted me' 'forgive me if i did hurt your hand' 'the hand you might strike it off' 'i can't be other than a mortal lover tony there's the fact' 'no the fault is mine when i am degraded i trust you there's the error' the trial for dacier was the sight of her quick lifting bosom under the mask of cold language an attraction and repulsion in union a delirium to any lover impelled to trample on weak defences but the evident pain he inflicted moved his pity which helped to restore his conception of the beauty of her character she stood so nobly meek and she was never prudish only self respecting although the great news he imparted had roused an ardent thirst for holiday and a dash out of harness and he could hardly check it he yielded her the lead 'trust me you may' he said 'but you know we are one the world has given you to me me to you why should we be asunder there's no reason in it' she replied 'but still i wish to burn a little incense in honour of myself or else i cannot live it is the truth you make death my truer friend and at this moment i would willingly go out you would respect me more dead than alive i could better pardon you too' he pleaded for the red mouth's pardon remotely irritated by the suspicion that she swayed him overmuch and he had deserved the small benevolences and donations of love crumbs and heavenly dews 'not a word of pardon' said diana 'i shall never count an iota against you in the dark backward and abysm of time this news is great and i have sunk beneath it come tomorrow then we will speak upon whatever you can prove rational the hour is getting late' dacier took a draught of her dark beauty with the crimson he had kindled over the cheeks her lips were firmly closed her eyes grave dry but seeming to waver tearfully in their heavy fulness he could not doubt her love of him and although chafing at the idea that she swayed him absurdly beyond the credible in his world of wag tongues he resumed his natural soberness as a garment not very uneasily fitting whence it ensued for so are we influenced by the garb we put on us that his manly sentiment of revolt in being condemned to play second was repressed by the refreshment breathed on him from her lofty character the pure jewel proffered to his inward ownership 'adieu for the night' he said and she smiled he pressed for a pressure of her hand she brightened her smile instead and said only 'good night percy' chapter xxxii wherein we behold a giddy turn at the spectral crossways danvers accompanied mr dacier to the house door climbing the stairs she found her mistress in the drawing room still 'you must be cold ma'am' she said glancing at the fire grate 'is it a frost' said diana 'it's midnight and midwinter ma'am' 'has it struck midnight' the mantel piece clock said five minutes past 'you had better go to bed danvers or you will lose your bloom stop you are a faithful soul great things are happening and i am agitated mr dacier has told me news he came back purposely' 'yes ma'am' said danvers 'he had a great deal to tell' 'well he had' diana coloured at the first tentative impertinence she had heard from her maid 'what is the secret of you danvers what attaches you to me' 'i'm sure i don't know ma'am i'm romantic' 'and you think me a romantic object' 'i'm sure i can't say ma'am i'd rather serve you than any other lady and i wish you was happy' 'do you suppose i am unhappy' 'i'm sure but if i may speak ma'am so handsome and clever a lady and young i can't bear to see it' 'tush you silly woman you read your melting tales and imagine i must go and write for money it is my profession and i haven't an idea in my head this news disturbs me ruin if i don't write so i must i can't' diana beheld the ruin she clasped the great news for succour great indeed and known but to her of all the outer world she was ahead of all ahead of mr tonans the visionary figure of mr tonans petrified by the great news drinking it and confessing her ahead of him in the race for secrets arose toweringly she had not ever seen the editor in his den at midnight with the rumble of his machinery about him and fresh matter arriving and flying into the printing press it must be like being in the very furnace hissing of events an olympian council held in vulcan's smithy consider the bringing to the jove there news of such magnitude as to stupefy him he too who had admonished her rather sneeringly for staleness in her information but this news great though it was and throbbing like a heart plucked out of a breathing body throbbed but for a brief term a day or two after which great though it was immense it relapsed into a common organ a possession of the multitude merely historically curious 'you are not afraid of the streets at night' diana said to her maid as they were going upstairs 'not when we're driving ma'am' was the answer the man of two minds faced his creatrix in the dressing room still delivering that most ponderous of sentences a smothering pillow i have mistaken my vocation thought diana i am certainly the flattest proser who ever penned a line she sent dangers into the bedroom on a trifling errand unable to bear the woman's proximity and oddly unwilling to dismiss her she pressed her hands on her eyelids would percy have humiliated her so if he had respected her he took advantage of the sudden loss of her habitual queenly initiative at the wonderful news to debase and stain their intimacy the lover's behaviour was judged by her sensations she felt humiliated plucked violently from the throne where she had long been sitting securely very proudly that was at an end if she was to be better than the loathsomest of hypocrites she must deny him his admission to the house and then what was her life something that was pressing her low she knew not how and left it unquestioned incited her to exaggerate the indignity her pride had suffered she was a dethroned woman deeper within an unmasked actress she said oh she forgave him but clearly he took her for the same as other women consenting to receive a privileged visitor and sounding herself to the soul was she so magnificently better her face flamed she hugged her arms at her breast to quiet the beating and dropped them when she surprised herself embracing the memory he had brought political news and treated her as name the thing not designedly it might be her position invited it 'the world had given her to him' the world is always a prophet of the mire but the world is no longer an utterly mistaken world she shook before it she asked herself why percy or the world should think highly of an adventuress who was a denounced wife a wretched author and on the verge of bankruptcy she was an adventuress when she held the crossways she had at least a bit of solid footing now gone an adventuress without an idea in her head witness her dullard the man of two minds at his work of sermonizing his mistress the tremendous pressure upon our consciousness of the material cause when we find ourselves cast among the breakers of moral difficulties and endeavour to elude that mudvisaged monster chiefly by feigning unconsciousness was an experience of diana's in the crisis to which she was wrought her wits were too acute her nature too direct to permit of a lengthened confusion she laid the scourge on her flesh smartly i gave him these privileges because i am weak as the weakest base as my enemies proclaim me i covered my woman's vile weakness with an air of intellectual serenity that he choosing his moment tore away exposing me to myself as well as to him the most ordinary of reptiles i kept up a costly household for the sole purpose of seeing him and having him near me hence this bitter need of money either it must be money or disgrace money would assist her quietly to amend and complete her work yes and this want of money in a review of the last two years was the material cause of her recklessness it was her revived and uprising pudency declared the principal the only cause mere want of money and she had a secret worth thousands the secret of a day no more anybody's secret after some four and twenty hours she smiled at the fancied elongation and stare of the features of mr tonans in his editorial midnight den what if he knew it and could cap it with something novel and stranger hardly but it was an inciting suggestion she began to tremble as a lightning flash made visible her fortunes recovered disgrace averted hours of peace for composition stretching before her a summer afternoon's vista it seemed a duel between herself and mr tonans and she sure of her triumph diana victrix 'danvers' she called 'is it to undress ma'am' said the maid entering to her 'you are not afraid of the streets you tell me i have to go down to the city i think it is urgent yes i must go if i were to impart the news to you your head would be a tolling bell for a month' 'you will take a cab ma'am' 'we must walk out to find one i must go though i should have to go on foot quick with bonnet and shawl muffle up warmly we have never been out so late but does it matter you're a brave soul i'm sure and you shall have your fee' 'i don't care for money ma'am' 'when we get home you shall kiss me' danvers clothed her mistress in furs and rich wrappings not paid for was diana's desperate thought and a wrong one but she had to seem the precipitated bankrupt and succeeded she was near being it the boiling of her secret carried her through the streets rapidly and unobservantly except of such small things as the glow of the lights on the pavements and the hushed cognizance of the houses in silence to a thoroughfare where a willing cabman was met the destination named he nodded alertly he had driven gentlemen there at night from the house of commons he said 'our parliament is now sitting and you drive ladies' diana replied 'i hope i know one never mind the hour' said he of the capes he was bidden to drive rapidly 'complexion a tulip you do not often see a pale cabman' she remarked to danvers who began laughing as she always expected to do on an excursion with her mistress 'do you remember ma'am the cabman taking us to the coach when you thought of going to the continent' 'and i went to the crossways i have forgotten him' 'he declared you was so beautiful a lady he would drive you to the end of england for nothing' 'it must have been when i was paying him put it out of your mind danvers that there are individual cabmen they are the painted flowers of our metropolitan thoroughfares and we gather them in rows' 'they have their feelings ma'am' 'brandied feelings are not pathetic to me' 'i like to think kindly of them' danvers remarked in reproof of her inhumanity adding 'they may overturn us' at which diana laughed her eyes were drawn to a brawl of women and men in the street 'ah that miserable sight' she cried 'it is the everlasting nightmare of london' danvers humped femininely injured by the notice of it she wondered her mistress should deign to rolling on between the blind and darkened houses diana transferred her sensations to them and in a fit of the nerves imagined them beholding a funeral convoy without followers they came in view of the domed cathedral hearing in a pause of the wheels the bell of the hour 'faster faster my dear man' diana murmured and they entered a small still square of many lighted windows 'this must be where the morrow is manufactured' she said 'tell the man to wait or rather it's the mirror of yesterday we have to look backward to see forward in life' she talked her cool philosophy to mask her excitement from herself her card marked 'imperative two minutes' was taken up to mr tonans they ascended to the editorial ante room doors opened and shut hasty feet traversed the corridors a dull hum in dumbness told of mighty business at work diana received the summons to the mighty head of the establishment danvers was left to speculate she heard the voice of mr tonans 'not more than two' this was not a place for compliments men passed her hither and yonder cursorily noticing the presence of a woman she lost very strangely to her the sense of her sex and became an object a disregarded object things of more importance were about her feminine self esteem was troubled all idea of attractiveness expired here was manifestly a spot where women had dropped from the secondary to the cancelled stage of their extraordinary career in a world either blowing them aloft like soap bubbles or quietly shelving them as supernumeraries a gentleman sweet vision shot by to the editor's door without even looking cursorily he knocked mr tonans appeared and took him by the arm dictating at a great rate perceived danvers frowned at the female and requested him to wait in the room which the gentleman did not once casting eye upon a woman at last her mistress returned to her escorted so far by mr tonans and he refreshingly bent his back to bow over her hand so we have the satisfaction of knowing that we are not such poor creatures after all suffering in person danvers was revived by the little show of homage to her sex they descended the stairs 'you are not an editor of a paper but you may boast that you have been near the nest of one' diana said when they resumed their seats in the cab she breathed deeply from time to time as if under a weight or relieved of it but she seemed animated and she dropped now and again a funny observation of the kind that tickled danvers and caused the maid to boast of her everywhere as better than a play at home danvers busied her hands to supply her mistress a cup of refreshing tea and a plate of biscuits diana had stunned herself with the strange weight of the expedition and had not a thought in spite of tea at that hour she slept soundly through the remainder of the night dreamlessly till late into the morning chapter xxxiii exhibits the springing of a mine in a newspaper article the powers of harmony would seem to be tried to their shrewdest pitch when politics and love are planted together in a human breast this apparently opposite couple can nevertheless chant a very sweet accord as was shown by dacier on his homeward walk from diana's house let love lead the god will make music of any chamber comrade he was able to think of affairs of state while feeling the satisfied thirst of the lover whose pride irritated by confidential wild eulogies of the beautiful woman had recently clamoured for proofs of his commandership the impression she stamped on him at copsley remained but it could not occupy the foreground for ever he did not object to play second to her sprightly wits in converse if he had some warm testimony to his mastery over her blood for the world had given her to him enthusiastic friends had congratulated him she had exalted him for true knightliness and he considered the proofs well earned though he did not value them low they were little by comparison they lighted instead of staining her unparalleled high character she loved him full surely did she love him or such a woman would never have consented to brave the world once in their project of flight and next even more endearingly when contemplated in the sacrifice of her good name not omitting that fervent memory of her pained submission but a palpitating submission to his caress she was in his arms again at the thought of it he had melted her and won the confession of her senses by a surprise and he owned that never had woman been so vigilantly self guarded or so watchful to keep her lover amused and aloof such a woman deserved long service but then the long service deserved its time of harvest her surging look of reproach in submission pointed to the golden time and as he was a man of honour pledged to her for life he had no remorse and no scruple in determining to exact her dated promise on this occasion deliberately she was the woman to be his wife she was his mind's mate they had hung apart in deference to mere scruples too long during the fierce battle of the session she would be his help his fountain of counsel and she would be the rosy gauze veiled more than cold helper and adviser the being which would spur her womanly intelligence to acknowledge on this occasion deliberately the wisdom of the step they had been so close to it she might call it madness then now it was wisdom each had complete experience of the other and each vowed the step must be taken as to the secret communicated he exulted in the pardonable cunning of the impulse turning him back to her house after the guests had gone and the dexterous play of his bait on the line tempting her to guess and quit her queenly guard though it had not been distinctly schemed the review of it in that light added to the enjoyment it had been dimly and richly conjectured as a hoped result small favours from her were really worth thrice worth the utmost from other women they tasted the sweeter for the winning of them artfully an honourable thing in love nature rewarding the lover's ingenuity and enterprise inspires him with old greek notions of right and wrong and love is indeed a fluid mercurial realm continually shifting the principles of rectitude and larceny as long as he means nobly what is there to condemn him not she in her heart she was the presiding divinity and she his tony that splendid diana was the woman the world abused whom will it not abuse the slough she would have to plunge in before he could make her his own with the world's consent was already up to her throat she must and without further hesitation be steeped that he might drag her out washed of the imputed defilement and radiant as she was in character reflection now said this not impulse her words rang through him at every meeting she said things to confound his estimate of the wits of women or be remembered for some spirited ring they had a high wind will make a dead leaf fly like a bird he murmured it and flew with her she quickened a vein of imagination that gave him entrance to a strangely brilliant sphere above his own where she sustaining he too could soar and he did scarce conscious of walking home undressing falling asleep the act of waking was an instantaneous recovery of his emotional rapture of the overnight nor was it a bar to graver considerations his chief had gone down to a house in the country his personal business was to see and sound the followers of their party after another sight of his tony she would be sure to counsel sagaciously she always did she had a marvellous intuition of the natures of the men he worked with solely from his chance descriptions of them it was as though he started the bird and she transfixed it and she should not have matter to rule her smooth brows that he swore to she should sway him as she pleased be respected after her prescribed manner the promise must be exacted nothing besides promise you see tony you cannot be less than tony to me now he addressed the gentle phantom of her let me have your word and i am your servant till the session ends tony blushes her swarthy crimson diana fluttering rebukes her but diana is the appeasable goddess tony is the woman and she loves him the glorious goddess need not cut them adrift they can show her a book of honest pages dacier could truthfully say he had worshipped done knightly service to the beloved woman homage to the aureole encircling her those friends of his covertly congratulating him on her preference doubtless thought him more privileged than he was but they did not know diana and they were welcome if they would only believe to the knowledge that he was at the feet of this most sovereign woman he despised the particular satyr world which whatever the nature or station of the woman crowns the desecrator and bestows the title of fool on the worshipper he could have answered veraciously that she had kept him from folly nevertheless the term to service must come in the assurance of the approaching term he stood braced against a blowing world happy as men are when their muscles are strung for a prize they pluck with the energy and aim of their whole force letters and morning papers were laid for him to peruse in his dressing room he read his letters before the bath not much public news was expected at the present season while dressing he turned over the sheets of whitmonby's journal dull comments on stale things foreign news home news with the leaders on them identically dull behold the effect of journalism a witty man sparkling overnight gets into his pulpit and proses because he must say something and he really knows nothing journalists have an excessive overestimate of their influence they cannot as diana said comparing them with men on the parliamentary platform cannot feel they are aboard the big vessel they can only strive to raise a breeze or find one to swell and they cannot measure the stoutness or the greatness of the good ship england dacier's personal ambition was inferior to his desire to extend and strengthen his england parliament was the field government the office how many conversations had passed between him and diana on that patriotic dream she had often filled his drooping sails he owned it proudly and while the world both the hoofed and the rectilinear portions were biting at her character had he fretted her self respect he blamed himself but a devoted service must have its term the paper of mr tonans was reserved for perusal at breakfast he reserved it because tonans was an opponent tricksy and surprising now and then amusing too unlikely to afford him serious reflections the recent endeavours of his journal to whip the government team to a right about face were annoying preposterous dacier had admitted to diana that tonans merited the thanks of the country during 'the discreditable railway mania when his articles had a fine exhortative and prophetic twang and had done marked good otherwise as regarded the ministry the veering gusts of tonans were objectionable he 'raised the breeze' wantonly as well as disagreeably any one can whip up the populace if he has the instruments and tonans frequently intruded on the ministry's prerogative to govern the journalist was bidding against the statesman but such is the condition of a rapidly radicalizing country we must take it as it is with a complacent what now dacier fixed his indifferent eyes on the first column of the leaders he read and his eyes grew horny he jerked back at each sentence electrified staring the article was shorter than usual total repeal was named the precise date when the minister intended calling parliament together to propose it the 'total repeal' might be guess work an editor's bold stroke but the details the date were significant of positive information the minister's definite and immediate instructions were exactly stated where could the fellow have got hold of that dacier asked the blank ceiling he frowned at vacant corners of the room in an effort to conjure some speculation indicative of the source had his chief confided the secret to another and a traitor had they been overheard in his library when the project determined on was put in plain speech the answer was no impossible to each question he glanced at diana she but it was past midnight when he left her and she would never have betrayed him never never to imagine it a moment was an injury to her where else could he look it had been specially mentioned in the communication as a secret by his chief who trusted him and no others up to the consultation with the cabinet it was a thing to be guarded like life itself not to a soul except diana would dacier have breathed syllable of any secret and one of this weight he ran down the article again there were the facts undeniable facts and they detonated with audible roaring and rounding echoes of them over england how did they come there as well inquire how man came on the face of the earth he had to wipe his forehead perpetually think as he would in exaltation of diana to shelter himself he was the accused he might not be the guilty but he had opened his mouth and though it was to her only and she as dunstane had sworn true as steel he could not escape condemnation he had virtually betrayed his master diana would never betray her lover but the thing was in the air as soon as uttered and off to the printing press dacier's grotesque fancy under annoyance pictured a stream of small printer's devils in flight from his babbling lips he consumed bits of breakfast with a sour confession that a newspaper article had hit him at last and stunningly hat and coat were called for the state of aimlessness in hot perplexity demands a show of action whither to go first was as obscure as what to do diana said of the englishman's hat and coat that she supposed they were to make him a walking presentment of the house he had shut up behind him a shot of the eye at the glass confirmed the likeness but with a ruefully wry faced repudiation of it internally not so shut up the reverse of that a common babbler however there was no doubt of diana first he would call on her the pleasantest dose in perturbations of the kind is instinctively taken first she would console perhaps direct him to guess how the secret had leaked but so suddenly immediately it was inexplicable sudden and immediate consequences were experienced on the steps of his house his way was blocked by the arrival of mr quintin manx who jumped out of a cab bellowing interjections and interrogations in a breath was there anything in that article he had read it at breakfast and it had choked him dacier was due at a house and could not wait he said rather sharply he was not responsible for newspaper articles quintin manx a senior gentleman and junior landowner vowed that no minister intending to sell the country should treat him as a sheep the shepherd might go he would not carry his flock with him but was there a twinkle of probability in the story that article dacier was unable to inform him he was very hurried had to keep an appointment 'if i let you go will you come and lunch with me at two' said quintin to get rid of him dacier nodded and agreed 'two o'clock mind' was bawled at his heels as he walked off with his long stride unceremoniously leaving the pursy gentleman of sixty to settle with his cabman far to the rear chapter xxxiv in which it is darkly seen how the criminal's judge may be love's criminal when we are losing balance on a precipice we do not think much of the thing we have clutched for support our balance is restored and we have not fallen that is the comfortable reflection we stand as others do and we will for the future be warned to avoid the dizzy stations which cry for resources beyond a common equilibrium and where a slip precipitates us to ruin when further it is a woman planted in a burning blush having to idealize her feminine weakness that she may not rebuke herself for grovelling the mean material acts by which she sustains a tottering position are speedily swallowed in the one pervading flame she sees but an ashen curl of the path she has traversed to safety if anything knowing her lover was to come in the morning diana's thoughts dwelt wholly upon the way to tell him as tenderly as possible without danger to herself that her time for entertaining was over until she had finished her book indefinitely therefore the apprehension of his complaining pricked the memory that she had something to forgive he had sunk her in her own esteem by compelling her to see her woman's softness but how high above all other men her experience of him could place him notwithstanding he had bowed to the figure of herself dearer than herself that she set before him and it was a true figure to the world a too fictitious to any but the most knightly of lovers she forgave and a shudder seized her snake she rebuked the delicious run of fire through her veins for she was not like the idol women of imperishable type who are never for a twinkle the prey of the blood statues created by man's common desire to impress upon the sex his possessing pattern of them as domestic decorations when she entered the room to dacier and they touched hands she rejoiced in her coolness without any other feeling or perception active not to be unkind not too kind this was her task she waited for the passage of commonplaces 'you slept well percy' 'yes and you' 'i don't think i even dreamed' they sat she noticed the cloud on him and waited for his allusion to it anxious concerning him simply dacier flung the hair off his temples words of titanic formation were hurling in his head at journals and journalists he muttered his disgust of them 'is there anything to annoy you in the papers to day' she asked and thought how handsome his face was in anger the paper of mr tonans was named by him 'you have not seen it 'i have not opened it yet' he sprang up 'the truth is those fellows can now afford to buy right and left corrupt every soul alive there must have been a spy at the keyhole i'm pretty certain i could swear it was not breathed to any ear but mine and there it is this morning in black and white' 'what is' cried diana turning to him on her chair 'the thing i told you last night' her lips worked as if to spell the thing 'printed do you say' she rose 'printed in a leading article loud as a trumpet a hue and cry running from end to end of the country and my chief has already had the satisfaction of seeing the secret he confided to me yesterday roared in all the thoroughfares this morning they've got the facts his decision to propose it and the date the whole of it but who could have betrayed it' for the first time since her midnight expedition she felt a sensation of the full weight of the deed she heard thunder she tried to disperse the growing burden by an inward summons to contempt of the journalistic profession but nothing would come she tried to minimize it and her brain succumbed her views of the deed last night and now throttled reason in two contending clutches the enormity swelled its dimensions taking shape and pointing magnetically at her she stood absolutely amazedly bare before it 'is it of such very great importance' she said like one supplicating him to lessen it 'a secret of state if you ask whether it is of great importance to me relatively it is of course nothing greater personally my conscience is clear i never mentioned it couldn't have mentioned it to any one but you i'm not the man to blab secrets he spoke to me because he knew he could trust me to tell you the truth i'm brought to a dead stop i can't make a guess i'm certain from what he said that he trusted me only with it perfectly certain i know him well he was in his library speaking in his usual conversational tone deliberately nor overloud he stated that it was a secret between us' 'will it affect him' 'this article why naturally it will you ask strange questions a minister coming to a determination like that it affects him vitally the members of the cabinet are not so devoted it affects us all the whole party may split it to pieces there's no reckoning the upset right and left if it were false it could be refuted we could despise it as a trick of journalism it's true there's the mischief tonans did not happen to call here last night absurd i left later than twelve' 'no but let me hear' diana said hurriedly for the sake of uttering the veracious negative and to slur it over 'let me hear' she could not muster an idea her delicious thrilling voice was a comfort to him he lifted his breast high and thumped it trying to smile 'after all it's pleasant being with you tony give me your hand you may i 'm bothered confounded by this morning surprise it was like walking against the muzzle of a loaded cannon suddenly unmasked one can't fathom the mischief it will do and i shall be suspected and can't quite protest myself the spotless innocent not even to my heart's mistress to the wife of the bosom i suppose i'm no roman you won't give me your hand tony you might seeing i am rather' a rush of scalding tears flooded her eyes 'don't touch me' she said and forced her sight to look straight at him through the fiery shower 'i have done positive mischief' 'you my dear tony' he doated on her face 'i don't blame you i blame myself these things should never be breathed once in the air the devil has hold of them don't take it so much to heart the thing's bad enough to bear as it is tears let me have the hand i came on my honour with the most honest intention to submit to your orders but if i see you weeping in sympathy' 'oh for heaven's sake' she caught her hands away from him 'don't be generous whip me with scorpions and don't touch me' cried diana 'do you understand you did not name it as a secret i did not imagine it to be a secret of immense immediate importance' 'but what' shouted dacier stiffening he wanted her positive meaning as she perceived having hoped that it was generally taken and current and the shock to him over 'i had i had not a suspicion of doing harm percy' 'but what harm have you done no riddles' his features gave sign of the break in their common ground the widening gulf 'i went it was a curious giddiness i can't account for it i thought' 'went you went where' 'last night i would speak intelligibly my mind has gone ah you look it is not so bad as my feeling' 'but where did you go last night what to tonans' she drooped her head she saw the track of her route cleaving the darkness in a demoniacal zig zag and herself in demon's grip 'yes' she confronted him 'i went to mr tonans' 'why' 'i went to him ' 'you went alone' 'i took my maid' 'well' 'it was late when you left me' 'speak plainly' 'i am trying i will tell you all' 'at once if you please' 'i went to him why there is no accounting for it he sneered constantly at my stale information' 'you gave him constant information' 'no in our ordinary talk he railed at me for being out of it i must be childish i went to show him oh my vanity i think i must have been possessed' she watched the hardening of her lover's eyes they penetrated and through them she read herself insufferably but it was with hesitation still that he said 'then you betrayed me' 'percy i had not a suspicion of mischief' 'you went straight to this man' 'not thinking' 'you sold me to a journalist' 'i thought it was a secret of a day i don't think you no you did not tell me to keep it secret a word from you would have been enough i was in extremity' dacier threw his hands up and broke away he had an impulse to dash from the room to get a breath of different air he stood at the window observing tradesmen's carts housemaids blank doors dogs a beggar fifer her last words recurred to him he turned 'you were in extremity you said what is the meaning of that what extremity' her large dark eyes flashed powerlessly her shape appeared to have narrowed her tongue too was a feeble penitent 'you ask a creature to recall her acts of insanity' 'there must be some signification in your words i suppose' 'i will tell you as clearly as i can you have the right to be my judge i was in extremity that is i saw no means i could not write it was ruin coming' 'ah you took payment for playing spy' 'i fancied i could retrieve now i see the folly the baseness i was blind' 'then you sold me to a journalist for money' the intolerable scourge fetched a stifled scream from her and drove her pacing but there was no escape she returned to meet it the room was a cage to both of them and every word of either was a sting 'percy i did not imagine he would use it make use of it as he has done' 'not and when he paid for it' 'i fancied it would be merely of general service if any' 'distributed i see not leading to the exposure of the communicant' 'you are harsh but i would not have you milder' the meekness of such a mischief doer was revolting and called for the lash 'do me the favour to name the sum i am curious to learn what my imbecility was counted worth' 'no sum was named' 'have i been bought for a song' 'it was a suggestion no definite nothing stipulated' 'you were to receive money' 'leave me a bit of veiling no you shall behold me the thing i am listen i was poor' 'you might have applied to me' 'for money that i could not do 'better than betraying me believe me' 'i had no thought of betraying i hope i could have died rather than consciously betray' 'money my whole fortune was at your disposal' 'i was beset with debts unable to write and last night when you left me abject it seemed to me that you disrespected me' 'last night' dacier cried with lashing emphasis 'it is evident to me that i have the reptile in me percy or else i am subject to lose my reason i went i went like a bullet i cannot describe it i was mad i need a strong arm i want help i am given to think that i do my best and can be independent i break down i went blindly now i see it for the chance of recovering my position as the gambler casts and he wins or loses with me it is the soul that is lost no exact sum was named thousands were hinted' 'you are hardly practical on points of business' 'i was insane' 'i think you said you slept well after it' dacier remarked 'i had so little the idea of having done evilly that i slept without a dream' he shrugged the consciences of women are such smooth deeps or running shallows 'i have often wondered how your newspaper men got their information' he said and muttered 'money women' adding 'idiots to prime them and i one of the leaky vessels well we learn i have been rather astonished at times of late at the scraps of secret knowledge displayed by tonans if he flourishes his thousands the wonder is he doesn't corrupt the ministers' wives perhaps he does marriage will become a danger sign to parliamentary members foreign women do these tricks women of a well known stamp it is now a full year i think since i began to speak to you of secret matters and congratulated myself i recollect on your thirst for them' 'percy if you suspect that i have uttered one word before last night you are wrong i cannot paint my temptation or my loss of sense last night previously i was blameless i thirsted yes but in the hope of helping you' he looked at her she perceived how glitteringly loveless his eyes had grown it was her punishment and though the enamoured woman's heart protested it excessive she accepted it 'i can never trust you again' he said 'i fear you will not' she replied his coming back to her after the departure of the guests last night shone on him in splendid colours of single minded loverlike devotion 'i came to speak to my own heart i thought it would give you pleasure thought i could trust you utterly i had not the slightest conception i was imperilling my honour' he stopped her bloodless fixed features revealed an intensity of anguish that checked him only her mouth a little open for the sharp breath appeared dumbly beseeching her large eyes met his like steel to steel as of one who would die fronting the weapon he strangled a loathsome inclination to admire 'so good bye' he said she moved her lips he said no more in half a minute he was gone to her it was the plucking of life out of her breast she pressed her hands where heart had been the pallor and cold of death took her body chapter xxxv reveals how the true heroine of romance comes finally to her time of triumph the shutting of her house door closed for dacier that woman's history in connection with himself he set his mind on the consequences of the act of folly the trusting a secret to a woman all were possibly not so bad none should be trusted the air of the street fanned him agreeably as he revolved the horrible project of confession to the man who had put faith in him particulars might be asked she would be unnamed but an imagination of the effect of naming her placarded a notorious woman in fresh paint two members of the same family her victims and last night no later than last night he had swung round at this very corner of the street to give her the fullest proof of his affection he beheld a dupe trotting into a carefully laid pitfall she had him by the generosity of his confidence in her moreover the recollection of her recent feeble phrasing when she stood convicted of the treachery when a really clever woman would have developed her resources led him to doubt her being so finely gifted she was just clever enough to hoodwink he attributed the dupery to a trick of imposing the idea of her virtue upon men attracted by her good looks and sparkle they entered the circle of her charm became delightfully intimate suffered a rebuff and were from that time prepared to serve her purpose how many other wretched dupes had she dangling he spied at westlake spied at redworth at old lord larrian at lord dannisburgh at arthur rhodes dozens old and young were alike to her if she saw an end to be gained by keeping them hooked tonans too and whitmonby newspaper editors were especially serviceable perhaps 'a young minister of state' held the foremost rank in that respect if completely duped and squeezeable he produced more substantial stuff the background of ice in dacier's composition was brought to the front by his righteous contempt of her treachery no explanation of it would have appeased him she was guilty and he condemned her she stood condemned by all the evil likely to ensue from her misdeed scarcely had he left her house last night when she was away to betray him he shook her from him without a pang crediting her with the one merit she had that of not imploring for mercy he the more easily shook her off treacherous she had not proved theatrical so there was no fuss in putting out her light and it was done he was justified by the brute facts honourable courteous kindly gentleman highly civilized an excellent citizen and a patriot he was icy at an outrage to his principles and in the dominion of love a sultan of the bow string and chopper period sovereignly endowed to stretch a finger for the scimitared mesrour to make the erring woman head and trunk with one blow and away with those remnants this internally he did enough that the brute facts justified him st james's park was crossed and the grass of the green park to avoid inquisitive friends he was obliged to walk exercise action of any sort was imperative and but for some engagement he would have gone to his fencing rooms for a bout with the master he remembered his engagement and grew doubly embittered he had absurdly pledged himself to lunch with quintin manx that was to pretend to eat while submitting to be questioned by a political dullard strong on his present right to overhaul and rail at his superiors the house was one of a block along the north western line of hyde park he kicked at the subjection to go there but a promise was binding though he gave it when stunned he could have silenced mr manx with the posing interrogation why have i so long consented to put myself at the mercy of a bore for him he could not answer it though manx as leader of the shipping interest was influential the man had to be endured like other doses in politics dacier did not once think of the great ship owner's niece till miss constance asper stepped into her drawing room to welcome him she was an image of repose to his mind the calm pure outline of her white features refreshed him as the alps the londoner newly alighted at berne smoke wrangle the wrestling city's wickedness behind him 'my uncle is very disturbed' she said 'is the news if i am not very indiscreet in inquiring' 'i have a practice of never paying attention to newspaper articles' dacier replied 'i am only affected by living with one who does' miss asper observed and the lofty isolation of her head above politics gave her a moral attractiveness in addition to physical beauty her water colour sketches were on her uncle's walls the beautiful in nature claimed and absorbed her she dressed with a pretty rigour a lovely simplicity picturesque of the nunnery she looked indeed a high born young lady abbess 'it's a dusty game for ladies' dacier said abhorring the women defiled by it and when one thinks of the desire of men to worship women there is a pathos in a man's discovery of the fair young creature undefiled by any interest in public affairs virginal amid her bower's environments the angelical beauty of a virgin mind and person captivated him by contrast his natural taste was to admire it shunning the lures and tangles of the women on high seas notably the married who by the way contrive to ensnare us through wonderment at a cleverness caught from their traffic with the masculine world often if we did but know a parrot repetition of the last male visitor's remarks but that which the fair maiden speaks though it may be simple is her own she too is her own or vowed but to one she is on all sides impressive in purity the world worships her as its perfect pearl and we are brought refreshfully to acknowledge that the world is right by contrast the white radiation of innocence distinguished constance asper celestially as he was well aware she had long preferred him the reserved among many pleading pressing suitors her steady faithfulness had fed on the poorest crumbs he ventured to express the hope that she was well 'yes' she answered with eyelids lifted softly to thank him for his concern in so humble a person 'you look a little pale' he said she coloured like a sea water shell 'i am inclined to paleness by nature' her uncle disturbed them lunch was ready he apologized for the absence of mrs markland a maternal aunt of constance who kept house for them quintin manx fell upon the meats and then upon the minister dacier found himself happily surprised by the accession of an appetite he mentioned it to escape from the worrying of his host as unusual with him at midday and miss asper supporting him in that effort said benevolently 'gentlemen should eat they have so many fatigues and troubles' she herself did not like to be seen eating in public her lips opened to the morsels as with a bird's bill though with none of the pecking eagerness we complacently observe in poultry 'but now i say positively how about that article' said quintin dacier visibly winced and constance immediately said 'oh spare us politics dear uncle' her intercession was without avail but by contrast with the woman implicated in the horrible article it was a carol of the seraphs 'come you can say whether there's anything in it' dacier's host pushed him 'i should not say it if i could' he replied the mild sweetness of miss asper's look encouraged him he was touched to the quick by hearing her say 'you ask for cabinet secrets uncle all secrets are holy but secrets of state are under a seal next to divine' next to divine she was the mouthpiece of his ruling principle 'i 'm not prying into secrets' quintin persisted 'all i want to know is whether there 's any foundation for that article all london's boiling about it i can tell you or it's only newspaper's humbug' 'clearly the oracle for you is the editor's office' rejoined dacier 'a pretty sort of answer i should get' 'it would at least be complimentary' 'how do you mean' 'the net was cast for you and the sight of a fish in it' miss asper almost laughed 'have you heard the choir at st catherine's' she asked dacier had not he repented of his worldliness and drinking persuasive claret said he would go to hear it next sunday 'do' she murmured 'well you seem to be a pair against me' her uncle grumbled 'anyhow i think it's important people have been talking for some time and i don't want to be taken unawares i won't be a yoked ox mind you' 'have you been sketching lately' dacier asked miss asper she generally filled a book in the autumn she said 'may i see it' 'if you wish' they had a short tussle with her uncle and escaped he was conducted to a room midway upstairs an heiress's conception of a saintly little room and more impresive in purity indeed it was than a saint's with the many crucifixes gold and silver emblems velvet prie dieu chairs jewel clasped sacred volumes every invitation to meditate in luxury on an ascetic religiousness she depreciated her sketching powers 'i am impatient with my imperfections i am therefore doomed not to advance' 'on the contrary that is the state guaranteeing ultimate excellence' he said much disposed to drone about it she sighed 'i fear not' he turned the leaves comparing her modesty with the performance the third of the leaves was a subject instantly recognized by him it represented the place he had inherited from lord dannisburgh he named it she smiled 'you are good enough to see a likeness my aunt and i were passing it last october and i waited for a day to sketch' 'you have taken it from my favourite point of view' 'i am glad' 'how much i should like a copy' 'if you will accept that' 'i could not rob you' 'i can make a duplicate' 'the look of the place pleases you' 'oh yes the pines behind it the sweet little village church even the appearance of the rustics it is all impressively old english i suppose you are very seldom there' 'does it look like a home to you' 'no place more' 'i feel the loneliness' 'where i live i feel no loneliness' 'you have heavenly messengers near you' 'they do not always come' 'would you consent to make the place less lonely to me' her bosom rose in deference to her maidenly understanding she gazed inquiringly 'if you love it' said he 'the place' she said looking soft at the possessor 'constance' 'is it true' 'as you yourself could it be other than true this hand is mine' 'oh percy' borrowing the world's poetry to describe them the long prayed for summer enveloped the melting snows so the recollection of diana's watch beside his uncle's death bed was wiped out ay and the hissing of her treachery silenced this maidenly hand put him at peace with the world instead of his defying it for a worthless woman who could not do better than accept the shelter of her husband's house as she ought to be told if her friends wished her to save her reputation dacier made his way downstairs to quintin manx by whom he was hotly congratulated and informed of the extent of the young lady's fortune on the strength of which it was expected that he would certainly speak a private word in elucidation of that newspaper article 'i know nothing of it' said dacier but promised to come and dine alone in her happiness constance asper despatched various brief notes under her gold symbolled crest to sisterly friends one to lady wathin containing the single line 'your prophesy is confirmed' dacier was comfortably able to face his club after the excitement of a proposal with a bride on his hands he was assaulted concerning the article and he parried capitally say that her lips were rather cold at any rate they invigorated him her character was guaranteed not the hazy idea of a dupe and her fortune would be enormous a speculation merely due to worldly prudence and prospective ambition at the dinner table of four in the evening conversation would have seemed dull to him by contrast had it not been for the presiding grace of his bride whose habitually eminent feminine air of superiority to the repast was throned by her appreciative receptiveness of his looks and utterances before leaving her he won her consent to a very early marriage on the plea of a possibly approaching session and also that they had waited long the consent notwithstanding the hurry of preparations it involved besides the annihilation of her desire to meditate on so solemn a change in her life and savour the congratulations of her friends and have the choir of st catherine's rigorously drilled in her favourite anthems was beautifully yielded to the pressure of circumstances there lay on his table at night a letter a bulky letter no need to tear it open for sight of the signature the superscription was redolent of that betraying woman he tossed it unopened into the fire as it was thick it burned sullenly discolouring his name on the address as she had done and still offering him a last chance of viewing the contents she fought on the consuming fire to have her exculpation heard but was she not a shameless traitor she had caught him by his love of his country and hope to serve it she had wound into his heart to bleed him of all he knew and sell the secrets for money a wonderful sort of eloquence lay there on those coals no doubt he felt a slight movement of curiosity to glance at two or three random sentences very slight and why read them now they were valueless to him mere outcries he judged her by the brute facts she and her slowly consuming letter were of a common blackness moreover to read them when he was plighted to another woman would be senseless in the discovery of her baseness she had made a poor figure doubtless during the afternoon she had trimmed her intuitive belial art of making 'the worse appear the better cause' queer to peruse and instructive in an unprofitable department of knowledge the tricks of the sex he said to himself with little intuition of the popular taste she wouldn't be a bad heroine of romance he said it derisively of the romantic but the right worshipful heroine of romance was the front face female picture he had won for his walls poor diana was the flecked heroine of reality not always the same not impeccable not an ignorant innocent nor a guileless good under good leading devoted to the death in a grave crisis often wrestling with her terrestrial nature nobly and a growing soul but not one whose purity was carved in marble for the assurance to an englishman that his possession of the changeless thing defies time and his fellows is the pillar of his home and universally enviable your fair one of romance cannot suffer a mishap without a plotting villain perchance many of them to wreak the dread iniquity she cannot move without him she is the marble block and if she is to have a feature he is the sculptor she depends on him for life and her human history at least is married to him far more than to the rescuing lover no wonder then that men should find her thrice cherishable featureless or with the most moderate possible indication of a countenance thousands of the excellent simple creatures do and every reader of her tale on the contrary the heroine of reality is that woman whom you have met or heard of once in your course of years and very probably despised for bearing in her composition the motive principle at best you say a singular mixture of good and bad anything but the feminine ideal of man feature to some excess you think distinguishes her yet she furnishes not any of the sweet sensual excitement pertaining to her spotless rival pursued by villany she knocks at the doors of the mind and the mind must open to be interested in her mind and heart must be wide open to excuse her sheer descent from the pure ideal of man dacier's wandering reflections all came back in crowds to the judicial bench of the black cap he felt finely apart from the treason that her want of money degraded her him too by contact money she might have had to any extent upon application for it of course how was he to imagine that she wanted money smilingly as she welcomed him and his friends entertaining them royally he was bound to think she had means a decent propriety bound him not to think of the matter at all he naturally supposed she was capable of conducting her affairs and money it soiled his memory though the hour at rovio was rather pretty and the scene at copsley touching other times also short glimpses of the woman were taking the flood of her treachery effaced them and why reflect constance called to him to look her way diana's letter died hard the corners were burnt to black tissue with an edge or two of discoloured paper a small frayed central heap still resisted and in kindness to the necessity for privacy he impressed the fire tongs to complete the execution after which he went to his desk and worked under the presidency of constance chapter xxxvi is conclusive as to the heartlessness of women with brains hymenaeal rumours are those which might be backed to run a victorious race with the tale of evil fortune and clearly for the reason that man's livelier half is ever alert to speed them they travel with an astonishing celerity over the land like flames of the dry beacon faggots of old time in announcement of the invader or a conquest gathering as they go wherein to say nothing of their vastly wider range they surpass the electric wires man's nuptial half is kindlingly concerned in the launch of a new couple it is the business of the fair sex and man himself very strangely but nature quickens him still lends a not unfavouring eye to the preparations of the matrimonial vessel for its oily descent into the tides where billows will soon be rising captain and mate soon discussing the fateful question of who is commander we consent it appears to hope again for mankind here is another chance or else assuming the happiness of the pair that pomp of ceremonial contrasted with the little wind blown candle they carry between them catches at our weaker fibres after so many ships have foundered some keel up like poisoned fish at the first drink of water it is a gallant spectacle let us avow and either the world perpetuating it is heroical or nature incorrigible in the species marriages are unceasing friends do it and enemies the unknown contractors of this engagement or armistice inspire an interest it certainly is both exciting and comforting to hear that man and woman are ready to join in a mutual affirmative say yes together again it sounds like the end of the war the proclamation of the proximate marriage of a young minister of state and the greatest heiress of her day notoriously 'the young minister of state' of a famous book written by the beautiful now writhing woman madly enamoured of him and the heiress whose dowry could purchase a duchy this was a note to make the gossips of england leap from their beds at the midnight hour and wag tongues in the market place it did away with the political hubbub over the tonans article and let it noise abroad like nonsense the hon percy dacier espouses miss asper and she rescues him from the snares of a siren he her from the toils of the papists she would have gone over to them she was going when luckily for the protestant faith percy dacier intervened with his proposal town and country buzzed the news and while that dreary league trumpeted about the business of the nation a people suddenly become oriental chattered of nothing but the blissful union to be celebrated in princely state with every musical accessory short of operatic lady wathin was an active agent in this excitement the excellent woman enjoyed marriages of high life which as there is presumably wealth to support them are manifestly under sanction and a marriage that she could consider one of her own contrivance had a delicate flavour of a marriage in the family not quite equal to the seeing a dear daughter of her numerous progeny conducted to the altar but excelling it in the pomp that bids the heavens open she and no other spread the tidings of miss asper's debating upon the step to rome at the very instant of percy dacier's declaration of his love and it was a beautiful struggle that of the half dedicated nun and her deep rooted earthly passion love prevailing she sent word to lady dunstane 'you know the interest i have always taken in dear constance aspen' etc inviting her to come on a visit a week before the end of the month that she might join in the ceremony of a wedding 'likely to be the grandest of our time' pitiful though it was to think of the bridal pair having but eight or ten days at the outside for a honeymoon the beauty of their 'mutual devotion to duty' was urged by lady wathin upon all hearers lady dunstane declined the invitation she waited to hear from her friend and the days went by she could only sorrow for her poor tony divining her state however little of wrong in the circumstances they imposed a silence on her decent mind and no conceivable shape of writing would transmit condolences she waited with a dull heartache by no means grieving at dacier's engagement to the heiress until redworth animated her as the bearer of rather startling intelligence indirectly relating to the soul she loved an accident in the street had befallen mr warwick redworth wanted to know whether diana should be told of it though he had no particulars to give and somewhat to his disappointment lady dunstane said she would write she delayed thinking the accident might not be serious and the information of it to diana surely would be so next day at noon her visitor was lady wathin evidently perturbed and anxious to say more than she dared but she received no assistance after beating the air in every direction especially dwelling on the fond reciprocal affection of the two devoted lovers to be united within three days' time lady wathin said at last 'and is it not shocking i talk of a marriage and am appalled by a death that poor man died last night in the hospital i mean poor mr warwick he was recovering getting strong and well and he was knocked down at a street crossing and died last night it is a warning to us' 'mr redworth happened to hear of it at his club near which the accident occurred and he called at the hospital mr warwick was then alive' said lady dunstane adding 'well if prevention is better than cure as we hear accidents are the specific for averting the maladies of age which are a certain crop' lady wathin's eyelids worked and her lips shut fast at the cold hearted remark void of meaning she sighed 'so ends a life of misery my dear' 'you are compassionate' 'i hope so but indeed i must speak if you will let me i think of the living' lady dunstane widened her eyes 'of mrs warwick' 'she has now the freedom she desired i think of others forgive me but constance asper is to me as a daughter i have perhaps no grounds for any apprehension love so ardent so sincere was never shown by bridegroom elect and it is not extraordinary to those acquainted with dear constance but one may be a worshipped saint and experience defection the terrible stories one hears of a power of fascination almost' lady wathin hung for the word 'infernal' said lady dunstane whose brows had been bent inquiringly 'have no fear the freedom you allude to will not be used to interfere with any entertainment in prospect it was freedom my friend desired now that her jewel is restored to her she is not the person to throw it away be sure and pray drop the subject' 'one may rely you think' 'oh oh' 'this release coming just before the wedding' 'i should hardly suppose the man to be the puppet you depict or indicate' 'it is because men so many are not puppets that one is conscious of alarm' 'your previous remark' said lady dunstane 'sounded superstitious your present one has an antipodal basis but as for your alarm check it and spare me further my friend has acknowledged powers considering that she does not use them you should learn to respect her' lady wathin bowed stiffly she refused to partake of lunch having she said satisfied her conscience by the performance of a duty and arranged with her flyman to catch a train her cousin lady dunstane smiled loftily at everything she uttered and she felt that if a woman like this mrs warwick could put division between blood relatives she could do worse and was to be dreaded up to the hour of the nuptials 'i meant no harm in coming' she said at the shaking of hands 'no no i understand' said her hostess 'you are hen hearted over your adopted brood the situation is perceptible and your intention creditable' as one of the good women of the world lady wathin in departing was indignant at the tone and dialect of a younger woman not modestly concealing her possession of the larger brain brains in women she both dreaded and detested she believed them to be devilish here were instances they had driven poor sir lukin to evil courses and that poor mr warwick straight under the wheels of a cab sir lukin's name was trotting in public with a naughty mrs fryar gunnett's mrs warwick might still trim her arts to baffle the marriage women with brains moreover are all heartless they have no pity for distress no horror of catastrophes no joy in the happiness of the deserving brains in men advance a household to station but brains in women divide it and are the wrecking of society fortunately lady wathin knew she could rally a powerful moral contingent the aptitude of which for a one minded cohesion enabled it to crush those fractional daughters of mischief she was a really good woman of the world heading a multitude the same whom you are accustomed to hear exalted lucky in having had a guided girlhood a thick curtained prudence and in having stock in the moral funds shares in the sentimental tramways wherever the world laid its hoards or ran its lines she was found and forcible enough to be eminent though at fixed hours of the day even as she washed her hands she abjured worldliness a performance that cleansed her if she did not make morality appear loveable to the objects of her dislike it was owing to her want of brains to see the origin nature and right ends of morality but a world yet more deficient than she esteemed her cordially for being a bulwark of the present edifice which looks a solid structure when the microscope is not applied to its components supposing percy dacier a dishonourable tattler as well as an icy lover and that lady wathin through his bride had become privy to the secret between him and diana there is reason to think that she would have held it in terror over the baneful woman but not have persecuted her for she was by no means the active malignant of theatrical plots no she would have charged it upon the possession of brains by women and have had a further motive for inciting the potent dignitary her husband to employ his authority to repress the sex's exercise of those fell weapons hurtful alike to them and all coming near them so extreme was her dread of mrs warwick that she drove from the london railway station to see constance and be reassured by her tranquil aspect sweet constance and her betrothed percy were together examining a missal lady dunstane despatched a few words of the facts to diana she hoped to hear from her rather hoped for the moment not to see her no answer came the great day of the nuptials came and passed she counted on her husband's appearance the next morning as the good gentleman made a point of visiting her to entertain the wife he adored whenever he had a wallet of gossip that would overlay the blank of his absence he had been to the church of the wedding he did not say with whom all the world was there and he rapturously described the ceremony stating that it set women weeping and caused him to behave like a fool 'you are impressionable' said his wife he murmured something in praise of the institution of marriage when celebrated impressively it seemed 'tony calls the social world the theatre of appetites as we have it at present' she said 'and the world at a wedding is one may reckon in the second act of the hungry tragicomedy' 'yes there's the breakfast' sir lukin assented mrs fryar gunnett was much more intelligible to him in fact quite so as to her speech emma's heart now yearned to her tony consulting her strength she thought she might journey to london and on the third morning after the dacier asper marriage she started diana's door was open to arthur rhodes when emma reached it 'have you seen her' she asked him his head shook dolefully 'mrs warwick is unwell she has been working too hard' 'you also i'm afraid' 'no' he could deny that whatever the look of him 'come to me at copsley soon' said she entering to danvers in the passage 'my mistress is upstairs my lady' said danvers 'she is lying on her bed' 'she is ill' 'she has been lying on her bed ever since' 'since what' lady dunstane spoke sharply danvers retrieved her indiscretion 'since she heard of the accident my lady' 'take my name to her or no i can venture' 'i am not allowed to go in and speak to her you will find the room quite dark my lady and very cold it is her command my mistress will not let me light the fire and she has not eaten or drunk of anything since she will die if you do not persuade her to take nourishment a little for a beginning it wants the beginning' emma went upstairs thinking of the enigmatical maid that she must be a good soul after all diana's bedroom door was opened slowly 'you will not be able to see at first my lady' danvers whispered 'the bed is to the left and a chair i would bring in a candle but it hurts her eyes she forbids it' emma stepped in the chill thick air of the unlighted london room was cavernous she almost forgot the beloved of her heart in the thought that a living woman had been lying here more than two days and nights fasting the proof of an uttermost misery revived the circumstances within her to render her friend's presence in this desert of darkness credible she found the bed by touch silently and distinguished a dark heap on the bed she heard no breathing she sat and listened then she stretched out her hand and met her tony's it lay open it was the hand of a drowned woman shutters and curtains and the fireless grate gave the room an appalling likeness to the vaults so like to the home of death it seemed that in a few minutes the watcher had lost count of time and kept but a wormy memory of the daylight she dared not speak for some fear of startling for the worse fear of never getting answer tony's hand was lifeless her clasp of it struck no warmth she stung herself with bitter reproaches for having let common mundane sentiments worthy of a lady wathin bar her instant offer of her bosom to the beloved who suffered in this depth of mortal agony tony's love of a man as she should have known would be wrought of the elements of our being when other women named happiness she said life in division death her body lying still upon the bed here was a soul borne onward by the river of death the darkness gave sight after a while like a curtain lifting on a veil the dead light of the underworld tony lay with her face up her underlip dropped straight from head to feet the outline of her face without hue of it could be seen sign of the hapless women that have souls in love hateful love of men emma thought and was moved to feel at the wrist for her darling's pulse he has killed her the thought flashed as with pangs chilling her frame the pressure at the wrist continued insensible of the faintest beat she clasped it trembling in pain to stop an outcry 'it is emmy' said the voice emma's heart sprang to heaven on a rush of thanks 'my tony' she breathed softly she hung for a further proof of life in the motionless body 'tony' she said the answer was at her hand a thread like return of her clasp 'it is emmy come to stay with you never to leave you' the thin still answer was at her hand a moment the fingers fell away a deep breath was taken twice to say 'don't talk to me' emma retained the hand she was warned not to press it by the deadness following its effort to reply but tony lived she had given proof of life over this little wavering taper in the vaults emma cowered cherishing the hand silently hoping for the voice it came 'winter' 'it is a cold winter tony' 'my dear will be cold' 'i will light the fire' emma lost no time in deciding to seek the match box the fire was lit and it flamed it seemed a revival in the room coming back to the bedside she discerned her tony's lacklustre large dark eyes and her hollow cheeks her mouth open to air as to the drawing in of a sword rather as to the releaser than the sustainer her feet were on the rug her maid had placed to cover them emma leaned across the bed to put them to her breast beneath her fur mantle and held them there despite the half animate tug of the limbs and the shaft of iciness they sent to her very heart when she had restored them to some warmth she threw aside her bonnet and lying beside tony took her in her arms heaving now and then a deep sigh she kissed her cheek 'it is emmy' 'kiss her' 'i have no strength' emma laid her face on the lips they were cold even the breath between them cold 'has emmy been long' 'here dear i think so i am with my darling' tony moaned the warmth and the love were bringing back her anguish she said 'i have been happy it is not hard to go' emma strained to her 'tony will wait for her soul's own soul to go the two together' there was a faint convulsion in the body 'if i cry i shall go in pain' 'you are in emmy's arms my beloved' tony's eyes closed for forgetfulness under that sensation a tear ran down from her but the pain was lag and neighboured sleep like the pleasure so passed the short winter day little spoken then emma bethought her of a way of leading tony to take food and she said 'i shall stay with you i shall send for clothes i am rather hungry don't stir dear i will be mistress of the house' she went below to the kitchen where a few words in the ear of a frenchwoman were sufficient to waken immediate comprehension of what was wanted and smart service within ten minutes an appetizing bouillon sent its odour over the bedroom tony days back had said her last to the act of eating but emma sipping at the spoon and expressing satisfaction was a pleasant picture the bouillon smelt pleasantly 'your servants love you' emma said 'ah poor good souls' 'they crowded up to me to hear of you madame of course at the first word was off to her pots and we english have the habit of calling ourselves the practical people this bouillon is consummate however we have the virtues of barbarians we can love and serve for love i never tasted anything so good i could become a glutton' 'do' said tony 'i should be ashamed to drain the bowl all to myself a solitary toper is a horrid creature unless he makes a song of it' 'emmy makes a song of it to me' 'but pledge me is a noble saying when you think of humanity's original hunger for the whole it is there that our civilizing commenced and i am particularly fond of hearing the call it is grandly historic so pledge me tony we two can feed from one spoon it is a closer bond than the loving cup i want you just to taste it and excuse my gluttony' tony murmured 'no' the spoon was put to her mouth she sighed to resist the stronger will compelled her to move her lips emma fed her as a child and nature sucked for life the first effect was a gush of tears emma lay with her that night when the patient was the better sleeper but during the night at intervals she had the happiness of feeling tony's hand travelling to make sure of her chapter xxxvii an exhibition of some champions of the stricken lady close upon the hour of ten every morning the fortuitous meeting of two gentlemen at mrs warwick's housedoor was a signal for punctiliously stately greetings the salutation of the raised hat and a bow of the head from a position of military erectness followed by the remark 'i trust you are well sir' to which the reply 'i am very well sir and trust you are the same' was deemed a complimentary fulfilment of their mutual obligation in presence mr sullivan smith's initiative imparted this exercise of formal manners to mr arthur rhodes whose renewed appearance at the minute of his own arrival he viewed as he did not conceal with a disappointed and a reproving eye the inquiry after the state of mrs warwick's health having received its tolerably comforting answer from the footman they left their cards in turn then descended the doorsteps faced for the performance of the salute and departed their contrary ways the pleasing intelligence refreshed them one morning that they would be welcomed by lady dunstane thereupon mr sullivan smith wheeled about to mr arthur rhodes and observed to him 'sir i might claim by right of seniority to be the foremost of us two in offering my respects to the lady but the way is open to you' 'sir' said mr arthur rhodes 'permit me to defer to your many superior titles to that distinction' 'the honour sir lies rather in the bestowing than in the taking' 'i venture to think sir that though i cannot speak pure castilian i require no lesson from a grandee of spain in acknowledging the dues of my betters' 'i will avow myself conquered sir by your overpowering condescension' said mr sullivan smith 'and i entreat you to ascribe my acceptance of your brief retirement to the urgent character of the business i have at heart' he laid his fingers on the panting spot and bowed mr arthur rhodes likewise bowing deferentially fell to rearward 'if i mistake not' said the irish gentleman 'i am indebted to mr rhodes and we have been joint participators in the hospitality of mrs warwick's table' the english gentleman replied 'it was there that i first had the pleasure of an acquaintance which is graven on my memory as the words of the wise king on tablets of gold and silver' mr sullivan smith gravely smiled at the unwonted match he had found in ceremonious humour in saxonland and saying 'i shall not long detain you mr rhodes' he passed through the doorway arthur waited for him pacing up and down for a quarter of an hour when a totally different man reappeared in the same person and was the sullivan smith of the rosy beaming features and princely heartiness he was accosted 'now my dear boy it's your turn to try if you have a chance and good luck go with ye i've said what i could on your behalf for you're one of ten thousand in this country you are' mr sullivan smith had solemnified himself to proffer a sober petition within the walls of the newly widowed lady's house namely for nothing less than that sweet lady's now unfettered hand and it had therefore been perfectly natural to him until his performance ended with the destruction of his hopes to deliver himself in the high castilian manner quite unexpected however was the reciprocal loftiness of tone spontaneously adopted by the young english squire for whom in consequence he conceived a cordial relish and as he paced in the footsteps of arthur anxious to quiet his curiosity by hearing how it had fared with one whom he had to suppose the second applicant he kept ejaculating 'not a bit the fellow can't be saxon and she had a liking for him she's nigh coming of the age when a woman takes to the chicks better he than another if it's to be any one for he's got fun in him he carries his own condiments instead of borrowing from the popular castors as is their way over here but i might have known there 's always sure to be salt and savour in the man she covers with her wing excepting if you please my dear lady a bad shot you made at a rascal cur no more worthy of you than beelzebub of paradise no matter the daughters' of erin must share the fate of their mother isle that their tears may shine in the burst of sun to follow for personal and patriotic motives i would have cheered her and been like a wild ass combed and groomed and tamed by the adorable creature but her friend says there 's not a whisk of a chance for me and i must roam the desert kicking up and worshipping the star i hail brightest they know me not who think i can't worship why what were i without my star at best a pickled porker' sullivan smith became aware of a ravishing melodiousness in the soliloquy as well as a clean resemblance in the simile he would certainly have proceeded to improvize impassioned verse if he had not seen arthur rhodes on the pavement 'so here's the boy query the face he wears' 'how kind of you to wait' said arthur 'we'll call it sympathy for convenience' rejoined sullivan smith 'well and what next' 'you know as much as i do thank heaven she is recovering' 'is that all' 'why what more' arthur was jealously inspected 'you look open hearted my dear boy' sullivan smith blew the sound of a reflected ahem 'excuse me for cornemusing in your company' he said 'but seriously there was only one thing to pardon your hurrying to the lady's door at such a season when the wind tells tales to the world she's down with a cold you know' 'an influenza' said arthur the simplicity of the acquiescence was vexatious to a champion desirous of hostilities to vindicate the lady in addition to his anxiety to cloak her sad plight 'she caught it from contact with one of the inhabitants of this country 'tis the fate of us irish and we're condemned to it for the sin of getting tired of our own i begin to sneeze when i land at holyhead unbutton a waistcoat here in the hope of meeting a heart and you're lucky in escaping a pulmonary attack of no common severity while the dog that infected you scampers off to celebrate his honeymoon mayhap ah but call at her house in shoals the world 'll soon be saying it's worse than a coughing cold if you came to lead her out of it in triumph the laugh 'd be with you and the lady well covered d' ye understand' the allusion to the dog's honeymoon had put arthur rhodes on the track of the darting cracker metaphor 'i think i do' he said 'she will soon be at copsley lady dunstane's house on the hills and there we can see her' 'and that's next to the happiness of consoling if only it had been granted she's not an ordinary widow to be caught when the tear of lamentation has opened a practicable path or water way to the poor nightcapped jewel within so and you're a candid admirer mr rhodes well and i'll be one with you for there's not a star in the firmament more deserving of homage than that lady' 'let's walk in the park and talk of her' said arthur 'there's no sweeter subject to me' his boyish frankness rejoiced sullivan smith 'as long as you like nor to me' he exclaimed 'and that ever since i first beheld her on the night of a ball in dublin before i had listened to a word of her speaking and she bore her father's irish name none of your warwicks and your but let the cur go barking he can't tell what he's lost perhaps he doesn't care and after inflicting his hydrophobia on her tender fame pooh sir you call it a civilized country where you and i and dozens of others are ready to start up as brothers of the lady to defend her and are paralyzed by the law 'tis a law they've instituted for the protection of dirty dogs their majority' 'i owe more to mrs warwick than to any soul i know' said arthur 'let 's hear' quoth sullivan smith proceeding 'she's the arabian nights in person that's sure and shakespeare's plays tragic and comic and the book of celtic history and erin incarnate down with a cold no matter where but we know where it was caught so there's a pretty library for who's to own her now she's enfranchized by circumstances and a poetical figure too' he subsided for his companion to rhapsodize arthur was overcharged with feeling and could say only 'it would be another world to me if i lost her' 'true but what of the lady' 'no praise of mine could do her justice' 'that may be but it's negative of yourself and not a portrait of the object hasn't she the brain of socrates or better say minerva on the bust of venus and the remainder of her finished off to an exact resemblance of her patronymic goddess of the bow and quiver' 'she has a wise head and is beautiful' 'and chaste' arthur reddened he was prepared to maintain it could not speak it 'she is to us in this london what the run of water was to theocritus in sicily the nearest to the visibly divine' he said and was applauded 'good and on you go top me a few superlatives on that and i 'm your echo my friend isn't the seeing and listening to her like sitting under the silvery canopy of a fountain in high summer' 'all the comparisons are yours' arthur said enviously 'mr rhodes you are a poet i believe and all you require to loosen your tongue is a drop of bacchus so if you will do me the extreme honour to dine with me at my club this evening we'll resume the toast that should never be uttered dry you reprove me justly my friend' arthur laughed and accepted the club was named and the hour and some items of the little dinner the birds and the year of the wines it surprised him to meet mr redworth at the table of his host a greater surprise was the partial thaw in redworth's bearing toward him but as it was partial and he a youth and poor not even the genial influences of bacchus could lift him to loosen his tongue under the repressing presence of the man he knew to be his censor though sullivan smith encouraged him with praises and opportunities he thought of the many occasions when mrs warwick's art of management had produced a tacit harmony between them she had no peer the dinner failed of the pleasure he had expected from it redworth's bluntness killed the flying metaphors and at the end of the entertainment he and sullivan smith were drumming upon politics 'fancies he has the key of the irish difficulty' said the latter clapping hand on his shoulder by way of blessing as they parted at the club steps redworth asked arthur rhodes the way he was going and walked beside him 'i suppose you take exercise don't get colds and that kind of thing' he remarked in the old bullying fashion and changed it abruptly 'i am glad to have met you this evening i hope you'll dine with me one day next week have you seen mrs warwick lately' 'she is unwell she has been working too hard' said arthur 'seriously unwell do you mean' 'lady dunstane is at her house and speaks of her recovering' 'ah you've not seen her' 'not yet' 'well good night' redworth left him and only when moved by gratitude to the lad for his mention of mrs warwick's 'working too hard' as the cause of her illness recollected the promised dinner and the need for having his address he had met sullivan smith accidentally in the morning and accepted the invitation to meet young rhodes because these two of all men living were for the moment dearest to him as diana warwick's true and simple champions and he had intended a perfect cordiality toward them both the end being a semi wrangle with the patriot and a patronizing bluntness with the boy who by the way would hardly think him sincere in the offer of a seat at his table he owned himself incomplete he never could do the thing he meant in the small matters not leading to fortune but they led to happiness redworth was guilty of a sigh for now diana warwick stood free doubly free he was reduced to reflect in a wavering dubiousness her more than inclination for dacier witnessed by him and the shot of the world flying randomly on the subject had struck this cuirassier making light of his armour without causing any change of his habitual fresh countenance as for the scandal it had never shaken his faith in her nature he thought of the passion his heart struck at diana's and whatever might by chance be true in the scandal affected him little if but her heart were at liberty that was the prize he coveted having long read the nature of the woman and wedded his spirit to it she would complete him of course infatuated men argue likewise and scandal does not move them at a glance the lower instincts and the higher spirit appear equally to have the philosophy of overlooking blemishes the difference between appetite and love is shown when a man after years of service can hear and see and admit the possible and still desire in worship knowing that we of earth are begrimed and must be cleansed for presentation daily on our passage through the miry ways but that our souls if flame of a soul shall have come of the agony of flesh are beyond the baser mischances partaking of them indeed but sublimely now redworth believed in the soul of diana for him it burned and it was a celestial radiance about her unquenched by her shifting fortunes her wilfulnesses and it might be errors she was a woman and weak that is not trained for strength she was a soul therefore perpetually pointing to growth in purification he felt it and even discerned it of her if he could not have phrased it the something sovereignty characteristic that aspired in diana enchained him with her or rather with his thought of her soul he understood the right union of women and men from the roots to the flowering heights of that rare graft she gave him comprehension of the meaning of love a word in many mouths not often explained with her wound in his idea of her he perceived it to signify a new start in our existence a finer shoot of the tree stoutly planted in good gross earth the senses running their live sap and the minds companioned and the spirits made one by the whole natured conjunction in booth a happy prospect for the sons and daughters of earth divinely indicating more than happiness the speeding of us compact of what we are between the ascetic rocks and the sensual whirlpools to the creation of certain nobler races now very dimly imagined singularly enough the man of these feelings was far from being a social rebel his diana conjured them forth in relation to her but was not on his bosom to enlighten him generally his notions of citizenship tolerated the female pharisees as ladies offering us an excellent social concrete where quicksands abound and without quite justifying the lady wathins and constance aspers of the world whose virtues he could set down to accident or to acid blood he considered them supportable and estimable where the mrs fryar gunnetts were innumerable threatening to become a majority as they will constantly do while the sisterhood of the chaste are wattled in formalism and throned in sourness thoughts of diana made phantoms of the reputable and their reverse alike he could not choose but think of her she was free and he too and they were as distant as the horizon sail and the aft floating castaway her passion for dacier might have burnt out her heart and at present he had no claim to visit her dared not intrude he would have nothing to say if he went save to answer questions upon points of business as to which lady dunstane would certainly summon him when he was wanted riding in the park on a frosty morning he came upon sir lukin who looked gloomy and inquired for news of diana warwick saying that his wife had forbidden him to call at her house just yet 'she's got a cold you know' said sir lukin adding 'confoundedly hard on women eh obliged to keep up a show and i'd swear by all that's holy diana warwick hasn't a spot not a spot to reproach herself with i fancy i ought to know women by this time and look here redworth last night that is i mean yesterday evening i broke with a woman a lady of my acquaintance you know because she would go on scandal mongering about diana warwick i broke with her i told her i'd have out any man who abused diana warwick and i broke with her by jove redworth those women can prove spitfires they've bags of venom under their tongues barley sugar though they look and that's her colour but i broke with her for good i doubt if i shall ever call on her again and in point of fact i won't' mrs fryar gunnett was described in the colouring of the lady sir lukin after some further remarks rode on and redworth mused on a moral world that allows a woman of mrs fryar gunnett's like to hang on to it and to cast a stone at diana forgetful in his championship that diana was not disallowed a similar licence when he saw emma dunstane some days later she was in her carriage driving as she said to lawyerland for an interview with old mr braddock on her friend's affairs he took a seat beside her 'no tony is not well' she replied to his question under the veil of candour 'she is recovering but she you can understand suffered a shock she is not able to attend to business and certain things have to be done' 'i used to be her man of business' redworth observed 'she speaks of your kind services this is mere matter for lawyers' 'she is recovering' 'you may see her at copsley next week you can come down on wednesdays or saturdays' 'any day tell her i want her opinion upon the state of things' 'it will please her but you will have to describe the state of things' emma feared she had said too much she tried candour again for concealment 'my poor tony has been struck down low i suppose it is like losing a diseased limb she has her freedom at the cost of a blow to the system' 'she may be trusted for having strength' said redworth' 'yes' emma's mild monosyllable was presently followed by an exclamation 'one has to experience the irony of fate to comprehend how cruel it is' then she remembered that such language was peculiarly abhorrent to him 'irony of fate' he echoed her 'i thought you were above that literary jargon' 'and i thought i was or thought it would be put in a dialect practically explicable' she answered smiling at the lion roused 'upon my word' he burst out 'i should like to write a book of fables showing how donkeys get into grinding harness and dogs lose their bones and fools have their sconces cracked and all run jabbering of the irony of fate to escape the annoyance of tracing the causes and what are they nine times out of ten plain want of patience or some debt for indulgence there's a subject let some one write fables in illustration of the irony of fate and i'll undertake to tack on my grandmother's maxims for a moral to teach of 'em we prate of that irony when we slink away from the lesson the rod we conjure and you to talk of fate it's the seed we sow individually or collectively i'm bound up in the prosperity of the country and if the ship is wrecked it ruins my fortune but not me unless i'm bound up in myself at least i hope that's my case' he apologized for intruding mr thomas redworth his hearer looked at him thinking he required a more finely pointed gift of speech for the ironical tongue but relishing the tonic directness of his faculty of reason while she considered that the application of the phrase might be brought home to him so as to render 'my grandmother's moral' a conclusion less comfortingly if quite intelligibly summary and then she thought of tony's piteous instance and thinking with her heart the tears insisted on that bitter irony of the heavens which bestowed the long withheld and coveted boon when it was empty of value or was but as a handful of spices to a shroud perceiving the moisture in her look redworth understood that it was foolish to talk rationally but on her return to her beloved the real quality of the man had overcome her opposing state of sentiment and she spoke of him with an iteration and throb in the voice that set a singular query whirring round diana's ears her senses were too heavy for a suspicion chapter xxxviii convalescence of a healthy mind distraught from an abandonment that had the last pleasure of life in a willingness to yield it up diana rose with her friend's help in some state of fortitude resembling the effort of her feet to bear the weight of her body she plucked her courage out of the dust to which her heart had been scattered and tasked herself to walk as the world does but she was indisposed to compassionate herself in the manner of the burdened world she lashed the creature who could not raise a head like others and made the endurance of torture a support such as the pride of being is to men she would not have seen any similarity to pride in it would have deemed it the reverse it was in fact the painful gathering of the atoms composing pride for she had not only suffered she had done wrongly and when that was acknowledged by the light of her sufferings the wrong doing appeared gigantic chorussing eulogies of the man she had thought her lover and who was her lover once before the crime against him in the opening of her bosom to emma he was painted a noble figure one of those that romance delights to harass for the sake of ultimately the more exquisitely rewarding he hated treachery she had been guilty of doing what he most hated she glorified him for the incapacity to forgive it was to her mind godlike and her excuses of herself at the first confession she said she had none and sullenly maintained that there was none to exonerate little by little her story was related her version of the story for not even as woman to woman friend to great hearted friend pure soul to soul could diana tell of the state of shivering abjection in which dacier had left her on the fatal night of the many causes conducing to it and of the chief that was an unutterable secret bound by all the laws of feminine civilization not to be betrayed her excessive self abasement and exaltation of him who had struck her down rendered it difficult to be understood and not till emma had revolved it and let it ripen in the mind some days could she perceive with any clearness her tony's motives or mania the very word money thickened the riddle for tony knew that her friend's purse was her own to dip in at her pleasure yet she to escape so small an obligation had committed the enormity for which she held the man blameless in spurning her 'you see what i am emmy' diana said 'what i do not see is that he had grounds for striking so cruelly' 'i proved myself unworthy of him' but does a man pretending to love a woman cut at one blow for such a cause the ties uniting her to him unworthiness of that kind is not commonly the capital offence in love tony's deep prostration and her resplendent picture of her judge and executioner kept emma questioning within herself gradually she became enlightened enough to distinguish in the man a known if not common type of the externally soft and polished internally hard and relentless who are equal to the trials of love only as long as favouring circumstances and seemings nurse the fair object of their courtship her thoughts recurred to the madness driving tony to betray the secret and the ascent unhelped to get a survey of it and her and the conditions was mountainous she toiled up but to enter the regions of cloud sure nevertheless that the obscurity was penetrable and excuses to be discovered somewhere having never wanted money herself she was unable perfectly to realize the urgency of the need she began however to comprehend that the very eminent gentleman before whom all human creatures were to bow in humility had for an extended term considerably added to the expenses of tony's household by inciting her to give those little dinners to his political supporters and bringing comrades perpetually to supper parties careless of how it might affect her character and her purse surely an honourable man was bound to her in honour tony's remark 'i have the reptile in me dear' her exaggeration of the act in her resigned despair was surely no justification for his breaking from her even though he had discovered a vestige of the common 'reptile' to leave her with a stain on her name there would not have been a question about it if tony had not exalted him so loftily refusing in visible pain to hear him blamed danvers had dressed a bed for lady dunstane in her mistress's chamber where often during the night emma caught a sound of stifled weeping or the long falling breath of wakeful grief one night she asked whether tony would like to have her by her side 'no dear' was the answer in the dark 'but you know my old pensioners the blind fifer and his wife i've been thinking of them' 'they were paid as they passed down the street yesterday my love' 'yes dear i hope so but he flourishes his tune so absurdly i've been thinking that is the part i have played instead of doing the female's duty of handing round the tin cup for pennies i won't cry any more' she sighed and turned to sleep leaving emma to disburden her heart in tears for it seemed to her that tony's intellect was weakened she not merely abased herself and exalted dacier preposterously she had sunk her intelligence in her sensations a state that she used to decry as the sin of mankind the origin of error and blood strangely too the proposal came from her or the suggestion of it notwithstanding her subjectedness to the nerves that she should show her face in public she said 'i shall have to run about emmy when i can fancy i am able to rattle up to the old mark at present i feel like a wrestler who has had a fall as soon as the stiffness is over it's best to make an appearance for the sake of one's backers though i shall never be in the wrestling ring again' 'that is a good decision when you feel quite yourself dear tony' emma replied 'i dare say i have disgraced my sex but not as they suppose i feel my new self already and can make the poor brute go through fire on behalf of the old what is the task merely to drive a face' 'it is not known' 'it will be known' 'but this is a sealed secret' 'nothing is a secret that has been spoken it 's in the air and i have to breathe to live by it and i would rather it were out she betrayed him rather that than have them think anything they will exclaim how could she i have been unable to answer it to you my own heart how oh our weakness is the swiftest dog to hunt us we cannot escape it but i have the answer for them that i trust with my whole soul none of them would have done the like' 'none my tony would have taken it to the soul as you do' 'i talk dear if i took it honestly i should be dumb soon dust the moment we begin to speak the guilty creature is running for cover she could not otherwise exist i am sensible of evasion when i open my lips' 'but tony has told me all' 'i think i have but if you excuse my conduct i am certain i have not' 'dear girl accounting for it is not the same as excusing' 'who can account for it i was caught in a whirl oh nothing supernatural my weakness which it pleases me to call a madness shift the ninety ninth when i drove down that night to mr tonans i am certain i had my clear wits but i felt like a bolt i saw things but at too swift a rate for the conscience of them ah let never necessity draw the bow of our weakness it is the soul that is winged to its perdition i remember i was writing a story named the man of two minds i shall sign it by the woman of two natures if ever it is finished capacity for thinking should precede the act of writing it should i do not say that it does capacity for assimilating the public taste and reproducing it is the commonest the stuff is perishable but it pays us for our labour and in so doing saves us from becoming tricksters now i can see that mr redworth had it in that big head of his the authoress outliving her income' 'he dared not speak' 'why did he not dare' 'would it have checked you' 'i was a shot out of a gun and i am glad he did not stand in my way what power charged the gun is another question dada used to say that it is the devil's masterstroke to get us to accuse him so fare ye well old nickie ben my dear i am a black sheep a creature with a spotted reputation i must wash and wash and not with water with sulphur flames' she sighed 'i am down there where they burn you should have let me lie and die you were not kind i was going quietly' 'my love' cried emma overborne by a despair that she traced to the woman's concealment of her bleeding heart 'you live for me do set your mind on that think of what you are bearing as your debt to emma will you' tony bowed her head mechanically 'but i am in love with king death and must confess it' she said 'that hideous eating you forced on me snatched me from him and i feel that if i had gone i should have been mercifully forgiven by everybody' 'except by me' said emma embracing her 'tony would have left her friend for her last voyage in mourning and my dearest will live to know happiness' 'i have no more belief in it emmy' 'the mistake of the world is to think happiness possible to the senses' 'yes we distil that fine essence through the senses and the act is called the pain of life it is the death of them so much i understand of what our existence must be but i may grieve for having done so little' 'that is the sound grief with hope at the core not in love with itself and wretchedly mortal as we find self is under every shape it takes especially the chief one' 'name it' 'it is best named amor' there was a writhing in the frame of the hearer for she did want love to be respected not shadowed by her misfortune her still flushed senses protested on behalf of the eternalness of the passion and she was obliged to think emma's cold condemnatory intellect came of the no knowledge of it a letter from mr tonans containing an enclosure was a sharp trial of diana's endurance of the irony of fate she had spoken of the irony in allusion to her freedom now that according to a communication from her lawyers she was independent of the task of writing the letter which paid the price of her misery bruised her heavily 'read it and tear it all to strips' she said in an abhorrence to emma who rejoined 'shall i go at once and see him' 'can it serve any end but throw it into the fire oh no simulation of virtue there was not i think a stipulated return for what i did but i perceive clearly i can read only by events that there was an understanding you behold it i went to him to sell it he thanks me says i served the good cause well i have not that consolation if i had thought of the cause of anything high it would have arrested me on the fire with it' the letter and square slip were consumed diana watched the blackening papers so they cease their sinning emmy and as long as i am in torment i may hope for grace we talked of the irony it means the pain of fire' 'i spoke of the irony to redworth' said emma 'incidentally of course' 'and he fumed' 'he is really not altogether the mr cuthbert dering of your caricature he is never less than acceptably rational i won't repeat his truisms but he said or i deduced from what he said that a grandmother's maxims would expound the enigma' 'probably the simple is the deep in relation to the mysteries of life' said diana whose wits had been pricked to a momentary activity by the letter 'he behaves wisely so perhaps we are bound to take his words for wisdom much nonsense is talked and written and he is one of the world's reserves who need no more than enrolling to make a sturdy phalanx of common sense it's a pity they are not enlisted and drilled to express themselves' she relapsed 'but neither he nor any of them could understand my case' 'he puts the idea of an irony down to the guilt of impatience tony' 'could there be a keener irony than that a friend of dada's waited patiently for a small fortune and when it arrived he was a worn out man just assisted to go decently to his grave' 'but he may have gained in spirit by his patient waiting' 'oh true we are warmer if we travel on foot sunward but it is a discovery that we are colder if we take to ballooning upward the material good reverses its benefits the more nearly we clasp it all life is a lesson that we live to enjoy but in the spirit i will brood on your saying' 'it is your own saying silly tony as the only things worth saying always are' exclaimed emma as she smiled happily to see her friend's mind reviving though it was faintly and in the dark chapter xxxix of nature with one of her cultivated daughters and a short excursion in anti climax a mind that after a long season of oblivion in pain returns to wakefulness without a keen edge for the world is much in danger of souring permanently diana's love of nature saved her from the dire mischance during a two months' residence at copsley by stupefying her senses to a state like the barely conscious breathing on the verge of sleep february blew south west for the pairing of the birds a broad warm wind rolled clouds of every ambiguity of form in magnitude over peeping azure or skimming upon lakes of blue and lightest green or piling the amphitheatre for majestic sunset or sometimes those daughters of the wind flew linked and low semi purple threatening the shower they retained and teaching gloom to rouse a songful nest in the bosom of the viewer sometimes they were april variable to soar with rain skirts and sink with sunshafts or they drenched wood and field for a day and opened on the high south western star daughters of the wind but shifty daughters of this wind of the dropping sun they have to be watched to be loved in their transformations diana had arthur rhodes and her faithful leander for walking companions if arthur said 'such a day would be considered melancholy by london people' she thanked him in her heart as a benefactor who had revealed to her things of the deepest the simplest were her food thus does nature restore us by drugging the brain and making her creature confidingly animal for its new growth she imagined herself to have lost the power to think certainly she had not the striving or the wish exercise of her limbs to reach a point of prospect and of her ears and eyes to note what bird had piped what flower was out on the banks and the leaf of what tree it was that lay beneath the budding satiated her daily desires she gathered unknowingly a sheaf of landscapes images keys of dreamed horizons that opened a world to her at any chance breath altering shape or hue a different world from the one of her old ambition her fall had brought her renovatingly to earth and the saving naturalness of the woman recreated her childlike with shrouded recollections of her strange taste of life behind her with a tempered fresh blood to enjoy aimlessly and what would erewhile have been a barrenness to her sensibilities in time the craving was evolved for positive knowledge and shells and stones and weeds were deposited on the library table at copsley botanical and geological books comparingly examined emma dunstane always eager to assist for the samples wafted her into the heart of the woods poor sir lukin tried three days of their society and was driven away headlong to club life he sent down redworth with whom the walks of the zealous inquirers were profitable though diana in acknowledging it to herself reserved a decided preference for her foregone ethereal mood larger and untroubled by the presence of a man the suspicion emma had sown was not excited to an alarming activity but she began to question could the best of men be simply a woman's friend was not long service rather less than a proof of friendship she could be blind when her heart was on fire for another her passion for her liberty however received no ominous warning to look to the defences he was the same blunt speaker and knotted his brows as queerly as ever at arthur in a transparent calculation of how this fellow meant to gain his livelihood she wilfully put it to the credit of arthur's tact that his elder was amiable without denying her debt to the good man for leaving her illness and her appearance unmentioned he forbore even to scan her features diana's wan contemplativeness in which the sparkle of meaning slowly rose to flash as we see a bubble rising from the deeps of crystal waters caught at his heart while he talked his matter of fact but her instinct of a present safety was true she and arthur discovered and it set her first meditating whether she did know the man so very accurately that he had printed for private circulation when at harrow school a little book a record of his observations in nature lady dunstane was the casual betrayer he shrugged at the nonsense of a boy's publishing anybody's publishing he held for a doubtful proof of sanity his excuse was that he had not published opinions let us observe and assist in our small sphere not come mouthing to the footlights 'we retire' diana said for herself and arthur 'the wise thing is to avoid the position that enforces publishing' said he to the discomposure of his raw junior in the fields he was genially helpful commending them to the study of the south west wind if they wanted to forecast the weather and understand the climate of our country 'we have no seasons or only a shuffle of them old calendars give seven months of the year to the southwest and that's about the average count on it you may generally reckon what to expect when you don't have the excess for a year or two you are drenched the year following' he knew every bird by its flight and its pipe habits tricks hints of sagacity homely with the original human and his remarks on the sensitive life of trees and herbs were a spell to his thirsty hearers something of astronomy he knew but in relation to that science he sank his voice touchingly to diana who felt drawn to kinship with him when he had a pupil's tone an allusion by arthur to the poetical work of aratus led to a memorably pleasant evening's discourse upon the long reading of the stars by these our mortal eyes altogether the mind of the practical man became distinguishable to them as that of a plain brother of the poetic diana said of him to arthur 'he does not supply me with similes he points to the source of them' arthur with envy of the man of positive knowledge disguised an unstrung heart in agreeing redworth alluded passingly to the condition of public affairs neither of them replied diana was wondering how one who perused the eternal of nature should lend a thought to the dusty temporary of the world subsequently she reflected that she was asking him to confine his great male appetite to the nibble of bread which nourished her immediate sense of life her reflections were thin as mist coming and going like the mist with no direction upon her brain if they sprang from it when he had gone welcome though arthur had seen him to be she rebounded to a broader and cheerfuller liveliness arthur was flattered by an idea of her casting off incubus a most worthy gentleman and a not perfectly sympathetic associate her eyes had their lost light in them her step was brisker she challenged him to former games of conversation excursions in blank verse here and there as the mood dictated they amused themselves and emma too she revelled in seeing tony's younger face and hearing some of her natural outbursts that dacier never could have been the man for her would have compressed and subjected her and inflicted a further taste of bondage in marriage she was assured she hoped for the day when tony would know it and haply that another whom she little comprehended was her rightful mate march continued south westerly and grew rainier as redworth had foretold bidding them look for gales and storm and then the change of wind it came after wettings of a couple scorning the refuge of dainty townsfolk under umbrellas and proud of their likeness to dripping wayside wildflowers arthur stayed at copsley for a week of the crisp north easter and what was it when he had taken his leave that brought tony home from her solitary walk in dejection it could not be her seriously regretting the absence of the youthful companion she had parted with gaily appointing a time for another meeting on the heights and recommending him to repair idle hours with strenuous work the fit passed and was not explained the winds are sharp with memory the hard shrill wind crowed to her senses of an hour on the bleak sands of the french coast the beginning of the curtained misery inscribed as her happiness she was next day prepared for her term in london with emma who promised her to make an expedition at the end of it by way of holiday to see the crossways which mr redworth said was not tenanted 'you won't go through it like a captive' said emma 'i don't like it dear' diana put up a comic mouth 'the debts we owe ourselves are the hardest to pay that is the discovery of advancing age and i used to imagine it was quite the other way but they are the debts of honour imperative i shall go through it grandly you will see if i am stopped at my first recreancy and turned directly the contrary way i think i have courage' 'you will not fear to meet any one' said emma 'the world and all it contains i am robust eager for the fray an amazon a brazen faced hussy fear and i have parted i shall not do you discredit besides you intend to have me back here with you and besides again i burn to make a last brave appearance i have not outraged the world dear emmy whatever certain creatures in it may fancy' she had come out of her dejectedness with a shrewder view of dacier equally painful for it killed her romance and changed the garden of their companionship in imagination to a waste her clearing intellect prompted it whilst her nature protested and reviled her to uplift him he had loved her 'i shall die knowing that a man did love me once' she said to her widowed heart and set herself blushing and blanching but the thought grew inveterate 'he could not bear much' and in her quick brain it shot up a crop of similitudes for the quality of that man's love she shuddered as at a swift cleaving of cold steel he had not given her a chance he had not replied to her letter written with the pen dipped in her heart's blood he must have gone straight away to the woman he married this after almost justifying the scandalous world after she realized her sensations of that night when the house door had closed on him her feeling of lost sovereignty degradation feminine danger friendliness and she was unaware and never knew nor did the world ever know what cunning had inspired the frosty cupid to return to her and be warmed by striking a bargain for his weighty secret she knew too well that she was not of the snows which do not melt however high her conceit of herself might place her happily she now stood out of the sun in a bracing temperature polar and her compassion for women was deeply sisterly in tenderness and understanding she spoke of it to emma as her gain 'i have not seen that you required to suffer to be considerate' emma said 'it is on my conscience that i neglected mary paynham among others and because you did not take to her emmy' 'the reading of it appears to me that she has neglected you' 'she was not in my confidence and so i construe it as delicacy one never loses by believing the best' 'if one is not duped' 'expectations dupe us not trust the light of every soul burns upward of course most of them are candles in the wind let us allow for atmospheric disturbance now i thank you dear for bringing me back to life i see that i was really a selfish suicide because i feel i have power to do some good and belong to the army when we are beginning to reflect as i do now on a recovered basis of pure health we have the world at the dawn and know we are young in it with great riches great things gained and greater to achieve personally i behold a queer little wriggling worm for myself but as one of the active world i stand high and shapely and the very thought of doing work is like a draught of the desert springs to me instead of which i have once more to go about presenting my face to vindicate my character mr redworth would admit no irony in that at all events it is anti climax' 'i forgot to tell you tony you have been proposed for' said emma and there was a rush of savage colour over tony's cheeks her apparent apprehensions were relieved by hearing the name of mr sullivan smith 'my poor dear countryman and he thought me worthy did he some day when we are past his repeating it i'll thank him' the fact of her smiling happily at the narration of sullivan smith's absurd proposal by mediatrix proved to emma how much her nature thirsted for the smallest support in her self esteem the second campaign of london was of bad augury at the commencement owing to the ridiculous intervention of a street organ that ground its pipes in a sprawling roar of one of the puritani marches just as the carriage was landing them at the door of her house the notes were harsh dissonant drunken interlocked and horribly torn asunder intolerable to ears not keen to extract the tune through dreadful memories diana sat startled and paralyzed the melody crashed a revival of her days with dacier as in gibes and yet it reached to her heart she imagined a providence that was trying her on the threshold striking at her feebleness she had to lock herself in her room for an hour of deadly abandonment to misery resembling the run of poison through her blood before she could bear to lift eyes on her friend to whom subsequently she said 'emmy there are wounds that cut sharp as the enchanter's sword and we don't know we are in halves till some rough old intimate claps us on the back merely to ask us how we are i have to join myself together again as well as i can it's done dear but don't notice the cement' 'you will be brave' emma petitioned 'i long to show you i will' the meeting with those who could guess a portion of her story did not disconcert her to lady pennon and lady singleby she was the brilliant diana of her nominal luminary issuing from cloud face and tongue she was the same and once in the stream she soon gathered its current topics and scattered her arrowy phrases lady pennon ran about with them declaring that the beautiful speaker if ever down was up and up to her finest mark mrs fryar gannett had then become the blazing regnant antisocial star a distresser of domesticity the magnetic attraction in the spirituous flames of that wild snapdragon bowl called the upper class and she was angelically blonde a straw coloured beauty 'a lovely wheat sheaf if the head were ripe' diana said of her 'threshed says her fame my dear' lady pennon replied otherwise allusive 'a wheatsheaf of contention for the bread of wind' said diana thinking of foolish sir lukin thoughtless of talking to a gossip she would have shot a lighter dart had she meant it to fly and fix proclaim ye classics what minor goddess or primal iris or ate sped straight away on wing to the empty wheatsheaf ears of the golden visaged amabel fryar gunnett daughter of demeter in the field to behold of aphrodite in her rosy incendiarism for the many of men filling that pearly concave with a perversion of the uttered speech such as never lady could have repeated nor man if less than a reaping harvester which verily for women to hear is to stamp a substantial damnatory verification upon the delivery of the saying 'mrs warwick says of you that you're a bundle of straws for everybody and bread for nobody' or stranger speculation through what and what number of conduits curious and variously colouring did it reach the fair amabel of the infant in cradle smile in that deformation of the original utterance to pursue the thing would be to enter the subter sensual perfumed caverns of a romance of fashionable life with no hope of coming back to light other than by tail of lynx like the great arabian seaman at the last page of the final chapter a prospectively popular narrative indeed and coin to reward it and applause but i am reminded that a story properly closed on the marriage of the heroine constance and her young minister of state has no time for conjuring chemists' bouquet of aristocracy to lure the native taste when we have satisfied english sentiment our task is done in every branch of art i hear and it will account to posterity for the condition of the branches those yet wakeful eccentrics interested in such a person as diana to the extent of remaining attentive till the curtain falls demand of me to gather up the threads concerning her which my gardener sweeping his pile of dead leaves before the storm and night advises me to do speedily but it happens that her resemblance to her sex and species of a civilized period plants the main threads in her bosom rogues and a policeman or a hurried change of front of all the actors are not a part of our slow machinery nor is she to show herself to advantage only those who read her woman's blood and character with the head will care for diana of the crossways now that the knot of her history has been unravelled some little love they must have for her likewise and how it can be quickened on behalf of a woman who never sentimentalizes publicly and has no dolly dolly compliance and muses on actual life and fatigues with the exercise of brains and is in sooth an alien a princess of her kind and time but a foreign one speaking a language distinct from the mercantile trafficking in ideas this is the problem for to be true to her one cannot attempt at propitiation she said worse things of the world than that which was conveyed to the boxed ears of mrs fryar gunnett accepting the war declared against her a second time she performed the common mental trick in adversity of setting her personally known innocence to lessen her generally unknown error but anticipating that this might become known and the other not and feeling that the motives of the acknowledged error had served to guard her from being the culprit of the charge she writhed under she rushed out of a meditation compounded of mind and nerves with derision of the world's notion of innocence and estimate of error it was a mood lasting through her stay in london and longer to the discomfort of one among her friends and it was worthy of the anti climax expedition as she called it for the rest her demeanour to the old monster world exacting the servility of her in repayment for its tolerating countenance was faultless emma beheld the introduction to mrs warwick of his bride by mr percy dacier she had watched their approach up the ball room thinking how differently would redworth and tony have looked differently had it been tony and dacier but emma could not persuade herself of a possible harmony between them save at the cost of tony's expiation of the sin of the greater heart in a performance equivalent to suttee perfectly an english gentleman of the higher order he seemed the effigy of a tombstone one fixed upright and civilly proud of his effigy bride so far emma considered them fitted she perceived his quick eye on her corner of the room necessarily for a man of his breeding without a change of expression an emblem pertaining to her creed was on the heroine's neck also dependant at her waist she was white from head to foot a symbol of purity her frail smile appeared deeply studied in purity judging from her look and her reputation emma divined that the man was justly mated with a devious filmy sentimentalist likely to 'fiddle harmonics on the sensual strings' for him at a mad rate in the years to come such fiddling is indeed the peculiar diversion of the opulent of a fatly prosperous people who take it one may concede to them for an inspired elimination of the higher notes of life the very highest that saying of tony's ripened with full significance to emma now not sensualism but sham spiritualism was the meaning and however fine the notes they come skilfully evoked of the under brute in us reasoning it so she thought it a saying for the penetration of the most polished and deceptive of the later human masks she had besides be it owned a triumph in conjuring a sentence of her friend's like a sword's edge to meet them for she was boiling angrily at the ironical destiny which had given to those two a beclouding of her beloved whom she could have rebuked in turn for her insane caprice of passion but when her beloved stood up to greet mrs percy dacier all idea save tremulous admiration of the valiant woman who had been wounded nigh to death passed from emma's mind diana tempered her queenliness to address the favoured lady with smiles and phrases of gentle warmth of goodness of nature and it became a halo rather than a personal eclipse that she cast emma looked at dacier he wore the prescribed conventional air subject in half a minute to a rapid blinking of the eyelids his wife could have been inimically imagined fascinated and dwindling a spot of colour came to her cheeks she likewise began to blink the happy couple bowed proceeding and emma had dacier's back for a study we score on that flat slate of man unattractive as it is to hostile observations and unprotected the device we choose her harshest was the positive thought that he had taken the woman best suited to him doubtless he was a man to prize the altar candle above the lamp of day she fancied the back view of him shrunken and straitened perhaps a mere hostile fancy though it was conceivable that he should desire as little of these meetings as possible eclipses are not courted the specially womanly exultation of emma dunstane in her friend's noble attitude seeing how their sex had been struck to the dust for a trifling error easily to be overlooked by a manful lover and had asserted its dignity in physical and moral splendour in self mastery and benignness was unshared by diana as soon as the business of the expedition was over her orders were issued for the sale of the lease of her house and all it contained 'i would sell danvers too' she said 'but the creature declines to be treated as merchandize it seems i have a faithful servant very much like my life not quite to my taste the one thing out of the wreck with my dog' before quitting her house for the return to copsley she had to grant mr alexander hepburn post haste from his caledonia a private interview she came out of it noticeably shattered nothing was related to emma beyond the remark 'i never knew till this morning the force of no in earnest' the weighty little word woman's native watchdog and guardian if she calls it to her aid in earnest had encountered and withstood a fiery ancient host astonished at its novel power of resistance emma contented herself with the result 'were you much supplicated' 'an operatic fourth act' said diana by no means feeling so flippantly as she spoke she received while under the impression of this man's honest if primitive ardour of courtship or effort to capture a characteristic letter from westlake choicely phrased containing presumeably an application for her hand in the generous offer of his own her reply to a pursuer of that sort was easy comedy after the barbaric attack refreshed her wits and reliance on her natural fencing weapons to westlake the unwritten no was conveyed in a series of kindly ironic subterfuges that played it like an impish flea across the pages just giving the bloom of the word and rich smiles come to emma's life in reading the dexterous composition which however proved so thoroughly to westlake's taste that a second and a third exercise in the comedy of the negative had to be despatched to him from copsley chapter xl in which we see nature making of a woman a maid again and a thrice whimsical on their way from london after leaving the station the drive through the valley led them past a field where cricketers were at work bowling and batting under a vertical sun not a very comprehensible sight to ladies whose practical tendencies as observers of the other sex incline them to question the gain of such an expenditure of energy the dispersal of the alphabet over a printed page is not less perplexing to the illiterate as soon as emma dunstane discovered the copsley head gamekeeper at one wicket and actually thomas redworth facing him bat in hand she sat up greatly interested sir lukin stopped the carriage at the gate and reminded his wife that it was the day of the year for the men of his estate to encounter a valley eleven redworth like the good fellow he was had come down by appointment in the morning out of london to fill the number required copsley being weak this year eight of their wickets had fallen for a lament able figure of twenty nine runs himself clean bowled the first ball but tom redworth had got fast hold of his wicket and already scored fifty to his bat 'there grand hit' sir lukin cried the ball flying hard at the rails 'once a cricketer always a cricketer if you've legs to fetch the runs and pullen's not doing badly his business is to stick we shall mark them a hundred yet i do hate a score on our side without the two 's' he accounted for redworth's mixed colours by telling the ladies he had lent him his flannel jacket which against black trousers looked odd but not ill gradually the enthusiasm of the booth and bystanders converted the flying of a leather ball into a subject of honourable excitement 'and why are you doing nothing' sir lukin was asked and he explained 'my stumps are down i'm married' he took his wife's hand prettily diana had a malicious prompting she smothered the wasp and said 'oh look at that' 'grand hit again oh good good' cried sir lukin clapping to it while the long hit off ran spinning his legs into one for an impossible catch and the batsmen were running and stretching bats and the ball flying away flying back and others after it and still the batsmen running till it seemed that the ball had escaped control and was leading the fielders on a coltish innings of its own defiant of bowlers diana said merrily 'bravo our side' 'bravo old tom redworth' rejoined sir lukin 'four and a three and capital weather haven't we hope we shall have same sort day next month return match my ground i've seen tom redworth score old days over two hundred t' his bat and he used to bowl too but bowling wants practice and emmy look at the old fellows lining the booth pipe in mouth and cheering they do enjoy a day like this we'll have a supper for fifty at copsley's it's fun by jove we must have reached up to near the hundred' he commissioned a neighbouring boy to hie to the booth for the latest figures and his emissary taught lightning a lesson diana praised the little fellow 'yes he's a real english boy' said emma 'we 've thousands of 'em thousands ready to your hand' exclaimed sir lukin 'and a confounded radicalized country' he murmured gloomily of 'lets us be kicked any amount of insult meek as gruel making of the finest army the world has ever seen you saw the papers this morning good heaven how a nation with an atom of self respect can go on standing that sort of bullying from foreigners we do we're insulted and we're threatened and we call for a hymn now then my man what is it' the boy had flown back 'ninety two marked sir ninety nine runs one more for the hundred' 'well reckoned and mind you're up at copsley for the return match and tom redworth says they may bite their thumbs to the bone they don't hurt us i tell him he has no sense of national pride he says we're not prepared for war we never are and whose the fault says we're a peaceful people but 'ware who touches us he doesn't feel a kick oh clever snick hurrah for the hundred two three no don't force the running you fools though they 're wild with the ball ha no all right' the wicket stood hurrah the heat of the noonday sun compelled the ladies to drive on 'enthusiasm has the privilege of not knowing monotony' said emma 'he looks well in flannels' 'yes he does' diana replied aware of the reddening despite her having spoken so simply 'i think the chief advantage men have over us is in their amusements' 'their recreations' 'that is the better word' diana fanned her cheeks and said she was warm 'i mean the permanent advantage for you see that age does not affect them' 'tom redworth is not a patriarch my dear' 'well he is what would be called mature' 'he can't be more than thirty two or three and that for a man of his constitution means youth' 'well i can imagine him a patriarch playing cricket' 'i should imagine you imagine the possible chances he is the father who would play with his boys' 'and lock up his girls in the nursery' diana murmured of the extraordinary heat emma begged her to remember her heterodox views of the education for girls 'he bats admirably' said diana 'i wish i could bat half as well' 'your batting is with the tongue' 'not so good and a solid bat or bludgeon to defend the poor stumps is surer but there is the difference of cricket when your stumps are down you are idle at leisure not a miserable prisoner' 'supposing all marriages miserable' 'to the mind of me' said diana and observed emma's rather saddened eyelids for a proof that schemes to rob her of dear liberty were certainly planned they conversed of expeditions to redworth's berkshire mansion and to the crossways untenanted at the moment as he had informed emma who fancied it would please tony to pass a night in the house she loved but as he was to be of the party she coldly acquiesced the woman of flesh refuses pliancy when we want it of her and will not until it is her good pleasure be bent to the development called a climax as the puppet woman mother of fiction and darling of the multitude ever amiably does at a hint of the nuptial chapter diana in addition sustained the weight of brains neither with waxen optics nor with subservient jointings did she go through her pathways of the world her direct individuality rejected the performance of simpleton and her lively blood the warmer for its containment quickened her to penetrate things and natures and if as yet in justness to the loyal male friend she forbore to name him conspirator she read both him and emma whose inner bosom was revealed to her without an effort to see but her characteristic chasteness of mind not coldness of the 'blood which had supported an arduous conflict past all existing rights closely to depict and which barbed her to pierce to the wishes threatening her freedom deceived her now to think her flaming blushes came of her relentless divination on behalf of her recovered treasure whereby the clear reading of others distracted the view of herself for one may be the cleverest alive and still hoodwinked while blood is young and warm the perpetuity of the contrast presented to her reflections of redworth's healthy open practical cheering life and her own freakishly interwinding darkly penetrative simulacrum of a life cheerless as well as useless forced her humiliated consciousness by degrees in spite of pride to the knowledge that she was engaged in a struggle with him and that he was the stronger it might be the worthier she thought him the handsomer he throve to the light of day and she spun a silly web that meshed her in her intricacies her intuition of emma's wishes led to this he was constantly before her she tried to laugh at the image of the concrete cricketer half flannelled and red of face the 'lucky calculator' as she named him to emma who shook her head and sighed the abstract healthful and powerful man able to play besides profitably working defied those poor efforts consequently at once she sent up a bubble to the skies where it became a spheral realm of far too fine an atmosphere for men to breathe in it and thither she transported herself at will whenever the contrast with its accompanying menace of a tyrannic subjugation overshadowed her in the above the kingdom composed of her shattered romance of life and her present aspirings she was free and safe nothing touched her there nothing that redworth did she could not have admitted there her ideal of a hero it was the sublimation of a virgin's conception of life better fortified against the enemy she peopled it with souls of the great and pure gave it illimitable horizons dreamy nooks ravishing landscapes melodies of the poets of music higher and more celestial than the salvatore it was likewise now she could assure herself serenely independent of the horrid blood emotions living up there she had not a feeling the natural result of this habit of ascending to a superlunary home was the loss of an exact sense of how she was behaving below at the berkshire mansion she wore a supercilious air almost as icy as she accused the place of being emma knew she must have seen in the library a row of her literary ventures exquisitely bound but there was no allusion to the books mary paynham's portrait of mrs warwick hung staring over the fireplace and was criticized as though its occupancy of that position had no significance 'he thinks she has a streak of genius' diana said to emma 'it may be shown in time' emma replied for a comment on the work 'he should know for the spanish pictures are noble acquisitions' 'they are doubtless good investments' he had been foolish enough to say in diana's hearing that he considered the purchase of the berkshire estate a good investment it had not yet a name she suggested various titles for emma to propose 'the funds' or 'capital towers' or 'dividend manor' or 'railholm' blind to the evidence of inflicting pain emma from what she had guess concerning the purchaser of the crossways apprehended a discovery there which might make tony's treatment of him unkinder seeing that she appeared actuated contrariously and only her invalid's new happiness in the small excursions she was capable of taking to a definite spot of some homely attractiveness moved her to follow her own proposal for the journey diana pleaded urgently childishly in tone to have arthur rhodes with them 'so as to be sure of a sympathetic companion for a walk on the downs' at the crossways they were soon aware that mr redworth's domestics were in attendance to serve them manifestly the house was his property and not much of an investment the principal bed room her father's once and her own devoted now to emma's use appalled her with a resemblance to her london room she had noticed some of her furniture at 'dividend manor' and chosen to consider it in the light of a bargain from a purchase at the sale of her goods here was her bed her writing table her chair of authorship desks books ornaments water colour sketches and the drawing room was fitted with her brackets and etageres holding every knickknack she had possessed and scattered small bronzes antiques ivory junks quaint ivory figures chinese and japanese bits of porcelain silver incense urns dozens of dainty sundries she had a shamed curiosity to spy for an omission of one of them all were there the crossways had been turned into a trap her reply to this blunt wooing conspired she felt justifled in thinking between him and emma was emphatic in muteness she treated it as if unobserved at night in bed the scene of his mission from emma to her under this roof barred her customary ascent to her planetary kingdom next day she took arthur after breakfast for a walk on the downs and remained absent till ten minutes before the hour of dinner as to that young gentleman he was near to being caressed in public arthur's opinions his good sayings were quoted his excellent companionship on really poetical walks and perfect sympathy praised to his face challenged by her initiative to a kind of language that threw redworth out he declaimed 'we pace with some who make young morning stale' 'oh stale as peel of fruit long since consumed' she chimed and go they proceeded and they laughed emma smiled a little redworth did the same beneath one of his questioning frowns a sort of fatherly grimace a suspicion that this man when infatuated was able to practise the absurdest benevolence the burlesque of chivalry as a man admiring sex esteems it stirred very naughty depths of the woman in diana labouring under her perverted mood she put him to proof for the chance of arming her wickedest to despise him arthur was petted consulted cited flattered all round all but caressed she played with a reserve the maturish young woman smitten by an adorable youth and enjoyed doing it because she hoped for a visible effect more paternal benevolence and could do it so dispassionately coquettry emma thought was most unworthily shown and it was of the worst description innocent of conspiracy she had seen the array of tony's lost household treasures she wondered at a heartlessness that would not even utter common thanks to the friendly man for the compliment of prizing her portrait and the things she had owned and there seemed an effort to wound him the invalided woman charitable with allowances for her erratic husband could offer none for the woman of a long widowhood that had become a trebly sensitive maidenhood abashed by her knowledge of the world animated by her abounding blood cherishing her new freedom dreading the menacer feeling that though she held the citadel she was daily less sure of its foundations and that her hope of some last romance in life was going for in him shone not a glimpse he appeared to diana as a fatal power attracting her without sympathy benevolently overcoming one of those good men strong men who subdue and do not kindle the enthralment revolted a nature capable of accepting subjection only by burning in return for his moral excellence she gave him the moral sentiments esteem gratitude abstract admiration perfect faith but the man she could not now say she had never been loved and a flood of tenderness rose in her bosom swelling from springs that she had previously reproved with a desperate severity the unhappy unsatisfied yearning to be more than loved to love it was alive out of the wreck of its first trial this the secret of her natural frailty was bitter to her pride chastely minded as she was it whelmed her and then her comic imagination pictured redworth dramatically making love and to a widow it proved him to be senseless of romance poetic men take aim at maidens his devotedness to a widow was charged against him by the widow's shudder at antecedents distasteful to her soul a discolouration of her life she wished to look entirely forward as upon a world washed clear of night not to be cast back on her antecedents by practical wooings or words of love to live spiritually free of the shower at her eyelids attendant on any idea of her loving the woman who talked of the sentimentalist's 'fiddling harmonics' herself stressed the material chords in her attempt to escape out of herself and away from her pursuer meanwhile she was as little conscious of what she was doing as of how she appeared arthur went about with the moony air of surcharged sweetness and a speculation on it alternately tiptoe and prostrate more of her intoxicating wine was administered to him in utter thoughtlessness of consequences to one who was but a boy and a friend almost of her own rearing she told emma when leaving the crossways that she had no desire to look on the place again she wondered at mr redworth's liking such a solitude in truth the look back on it let her perceive that her husband haunted it and disfigured the man of real generosity as her heart confessed but whom she accused of a lack of prescient delicacy for not knowing she would and must be haunted there blaming him her fountain of colour shot up at a murmur of her unjustness and the poor man's hopes a week later the youth she publicly named 'her arthur' came down to copsley with news of his having been recommended by mr redworth for the post of secretary to an old whig nobleman famous for his patronage of men of letters and besides he expected to inherit he said and gazed in a way to sharpen her instincts the wine he had drunk of late from her flowing vintage was in his eyes they were on their usual rambles out along the heights 'accept by all means and thank mr redworth' said she speeding her tongue to intercept him 'literature is a good stick and a bad horse indeed i ought to know you can always write i hope you will' she stepped fast hearing 'mrs warwick diana may i take your hand' this was her pretty piece of work 'why should you if you speak my christian name no you forfeit any pretext and pray don't loiter we are going at the pace of the firm of potter and dawdle and you know they never got their shutters down till it was time to put them up again' nimble footed as she was she pressed ahead too fleetly for amorous eloquence to have a chance she heard 'diana' twice through the rattling of her discourse and flapping of her dress 'christian names are coin that seem to have an indifferent valuation of the property they claim' she said in the copsley garden 'and as for hands at meeting and parting here is the friendliest you could have only don't look rueful my dear arthur spare me that or i shall blame myself horribly' his chance had gone and he composed his face no hope in speaking had nerved him merely the passion to speak diana understood the state and pitied the naturally modest young fellow and chafed at herself as a senseless incendiary who did mischief right and left from seeking to shun the apparently inevitable a sidethought intruded that he would have done his wooing poetically not in the burly storm or bull saxon she apprehended supposing it imperative with her to choose she looked up and the bird of broader wing darkened the whole sky bidding her know that she had no choice emma was requested to make mr redworth acquainted with her story all of it 'so that this exalted friendship of his may be shaken to a common level he has an unbearably high estimate of me and it hurts me tell him all and more than even you have known but for his coming to me on the eve of your passing under the surgeon's hands i should have gone flung the world my glove a matter of minutes ten minutes later the train was to start for france at eight and i was awaited i have to thank heaven that the man was one of those who can strike icily tell mr redworth what i say you two converse upon every subject one may be too loftily respected in my case by and by for he is a tolerant reader of life and women i think we shall be humdrum friends of the lasting order' emma's cheeks were as red as diana's 'i fancy tom redworth has not much to learn concerning any person he cares for' she said 'you like him i have lost touch of you my dear and ask' 'i like him that i can say he is everything i am not but now i am free the sense of being undeservedly over esteemed imposes fetters and i don't like them i have been called a beauty rightly or other i have had a beauty's career and a curious caged beast's life i have found it will you promise me to speak to him and also thank him for helping arthur rhodes to a situation' at this the tears fell from her and so enigmatical had she grown to emma that her bosom friend took them for a confessed attachment to the youth diana's wretched emotion shamed her from putting any inquiries whether redworth had been told he came repeatedly and showed no change of face always continuing in the form of huge hovering griffin until an idea instead of the monster bird struck her might she not after all be cowering under imagination the very maidenly idea wakened her womanliness to reproach her remainder of pride not to see more accurately it was the reason why she resolved against emma's extreme entreaties to take lodgings in the south valley below the heights where she could be independent of fancies and perpetual visitors but near her beloved at any summons of urgency which emma would not habitually send because of the coming of a particular gentleman dresses were left at copsley for dining and sleeping there upon occasion and poor danvers despairing over the riddle of her mistress was condemned to the melancholy descent 'it's my belief' she confided to lady dunstane's maid bartlett 'she'll hate men all her life after that mr dacier' if women were deceived and the riddle deceived herself there is excuse for a plain man like redworth in not having the slightest clue to the daily shifting feminine maze he beheld the strange thing was that during her maiden time she had never been shifty or flighty invariably limpid and direct chapter xli contains a revelation of the origin of the tigress in diana an afternoon of high summer blazed over london through the city's awning of smoke and the three classes of the population relaxed by the weariful engagement with what to them was a fruitless heat were severally bathing their ideas in dreams of the contrast possible to embrace breezy seas or moors aerial alps cool beer the latter if confessedly the lower comfort is the readier at command and thomas redworth whose perspiring frame was directing his inward vision to fly for solace to a trim new yacht built on his lines beckoning from southampton water had some of the amusement proper to things plucked off the levels in the conversation of a couple of journeymen close ahead of him as he made his way from a quiet street of brokers' offices to a city bank one asked the other if he had ever tried any of that cold stuff they were now selling out of barrows with cream his companion answered that he had not got much opinion of stuff of the sort and what was it like 'well it's cheap it ain't bad it's cooling but it ain't refreshing' 'just what i reckoned all that newfangle rubbish' without a consultation the conservatives in beverage filed with a smart turn about

quid rabidae tradis ovile lupae says one of the multitude we may be seeing fangs of wolves where fleeces waxed the state that makes it a vital principle to concern itself with the helpless poor meets instead of waiting for democracy which is a perilous flood but when it is dammed or else in course of time luxurious yachting my friend will encounter other reefs and breakers than briny ocean's capital whereat diana warwick aimed her superbest sneer has its instant duties she theorized on the side of poverty and might do so he had no right to be theorizing on the side of riches across st george's channel the cry for humanity in capital was an agony he ought to be there doing not cogitating the post of irish secretary must be won by real service founded on absolute local knowledge yes and sympathy if you like but sympathy is for proving not prating these were the meditations of a man in love veins arteries headpiece in love and constantly brooding at a solitary height over the beautiful coveted object only too bewildered by her multifarious evanescent feminine evasions as of colours on a ruffle water to think of pouncing for he could do nothing to soften nothing that seemed to please her and all the while the motive of her mind impelled him in reflection beyond practicable limits even pointing him to apt quotations either he thought within her thoughts or his own were at her disposal nor was it sufficient for him to be sensible of her influence to restrain the impetus he took from her he had already wedded her morally and much that he did as well as whatever he debated came of diana more than if they had been coupled when his downright practical good sense could have spoken she held him suspended swaying him in that posture and he was not a whit ashamed of it the beloved woman was throned on the very highest of the man furthermore not being encouraged he had his peculiar reason for delay though now he could offer her wealth she had once in his hearing derided the unpleasant hiss of the ungainly english matron's title of mrs there was no harm in the accustomed title to his taste but she disliking it he did the same on her special behalf and the prospect funereally draped of a title sweeter sounding to her ears was above his horizon bear in mind that he underwent the reverse of encouragement any small thing to please her was magnified and the anticipation of it nerved the modest hopes of one who deemed himself and any man alive deeply her inferior such was the mood of the lover condemned to hear another malignant scandal defiling the name of the woman he worshipped sir lukin dunstane extremely hurried bumped him on the lower step of the busy bank and said 'pardon' and 'ha redwarth making money' 'why what are you up to down here' he was asked and he answered 'down to the tower to an officer quartered there not bad quarters but an infernal distance business' having cloaked his expedition to the distance with the comprehensive word he repeated it by which he feared he had rendered it too significant and he said 'no no nothing particular' and that caused the secret he contained to swell in his breast rebelliously informing the candid creature of the fact of his hating to lie whereupon thus he poured himself out in the quieter bustle of an alley off the main thoroughfare 'you're a friend of hers i 'm sure you care for her reputation you 're an old friend of hers and she's my wife's dearest friend and i'm fond of her too and i ought to be and ought to know and do know pure strike off my fist if there's a spot on her character and a scoundrel like that fellow wroxeter damnedest rage i ever was in swears down at lockton when she was a girl why redworth i can tell you when diana warwick was a girl' redworth stopped him 'did he say it in your presence' sir lukin was drawn up by the harsh question 'well no not exactly' he tried to hesitate but he was in the hot vein of a confidence and he wanted advice 'the cur said it to a woman hang the woman and she hates diana warwick i can't tell why a regular snake's hate by jove how women carp hate' 'who is the woman' said redworth sir lukin complained of the mob at his elbows 'i don't like mentioning names here' a convenient open door of offices invited him to drag his receptacle and possible counsellor into the passage where immediately he bethought him of a postponement of the distinct communication but the vein was too hot 'i say redworth i wish you'd dine with me let's drive up to my club very well two words and i warn you i shall call him out and make it appear it 's about another woman who'll like nothing so much if i know the jezebel some women are hussies let 'em be handsome as houris and she's a fire ship by heaven she is come you're a friend of my wife's but you're a man of the world and my friend and you know how fellows are tempted tom redworth cur though he is he's likely to step out and receive a lesson well he's the favoured cavalier for the present h'm fryar gannett swears he told her circumstantially and it was down at lockton when diana warwick was a girl swears she'll spit her venom at her so that diana warwick shan't hold her head up in london society what with that cur wroxeter old dannisburgh and dacier and it does count a list doesn't it confound the handsome hag she's jealous of a dark rival i've been down to colonel hartswood at the tower and he thinks wroxeter deserves horsewhipping and we may manage it i know you 're dead against duelling and so am i on my honour but you see there are cases where a lady must be protected and anything new left to circulate against a lady who has been talked of twice oh by jove it must be stopped if she has a male friend on earth it must be stopped on the spot' redworth eyed sir lukin curiously through his wrath 'we'll drive up to your club' he said 'hartswood dines with me this evening to confer' rejoined sir lukin 'will you meet him' 'i can't' said redworth 'i have to see a lady whose affairs i have been attending to in the city and i 'm engaged for the evening you perceive my good fellow' he resumed as they rolled along 'this is a delicate business you have to consider your wife mrs warwick's name won't come up but another woman's will' 'i meet wroxeter at a gambling house he frequents and publicly call him cheat slap his face if need be' 'sure to' repeated redworth 'no stupid pretext will quash the woman's name now such a thing as a duel would give pain enough' 'of course i understand' sir lukin nodded his clear comprehension 'but what is it you advise to trounce the scoundrel and silence him' 'leave it to me for a day let me have your word that you won't take a step positively neither you nor colonel hartswood i'll see you by appointment at your club' redworth looked up over the chimneys 'we 're going to have a storm and a gale i can tell you' 'gale and storm' cried sir lukin 'what has that got to do with it' 'think of something else for a time' 'and that brute of a woman deuced handsome she is if you care for fair women redworth she's a venus jumped slap out of the waves and the devil for sire that you learn running about sowing her lies she's a yellow witch oh but she's a shameless minx and a black leg cur like wroxeter any woman intimate with a fellow like that stamps herself i loathe her sort of woman who swears in the morning you're the only man on earth and next day that evening engaged fee to polly hopkins and it's a gentleman a nobleman my lord been going on behind your back half the season and she isn't hissed when she abuses a lady a saint in comparison you know the world old fellow brighton richmond visits to a friend as deep in the bog how fryar gunnett a man after all can stand it and drives of an afternoon for an airing by heaven you're out of that mess redworth not much taste for the sex and you're right you're lucky upon my word the corruption of society in the present day is awful it's appalling i rattled at her and oh dear me perks on her hind heels and defies me to prove and she's no pretender but hopes she's as good as any of my chaste dianas my dear old friend it's when you come upon women of that kind you have a sickener and i'm bound by the best there is in a man honour gratitude all the' list to defend diana warwick' 'so you see for your wife's sake your name can't be hung on a woman of that kind' said redworth 'i'll call here the day after to morrow at three pm' sir lukin descended and vainly pressed redworth to run up into his club for refreshment said he roguishly 'who 's the lady' the tone threw redworth on his frankness 'the lady i 've been doing business for in the city is miss paynham' 'i saw her once at copsley good looking cleverish' 'she has ability' entering his club sir lukin was accosted in the reading room by a cavalry officer a colonel launay an old harrovian who stood at the window and asked him whether it was not tom redworth in the cab another of the same school standing squared before a sheet of one of the evening newspapers heard the name and joined them saying 'tom redworth is going to be married some fellow told me' 'he'll make a deuced good husband to any woman if it's true' said sir lukin with miss paynham ringing in his head 'he's a cold blooded old boy and likes women for their intellects' colonel launay hummed in meditative emphasis he stared at vacancy with a tranced eye and turning a similar gaze on sir lukin as if through him burst out 'oh by george i say what a hugging that woman 'll get' the cocking of ears and queries of sir lukin put him to the test of his right to the remark for it sounded of occult acquaintance with interesting subterranean facts and there was a communication in brief syllables and the dot language crudely masculine immensely surprised sir lukin exclaimed 'of course when fellows live quietly and are careful of themselves ah you may think you know a man for years and you don't you don't know more than an inch or two of him why of course tom redworth would be uxorious the very man and tell us what has become of the firefly now one never sees her didn't complain' 'very much the contrary' both gentlemen were grave believing their knowledge in the subterranean world of a wealthy city to give them a positive cognizance of female humanity and the substance of colonel launay's communication had its impressiveness for them 'well it's a turn right about face for me' said sir lukin 'what a world we live in i fancy i've hit on the woman he means to marry had an idea of another woman once but he's one of your friendly fellows with women that's how it was i took him for a fish great mistake i admit but tom redworth 's a man of morals after all and when those men do break loose for a plunge ha have you ever boxed with him well he keeps himself in training i can tell you' sir lukin's round of visits drew him at night to lady singleby's where he sighted the identical young lady of his thoughts miss paynham temporarily a guest of the house and he talked to her of redworth and had the satisfaction to spy a blush a rageing blush which avowal presented her to his view as an exceedingly good looking girl so that he began mentally to praise redworth for a manly superiority to small trifles and the world's tattle 'you saw him to day' he said she answered 'yes he goes down to copsley tomorrow' 'i think not' said sir lukin' 'i have it from him' she closed her eyelids in speaking 'he and i have some rather serious business in town' 'serious' 'don't be alarmed not concerning him' 'whom then you have told me so much i have a right to know' 'not an atom of danger i assure you' 'it concerns mrs warwick' said she sir lukin thought the guess extraordinary he preserved an impenetrable air but he had spoken enough to set that giddy head spinning nowhere during the night was mrs fryar gannett visible earlier than usual she was riding next day in the row alone for perhaps two minutes and sir lukin passed her formally saluting he could not help the look behind him she sat so bewitchingly on horseback he looked and behold her riding whip was raised erect from the elbow it was his horse that wheeled compulsorily he was borne at a short canter to her side 'your commands' the handsome amabel threw him a sombre glance from the corners of her uplifted eyelids and snakish he felt it but her colour and the line of her face went well with sullenness and her arts of fascination cast aside she fascinated him more in seeming homelier girlish if the trial of her beauty of a woman in a temper can bear the strain she has attractive lures indeed irresistible to the amorous idler and when in addition being the guilty person she plays the injured her show of temper on the taking face pitches him into perplexity with his own emotions creating a desire to strike and be stricken howl and set howling which is of the happiest augury for tender reconcilement on the terms of the gentleman on his kneecap 'you've been doing a pretty thing' she said and briefly she named her house and half an hour and flew sir lukin was left to admire the figure of the horsewoman really her figure had an air of vindicating her successfully except for the poison she spat at diana warwick and what pretty thing had he been doing he reviewed dozens of speculations until the impossibility of seizing one determined him to go to mrs fryar gunnett at the end of the half hour 'just to see what these women have to say for themselves' some big advance drops of redworth's thunderstorm drawing gloomily overhead warned him to be quick and get his horse into stables dismounted the sensational man was irresolute suspecting a female trap but curiosity combined with the instinctive turning of his nose in the direction of the lady's house led him thither to an accompaniment of celestial growls which impressed him judging by that naughty girl face of hers and the woman's tongue she had as a likely prelude to the scene to come below chapter xlii the penultimate showing a final struggle for liberty and run into harness the prophet of the storm had forgotten his prediction which however was of small concern to him apart from the ducking he received midway between the valley and the heights of copsley whither he was bound on a mission so serious that according to his custom in such instances he chose to take counsel of his active legs an adviseable course when the brain wants clearing and the heart fortifying diana's face was clearly before him through the deluge now in ogle features the dimple running from her mouth the dark bright eyes and cut of eyelids and nostrils alive under their lightning now inkier whole radiant smile or musefully listening nursing a thought or she was obscured and he felt the face the individuality of it had him by the heart beyond his powers of visioning on his arrival he stood in the hall adrip like one of the trees of the lawn laughing at lady dunstane's anxious exclamations his portmanteau had come and he was expected she hurried out at the first ringing of the bell to greet and reproach him for walking in such weather 'diana has left me' she said when he reappeared in dry clothing 'we are neighbours she has taken cottage lodgings at selshall about an hour's walk one of her wild dreams of independence are you disappointed' 'i am' redworth confessed emma coloured 'she requires an immense deal of humouring at present the fit will wear off only we must wait for it any menace to her precious liberty makes her prickly she is passing the day with the pettigrews who have taken a place near her village for a month she promised to dine and sleep here if she returned in time what is your news' 'nothing the world wags on' 'you have nothing special to tell her' 'nothing' he hummed 'nothing i fancy that she does not know' 'you said you were disappointed' 'it's always a pleasure to see her' 'even in her worst moods i find it so' 'oh moods' quoth redworth 'my friend they are to be reckoned with women' 'certainly what i meant was that i don't count them against women' 'good but my meaning was i think i remember your once comparing them and the weather and you spoke of the one point more variable in women you may forestall your storms there is no calculating the effect of a few little words at a wrong season' 'with women i suppose not i have no pretension to a knowledge of the sex' emma imagined she had spoken plainly enough if he had immediate designs and she was not sure of that and wished rather to shun his confidences while tony was in her young widowhood revelling in her joy of liberty by and by was her thought perhaps next year she dreaded tony's refusal of the yoke and her iron hardness to the dearest of men proposing it and moreover her further to be apprehended holding to the refusal for the sake of consistency if it was once uttered for her own sake she shrank from hearing intentions that distressing the good man she would have to discountenance his candour in confessing disappointment and his open face his excellent sense too gave her some assurance of his not being foolishly impetuous after he had read to her for an hour as his habit was on evenings and wet days their discussion of this and that in the book lulled any doubts she had of his prudence enough to render it even a dubious point whether she might be speculating upon a wealthy bachelor in the old fashioned ultra feminine manner the which she so abhorred that she rejected the idea consequently redworth's proposal to walk down to the valley for diana and bring her back struck her as natural when a shaft of western sunshine from a whitened edge of raincloud struck her windows she let him go without an intimated monition or a thought of one thinking simply that her tony would be more likely to come having him for escort those are silly women who are always imagining designs and intrigues and future palpitations in the commonest actions of either sex emma dunstane leaned to the contrast between herself and them danvers was at the house about sunset reporting her mistress to be on her way with mr redworth the maid's tale of the dreadful state of the lanes accounted for their tardiness and besides the sunset had been magnificent diana knocked at emma's bedroom door to say outside hurriedly in passing how splendid the sunset had been and beg for an extra five minutes taking full fifteen she swam into the drawing room lively with kisses on emma's cheeks and excuses referring her misconduct in being late to the seductions of 'sol' in his glory redworth said he had rarely seen so wonderful a sunset the result of their unanimity stirred emma's bosom to match making regrets and the walk of the pair together alone under the propitious laming heavens appeared to her now as an opportunity lost from sisterly sympathy she fancied she could understand tony's liberty loving reluctance she had no comprehension of the backwardness of the man beholding the dear woman handsomer than in her maiden or her married time and sprightlier as well she chatted deliciously and drew redworth to talk his best on his choicer subjects playing over them like a fide wisp determined at once to flounder him and to make him shine her tender esteem for the man was transparent through it all and emma whose evening had gone happily between them said to her in their privacy before parting 'you seemed to have been inspired by sol my dear you do like him don't you' diana vowed she adored him and with a face of laughter in rosy suffusion put sol for redworth redworth for sol but watchful of emma's visage said finally 'if you mean the mortal man i think him up to almost all your hyperboles as far as men go and he departed to his night's rest which i hope will be good like a king not to admire him would argue me senseless heartless i do i have reason to' 'and you make him the butt of your ridicule tony' 'no i said like a king and he is one he has to me morally the grandeur of your sol sinking caesar stabbed cato on the sword point he is roman spartan imperial english if you like the pick of the land it is an honour to call him friend and i do trust he will choose the pick among us to make her a happy woman if she's for running in harness there i can't say more' emma had to be satisfied with it for the present they were astonished at breakfast by seeing sir lukin ride past the windows he entered with the veritable appetite of a cavalier who had ridden from london fasting and why he had come at that early hour he was too hungry to explain the ladies retired to read their letters by the morning's post whereupon sir lukin called to redworth 'i met that woman in the park yesterday and had to stand a volley i went beating about london for you all the afternoon and evening she swears you rated her like a scullery wench and threatened to ruin wroxeter did you see him she says the story's true in one particular that he did snatch a kiss and got mauled not so much to pay for it but what a ruffian eh' 'i saw him' said redworth 'he 's one of the new set of noblemen who take bribes to serve as baits for transactions in the city they help to the ruin of their order or are signs of its decay we won't judge it by him he favoured me with his word of honour that the thing you heard was entirely a misstatement and so forth apologized i suppose he mumbled something' 'a thorough cur' 'he professed his readiness to fight if either of us was not contented' 'he spoke to the wrong man i've half a mind to ride back and have him out for that rascal osculation and the lady unwilling and she a young one a girl under the protection of the house by jove redworth when you come to consider the scoundrels men can be it stirs a fellow's bile there's a deal of that sort of villany going and succeeding sometimes he deserves the whip or a bullet' 'a sermon from lukin dunstane might punish him' 'oh i'm a sinner i know but go and tell one woman of another woman and that a lie that's beyond me' 'the gradations of the deeps are perhaps measurable to those who are in them' 'the sermon's at me pop' said sir lukin 'by the way i'm coming round to think diana warwick was right when she used to jibe at me for throwing up my commission idleness is the devil or mother of him i manage my estates but the truth is it doesn't occupy my mind' 'your time' 'my mind i say' 'whichever you please' 'you're crusty to day redworth let me tell you i think and hard too when the fit's on me however you did right in stopping i'll own a piece of folly and shutting the mouths of those two though it caused me to come in for a regular drencher but a pretty woman in a right down termagant passion is good theatre because it can't last at that pace and you're sure of your agreeable tableau not that i trust her ten minutes out of sight or any woman except one or two my wife and diana warwick trust those you've tried old boy diana warwick ought to be taught to thank you though i don't know how it's to be done' 'the fact of it is' redworth frowned and rose 'i've done mischief i had no right to mix myself in it i'm seldom caught off my feet by an impulse but i was i took the fever from you' he squared his figure at the window and looked up on a driving sky 'come let's play open cards tom redworth' said sir lukin leaving the table and joining his friend by the window 'you moral men are doomed to be marrying men always and quite right not that one doesn't hear a roundabout thing or two about you no harm very much the contrary as the world goes but you're the man to marry a wife and if i guess the lady she's a sensible girl and won't be jealous i 'd swear she only waits for asking' 'then you don't guess the lady' said redworth 'mary paynham' the desperate half laugh greeting the name convinced more than a dozen denials sir lukin kept edging round for a full view of the friend who shunned inspection 'but is it can it be it must be after all why of course it is but the thing staring us in the face is just what we never see just the husband for her and she's the wife why diana warwick 's the very woman of course i remember i used to think so before she was free to wed' 'she is not of that opinion' redworth blew a heavy breath and it should be chronicled as a sigh but it was hugely masculine 'because you didn't attack the moment she was free that 's what upset my calculations' the sagacious gentleman continued for a vindication of his acuteness then seizing the reply 'refuses you don't mean to say you're the man to take a refusal and from a green widow in the blush did you see her cheeks when she was peeping at the letter in her hand she colours at half a word takes the lift of a finger for hymen coming and lots of fellows are after her i know it from emmy but you're not the man to be refused you're her friend her champion that woman fryar gunnett would have it you were the favoured lover and sneered at my talk of old friendship women are always down dead on the facts can't put them off a scent' 'there's the mischief' redworth blew again 'i had no right to be championing mrs warwick's name or the world won't give it at all events i'm a blundering donkey yes she wishes to keep her liberty and upon my soul i'm in love with everything she wishes i've got the habit' 'habit be hanged' cried sir lukin 'you're in love with the woman i know a little more of you now mr tom you're a fellow in earnest about what you do you're feeling it now on the rack by heaven though you keep a bold face did she speak positively sort of feminine of you're the monster not the man or measured little doctor's dose of pity worse sign' you 're not going' 'if you'll drive me down in half an hour' said redworth 'give me an hour' sir lukin replied and went straight to his wife's blue room diana was roused from a meditation on a letter she held by the entrance of emma in her bed chamber to whom she said 'i have here the very craziest bit of writing but what is disturbing you dear' emma sat beside her panting and composing her lips to speak 'do you love me i throw policy to the winds if only i can batter at you for your heart and find it tony do you love me but don't answer give me your hand you have rejected him' 'he has told you' 'no he is not the man to cry out for a wound he heard in london lukin has had the courage to tell me after his fashion tom redworth heard an old story coming from one of the baser kind of women grossly false he knew i mention only lord wroxeter and lockton he went to man and woman both and had it refuted and stopped their tongues on peril as he of all men is able to do when he wills it' observing the quick change in tony's eyes emma exclaimed 'how you looked disdain when you asked whether he had told me but why are you the handsome tigress to him of all men living the dear fellow dear to me at least since the day he first saw you has worshipped you and striven to serve you and harder than any scriptural service to have the beloved woman to wife i know nothing to compare with it for he is a man of warmth he is one of those rare men of honour who can command their passion who venerate when they love and those are the men that women select for punishment yes you it is to the woman he loves that he cannot show himself as he is because he is at her feet you have managed to stamp your spirit on him and as a consequence he defends you now for flinging him off and now his chief regret is that he has caused his name to be coupled with yours i suppose he had some poor hope seeing you free or else the impulse to protect the woman of his heart and soul was too strong i have seen what he suffered years back at the news of your engagement' 'oh for god's sake don't' cried tony tears running over and her dream of freedom her visions of romance drowning 'it was like the snapping of the branch of an oak when the trunk stands firm' emma resumed in her desire to scourge as well as to soften 'but similes applied to him will strike you as incongruous' tony swayed her body for a negative very girlishly and consciously 'he probably did not woo you in a poetic style or the courtly by prescription' again tony swayed she had to hug herself under the stripes and felt as if alone at sea with her dear heavens pelting 'you have sneered at him for his calculating to his face and it was when he was comparatively poor that he calculated to his cost that he dared not ask you to marry a man who could not offer you a tithe of what he considered fit for the peerless woman peerless i admit there he was not wrong but if he had valued you half a grain less he might have won you you talk much of chivalry you conceive a superhuman ideal to which you fit a very indifferent wooden model while the man of all the world the most chivalrous he is a man quite other from what you think him anything but a cuthbert dering or a man of two minds he was in the drawing room below on the day i received your last maiden letter from the crossways now his property in the hope of making it yours' 'i behaved abominably there' interposed tony with a gasp 'let it pass at any rate that was the prick of a needle not the blow of a sword' 'but marriage dear emmy marriage is marriage to be the end of me' 'what amazing apotheosis have you in prospect and are you steering so particularly well by yourself' 'miserably but i can dream and the thought of a husband cuts me from any dreaming it's all dead flat earth at once' 'would you lave rejected him when you were a girl' 'i think so' 'the superior merits of another' 'oh no no no no i might have accepted him and i might not have made him happy i wanted a hero and the jewelled garb and the feather did not suit him' 'no he is not that description of lay figure you have dressed it and gemmed it and made your discovery here is a true man and if you can find me any of your heroes to match him i will thank you he came on the day i speak of to consult me as to whether with the income he then had well i had to tell him you were engaged the man has never wavered in his love of you since that day he has had to bear something' this was an electrical bolt into tony's bosom shaking her from self pity and shame to remorseful pity of the suffering lover and the tears ran in streams as she said 'he bore it emmy he bore it' she sobbed out 'and he went on building a fortune and batting whatever he undertakes he does perfectly approve of the pattern or not oh i have no doubt he had his nest of wish piping to him all the while only it seems quaint dear quaint and against everything we've been reading of lovers love was his bread and butter' her dark eyes showered 'and to tell you what you do not know of him his way of making love is really' she sobbed 'pretty it it took me by surprise i was expecting a bellow and an assault of horns and if dear you will say what boarding school girl have you got with you and i feel myself getting childish if sol in his glory had not been so m majestically m magnificent nor seemed to show me the king kingdom of my dreams i might have stammered the opposite word to the one he heard last night when he took my hand kindly before going to bed i had a fit for dropping on my knees to him i saw him bleed and he held himself right royally i told you he did sol in his moral grandeur how infinitely above the physical monarch is he not emmy what one dislikes is the devotion of all that grandeur to win a widow it should be a maiden princess you feel it so i am sure and here am i as if a maiden princess were i demanding romantic accessories of rubious vapour in the man condescending to implore the widow to wed him but tell me does he know everything of his widow everything i shall not have to go through the frightful chapter' 'he is a man with his eyes awake he knows as much as any husband could require to know' said emma adding 'my darling he trusts you it is the soul of the man that loves you as it is mine you will not tease him promise me give yourself frankly you see it clearly before you' 'i see compulsion my dear what i see is a regiment of proverbs bearing placards instead of guns and each one a taunt at women especially at widows they march they form square they enclose me in the middle and i have their inscriptions to digest read that crazy letter from mary paynham while i am putting on my bonnet i perceive i have been crying like a raw creature in her teens i don't know myself an advantage of the darker complexions is our speedier concealment of the traces' emma read miss paynham's letter and returned it with the comment 'utterly crazy' tony said 'is it not i am to pause before i trifle with a noble heart too long she is to have her happiness in the constant prayer for ours and she is warned by one of those intimations never failing her that he runs a serious danger it reads like a wizard's almanack and here homogeneity of sentiment the most perfect is unable to contend with the fatal charm which exercised by an indifferent person must be ascribed to original predestination she should be under the wing of lady wathin there is the mother for such chicks but i'll own to you emmy that after the perusal i did ask myself a question as to my likeness of late to the writer i have drivelled i was shuddering over it when you came in i have sentimentalized up to thin smoke and she tells a truth when she says i am not to count social cleverness she means volubility as a warrant for domineering a capacious intelligence because of the gentleman's modesty agreed i have done it i am contrite i am going into slavery to make amends for presumption banality thy name is marriage' 'your business is to accept life as we have it' said emma and tony shrugged she was precipitate in going forth to her commonplace fate and scarcely looked at the man requested by emma to escort her to her cottage after their departure emma fell into laughter at the last words with the kiss of her cheeks 'here goes old ireland' but from her look and from what she had said upstairs emma could believe that the singular sprite of girlishness invading and governing her latterly had yielded place to the woman she loved chapter xliii nuptial chapter and of how a barely willing woman was led to bloom with the nuptial sentiment emma watched them on their way through the park till they rounded the beechwood talking it could be surmised of ordinary matters the face of the gentleman turning at times to his companion's which steadily fronted the gale she left the ensuing to a prayer for their good direction with a chuckle at tony's evident feeling of a ludicrous posture and the desperate rush of her agile limbs to have it over but her prayer throbbed almost to a supplication that the wrong done to her beloved by dacier the wound to her own sisterly pride rankling as an injury to her sex might be cancelled through the union of the woman noble in the sight of god with a more manlike man meanwhile the feet of the couple were going faster than their heads to the end of the journey diana knew she would have to hoist the signal and how the prospect was dumb foundering she had to think of appeasing her emma redworth for his part actually supposed she had accepted his escorting in proof of the plain friendship offered him overnight 'what do your birds do in weather like this' she said 'cling to their perches and wait patiently it's the bad time with them when you don't hear them chirp' 'of course you foretold the gale' 'oh well it did not require a shepherd or a skipper for that' 'your grand gift will be useful to a yachtsman' 'you like yachting when i have tried my new schooner in the channel she is at your command for as long as you and lady dunstane please' 'so you acknowledge that birds things of nature have their bad time' 'they profit ultimately by the deluge and the wreck nothing on earth is tucked up in perpetuity' 'except the dead but why should the schooner be at our command' 'i shall be in ireland' he could not have said sweeter to her ears or more touching 'we shall hardly feel safe without the weatherwise on board' 'you may count on my man barnes i have proved him he is up to his work even when he's bilious only in that case occurring about once a fortnight you must leave him to fight it out with the elements' 'i rather like men of action to have a temper' 'i can't say much for a bilious temper' the weather to day really seemed of that kind she remarked he assented in the shrug manner not to dissent she might say what she would he helped nowhere to a lead and so quick are the changes of mood at such moments that she was now far from him under the failure of an effort to come near but thoughts of emma pressed 'the name of the new schooner her name is her picture to me' 'i wanted you to christen her' 'launched without a name' 'i took a liberty' needless to ask but she did 'with whom' 'i named her diana' 'may the goddess of the silver bow and crescent protect her to me the name is ominous of mischance' 'i would commit my fortunes and life' he checked his tongue ejaculating 'omens' she had veered straight away from her romantic aspirations to the blunt extreme of thinking that a widow should be wooed in unornamented matter of fact as she is wedded with a 'wilt thou' and 'i will' and no decorative illusions downright for the unpoetic creature if you please so she rejected the accompaniment of the silver goddess and high seas for an introduction of the crisis 'this would be a thunderer on our coasts i had a trial of my sailing powers in the mediterranean' as she said it her musings on him then with the contract of her position toward him now fierily brushed her cheeks and she wished him the man to make one snatch at her poor lost small butterfly bit of freedom so that she might suddenly feel in haven at peace with her expectant emma he could have seen the inviting consciousness but he was absurdly watchful lest the flying sprays of border trees should strike her he mentioned his fear and it became an excuse for her seeking protection of her veil 'it is our natural guardian' she said 'not much against timber' said he the worthy creature's anxiety was of the pattern of cavaliers escorting dames an exaggeration of honest zeal a present example of clownish goodness it might seem until entering the larch and firwood along the beaten heights there was a rocking and straining of the shallow rooted trees in a tremendous gust that quite pardoned him for curving his arm in a hoop about her and holding a shoulder in front the veil did her positive service he was honourably scrupulous not to presume a right good unimpulsive gentleman the same that she had always taken him for and liked 'these firs are not taproots' he observed by way of apology her dress volumed and her ribands rattled and chirruped on the verge of the slope 'i will take your arm here' she said redworth received the little hand saying 'lean to me' they descended upon great surges of wind piping and driving every light surface atom as foam and they blinked and shook even the man was shaken but their arms were interlinked and they grappled the battering enemy made them one it might mean nothing or everything to him it meant the sheer blissful instant at the foot of the hill he said 'it's harder to keep to the terms of yesterday' 'what were they' said she and took his breath more than the fury of the storm had done 'raise the veil i beg' 'widows do not wear it' the look revealed to him was a fugitive of the wilds no longer the glittering shooter of arrows 'have you' changed to me was the signification understood 'can you for life' do you think you can' his poverty in the pleading language melted her 'what i cannot do my best of friends is to submit to be seated on a throne with you petitioning yes as far as concerns this hand of mine if you hold it worthy of you we will speak of that now tell me the name of the weed trailing along the hedge there he knew it well a common hedgerow weed but the placid diversion baffled him it was clematis he said 'it drags in the dust when it has no firm arm to cling to i passed it beside you yesterday with a flaunting mind and not a suspicion of a likeness how foolish i was i could volubly sermonize only it should be a young maid to listen forgive me the yesterday' 'you have never to ask you withdraw your hand was i rough' 'no' she smiled demurely 'it must get used to the shackles but my cottage is in sight i have a growing love for the place we will enter it like plain people if you think of coming in' as she said it she had a slight shock of cowering under eyes tolerably hawkish in their male glitter but her coolness was not disturbed and without any apprehensions she reflected on what has been written of the silly division and war of the sexes which two might surely enter on an engagement to live together amiably unvexed by that barbarous old fowl and falcon interlude cool herself she imagined the same of him having good grounds for the delusion so they passed through the cottage garden and beneath the low porchway into her little sitting room where she was proceeding to speak composedly of her preference for cottages while untying her bonnet strings 'if i had begun my life in a cottage' when really a big storm wave caught her from shore and whirled her to mid sea out of every sensibility but the swimming one of her loss of self in the man 'you would not have been here' was all he said she was up at his heart fast locked undergoing a change greater than the sea works her thoughts one blush her brain a fire fount this was not like being seated on a throne 'there' said he loosening his hug 'now you belong to me i know you from head to foot after that my darling i could leave you for years and call you wife and be sure of you i could swear it for you my life on it that 's what i think of you don't wonder that i took my chance the first i have waited' truer word was never uttered she owned coming into some harmony with man's kiss on her mouth the man violently metamorphozed to a stranger acting on rights she had given him and who was she to dream of denying them not an idea in her head bound verily to be thankful for such love on hearing that it dated from the night in ireland 'so in love with you that on my soul your happiness was my marrow whatever you wished anything you chose it's reckoned a fool's part no it's love the love of a woman the one woman i was like the hand of a clock to the springs i taught this old watch dog of a heart to keep guard and bury the bones you tossed him' 'ignorantly admit' said she and could have bitten her tongue for the empty words that provoked 'would you have flung him nothing' and caused a lowering of her eyelids and shamed glimpses of recollections 'i hear you have again been defending me i told you i think i wished i had begun my girl's life in a cottage all that i have had to endure or so it seems to me it may be my way of excusing myself i know my cunning in that peculiar art i would take my chance of mixing among the highest and the brightest' 'naturally' 'culpably' 'it brings you to me' 'through a muddy channel' 'your husband has full faith in you my own' 'the faith has to be summoned and is buffeted as we were just now on the hill i wish he had taken me from a cottage' 'you pushed for the best society like a fish to its native sea' 'pray say a salmon to the riverheads' 'better' redworth laughed joyfully between admiration of the tongue that always outflew him and of the face he reddened by degrees her apter and neater terms of speech helped her to a notion of regaining some steps of her sunken ascendancy under the weight of the novel masculine pressure on her throbbing blood and when he bent to her to take her lord's farewell of her after agreeing to go and delight emma with a message her submission and her personal pride were not so much at variance perhaps because her buzzing head had no ideas 'tell emma you have undertaken to wash the blackamoor as white as she can be' she said perversely in her spite at herself for not coming as it were out of the dawn to the man she could consent to wed and he replied 'i shall tell her my dark girl pleads for a fortnight's grace before she and i set sail for the west coast of ireland' conjuring a picture that checked any protest against the shortness of time and emma would surely be his ally they talked of the dublin ball painfully to some of her thoughts but redworth kissed that distant brilliant night as freshly as if no belabouring years rolled in the chasm which led her to conceive partly and wonderingly the nature of a strong man's passion and it subjugated the woman knowing of a contrast the smart of the blow dealt her by him who had fired the passion in her became a burning regret for the loss of that fair fame she had sacrificed to him and could not bring to her truer lover though it was but the outer view of herself the world's view only she was generous and of honest conscience and but for the sake of her truer lover she would mentally have allowed the world to lash and abuse her without a plea of material purity could it be named the naming of it in her clear mind lessened it to accidental by good fortune she was no worse she said to redworth when finally dismissing him 'i bring no real disgrace to you my friend' to have had this sharp spiritual battle at such a time was proof of honest conscience rarer among women as the world has fashioned them yet than the purity demanded of them his answer 'you are my wife' rang in her hearing when she sat alone at last she was incapable despite her nature's imaginative leap to brightness of choosing any single period auspicious or luminous or flattering since the hour of her first meeting this man rather than the grey light he cast on her promising helpfulness and inspiring a belief in her capacity to help not the salvatore high raptures nor the nights of social applause could appear preferable she strained her shattered wits to try them as for her superlunary sphere it was in fragments and she mused on the singularity considering that she was not deeply enamoured was she so at all the question drove her to embrace the dignity of being reasonable under emmy's guidance for she did not stand firmly alone her story confessed it marriage might be the archway to the road of good service even as our passage through the flesh may lead to the better state she had thoughts of the kind and had them while encouraging herself to deplore the adieu to her little musk scented sitting room where a modest freedom breathed and her individuality had seemed pointing to a straighter growth she nodded subsequently to the truth of her happy emma's remark 'you were created for the world tony' a woman of blood and imagination in the warring world without a mate whom she can revere subscribes to a likeness with those independent minor realms between greedy mighty neighbours which conspire and undermine when they do not openly threaten to devour so then this union the return to the wedding yoke received sanction of grey toned reason she was not enamoured she could say it to herself she had however been surprised both by the man and her unprotesting submission surprised and warmed unaccountably warmed clearness of mind in the woman chaste by nature however little ignorant it allowed her to be in the general review of herself could not compass the immediately personal with its acknowledgement of her subserviency to touch and pressure and more stranger her readiness to kindle she left it unexplained unconsciously the image of dacier was effaced looking backward her heart was moved to her long constant lover with most pitying tender wonderment stormy man as her threatened senses told her that he was looking at him she had to mask her being abashed and mastered and looking forward her soul fell in prayer for this true man's never repenting of his choice sure of her now mr thomas redworth had returned to the station of the courtier and her feminine sovereignty was not ruffled to make her feel too feminine another revelation was his playful talk when they were more closely intimate he had his humour as well as his hearty relish of hers 'if all englishmen were like him' she chimed with emma dunstane's eulogies under the influence 'my dear' the latter replied 'we should simply march over the four quarters and be blessed by the nations only avoid your trick of dashing headlong to the other extreme he has his faults' 'tell me of them' diana cooed for an answer 'do i want the flavour a girl would be satisfied with superhuman excellence a widow asks for feature' 'to my thinking the case is that if it is a widow who sees the superhuman excellence in a man she may be very well contented to cross the bridge with him' rejoined emma 'suppose the bridge to break and for her to fall into the water he rescuing her then perhaps' 'but it has been happening' 'but piecemeal in extension so slowly i go to him a derelict bearing a story of the sea empty of ideas i remember sailing out of harbour passably well freighted for commerce' 'when tom redworth has had command of the derelict a week i should like to see her' the mention of that positive captaincy drowned diana in morning colours she was dominated physically and morally submissively too what she craved in the absence of the public whiteness which could have caused her to rejoice in herself as a noble gift was the spring of enthusiasm emma touched a quivering chord of pride with her hint at the good augury and foreshadowing of the larger union in the irishwoman's bestowal of her hand on the open minded englishman she had learned to trust the aureole glimmered transiently she could neither think highly of the woman about to be wedded nor poetically of the man nor therefore rosily of the ceremony nor other than vacuously of life and yet as she avowed to emma she had gathered the three rarest good things of life a faithful friend a faithful lover a faithful servant the two latter exposing an unimagined quality of emotion danvers on the night of the great day for redworth had undressed her with trembling fingers and her mistress was led to the knowledge that the maid had always been all eye and on reflection to admit that it came of a sympathy she did not share but when celtic brains are reflective on their emotional vessel they shoot direct as the arrow of logic diana's glance at the years behind lighted every moving figure to a shrewd transparency herself among them she was driven to the conclusion that the granting of any of her heart's wild wishes in those days would have lowered her or frozen dacier was a coldly luminous image still a tolling name no longer conceivably her mate recollection rocked not she the politician and citizen was admired she read the man more to her own discredit than to his but she read him and if that is done by the one of two lovers who was true to love it is the god of the passion pronouncing a final release from the shadow of his chains three days antecedent to her marriage she went down the hill over her cottage chimneys with redworth after hearing him praise and cite to emma dunstane sentences of a morning's report of a speech delivered by dacier to his constituents she alluded to it that she might air her power of speaking of the man coolly to him or else for the sake of stirring afresh some sentiment he had roused and he repeated his high opinion of the orator's political wisdom whereby was revived in her memory a certain reprehensible view belonging to her period of mock girlish naughtiness too vile as to his paternal benevolence now to clear vision the loftiest manliness what did she do she was irish therefore intuitively decorous in amatory challenges and interchanges but she was an impulsive woman and foliage was thick around only a few small birds and heaven seeing and penitence and admiration sprang the impulse it had to be this or a burst of weeping she put a kiss upon his arm she had omitted to think that she was dealing with a lover a man of smothered fire who would be electrically alive to the act through a coat sleeve redworth had his impulse he kept it under she felt the big breath he drew in imagination began busily building a nest for him and enthusiasm was not sluggish to make a home of it the impulse of each had wedded in expression and repression her sensibility told her of the stronger she rose on the morning of her marriage day with his favourite planxty kelly at her lips a natural bubble of the notes emma drove down to the cottage to breakfast and superintend her bride's adornment as to which diana had spoken slightingly as well as of the ceremony and the institution and this life itself she would be married out of her cottage a widow a cottager a woman under a cloud yes a sober person taking at last a right practical step to please her two best friends the change was marked she wished to hide it wished to confide it emma was asked 'how is he this morning' and at the answer describing his fresh and spirited looks and his kind ways with arthur rhodes and his fun with sullivan smith and the satisfaction with the bridegroom declared by lord larrian invalided from his rock and unexpectingly informed of the wedding diana forgot that she had kissed her and this time pressed her lips in a manner to convey the secret bridally 'he has a lovely day' 'and bride' said emma 'if you two think so i should like to agree with my dear old lord and bless him for the prize he takes though it feels itself at present rather like a christmas bon bon a piece of sugar in the wrap of a rhymed motto he is kind to arthur you say' 'like a cordial elder brother' 'dear love i have it at heart that i was harsh upon mary paynham for her letter she meant well and i fear she suffers and it may have been a bit my fault blind that i was when you say cordial elder brother you make him appear beautiful to me the worst of that is one becomes aware of the inability to match him' 'read with his eyes when you meet him this morning my tony' the secret was being clearly perceived by emma whose pride in assisting to dress the beautiful creature for her marriage with the man of men had a tinge from the hymenaeal brand exulting over dacier and in the compensation coming to her beloved for her first luckless footing on this road 'how does he go down to the church' said diana 'he walks down lukin and his chief drive he walks with your arthur and mr sullivan smith he is on his way now' diana looked through the window in the direction of the hill 'that is so like him to walk to his wedding' emma took the place of danvers in the office of the robing for the maid as her mistress managed to hint was too steeped 'in the colour of the occasion' to be exactly tasteful and had the art no doubt through sympathy of charging permissible common words with explosive meanings she was in an amorous palpitation of the reflected state after several knockings and enterings of the bedchamber door she came hurriedly to say 'and your pillow ma'am i had almost forgotten it' a question that caused her mistress to drop the gaze of a moan on emma with patience trembling diana preferred a hard pillow and usually carried her own about 'take it' she had to reply the friends embraced before descending to step into the fateful carriage 'and tell me' emma said 'are not your views of life brighter to day' 'too dazzled to know it may be a lamp close to the eyes or a radiance of sun i hope they are' 'you are beginning to think hopefully again' 'who can really think and not think hopefully you were in my mind last night and you brought a little boat to sail me past despondency of life and the fear of extinction when we despair or discolour things it is our senses in revolt and they have made the sovereign brain their drudge i heard you whisper with your very breath in my ear there is nothing the body suffers that the soul may not profit by that is emma's history with that i sail into the dark it is my promise of the immortal teaches me to see immortality for us it comes from you my emmy' if not a great saying it was in the heart of deep thoughts proof to emma that her tony's mind had resumed its old clear high aiming activity therefore that her nature was working sanely and that she accepted her happiness and bore love for a dower to her husband no blushing confession of the woman's love of the man would have told her so much as the return to mental harmony with the laws of life shown in her darling's pellucid little sentence she revolved it long after the day of the wedding to emma constantly on the dark decline of the unillumined verge between the two worlds those words were a radiance and a nourishment had they waned she would have trimmed them to feed her during her soul sister's absence they shone to her of their vitality she was lying along her sofa facing her south western window one afternoon of late november expecting tony from her lengthened honeymoon trip while a sunset in the van of frost not without celestial musical reminders of tony's husband began to deepen and as her friend was coming she mused on the scenes of her friend's departure and how tony issuing from her cottage porch had betrayed her feelings in the language of her sex by stooping to lift above her head and kiss the smallest of her landlady's children ranged up the garden path to bid her farewell over their strewing of flowers and of her murmur to tony entering the churchyard among the grave mounds 'old ireland won't repent it' and tony's rejoinder at the sight of the bridegroom advancing beaming 'a singular transformation of old england' and how having numberless ready sources of laughter and tears down the run of their heart in heart intimacy all spouting up for a word in the happy tremour of the moment they had both bitten their lips and blinked on a moisture of the eyelids now the dear woman was really wedded wedded and mated her letters breathed in their own lively or thoughtful flow of the perfect mating emma gazed into the depths of the waves of crimson where brilliancy of colour came out of central heaven preternaturally near on earth till one shade less brilliant seemed an ebbing away to boundless remoteness angelical and mortal mixed making the glory overhead a sign of the close union of our human conditions with the ethereal and psychically divined thence it grew that one thought in her breast became a desire for such extension of days as would give her the blessedness to clasp in her lap if those kind heavens would grant it a child of the marriage of the two noblest of human souls one the dearest and so have proof at heart that her country and our earth are fruitful in the good for a glowing future she was deeply a woman dumbly a poet true poets and true women have the native sense of the divineness of what the world deems gross material substance emma's exaltation in fervour had not subsided when she held her beloved in her arms under the dusk of the withdrawing redness they sat embraced with hands locked in the unlighted room and tony spoke of the splendid sky 'you watched it knowing i was on my way to you' 'praying dear' 'for me' 'that i might live long enough to be a godmother' there was no reply there was an involuntary little twitch of tony's fingers etext editor's
