note there is a short list of bookmarks or pointers at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the authors ideas before making an entire meal of them dw the tragic comedians a study in a wellknown story by george meredith book chapter xii she ran out to the shade of the garden walls to be by herself and in the air and she read and instantly her own letter to the baroness crashed sentence upon sentence in retort springing up with the combative instinct of a beast to make discord of the stuff she read and deride it twice she went over the lines with this defensive accompaniment then they laid octopuslimbs on her the writing struck chill as a glacier cave oh what an answer to that letter of fervid respectfulness of innocent supplication for maternal affection for some degree of benignant friendship the baroness coldly stated that she had arrived in the city to do her best in assisting to arrange matters which had come to a most unfortunate and impracticable pass she alluded to her established friendship for alvan but it was chiefly in the interests of clotilde that the latter was requested to perceive the necessity for bringing her relations with dr alvan to an end in the discreetest manner now possible to the circumstances this the baroness pursued could only be done by her intervention and her friendship for dr alvan had caused her to undertake the little agreeable office for which purpose promising her an exemption from anything in the nature of tragedy scenes the baroness desired clotilde to call on her the following day between certain specified hours of the afternoon that was all the girl in her letter to the baroness had constrained herself to write and therefore to think in so beautiful a spirit of ignorant innocence that the vileness of an answer thus brutally throwing off the mask of personal disinterestedness appeared to her both an abominable piece of cynicism on the part of a scandalous old woman and an insulting rejection of the cover of decency proposed to the creature by a daisy minded maiden she scribbled a single line in receipt of the letter and signed her initials the woman is hateful she said to her father she was ready to agree with him about the woman and alvan she was ashamed to have hoped anything of the woman and stamped down her disappointment under a vehement indignation that disfigured the man as well he had put the matter into the hands of this most detestable of women to settle it as she might think best he and shethe miserable old thing with her ancient arts and cajoleries had lured him back she had him fast again in spite offor who could tell perhaps by reason of her dirty habits she smoked dragoon cigars all day she was emitting tobaccosmoke it was notorious clotilde had not to learn it from her father but now she saw the filthy rag that standard of female independence wasthat petticoated unfeminine fouler than masculine alvan preferred the lichendraped tree to the sunny flower it was evident for never a letter from alvan had come to her she thought in wrath nothing but the thoughts of wrath and ran her wits through every reasonable reflection like a lighted brand that flings its colour if not fire upon surrounding images contempt of the squarejawed withered woman was too great for clotilde to have a sensation of her driving jealousy until painful glimpses of the man made jealousy so sharp that she flew for refuge to contempt of the pair that beldam had him back she had him fast oh let her keep him was he to be regretted who could make that choice her father did not let the occasion slip to speak insistingly as the world opined of alvan and his baroness he forced her to swallow the calumny and draw away with her family against herself through strong disgust out of a state of fire clotilde passed into solid frigidity she had neither a throb nor a passion wishing seemed to her senseless as life was she could hear without a thrill of her frame that alvan was in the city without a question whether it was true he had not written and he had handed her over to the baroness she did not ask herself how it was that she had no letter from him being afraid to think about it because if a letter had been withheld by her father it was a part of her whipping if none had been written there was nothing to hope for her recent humiliation condemned him by the voice of her sufferings for his failure to be giant eagle angel or any of the prodigious things he had taught her to expect and as he had thus deceived her the glorious lover she had imaged in her mind was put aside with some of the angry disdain she bestowed upon the woman by whom she had been wounded he ceased to be a visioned alvan and became an obscurity her principal sentiment in relation to him was that he threatened her peace but for him she would never have been taught to hate her parents she would have enjoyed the quiet domestic evenings with her people when marko sang and her sisters knitted and the betrothed sister wore a look very enviable in the abstract she would be seeing a future instead of a black iron gate but for him she certainly would never have had that letter from the baroness on the morning after the information of alvans return her father who deserved credit as a tactician came to her to say that alvan had sent to demand his letters and presents the demand was unlike what her stunned heart recollected of alvan but a hint that the baroness was behind it and that a refusal would bring the baroness down on her with another piece of insolence was effective she dealt out the letters arranged the presents made up the books pamphlets trinkets amulet coins lock of black hair and worn postmarked paper addressed in his hand to clotilde von rudiger carefully and half as souvenir half with the forlorn yearning of the look of lovers when they break asunderor of one of themshe signed inside the packet not clotilde but the gentlest title he had bestowed on her trusting to the pathos of the word child to tell him that she was enforced and still true if he should be interested in knowing it weak souls are much moved by having the pathos on their side they are consoled too time passed whole days the tender reminder had no effect on him it had been her last appeal she reflected that she had really felt when he had not been feeling at all and this marks a division she was next requested to write a letter to alvan signifying his release by the notification of her engagement to prince marko she was personally to deliver it to a gentleman who was of neither party and who would give her a letter from alvan in exchange which while assuring the gentleman she was acting with perfect freedom she was to be under her oath not to read and dutifully to hand to marko her betrothed her father assumed the fact of her renewed engagement to the prince as her whole family did strangely she thought it struck her as a fatality he said that alvan was working him great mischief doing him deadly injury in his position and for no just reason inasmuch as hea bold bad man striving to ruin the family on a point of pridehad declared that he simply considered himself bound in honour to her only a little doubtful of her independent action at present and a release of him accompanied by her plain statement of her being under no compulsion voluntarily the betrothed of another would solve the difficulty a certain old woman it seemed was anxious to have him formally released with the usual dose for such a patient of cajoleries and threats the general begged her to comply pulling the hands he squeezed in a way to strongly emphasize his affectionate entreaty she went straight to marko consenting that he should have alvans letter unopened she cared not to read it she said on his promise to give it up to her within a stated period there was a kind of prohibited pleasure sweet acid catching discord in the idea of this lovers keeping the forbidden thing she could ask for when she was curious about the other which at present she was not dead rather anxious to please her parents and determined to be no rival of the baroness marko promised it readily adding only let the storm roll over that we may have more liberty and i myself when we two are free will lead you to alvan and leave it to you to choose between us your happiness beloved is my sole thought submit for the moment he spoke sweetly with his dearest look touching her luxurious nature with a belief that she could love him untroubled by another she could love and be true to him her maternal inner nature yearned to the frailbodied youth she made a comparison in her mind of alvans love and markos and of the lives of the two men there was no grisly baroness attached to the princes life she wrote the letter to alvan feeling in the words that said she was plighted to prince marko that she said and clearly said the baroness is now relieved of a rival and may take you she felt it so acutely as to feel that she said nothing else severances are accomplished within the heart stroke by stroke within the cravens heart each new step resulting from a blow is temporarily an absolute severance her letter to alvan written she thought not tenderly of him but of the prince who had always loved a young woman and was unhampered by an old one the composition of the letter and the sense that the thing was done made her stony to alvan on the introduction of colonel von tresten whose name she knew but was dull to it she delivered him her letter with unaffected composure received from him alvans in exchange left the room as if to read it and after giving it unopened to marko composedly reappeared before the colonel to state that the letter could make no difference and all was to be as she had written it the colonel bowed stiffly it would have comforted her to have been allowed to say i cease to be the rival of that execrable harridan the delivery of so formidable a catscreech not being possible she stood in an attitude of mild resignation revolving thoughts of her fathers praises of his noble daughter her mothers kiss the caresses of her sisters and the dark bright eyes of marko the peace of the domestic circle this was her happiness and still there was time still hope for alvan to descend and cut the knot she conceived it slowly with some flush of the brain like a remainder of fever but no throbs of her pulses she had been swayed to act against him by tales which in her heart she did not credit exactly therefore did not take within herself though she let them influence her by the goad of her fears and angers and these she could conjure up at will for the defence of her conduct aware of their shallowness and all the while trusting him to come in the end and hear her reproaches for his delay he seemed to her now to have the character of a storm outside a household wrapped in comfortable monotony her natural spiritedness detested the monotony her craven soul fawned for the comfort after her many recent whippings the comfort was immensely desireable but a glance at the monotony gave it the look of a burial and standing in her attitude of resignation under colonel von trestens hard military stare she could have shrieked for alvan to come knowing that she would have cowered and trembled at the scene following his appearance yet she would have gone to him without any doubt his presence and the sense of his greater power declared by his coming would have lifted her over to him the part of her nature adoring storminess wanted only a present champion to outweigh the other part which cuddled security colonel von tresten however was very far from offering himself in such a shape to a girl that had jilted the friend he loved insulted the woman he esteemed and he stood there like a figure of soldierly complacency in marble her pencilled acknowledgement of the baronesss letter and her reply to it almost as much was construed as an intended insult to that lady whose champion tresten was he had departed before clotilde heard a step immediately thereupon it came to her mind that tresten was one of alvans bosom friends how then could he be of neither party and her father spoke of him as an upright rational man who although strangely enough he entertained as it appeared something like a profound reverence for the baroness could see and confess the downright impossibility of the marriage alvan proposed tresten her father said talked of his friend alvan as wild and eccentric but now becoming convinced that such a family as hers could never tolerate him considering his age his birth his blood his habits his politics his private entanglements and moral reputation it was partly hinted she shuddered at this false tresten he and the professor might be strung together for examples of perfidy his reverence of the baroness gave his cold blue eyes the iciness of her loathed letter alvan she remembered used to exalt him among the gallantest of the warriors dedicating their swords to freedom the dedication of the sword she felt sure was an accident he was a man of blood and naturally she must be hated by the man reverencing the baroness if ever man had executioner stamped on his face it was he like the professor nay like alvan himself he would not see that she was the victim of tyranny none of her signs would they see they judged of her by her inanimate frame in the hands of her torturers breaking her on the wheel she called to mind a fancy that she had looked at tresten out of her deadness earnestly for just one instant more than an instant she could not beneath her fathers vigilant watch and into those repellant cold blue butcher eyes tresten might clearly have understood the fleeting look what were her words what her deeds the look was the truth revealedher soul it begged for life like an infant and the mans face was an iron rock in reply no wonderhe worshipped the baroness so great was clotildes hatred of him that it overflooded the image of alvan who called him friend and deputed him to act as friend such blindness weakness folly on the part of one of alvans pretensions incurred a shade of her contempt she had not ever thought of him coldly hitherto it would have seemed a sacrilege but now she said definitely the friend of tresten cannot be the man i supposed him and she ascribed her capacity for saying it and for perceiving and adding up alvans faults of character to the freezing she had taken from that most antipathetic person she confessed to sensations of spite which would cause her to reject and spurn even his pleadings for alvan if they were imaginable as actual their not being imaginable allowed her to indulge her naughtiness harmlessly for the gratification of the idea of wounding some one though it were her lover connected with this tresten the letter of the baroness and the visit of the womans admirer had vitiated clotildes blood she was not only not mistress of her thoughts she was undirected either in thinking or wishing by any desires except that the people about her should caress and warm her until with no gaze backward she could say goodbye to them full of meaning as a goodbye to the covered grave as unreluctantly as the swallow quits her eavesnest in autumn and they were to learn that they were chargeable with the sequel of the history there would be a sequel she was sure if it came only to punish them for the cruelty which thwarted her timid anticipation of it by pressing on her natural instinct at all costs to bargain for an escape from pain and making her simulate contentment to cheat her muffled wound and them chapter xiii his love meantime was the mission and the burden of alvan and he was not ashamed to speak of it and plead for it and the pleading was not done troubadourishly in soft flutenotes as for easement of tuneful emotions beseeching sympathy he was liker to a sturdy beggar demanding his crust to support life of corporations that can be talked into admitting the rights of man and he vollied close logical argumentation on the basis of the laws in defence of his most natural hunger thunder in his breast and bright new heavenly morning alternating or clashing while the electric wires and post smote him with evil tidings of clotilde and the success of his efforts caught her back to him daily many times he reached to her and lost her had her in his arms and his arms withered with emptiness the ground he won quaked under him all the evidence opposed it but he was in action and his reason swore that he had her fast he had seen and felt his power over her his reason told him by what had been that it must be could he doubt he battled for his reason doubt was an extinguishing wave and he clung to his book of the law besieging church and state with it pointing to texts of the law which proved her free to choose her lord and husband for herself expressing his passionate love by his precise interpretation of the law and still with the cold sentience gaining on him against the current of his tumultuous blood and his hurried intelligence of her being actually what he had named her in moments of playful visionslippery a serpent a winding hare with the fear that she might slip from him betray deny him deliver him to ridicule after he had won his way to her over every barrier during his proudest exaltations in success when his eyes were sparkling there was a wry twitch inward upon his heart of hearts but if she was a hare he was a hunter little inclining to the chase now for mere physical recreation she had roused the sportsmans passion as well as the mans he meant to hunt her down and was not more scrupulous than our ancient hunters who hunted for a meal and hunted to kill with none of the later hesitations as to circumventing trapping snaring by devices and the preservation of the animals coat spotless let her be lured from her home or plucked from her home and if reluctant disgraced that she may be dependent utterly on the man stooping to pick her up he was equal to the projecting of a scheme socially infamous with such fanatical intensity did the thought of his losing the woman harass him and the torrent of his passion burst restraint to get to her to enfold herthis in the same hour of the original wild monsters persistent and sober exposition of the texts of the law with the voice of a cultivated modern gentleman and let it be said with a modern gentlemans design to wed a wife in honour all means were to be tried his eye burned on his prize mindless of what she was dragged through if there was resistance or whether by the hair of her head or her skirts or how she was obtained his interpretation of the law was for the powers of earth and other plans were to propitiate the powers under the earth and certain distempered groanings wrenched from him at intervals he addressed after they were out of him reflectively to the powers above so that nothing of him should be lost which might get aid of anything mundane infernal or celestial thus it is when venus bites a veritable ancient male she puts her venom in a magnificent beast not a pathetic phaedra she does it rarely for though to be loved by a bitten giant is one of the dreams of woman the considerate mother of love knows how needful it is to protect the sentiment of the passion and save them from an exhibition of the fires of that dragons breath do they not fly shrieking when they behold it barely are they able to read of it men too accustomed to minor doses of the goddess which moderate soften counteract instead of inflicting the malady abhor and have no brotherhood with its turbulent victim it was justly matter for triumph due to an extraordinary fervour of pleading upon a plain statement of the case that alvan should return from his foray bringing with him an emissary deputed by general von rudigers official chief to see that the young lady so passionately pursued by the foremost of his time in political genius and oratory was not subjected to parental tyranny but stood free to exercise her choice of the few who would ever have thought of attempting a diminished number would have equalled that feat alvan was no vain boaster he could gain the ears of grave men as well as mobs and women the interview with clotilde was therefore assured to him and the distracting telegrams and letters forwarded to him by tresten during his absence were consequently stabs already promising to heal they were brutal stabsher packet of his letters and presents on his table made them bleed afresh and the odd scrawl of the couple of words on the paper set him wondering at the imbecile irony of her calling herself the child in accompaniment to such an act for it reminded him of his epithet for her while it dealt him a tremendous blow it seemed senselessly malign perhaps flippant as she could be he knew she could be anything weak and shallow when out of his hands she had recently proved it still in view of the interview and on the tide of his labours to come to that wished end he struck his breast to brave himself with a good hopeful spirit once mine he said moreover to the better account clotildes english friend had sent him the lines addressed to her in which the writer dwelt on her love of him with a whimper of the voice of love that was previous to her perjury by little by a dayeighteen hours how lurid a satire was flung on events by the proximity of the dates but the closeness of the time between this lovecrooning and the denying of him pointed to a tyrannous intervention one could detect it full surely the poor craven was being tyrannized and tutored to deny him though she was a puss of the fields too as the mounted sportsman was not unwilling to think before visiting his mentor alvan applied for an audience of general von rudiger who granted it at once to a man coming so well armed to claim the privilege tresten walked part of the way to the generals house with him and then turned aside to visit the baroness lucie baroness von crefeldt was one of those persons who after a probationary term in the character of woman have become men but of whom offended man amazed by the flowering up of that hard rough jaw from the tender blooming promise of a petticoat finds it impossible to imagine they had once on a sweet spring time the sexs gentleness and charm of aspect mistress flanders breeched and hatted like a man pulling at the mans short pipe and heartily invoking frouzy deities committing a whole sackful of unfeminine etcaetera is an impenetrable wall to her maiden past yet was there an opening day when nothing of us moustached her she was a clearfaced girl and mother of young blushes before the years were at their work of transformation upon her countenance and behind her bosom the years were rough artists perhaps she was combative and fought them for touching her ungallantly and that perhaps was her first manly step baroness lucie was of high birth a wife openly maltreated a woman of breeding but with a mans head capable of inspiring manlike friendships and of entertaining them she was radicallyminded strongly of the radical profession of faith and a correspondent of revolutionary chiefs both the trusted adviser and devoted slave of him whose future glorious career she measured by his abilities rumour blew out a candle and left the wick to smoke in relation to their former intercourse the philistines revenged themselves on an old aristocratic radical and a jew demagogue with the weapon that scandal hands to virtue they are virtuous or nothing and they must show that they are so when they can and best do they show it by publicly dishonouring the friendship of a man and a woman for to be in error in malice does not hurt them but they profoundly feel that they are fools if they are duped she was aware of the recent course of events she had as she protested nothing to accuse herself of and she could hardly part her lips without a selfexculpation it will fall on me she said to tresten in her emphatic tone he will have his interview with the girl he will subdue the girl he will manacle himself in the chains he makes her wear she will not miss her chance i am the object of her detestation i am the price paid for their reconcilement she will seize her opportunity to vilipend me and i shall be condemned by the kind of courtmartial which hurries over the forms of a brial to sign the executionwarrant that makes it feel like justice you will see she cannot forgive me for not pretending to enter into her enthusiasm she will make him believe i conspired against her men in love are children with their mistressesthe greatest of them their heads are under the womans feet what have i not done to aid him at his instance i went to the archbishop to implore one of the princes of the church for succour i knelt to an ecclesiastic i did a ludicrous and a shameful thing knowing it in advance to be a barren farce i obeyed his wish the tale will be laughable i obeyed him i would not have it on my conscience that the commission of any deed ennomic however unwonted was refused by me to serve alvan you are my witness tresten that for a young woman of common honesty i was ready to pack and march qualities of mindmind they were out of the question he had a taste for a wife if he had hit on a girl commonly honest she might not have harmed himthe contrary cut his talons what is this girl exactly what one might be sure his appreciation in womanflesh would lead him to fix on a daughter of the philistines naturally and precisely the one of all on earth likely to confound him after marriage as she has played fast and loose with him before it he has never understood womencannot read them could a girl like that keep a secret shes a cressidaa creature of every camp not an idea of the cause he is vowed to not a sentiment in harmony with it she is viler than any of those berlin light o loves on the eve of jena stable as a viennese dancing slut home from mariazell this is the girl transparent to the whole world but his heart is on her and he must have her i suppose and i shall have to bear her impertinences or sign my demission and cease to labour for the cause at least in conjunction with alvan and how other wise he is the life of it and i am doomed to uselessness tresten nodded a protesting assent not quite so bad he said with the encouraging smile which could persuade a friend to put away bilious visions of the two if you two are divisible we could better dispense with him shell slip him shes an eel i have seen eels twine on a prong of the fork that prods them but shes an actress a slippery one through and through with no real embrace in her not even a common muscular contraction of every camp as you say she was not worth carrying off i consented to try it to quiet him he sets no bounds to his own devotion to friendship and we must take pattern by him its a mad love a titans love the baroness exclaimed groaning the womanno matter how or at what cost i can admire that primal barbarism of a great mans passion which counts for nothing the stains and accidents fraught with extinction for it to meaner men it reads ill it sounds badly but there is grand stuff in it see the royalty of the man for whom no degradation of the woman can be so long as it brings her to him hethat great hecovers all he burns her to ashes and takes the flamethe pure spirit of herto himself were men like himthey would have less to pardon we must as i have ever said be morally on alpine elevations to comprehend alvan he is mont blanc above his fellows do not ask him to be considerate of her she has planted him in a storm and the bigger the mountain the more savage monstrous cruelyes but she blew up the tourmente that girl is the author of his madness it is the snakes nature of the girl which distracts him she is in his blood had she come to me i would have helped her to cure him or had you succeeded in carrying her off i would have stood by their union or were she a different creature and not the shifty thing she is i could desire him to win her a peasant girl a workmans daughter a tradesmans a professional singer actress artisti would have given my hand to one of these in good faith thankful to her as it is i have acted in obedience to his wishes without idle remonstrances i know him too well and with as much cordiality as i could put into an evil service she will drag him down down tresten they are not joined yet said the colonel she has him by the worst half of him her correspondence with meher letter to excuse her insolence which she does like a prim chitthrows a light on the girl she is she will set him aiming at power to trick her out in the decorations she will not keep him to his labours to consolidate the power she will pervert the aesthetic in him through her hold on his material nature his vanity his luxuriousness she is one of the young women who begin timidly and when they see that they enjoy comparative impunity grow intrepid in dissipation and that palling they are ravenously ambitious she will drive him at his mark before the time is riperuinhim he is a titan not a god though god like he seems in comparison with men he would be fleshly enough in any hands this girl will drain him of all his nobler fire she shows mighty little of the inclination said the colonel to you but when they come together i know his voice the colonel protested his doubts of their coming together ultimately the baroness asked and brooded but she will have to see him and then will she resist him i shall change one view of her if she does she will shirk the interview tresten remarked supposing they meet i dont think much will come of it unless they meet on a field and he has an hours grace to catch her up and be off with her shes as calm as the face of a clock and wags her yes and no about him just as unconcernedly as a clocks pendulum ive spoken to many a sentinel outpost who wasnt deader on the subject in monosyllables than mademoiselle she has a military erectness and answers you and looks you straight at the eyes perfectly unabashed by your seeing the girl she is as you say she looked at me downright defying me to despise her alvan has been tricked by her colour shes icy she has no passion she acts up to him when theyre together and that deceives him i doubt her having bloodtheres no heat in it if she has and he cajoled count hollinger to send an envoy to see him righted the baroness ejaculated hollinger is not a sentimental person i assure you and not likely to have taken a step apparently hostile to the rudigers if he had not been extraordinarily shaken by alvan what character of man is this dr storchel tresten described count hollingers envoy so quaintly deputed to act the part of legal umpire in a family business as a mild man of law with no ideas or interests outside the law spectacled nervous formal a stranger to the passions and the baroness was amused to hear of storchel and alvans placid talk together upon themes of law succeeded by the little advocates bewildered fright at one of alvans gentler explosions tresten sketched it the baroness realized it and shut her lips tight for a laugh of essential humour chapter hiv late in the day alvan was himself able to inform her that he had overcome clotildes father after a struggle of hours the general had not consented to everything he had granted enough evidently in terror of the man who had captured count hollinger and it way arranged that tresten and storchel were to wait on clotilde next morning and hear from her mouth whether she yielded or not to alvans request to speak with her alone before the official interview in the presence of the notary when she was publicly to state her decision and freedom of choice according to count hollingers amicable arrangement through his envoy she will see meand the thing is done said alvan but i have worked for iti have worked i have been talking today for six hours uninterruptedly at a stretch to her father who reminds me of a caged bear i saw at a travelling menagerie and the beast would perform none of his evolutions for the edification of us lads till his keeper touched a particular pole and the touch of it set him to work like the winding of a key hollingers name was my magic wand with the general i could get no sense from him nor any acquiescence in sense till i called up hollinger when the generals alacrity was immediately that of the bear or a little boy castigated for his share of original sin they have been hard at her the whole family and i shall want the two hours i stipulated for to the full what do you saycome i wager i do it within one hour they have stockaded her pretty closely and it will be some time before i shall get her to have a clear view of me behind her defences but an hours an age with a woman clotilde i wager i have her on her knees in half an hour these notions of duty and station and her fiddlededee betrothal to that danube osier with indianidol eyes count for so much mist she was and is mine i swear to strike to her heart in ten minutes but madam if not you may pronounce me incapable of conquering any woman or of taking an absolute impression of facts i say i will do it i am insane if i may not judge from antecedents that my voice my touch my face will draw her to me at one signalat a look i am prepared to stake my reason on her running to me before i speak a wordand i will not beckon i promise to fold my arms and simply look your task of two hours then will be accomplished i compute in about half a minutebut it is on the assumption that she consents to see you alone said the baroness alvan opened his eyes he perceived in his deep sagaciousness woman at the bottom of her remark and replied you will know clotilde in time she points to me straight but of course if you agitate the compass the needles all in a tremble and the vessel is weak i admit but the instincts positive to doubt it would upset my understanding i have had three distinct experiences of my influence over her and each time curiously each time exactly in proportion to my degree of resolvebut baroness i tell you it was minutely in proportion to it weighed down to the graineach time did that girl respond to me with a similar degree of earnestness as i waned she waned as i heated so did she and from sparkheat to flame and to furnaceheat a refraction of the rays according to the altitude of the orb observed the baroness in a tone of assent and she smiled to herself at the condition of the man who could accept it for that he did not protest beyond presently a transient frown as at a bad taste on his tongue and a rather petulant objection to her use of analogies which he called the sapping of language she forbore to remind him in retort of his employment of metaphor when the figure served his purpose marvellously cried alvan marvellously that girl answered to my lead and tomorrowyoull own me righti must double the attraction i shall have to hand her back to her people for twentyfour hours and the dose must be doubled to keep her fast and safe you see i read her flatly i read and am charitable i have a perfect philosophical tolerance im in the mood today of horace hymning one of his fair greeks no no that is a comparison past my endurance interposed the baroness friend sigismund you have no philosophy you never had any and the small crow and croon of horace would be the last you could take up it is the chanted philosophy of comfortable stipendiaries retired merchants gouty patients on a restricted allowance of the grape old men who have given over thinking and young men who never had feelingthe philosophy of swine grunting their carmen as they turn to fat in the sun horace avaunt you have too much poetry in you to quote that unsanguine sensualist for your case his love distressed his liver and gave him a jaundice once or twice but where his love yields its poor ghost to his philosophy yours begins its labours that everlasting horace he is the versifier of the cushioned enemy not of us who march along flinty ways the piper of the bourgeois in soul poet of the conforming unbelievers pyrrha lydia lalage chloe glycera alvan murmured amorous of the musical names clotilde is a greek of one of the isles an ionian i see her in the horatian ode as in one of those old round shieldmirrors which give you a speck of the figure on a silversolar beam brilliant not much bigger than a dewdrop and so should a mans heart reflect her take her on the light in it she is perfection we wont take her in the shady part or on your flat lookingglasses there never was necessity for accuracy of line in the portraiture of women the idea of them is all we want its the best of them you will own shes greek shes a perinthian andrian olythian saurian messenian one of those delicious girls in the new comedy i remember was called the postponer the deferrer or as we might say the tomorrower there you have clotilde shes a tomorrower you climb the peak of tomorrow and to see her at all you must see her on the next peak but she leaves you her promise to hug on every yesterday and that keeps you going ay so we have patience feeding on a young womans promises of yesterday in ones fortieth yearit must end tomorrow though i kill something kill he meant the aerial wild spirit he could admire as her character when he had the prospect of extinguishing it in his grasp what do you meditate killing said the baroness the fool of the years behind me he replied and entering on my forty first a sage to be the mate and equal of your companion to prove i have had good training under the wisest to act as her guide and master if she the baroness checked her exclamation saying she declined to come to me i would have plumbed her for some solid ground something to rest ones faith on your pyrrhas glyceras and others of the like were not stable persons for a man of our days to bind his life to one of them harness is harness and a light yokefellow can make a proud career deviate but i give her a soul said alvan i am the wine and she the crystal cup she has avowed it again and again you read her as she is when away from me then she is a reed a weed what you will she is unfit to contend when she stands alone but when i am beside her when we are togetherthe moment i have her at arms length she will be part of me by the magic i have seen each time we encountered she knows it well she may know it too well for what he frowned for the chances of your meeting you think it possible she will refuse a blackness passing to lividness crossed his face he fetched a big breath then finish my history shut up the book i am a phantom of a man and everything written there is imposture i can account for all that she has done hitherto but not that she should refuse to see me not that she should refuse to see me now when i come armed to demand it refuse but i have done my work done what i said i would do i stand in my order of battle and she refuses no i stake my head on it i have not a clods perception i have not a spark of sense to distinguish me from a flatheaded lapp if she refusescall me a mountebank who has gained his position by clever tumbling a lucky gamester whatever plays blind with chance he started up in agitation lucie i am a grinning skull without a brain if that girl refuses she will not he took his hat to leave adding to seem rational to the cool understanding he addressed she will not refuse i am bound to think so in common respect for myself i have done tricks to make me appear a rageing ape if sheoh she cannot she will not refuse never i have eyes i have wits i am not tottering yet on my graveor its blindly if i am i have my clear judgement i am not an imbecile it seems to me a foolish suspicion that she can possibly refuse her manners are generally good freakish but good in the main perhaps she takes a sting but there is no sting here it would be bad manners to refuse to say nothing of she has a heart well then good manners and right feeling forbid her to refuse she is an exceedingly intelligent girl and i half fear i have helped you to a wrong impression of her you will really appreciate her wit you will indeed believe me you will we pardon nonsense in a girl married she will put on the matron with becoming decency and i am responsible for her then i stand surety for her then when i have her with me i warrant her mine and all mine head and heels at a whistle like the cossacks horse i fancy that at forty i am about as young as most young men i promise her another forty manful working years are you dubious of that i nod to you from the palsied summit of ninety said the baroness alvan gave a short laugh and stammered excuses for his naked egoism comparing himself to a forester who has sharpened such an appetite in toiling to slay his roe that he can think of nothing but the fire preparing the feast hymen and things hymenaeal he said laughing at himself for resuming the offence on the apology for it i could talk with interest of a trousseau i have debated in my mind with parliamentary acrimony about a choice of weddingpresents as she is legally free to bestow her hand on meand only a brutes horns could contest the factshe may decide to be married the day after tomorrow and get the trousseau in paris she has a turn for startling i can imagine that if i proposed a run for it she would be readier to spring to be on the road with me than in acquiescing in a quiet arrangement about a ceremonial day partly because in the first case she would throw herself and the rest of the adventure on me at no other cost than the enjoyment of one of her impulses and in the second because she is a girl who would require a full band of the best berlin orchestra in perpetual play to keep up her spirits among her people during the preparations for espousing a democrat demagogue and jew of a presumed inferior station by birth to her own give momus a sister clotilde is the lady i know her i would undertake to put a spell on her and keep her contented on a frontiernot russian any barbarous frontier where there is a sun she must have sun one might wrap her in sables but sun is best she loves it best though she looks remarkably well in sables never shall i forget she is frileuse and shivers into them there are frenchmen who could paint it only frenchmen our artists no she is very french born in france she would have been a matchless parisienne oh shes a riddle of course i dont pretend to spell every letter of her the returning of my presents is odd no i maintain that she is a coward acting under domination and theres no other way of explaining the puzzle i was out of sight they bullied her and she yieldedbewilderingly past comprehension it seemscatuntil you remember what shes made of shes a reed now i reappear armed with powers to give her a free course and she that abject whom you beheld recently renouncing me is you will see the young aurora she was when she came striking at my door on the upper alp that was a morning that morning is clotilde till my eyes turn over she is all young heaven and the mountains for me shes the filmy light above the mountains that weds white snow and sky by the way i dreamt last night she was half a woman half a tree and her hair was like a dead yewbough which is as you know of a brown burntout colour suitable to the popular conception of widows she stood and whatever turning you took you struck back on her whether my widow i cant say she must first be my wife oh for tomorrow what sort of evening is it said the baroness a mont blanc evening i saw him as i came along alvan replied and seized his hat to be out to look on the sovereign mountain again they touched hands he promised to call in the forenoon next day be cool she counselled him oh he flung back his head making light of the crisis after all its only a girl but you know what i set myself to win the things too smalli have been at such pains about it that i should be ridiculous if i allowed myself to be beaten there is no other reason for the trouble we re at except that as i have said a thousand times she suits me no man can be cooler than i keep so said the baroness he walked to where the strenuous blue lake finding outlet propels a shoulder like a brightmuscled athlete in action and makes the rhone stream there he stood for an hour disfevered by the limpid liquid tumult inspirited by the glancing volumes of a force that knows no abatement and is the skiey alps behind the great historic citied plains ahead his meditation ended with a resolution half in the form of a prayer to mixed deities undefined never to ask for a small thing any more if this one were granted him he had won it of course having brought all his powers to bear on the task and he rejoiced in winning it his heart leapt his imagination spun radiant webs of colour but he was a little ashamed of his frenzies though he did not distinctly recall them he fancied he had made some noise loud or not because his intentions were so pure that it was infamous to thwart them at a certain age honest men made sacrifice of their liberty to society and he had been ready to perform the duty of husbanding a woman a man should have a wife and rear children not to be forgotten in the land and to help mankind by transmitting to future times qualities he has proved priceless he thought of the children and yearned to the generations of men physically and morally through them this was his apology to the world for his distantlyrecollected excesses of temper was she so small a thing not if she succumbed she was petty vexatious irritating stinging while she resisted she cast an evil beam on his reputation strength and knowledge of himself and roused the giants of his nature to discharge missiles at her justified as they were by his pure intentions and the approbation of society but he had a broad full heart for the woman who would come to him forgiving her uplifting her richly endowing her no meanness of heart was in him he lay down at night thinking of clotilde in an abandonment of tenderness tomorrow you bird of tomorrow he let fly his goodnight to her chapter xv he slept near upon morning he roused with his tender fit strong on him but speechless in the waking as it had been dreamless in sleep it was a happy load on his breast a life about to be born and he thought that a wife beside him would give it language she should have for she would call out his thousand flitting ideas now dropped on barren ground for want of her fair bosom to inspire to vivify to receive poetry laid a hand on him his desire of the wife the children the citizens good nameof these our simple civilized ambitionswas lowly of the earth throbbing of earth and at the same time magnified beyond scope of speech in vast images and emblems resembling ranges of olympian cloud round the blue above earth all to be decipherable all utterable when she was by what commoner wordyet wife seemed to him the word most reverberating of the secret sought after by man fullest at once of fruit and of mystery or of that light in the heart of mystery which makes it magically fruitful he felt the presence of clotilde behind the word but in truth the delicate sensations breeding these halfthoughts of his as he lay between sleeping and waking shrank from conjuring up the face of the woman who had wounded them and a certain instinct to preserve and be sure of his present breathingspace of luxurious tranquillity kept her veiled soon he would see her as his wife and then she would be she unveiled ravishingly the only she the only wife he knew the cloud he clasped for clotilde enough to be at pains to shun a possible prospect of his execrating it oh the only she the only wife the wild mans reclaimer the sweet abundant valley and channel of his river of existence henceforward doubting her in the slightest was doubting her human it is the brain the satanic brain which will ever be pressing to cast its shadows the heart is clearer and truer he multiplied images projected visions nestled in his throbs to drug and dance his brain he snatched at the beauty of a day that outrolled the whole alpine handinhand of radiant heavenclimbers for an assurance of predestined celestial beneficence and again shadowily thoughtful of the littleness of the thing he exalted and claimed he staked his reason on the positive blessing to come to him before nightfall telling himself calmly that he did so because there would be madness in expecting it otherwise he asked for so little since he asked for so little to suppose that it would not be granted was irrational none but a very coward could hesitate to stake his all on the issue singularly small indeed the other aims in life appeared by comparison with this one but his intellect in the act of pleading excuses for his impatience distinguished why it should be so the crust which is not much is everything to the starving beggar and he was eager for the crust that he might become sound and whole again able to give their just proportion to things as at present he acknowledged himself hardly able to do he could not pursue two thoughts on a political question or grasp the idea of a salutary energy in the hosts animated by his leadership there would have to be an end of it speedily else men might name him worthless dog morning swam on the lake in her beautiful nakedness a wedding of white and blue of purest white and bluest blue alvan crossed the island bridges when the sun had sprung on his shivering fair prey to make the young fresh morning rosy and was glittering along the smooth lake waters workmen only were abroad and alvan was glad to be out with them to feel with them as one of them close beside him the vivid genius of the preceding century whose love of workmen was a salt of heaven in his human corruptness looked down on the lake in marble alvan cherished a worship of him as of one that had first thrilled him with the feeling of our common humanity with the tenderness for the poor with the knowledge of our frailty him as well as the great englishman and a frenchman his mind called father and his conscience replied to that progenitors questioning of him but said you know the love of woman he loved indeed but he was not an amatory trifler he too was a worker a champion worker he doated on the prospect of plunging into his work the vision of jolly giant labours told of peace obtained and there could be no peace without his prize he listened to the workmens footfalls the solitary sound and steady motion of their feet were eloquent of early morning in a city not less than the changes of light in heaven above the roofs with the golden light came numbers workmen still their tread on the stones roused some of his working thoughts like an old tune in his head and he watched the scattered files passing on disciplined by their daily necessities easily manageable if their necessities are but justly considered these numbers are the brute force of earth which must have the earth in time as they had it in the dawn of our world and then they entered into bondage for not knowing how to use it they will have it again they have it partially at times in the despot who is only the reflex of their brute force and can give them only a shadow of their claim they will have it all when they have illumination to see and trust to the leadership of a greater force than theyin force of brain in the spiritual force of ideas ideas founded on justice and not the justice of these days of the governing few whose wits are bent to steady our column of civilized humanity by a combination of props and jugglers arts but a justice coming of the recognized needs of majorities which will base the column on a broad plinth for safetybroad as the base of yonder mountains towering white immensityand will be the guarantee for the solid uplifting of our civilization at last right thou he apostrophizedthe old ironer at a point of his meditation and right thou more largely right he thought further advanced in it of the great giuseppe the genoese and right am i too between that metal rail of a politician and the deep dreamer each of them incomplete for want of an element of the other practically and in vision right was alvan for those two opposites met fusing in him like the former he counted on the supremacy of might like the latter he distinguished where it lay in perpetuity during his younger years he had been like neither in the moral curb they could put on themselvesparticularly the southernblooded man he had resembled the naturally impatient northerner most though not so supple for business as he but now he possessed the calmness of the genoese he had strong selfcommand now he had the principle that life is too short for the indulgence of public fretfulness or of private quarrels too valuable for fruitless risks too sacred one may say for the shedding of blood on personal grounds oh he had himself well under fear not he could give and take from opposition and rightly so seeing that he confessed to his own bent for sarcastically stinging he was therefore bound to endure a retort speech for speech pamphlet for pamphlet he could be temperate nay he defied an adversary to produce in him the sensation of intemperateness so there would not be much danger of his being excited to betray it shadowily he thought of the hard words hurled at him by the rudigers and of the injury clotildes father did him by plotting to rob him of his daughter but how had an alvan repliedwith the arts of peaceful fence victoriously he conceived of no temptation to his repressed irascibility save the political a day might come for him and the vehement old ironer to try their mettle in a tussle on that day he would have to be wary but as alvan felt assured he would be more master of himself than his antagonist he was for the young world in the brain of a new order of things the other based his unbending system on the visions of a feudal chief and would win a great step perchance but there he would stop he was not with the future this immediate prospect of a return to serenity after his recent charioteering had set him thinking of himself and his days to come which hung before him in a golden haze that was tranquillizing he had a name he had a station he wanted power and he saw it approaching he wanted a wife too colonel von tresten took coffee with him previous to the start with dr storchel to general von rudigers house alvan consequently was unable any longer to think of a wife in the abstract he wanted clotilde here was a man going straight to her going to see her positively to see her and hear her voicealmost instantly to hear her voice and see her eyes and hair touch her hand oh and rally her rouse her wit and be able to tell him the flower she wore for the day and where she wore itat her temples or sliding to the back hair or in her bosom or at her waist she had innumerable tricks of indication in these shifty pretty ways of hers and was full of varying speech to the cunning reader of her but keep her to seriousness alvan said our meeting must be early todayearly in the afternoon she is not unlikely to pretend to trifle she has not seen me for some time and will probably enough play at emancipation and speak of the singular impatience of the seigneur alvan dont you hear her i swear to those very words she loves her liberty and she curves her fan and taps her foot the seigneur alvan appears pressed for time she has letters to write to friends to day stop that i cant join in play tomorrow if she likes not to day or not till i have her by the hand she shall be elf and fairy french coquette whatever she pleases tomorrow and ill be satisfied all i beg is for plain dealing on a business matter this is a business matter a business meeting i thoroughly know the girls heart and know that in winning the interview i win her onlyhe pressed his friends armbut my dear tresten you understand youre a luckier fellow than ifor the time at all events make it as short as you can youll find me here i shall take a bookone of the pandects i dont suppose i shall work i feel idle any book handy anything will interest me i should walk or row on the lake but i would rather be sure of readiness for your return you meet storchel at the generals house the appointment was at the house tresten said i have not seen him this morning i know of nothing to prepare him for you see it was invariable with her as soon as she met me she had twice her spirit and that she knowsshe was a new woman ten times the happier for having some grains of my courage so shell be glad to come to terms and have me by to support her press it if necessary otherwise she might be disappointed my dear fellow storchel looks on and observes and that s about all he can do or need do up mont blanc today tresten its the very day for an ascentone of the rare crystalline jewels coming in a swiss august we should see the kingdoms of the earthand a republic but i could climb with all my heart in a snowstorm today andes on himalayas as high as you like the republic by the way small enough in the ring of empires and monarchies if you measure it geometrically you remember the laugh at the exact elevation of mount olympus but zeuss eagle sat on it and top me olympus after you have imagined the eagle aloft there after homer is the meaning that will be one of the lessons for our young republicansto teach them not to give themselves up to the embrace of dead materialism because as they fancy they have had to depend on material weapons for carving their way and have had no help from other quarters a suicidal delusion the spiritual weapon has done most and always does they are sons of an idea they deny their parentage when they scoff at idealism its a tendency we shall have to guard against it leads back to the old order of things if we do not trim our light she is waiting for you go you will find me here and dont forget my instructions appoint for the afternoonnot late too near night will seem like orpheus going below and i hope to meet a living woman not a ghostha coloured like a lantern in a cavern good lord covered with lichen say three oclock not later the reason is i want to have it over early and be sure of what i am doing im bothered by it i shall have to make arrangements a thousand little matters telegraph to paris i daresay shes fond of paris and i must learn whos there to meet her now start ill walk a dozen steps with you i think of her as if since we parted she had been sitting on a throne in erebus and must be ghastly i had a dream of a dead tree that upset me in fact you see i must have it over the whole affair makes me feel too young tresten advised him to spend an hour with the baroness i cant she makes me feel too old said alvan she talks she listens but i dont want to speak dead silencelet it be a dash of the pen till you return as for these good people hurrying to their traffic and tourists and loungers they have a trick for killing time without hurting him i wish i had i try to smother a minute and up the old fellow jumps quivering all over and threatening me body and soul they dont appear as if they had news on their faces this morning ive not seen a newspaper and wont look at one here we separate be formal in mentioning me to her but be particularly civil i know you have the right tone shes a critical puss days like these are the days for her to be out there goes a parasol like one i ve seen her carry stay no dont forget my instructions paris for a time it may be the pyrenees paris on our way back she would like the pyrenees its not too late for society at luchon and cauterets she likes mountains she mounts well in any case plenty of mules can be had paris to wind up with paris will be fuller about the beginning of october he had quitted tresten and was talking to himself cheating himself not discordantly at all the poet of the company within him claimed the word and was allowed by the others to dilate on clotildes likings and the honeymoon or posthoneymoon amusements to be provided for her in pyrenean valleys and parisian theatres and salons she was friande of chocolates bonbons she enjoyed fine pastry had a real relish of good wine she should have the best of everything he knew the spots of the very best that paris could supply in confiseurs and restaurants and in millinery likewise a lively recollection of the prattle of parisian ladies furnished names and addresses likely to prove invaluable to clotilde he knew actors and actresses and managers of theatres and mighty men in letters she should have the cream of paris does she hint at rewarding him for his trouble the thought of her indebted lips half closed asking him how to repay him sprang his heart to his throat chapter xvi then he found himself saying at the age i touch at the age of forty men that love love rootedly if the love is plucked from them the life goes with it he backed on his physical pride a stout bulwark his forty yearsthe forty the fifty the sixty of alvan matched the twenties and thirties of other men still it was true that he had reached an age when the desire to plant his affections in a dear fair bosom fixedly was natural fairer dearer than she was never one on earth he stood bareheaded for coolness looking in the direction tresten had taken his forehead shining and eyes charged with the electrical activity of the mind reading intensely all who passed him without a thought upon any of these objects in their passage the people were read penetrated and flung off as from a whirring of wheels to cut their place in memory sharp as in steel when imagination shall by and by renew the throbbing of that hour if the wheels be not stilled the world created by the furnaces of vitality inside him absorbed his mind and strangely while receiving multitudinous vivid impressions he did not commune with one was unaware of them his thick black hair waved and glistened over the fine aquiline of his face his throat was open to the breeze his great breast and head were joined by a massive column of throat that gave volume for the coursing of the blood to fire the battery of thought perchance in a tempest overflood it extinguish it his fortieth year was written on his complexion and presence it was the fortieth of a giant growth that will bend at the past eightieth as little as the rockpine should there come no uprooting tempest it said manhood and breathed of settled strength of muscle nerve and brain of the people passing many knew him not but marked him some knew him by repute one or two his person to all of them he was a noticeable figure even those of sheeplike nature having an inclination to start upon the second impulse in the flanks of curious sheep when their first had been arrested by the appearance of one not of their kind acknowledged the eminence of his bearing there may have been a passenger in the street who could tell the double tale of the stick he swung in his hand showing a gleam of metal whereon were engraved names of the lurid historic original owner and of the donor and the recipient according to the political sentiments of the narrator would his tale be coloured and a simple walkingstick would be clothed in tarquin guilt for striking off heads of the upper ranks of frenchmen till the blood of them topped the handle or else wear hues of wonder seem very memorable fit at least for a museum if the christian aristocrat might shrink from it in terror and loathing the paynim republican of deep dye would be ready to kiss it with veneration but assuming them to have a certain bond of manliness both agree in pronouncing the deed a right valiant and worthy one which caused this instrument to be presented to alvan by a famous doctor who hearing of his repudiation of the duel and of his gallant and triumphant defence of himself against a troop of ruffians enemies or scum of their city at night by the aid of a common stout pedestrian stick alone in a dark alley of the public park sent him duly mounted and engraved an illustrious fellow to the weapon of defence as a mode of commemorating his just abhorrence of bloodshed and his peaceful bravery observers of him would probably speculate on his features and the carriage of his person as he went by them with a result in their minds that can be of no import to us mens general speculations being directed by their individual aims and their moods their timidities prejudices envies rivalries but none could contest that he was a potential figure if to know him the rising demagogue of the time dressed him in such terrors as to make him appear an impending attila of the voracious hordes which live from hand to mouth without intervention of a banker and property to cry truce to the wolf he would have shone under a different aspect enough to send them to the poets to solve their perplexity had the knowledge been subjoined that this terrific devastator swinging the sanguinary stick was a slave of love who staked his all upon his love loved up to his capacity desperately loved a girl and hung upon her voice to hear whether his painful knocking at a door should gain him admittance to the ranks of the orderly citizens of the legitimately satiated passions or elsethe voice of a girl annihilate him he loved like the desertbred eastern as though his blood had never ceased to be steeped in its fountain orient loved barbarously but with a compelling resolve to control his blood and act and be the civilized man sober by virtue of his ladys gracious aid in fact it was the civilized man in him that had originally sought the introduction to her with a bribe to the untameable the former had once led and hoped to lead again alvan was a revolutionist in imagination the workmans friend in rational sympathy their leader upon mathematical calculation but a lawyer a reasoner in law and therefore of necessity a cousin germane leaning to become an ally of the philistinesthe founders and main supporters of his book of the law and so between the nature of his blood and the inclination of his mind alvan set his heart on a damsel of the philistines endowed with their trained elegancies and governed by some of their precepts but suitable to his wildness in her reputation for originality suiting him in her cultivated liveliness and her turn for luxury only the philistines breed these choice beauties put forth these delicate fresh young buds of girls and only here and there among them is there an exquisite eccentric yet passably decorous clotilde what his brother politicians never discovered in him and the baroness partly suspected through her interpretation of things opposing her sentiments clotilde uncloaks catching and mastering her his wilder animation may be appeased but his political life is threatened with a diversion of its current for he will be uxorious impassioned to gratify the tastes and whims of a youthful wife the republican will be in danger of playing prematurely for power to seat her beside him high while at the same time children perchance and his hardening lawyers head are secretly philistinizing the demagogue blunting the fine edge of his radicalism turning him into a slowstepping liberal otherwise your halfconservative in his convictions can she think it much to have married that drabcoloured unit power must be grasped his watch told him that tresten was now beholding her or just about to the stillness of the heavens was remarkable the hour held breath she delayed her descent from her chamber he saw how she touched at her hair more distinctly than he saw the lake before his eyes he watched her and the growl of a coming roar from him rebuked her tricky deliberateness deciding at last she slips down the stairs like a waterfall and is in the room erect composedif you do not lay ear against her bosom tresten stares at her owns she is worth a struggle love does this friend tresten love that stamps out prejudice and bids inequality be smooth tresten stares and owns she is worth heavier labours worse than his friend has endured love does it love that hallows a strangers claim to the flower of a proud garden love has won her the freedom to suffer herself to be chosen by the stranger what matters which of them toiled to bring them to so sweet an end it was not either of them but love by and by after acting serenest innocent suddenly broken she will be copious of sad confessions that will be in their secresy in the close and boundless together of clasped hands deep eyes that give him in realms of light within light all that he has dreamed of rapturousness and blessedness you are threatened with a blinding kiss if you look abashedif her voice shall dare repeat another of those foolish selfreproaches it shall be construed as a petition for further kisses silence he said to her imagining that he had been silent and enjoying silence with a perfect quietude beyond the trouble of a thought of her kisses and his happiness his full heart craved for the infinity of silence another moment and he was counting to her the days hours minutes which had been the gulf of torture between then and nowthe separation and the reunion he was voluble living to speak and a pause was only for the drawing of most blissful breath his watch went slowly she was beginning to drop her eyelids in front of tresten oh he knew her so well he guessed the length of her acting and the time for her earnestness she would have to act a coquette at first to give herself a countenance and who would not pardon the girl for putting on a mask who would fail to see the mask but he knew her so well she would not trifle very long his life on it that she will soon falter her bosom will lift lift and check a word from tresten then if he is a friend and she melts to the truth in her alvan heard her saying i will see him yes today let him appoint he may come when he likescome at once my life on it he swore by his unerring knowledge of her the certainty that she loved him he had walked into a quarter of the town strange to him he thought he had no recollection of the look of the street a friend came up and put him in the right way walking back with him this was general leczel a famous leader of one of the heroical risings whose passage through blood and despair have led to the broader law men ask for when they name freedom devotedly alvan stated the position of his case to leczel with continental frankness regarding a natural theme and then pursued the talk on public affairs to the note of what but knocks will ever open the blackyellow head to the fact that we are no longer in the first years of the eighteenth century leczel left him at his hotel steps promising to call on him before night tresten had not returned neither he nor the advocate and he had been absent fully an hour he was not in sight right or left alvan went to his room looked at his watch and out of the window incapable of imagining any event he began to breathe as if an atmosphere thick as water were pressing round him unconsciously he had staked his all on the revelation the moment was to bring so little a thing his intellect weighed the littleness of it but he had become level with it he magnified it with the greatness of his desire and such was his nature that the great desire of a thing withheld from him and his own as he could think made the world a whirlpool till he had it he waited figureable by nothing so much as a wild horse in captivity sniffing the breeze when the flanks of the quivering beast are like a windstruck barleyfield and his nerves are cords and his nostrils trumpet him he is flame kept under and straining to rise chapter xvii the baroness expected to see alvan in the morning for he kept appointments and he had said he would come she conceived that she was independent of personal wishes on the subject of clotilde the fury of his passion prohibited her forming any of the wishes we send up to destiny when matters interesting us are in suspense whether we have liberated minds or not she thought the girl would grant the interview was sure the creature would yield in his presence and then there was an end to the shining of alvan supposing the other possibility he had shown her such fierce illuminations of eye and speech that she foresaw it would be a blazing of the insurrectionary beaconfires of hell with him he was a man of angels and devils the former had long been conquering but the latter were far from extinct his passion for this shallow girl had consigned him to the lower host let him be thwarted his desperation would be unlikely to stop at legal barriers his lawyers head would be up and armed astoundingly to oppose the law he would read argue and act with hot conviction upon the reverse of every text of law she beheld him storming the fathers house to have out clotilde reluctant or conniving and he harangued the people he bore off his captive he held her firmly as he had sworn he would he defied authority he was a public rebelhe with his detected little secret aim which he nursed like a shamed mother of an infant fond but afraid to be proud of it she had seen that he aimed at standing well with the world and being one with it honourably holding to his principles of course but a disposition that way had been perceived and the vision of him in open rebellion because of his shy catching at the thread of an alliance with the decorous world carved an ironic line on her jaw full surely he would not be baffled without smiting the world on the face and he might suffer for it the rudigers would suffer likewise she considered them very foolish people her survey of the little nobility beneath her station had previously enabled her to account for their disgust of such a suitor as alvan and maintain that they would oppose him tooth and nail owing to his recent success the anticipation of a peaceful surrender to him seemed now on the whole to carry most weight this girl gives alvan her hand and her family repudiate her volatile flippant shallow as she is she must have had some turn for him a physical spell was on her once and it will be renewed when they meet it sometimes inspires a semblance of courage she may determine she may be stedfast long enough for him to take his measures to bear her away and the brocken witches congratulate him on his prize almost better would it be she thought that circumstance should thwart him and kindle his own demon element the forenoon the noon the afternoon went round late in the evening her door was flung wide for colonel von tresten she looked her interrogative well his features were not used to betray the course of events how has it gone she said he replied as i told you i fancied i gauged the hussy pretty closely she will not see him not she the baroness crossed her arms and alvan the colonel shrugged it was not done to tease a tremulous woman for she was calm it painted the necessary consequence of the refusal an explosion of aetna and she saw it where is he now said she at his hotel alone leczel is with him that looks like war tresten shrugged again it might have been foreseen by everybody concerned in the affair the girl does not care for him one corner of an eye she stood up before us cool as at a dancinglesson swore she had never committed herself to an oath to him sneered at him she positively sneered her manner to me assures me without question that if he had stood in my place she would have insulted him scarcely she would do in his absence what she would not do under his eyes remarked the baroness its decided then quite will he be here tonight i think not was she really insolent for a girl in her position she was did you repeat her words to him some of them what description of insolence she spoke of his vanity proceed it was more her manner to me as the one of the two appearing as his friend she was tolerably civil to storchel and the difference of behaviour must have been designed for she not only looked at storchel in a way to mark the difference she addressed him rather eagerly before we turned on our heels to tell him she would write to him and let him have her reply in a letter he will get some coquettish rigmarole that seems monstrousif one could be astonished by her said the baroness when is she to write she may write the letter will find no receiver said tresten significantly raising his eyebrows the legal gentleman is goneblown from a gun hes off home he informed me that he should write to the general throwing up his office and an end to his share in the business there was no rudeness to the poor man dear me no but imagine a quiet little advocate very precise and silkyyouve had a hint of himand all of a sudden the client he has by the ear swells into a tremendous beasta combination of lion and elephantbellows and shakes the room stops and stamps before him discharging an unintelligible flood of racy vernacular punctuated in thunder you hear him and see him alvan lost his headsome of his hair too the girl is not worth a lock but hes past reason he takes it so said the baroness musing it will be the sooner over she never cared for him a jot and theres the sting he has called up the whole world in an amphitheatre to see a girl laugh him to scorn hard for any man to bearalvan of all men why does he not come here he might rage at me for a day and a night and i would rock him to sleep in the end however he has done nothing that was the point the baroness perceived it to be a serious point and repeated the question sharply has he been to the houseno writing tresten dropped a nod not to the girl i suppose to the father said she he has written to the general you should have stopped it tell a vedette to stop cavalry youre not thinking of the man hes in a white frenzy i will go to him you will do wrong leave him to spout the stuff and get rid of his poison i remember a sister of poor nuciottis going to him after he had let his men walk into a trapand that was through a woman and he was quieted and the chief overlooked it and two days after nuciotti blew his brains out hed have been alive now if he had been left alone furious cursing is a natural relief to some men like womens weeping he has written a savage letter to her father sending the girl to the deuce with the name she deserves and challengeing the general that letter is despatched rudiger has it by this time the baroness fixed her eyes on tresten she struck her lap alvan is it he but the general is old gouty out of the lists there can be no fighting he apologized to you for his daughters insolence to me he will not fight be sure perhaps not tresten said as for the girl alvan has the fullest right to revile her it cannot be too widely known i could cry what wisdom there is in men when they are mad we must allow it to counterbalance breaches of ordinary courtesy with the nameshe deserves you say he pitched the very name at her character plainlycalled her what she is the baroness could have borne to hear it she had no feminine horror of the staining epithet for that sex but a sense of the distinction between camps and courts restrained the soldier he spoke of a discharge of cuttlefish ink at the character of the girl and added the baths a black one for her and they had better keep it private regrettable no doubt but it s probably true and he s out of his mind it would be dangerous to check him hed force his best friend to fight leczel is with him and gives him head it s about time for me to go back to him for there may be business the baroness thought it improbable she was hoping that with alvans eruption the dropscene would fall tresten spoke of the possibility he knew the contents of the letter and knew further that a copy of it with none of the pregnant syllables expunged had been forwarded to prince marko he counselled calm waiting for a certain number of hours the baroness committed herself to a promise to wait now that alvan had broken off from the baleful girl the worst must have been passed she thought he had broken with the girl she reviewed him under the light of that sole fact so the edge of the cloud obscuring him was lifted and he would again be the man she prized and hoped much of how thickly he had been obscured was visible to her through a retreating sensation of scorn of him for his mad excesses which she had not known herself to entertain while he was writhing in the toils and very bluntly and dismissingly felt now that his madness was at its climax an outrageous lunatic fit that promised to release him from his fatal passion seemed on the contrary respectable in essence if not in the display wives he should have by fifties and hundreds if he wanted them she thought in her great heartedness reflecting on the one whose threatened pretensions to be his mate were slain by the title flung at her and merited the word she could guess it was an impassable gulf a wound beyond healing it pronounced in a single breath the girls right name and his pledge of a return to sanity for it was the insanest he could do it uttered anathema on his love of her it painted his white glow of unreason and fierce ire at the scorn which her behaviour flung upon every part of his character that was tenderest with him after speaking such things a man comes to his senses or he dies so thought the baroness and she was not more than commonly curious to hear how the rudigers had taken the insult they had brought on themselves and not unwilling to wait to see alvan till he was cool his vanity when threatening to bleed to the death would not be civil to the surgeon before the second or third dressing of his wound chapter xviii in the house of the rudigers there was commotion clotilde sat apart from it locked in her chamber she had performed her crowning act of obedience to her father by declining the interview with alvan and as a consequence she was full of grovelling revolt two things had helped her to carry out her engagement to submit in this final instance of dutifulnessone was the sight of that hateful rigid face and glacier eye of tresten the other was the loophole she left for subsequent insurgency by engaging to write to count hollingers envoy dr storchel she had gazed most earnestly at him that he might not mistake her meaning and the little mans pair of spectacles had she fancied been dim he was touched here was a friend here was the friend she required the external aid the fresh evasion the link with alvan now to write to him to bind him to his beautiful human emotion by contrast with the treacherous tresten whose iciness roused her to defiance the nervous little advocate seemed an emissary of the skies and she invoked her treasurestores of the cravens craftiness in revolt to compose a letter that should move him melt the good angel to espouse her cause he was to be taught to understandnay angelically he would understand at oncewhy she had behaved apparently so contradictorily fettered cruelly constrained by threats and wily sermons upon her duty to her family terrorized a prisoner beside this blue lake in sight of the sublimest scenery of earth and hating his associatehating him she repeated and underscoredshe had belied herself she was willing to meet alvan she wished to meet him she could open her heart to alvans true friendhis only true friend he would instantly discern her unhappy plight in the presence of his associate she could explain nothing do nothing but what she had done he had frozen her she had good reason to know that man for her enemy she could prove him a traitor to alvan certain though she was from the first moment of dr storchels integrity and kindness of heart she had stood petrified before him as if affected by some wicked spell she owned she had utterly belied herself she protested she had been no free agent the future labours in her cause were thrown upon dr storchels shoulders but with such compliments to him on his mission from above as emissary angels are presumed to be sensibly affected by the letter was long involved rather eloquent when she forgot herself and wrote herself and intentionally very feminine after the manner of supplicatory ladies appealing to lawyers whom they would sway by the feeble artlessness of a sex that must confide in their possession of a heart their heads being too awful she was directing the letter when marko romaris gave his name outside her door he was her intimate her trustiest ally he was aware of her design to communicate with dr storchel and came to tell her it would be a waste of labour he stood there singularly pale and grave unlike the sprightly slave she petted on her search for a tyrant too late he said pointing to the letter she held dr storchel has gone she could not believe it for storchel had informed her that he would remain three days her powers of belief were more heavily taxed when marko said alvan has challenged your father to fight him with that he turned on his heel he had to assist in the deliberations of the family she clasped her temples the collision of ideas driven together by alvan and a duelalvan challengeing her fatheralvan the contemner of the senseless appeal to arms for the settlement of personal disputes darkened her mind she ran about the house plying all whom she met for news and explanations but her young brother was absent her sisters were ignorant and her parents were closeted in consultation with the gentleman at night marko sent her word that she might sleep in peace for things would soon be arranged and her father had left the city she went to her solitude to study the hard riddle of her shattered imagination of alvan the fragments would not suffer joining they assailed her in huge heaps and she did not ask herself whether she had ever known him but what disruption it was that had unsettled the reason of the strongest man alive at times he came flashing through the scud of her thoughts magnificently in person and how to stamp that splendid figure of manhood on a madmans conduct was the task she supposed herself to be attempting while she shrank from it and worshipped the figure abhorred the deed she could not unite them he was like some great cathedral organ foully handled in the night by demons he whose lucent reason was an unclouded sky over every complexity of our sphere he to crave to fight to seek the lifeblood of the father of his beloved more unintelligible than this was it to reflect that he must know the challenge to be of itself a bar to his meeting his clotilde ever again she led her senses round to weep and produced a state of mental drowning for a truce to the bitter riddle quiet reigned in the household next day and for the length of the day her father had departed her mother treated her vixenishly snubbing her for a word but the ugly business of yesterday seemed a matter settled and dismissed alvan then had been appeased he was not a man of blood he was the humanest of men she was able to reconstruct him under the beams of his handsome features and his kingly smile she could occasionally conjure them up in their vividness but had she not in truth been silly to yield to spite and send him back the photographs of him with his presents so that he should have the uttermost remnant of the gifts he asked for had he really asked to have anything back she inclined to doubt all that had been done and said since their separation if only it were granted her to look on a photograph showing him as he was actually before their misunderstanding the suntracing would not deceive as her own tricks of imageing might do seeing him as he was then the hour would be revivedshe would certainly feel him as he lived and breathed now thus she fancied on the effort to get him to her heart after the shock he had dealt it for he had become almost a stranger as a god that has taken human shape and character next to the sight of alvan her friend marko was welcome the youth visited her in the evening and with the glitter of his large black eyes bent to her and began talking incomprehensibly of leavetaking and farewell until she cried aloud that she had riddles enough one was too much what had he to say she gave him her hand to encourage him she listened and soon it was her hand that mastered his in the grasp though she was putting questions incredulously with an understanding duller than her instinct or how if the frightful instinct while she listened shot lightnings in her head whose revelations were too intelligible to be looked at we think it devilish when our old nature is incandescent to talk to us in this way kindled by its vilest in hoping hungering and fearing and we call on the civilized mind to disown it the tightened grasp of her hand confessed her understanding of the thing she pressed to hear repeated for the sake of seeming to herself to repudiate it under an accumulating horror at the same time that the repetition doubly and trebly confirmed it so as to exonerate her criminal sensations by casting the whole burden on the material fact marko with her fathers consent and the approval of the friends of the family had taken up alvans challenge that was the tale she saw him dead in the act of telling it what she cried what and then you and her fingers were bonier in their clutch let me hear it cant be she snapped at herself for not pitying him more but a sword had flashed to cut her gordian knot she her saw him dead the obstacle removed the man whom her parents opposed to alvan swept away she saw him as a black gate breaking to a flood of light she had never invoked it never wished never dreamed it but if it was to be oh impossible one of us is crazy you to fight they put it upon you you fight him but it is cruel it is abominable incredible you have accepted the challenge you say he answered that he had and gazed into her eyes for love she blinked over them crying out against parents and friends for their heartlessness in permitting him to fight this is positive this is really true she said burning and dreading to realize the magical change it pointed on and touching him with her other hand loathing herself loathing parents and friends who had brought her to the plight of desiring some terrible event in sheer necessity not she it was the situation they had created which was guilty by dint of calling out on their heartlessness and a spur of conscience she roused the feeling of compassion but marko marko poor child you cannot fight you have never fired a pistol or a gun in your life your health was always too delicate for these habits of men and you could not pull a trigger taking aim do you not know i have been practising for a couple of hours today he said compassion thrilled her a couple of hours unhappy boy but do you not know that he is a dead shot he is famous for his aim he never misses he can do all the duellists wonders both with sword and pistol and that is why he was respected when he refused the duel because he before these parents of mine drove him and me i think we are both madhe despised duelling he he alvan who has challenged my father i have heard him speak of duelling as cowardly but what is he what has he changed to and it would be cowardly to kill you marko i take my chance marko said you have no chance his aim is unerring she insisted on the deadliness of his aim and dwelt on it with a gloating delight that her conscience approved for she was persuading the youth to shun his fatal aim if you stood against him he would not spare youperhaps not i fear he would not as far as i know him now he can be terrible in wrath i think he would warn you but two men face to face and he suspecting that you cross his path find some way of avoiding him do i entreat you by your love of me oh no blood i do not want to lose you i could not bear it would you regret me said he her eyes fell on his and the beauty of those great dark eyes made her fondness for him legible he caused her a spasm of anguish foreknowing him doomed she thought that haply this devoted heart was predestined to be the sacrifice which should bring her round to alvan she murmured phrases of dissuasion until her hollow voice broke she wept for being speechless and turned upon providence and her parents in railing at whom a voice of no ominous empty sound was given her and still she felt more warmly than railing expressed only her voice shrank back from a tone of feeling she consoled herself with the reflection that utterance was inadequate besides her active good sense echoed marko ringingly when he cited the usages of their world and the impossibility of his withdrawing or wishing to withdraw from the line of a challenge accepted it was destiny she bowed her head lower and lower oppressed without and within unwilling to look at him she did not look when he left her the silence of him encouraged her head to rise she stared about his phantom seemed present and for a time she beheld him both upright in life and stretched in death it could not be her fault that he should die it was the fatality how strange it was providence after bitterly misusing her offered this reparation through the death of marko possibly she ought to run out and beseech alvan to spare the innocent youth she stood up trembling on her legs she called to alvan do not put blood between us oh i love you more than ever why did you let that horrible man you take for a friend come here i hate him and cannot feel my love of you when i see him he chills me to the bone he made me say the reverse of what was in my heart but spare poor marko you have no cause for jealousy you would be above it if you had do not aim fire in the air do not let me kiss that hand and think she sank to her chair exclaiming i am a prisoner she could not walk two steps she was imprisoned by the interdict of the house and the paralysis of her limbs providence decreed that she must abide the result dread power to be dragged to her happiness through a river of blood was indeed dreadful but the devotional sense of reliance upon hidden wisdom in the direction of human affairs when it appears considerate of our wishes inspirited her to be ready for what providence was about to do mysterious in its beneficence that it was it is the dark goddess fortune to the craven the craven with desires will offer up bloody sacrifices to it submissively the craven with desires expecting to be blest is a zealot of the faith which ascribes the direction of events to the outer world her soul was in full song to that contriving agency and she with the paralyzed limbs became practically active darting here and there over the room burning letters packing a portable bundle of clothes in preparation for the domestic confusion of the morrow when the body of marko would be driven to their door and amid the wailing and the hubbub she would escape unnoticed to alvan providenceguided out of the house would then signify assuredly to alvans arms the prospect might have seemed too heavenly to be realizable had she not been sensible of paying heavily for it and thus as he would wish to be was marko of double service to her for she was truly fond of the beautiful and chivalrous youth and far from wishing to lose him his blood was on the heads of those who permitted him to face the danger she would have felt for him still more tenderly if it were permitted to a womans heart to enfold two men at a time this it would seem she cannot do she is compelled by the painful restriction sadly to consent that one of them should be swept away night passed dragging and galloping in the very early light she thought of adding some ornaments to her bundle of necessaries she learnt of the object of her present faith to be provident on her own behalf and dressed in two of certain garments which would have swollen her bundle too much this was the day of providence she had strung herself to do her part in it and gone through the pathos of her fatalism above stairs in her bedroom before marko took his final farewell of her so she could speak her heaven be with you unshaken though sadly her father had returned to be away from him and close to her bundle she hurried to her chamber and awaited the catastrophe like one expecting to be raised from the vaults carriage wheels would give her the first intimation of it slow very slow would imply badly wounded she thought dead if the carriage stopped some steps from the house and one of the seconds of the poor boy descended to make the melancholy announcement she could not but apprehend the remorselessness of the decree death it would probably be alvan had resolved to sweep him off the earth she could not blame alvan for his desperate passion though pitying the victim of it in any case the instant of the arrival of the carriage was her opportunity marked by the finger of providence rendered visible and she sat rocking her parcel on her lap her love of alvan now was mixed with an alluring terror of him as an immediate deathdealer who stood against redstreaked heavens more grandly satanic in his angry mightiness than she had ever realized that figure and she trembled and shuddered fearing to meet him yearning to be taken to him to close her eyes on his breast in blindest happiness she gave the very sob for the occasion a carriage drove at full speed to the door full speed could not be the pace for a funeral load that was a visitor to her father on business she waited for fresh wheels telling herself she would be patient and must be ready her pathos ways ready and scarcely controllable the tear thickened on her eyelid as she projected her mind on the grief she would soon be undergoing for marko or at least she would undergo it subsequently she would certainly mourn for him she dared not proceed to an accumulated enumeration of his merits as her knowledge of the secret of pathos knew to be most moving in an extreme fear that she might weaken her required energies for action at the approaching signal feet came rushing up the stairs her door was thrown open and the living marko stranger than a dead stood present he had in his look an expectation that she would be glad to behold him and he asked her and she said oh yes she was glad of course she was glad that alvan had pardoned him for his rashness she was vexed that her projected confusion of the household had been thwarted vexed petrified with astonishment but how if i tell you that alvan is wounded he almost wept to say clotilde informs the world that she laughed on hearing this she was unaware of her ground for laughing it was the laugh of the tragic comedian could one believe in a providence capable of letting such a sapling and weakling strike down the most magnificent stature upon earth youhim she said in the tremendous compression of her contempt she laughed the world is upside downa world without light or pointing finger or affection for special favourites and therefore bereft of all mysterious and attractive wisdom a crazy world a corpse of a worldif this be true but it can still be disbelieved he stood by her dejectedly and she sent him flying with a repulsive leave me the youth had too much on his conscience to let him linger his manner of going smote her brain was it credible was it possible to think of alvan woundedthe giant laid on his back and in the hands of the leech assuredly it was a mockery of all calculations she could not conjure up the picture of him and her emotions were merely struck and stunned if this be true but it can be resolutely disbelieved we can put it before providence to cleanse itself of this thing or suffer the consequence that we now and for ever quit our worship lose our faith in it and our secret respect she heard markos tale confirmed whispers of leaden import physicians rumours and she doubted she clung insanely to her incredulity laughter had been slain but not her belief in the invincibility of alvan she could not imagine him overthrown in a conflictand by a hand that she had taken and twisted in her womans hand subduingly he the unerring shot laid low by one who had never burnt powder till the day before the duel it was easier to remain incredulous notwithstanding the gradational distinctness of the whispers she dashed her impossible at providence conceived the tale in wilful and almost buoyant self deception to be a conspiracy in the family to hide from her alvans magnanimous dismissal of poor marko from the field of strife that was the most evident fact she ran through delusion and delusion exhausting each and hugging it after the false life was out so violent was the opposition to reason in the idea of alvans descending to the duel and falling by the hand of marko that it cried to be rebutted by laughter and she could not she could laugh no more nor imagine laughing though she could say of the people of the house they act it well and hate them for the serious whispering air and the dropping of medical terms and weights of drugs which robbed her of what her instinct told her was the surest weapon for combating deception them however and their acting she could have with stood enough to silently discredit them through sheer virulence of a hatred that proved them to be duly credited but her savage wilfulness could not resist the look of marko she had to yield up her breast to the truth and stimulate further unbelief lest her loaded heart should force her to run to the wounded lions bedside and hear his reproaches she had to cheat her heart and the weak thing consented to it loathing her for the imposture seeing marko too assured of it by his broken look the terrible mournfulness less than the horrible irony of the truth gnawed within her it spoke to her in metal not in flesh it haunted her feelings and her faint imaginations alienly it discoloured it scorned the earth and earths teachings and the understanding of life rational clearness at all avenues was blurred by it the thought that alvan lay wounded and in danger was one thought that marko had stretched him there was quite another and was a livid eclipsing thought through which her grief had to work its way to get to heat and a state of burning she knew not in truth what to feel the cravens dilemma when yet feeling much anger at providencerose uppermost she had so shifted and wound about and so pulled her heart to pieces that she could no longer sanely and with wholeness encounter a shock she had no sensation firm enough to be stamped by a signet even on the fatal third day when marko white as his shrouded antagonist led her to the garden of the house and there said the word of death an execrating amazement framing the thought why is it not alvan who speaks rose beside her gaping conception of her loss she framed it as an earnest interrogation for the half minute before misery had possession of her coming down like a cloud providence then was too shadowy a thing to upbraid she could not blame herself for the intensity of her suffering testified to the bitter realness of her love of the dead man her cravens instinct to make a sacrifice of others flew with claws of hatred at her parents these she offered up and the spirit presiding in her appears to have accepted them as proper substitutes for her conscience chapter xix alvan was dead the shot of his adversary accidentally welldirected had struck him mortally he died on the morning of the third day after the duel there had been no hope that he could survive and his agonies made a speedy dissolution desirable by those most wishing him to live the baroness had her summons to hurry to him after his first swoon she was his nurse and late confidante a tearless woman rigid in service death relaxed his hold in her hand he met his fate like the valiant soul he was haply if he had lingered without the sweats of bodily tortures to stay reflectiveness he also in the strangeness of his prostration might have cast a thought on the irony of the fates felling a man like him by a youngsters hand and for a shallow girl he might have fathered some jest at life with rueful relish of the flavour for such is our manner of commenting on ourselves when we come to shipwreck through unseaworthy pretensions there was no interval on his passage from anguish to immobility silent was that house of many chambers that mass of humanity profusely mixed of good and evil of generous ire and mutinous of the passion for the future of mankind and vanity of person magnanimity and sensualism high judgement reckless indiscipline chivalry savagery solidity fragmentariness was dust the two men composing it the untamed and the candidate for citizenship in mutual dissension pulled it down he perished of his weakness but it was a strong man that fell if his end was unheroic the blot does not overshadow his life his end was a derision because the animal in him ran him unchained and bounding to it a stormy blood made wreck of a splendid intelligence yet they that pronounce over him the ordinary fatalistic epitaph of the foregone and done which is the wisdom of men measuring the dead by the last word of a lamentable history should pause to think whether fool or madman is the title for one who was a zealous worker respected by great heads of his time acknowledged the head of the voluminous coil of the working people and who as we have seen insensibly though these wrought within him was getting to purer fires through his coarser when the final intemperateness drove him to ruin as little was he the vanished god whom his working people hailed deploringly on the long procession of his remains from city to city under charge of the baroness that last word of his history ridicules the eulogy of partisan and devotee and to commit the excess of worshipping is to conjure up by contrast a vulgar giant for truth will have her just proportions and vindicates herself upon a figure overidealized by bidding it grimace leaving appraisers to get the balance of the two extremes he was neither fool nor madman nor man to be adored his last temptation caught him in the season before he had subdued his blood and amid the multitudinously simple of this world stamped him a tragic comedian that is a grand pretender a selfdeceiver one of the lividly ludicrous whom we cannot laugh at but must contemplate to distinguish where their character strikes the note of discord with life for otherwise in the reflection of their history life will seem a thing demoniacally inclined by fits to antic and dive into gulfs the characters of the hosts of men are of the simple order of the comic not many are of a stature and a complexity calling for the junction of the two muses to name them while for his devotees he lay still warm in the earth that other the woman poor clotilde astonished her compatriots by passing comedy and tragic comedy with the gift of her hand to the hand which had slain alvan in sooth the explanation is not so hard when we recollect our knowledge of her it was a gentle youth her parents urged her to it a particular letter the letter of the challenge to her father besliming her was showna hideous provocation pushed to the foullest who can blame prince marko who had ever given sign of more noble bravery than he he had stood to defend her name and fame he was very love the never extinguished torch of love and he hung on her for the little of life appearing to remain to him before heaven he was guiltless he was good her misery had shrunk her into nothingness and she rose out of nothingness cold and bloodless bearing a thought that she might make a good youth happy or nurse him sinkingbe of that use besides he was a refuge from the roof of her parents she shut her eyes on the past sure of his goodness goodness on her return to some sense of being she prized above other virtues and perhaps she had a fancy that to be allied to it was to be doing good after a few months she buried him from that day or it may be on her marriage day her heart was alvans years later she wrote her version of the story not sparing herself so much as she supposed providence and her parents were not forgiven but as we are in her debt for some instruction she may now be suffered to go etext editors bookmarks a tragic comedian that is a grand pretender a selfdeceiver at the age of forty men that love love rootedly hosts of men are of the simple order of the comic men in love are children with their mistresses providence and her parents were not forgiven she ran through delusion and delusion exhausting each trick for killing time without hurting him weak souls are much moved by having the pathos on their side the end
