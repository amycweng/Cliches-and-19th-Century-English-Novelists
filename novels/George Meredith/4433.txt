chapter xxxix in the domain of tailordom there was peace in mr gorens shop badgered ministers bankrupt merchants diplomatists with a headacheany of our modern grandees under difficulties might have envied that peace over which mr goren presided and he was an enviable man he loved his craft he believed that he had not succeeded the millions of antecedent tailors in vain and excepting that trifling coquetry with shirtfronts viz the red crosses which a shrewd rival had very soon eclipsed by representing nymphs triangularly posed he devoted himself to his business from morning to night as rigid in demanding respect from those beneath him as he was profuse in lavishing it on his patrons his public boast was that he owed no man a farthing his secret comfort that he possessed two thousand pounds in the funds but mr goren did not stop here behind these external characteristics he nursed a passion evan was astonished and pleased to find in him an enthusiastic ferncollector not that mr harrington shared the passion but the sight of these brown roots spread out ticketed on the stained paper after supper when the shutters were up and the house defended from the hostile outer world the old man poring over them and naming this and that spot where during his solitary saturday afternoon and sunday excursions he had lighted on the rare samples exhibited this contrast of the quiet evening with the sordid day humanized mr goren to him he began to see a spirit in the rigid tradesman not so utterly dissimilar to his own and he fancied that he too had a taste for ferns round beckley how they abounded he told mr goren so and mr goren said some day well jog down there together as the saying goes mr goren spoke of it as an ordinary event likely to happen in the days to come not as an incident the mere mention of which as being probable stopped the breath and made the pulses leap for now evans education taught him to feel that he was at his lowest degree never now could rose stoop to him he carried the shop on his back she saw the brand of it on his forehead well and what was rose to him beyond a blissful memory a star that he had once touched self love kept him strong by day but in the darkness of night came his misery wakening from tender dreams he would find his heart sinking under a horrible pressure and then the fair fresh face of rose swam over him the hours of beckley were revived with intolerable anguish he saw that she was blamelessthat he alone was to blame yet worse was it when his closed eyelids refused to conjure up the sorrowful lovely nightmare and he lay like one in a trance entombedwretched pagan feeling all that had been blindly when the past lay beside him like a corpse that he had slain these nightly torments helped him to brave what the morning brought insensibly also as time hardened his sufferings evan asked himself what the shame of his position consisted in he grew stiffnecked his pagan virtues stood up one by one to support him andrew courageously evading the interdict that forbade him to visit evan would meet him by appointment at city taverns and flatly offered him a place in the brewery evan declined it on the pretext that having received old toms money for the year he must at least work out that term according to the conditions andrew fumed and sneered at tailordom evan said that there was peace in mr gorens shop his sharp senses discerned in andrews sneer a certain sincerity and he revolted against it mr john raikes too burlesqued society so well that he had the satisfaction of laughing at his enemy occasionally the latter gentleman was still a pensioner flying about town with the countess de saldar in deadly fear lest that fascinating lady should discover the seat of his fortune happy notwithstanding in the mirror of evans little world he beheld the great one from which he was banished now the dusk of a winters afternoon was closing over london when a carriage drew up in front of mr gorens shop out of which to mr gorens chagrin a lady stepped with her veil down the lady entered and said that she wished to speak to mr harrington mr goren made way for her to his pupil and was amazed to see her fall into his arms and hardly gratified to hear her say pardon me darling for coming to you in this place evan asked permission to occupy the parlour my place said mr goren with humble severity over his spectacles is very poor such as it is it is at the ladys service alone with her evan was about to ease his own feelings by remarking to the effect that mr goren was human like the rest of us but caroline cried with unwonted vivacity yes yes i know but i thought only of you i have such news for you you will and must pardon my comingthats my first thought sensitive darling that you are she kissed him fondly juliana bonner is in town staying with us is that your news asked evan pressing her against his breast no dear lovebut still you have no idea what her fortune mrs bonner has died and left herbut i mustnt tell you oh my darling how she admires you sheshe could recompense you if you would we will put that by for the present dear the duke has begged you through me to accepti think it s to be a sort of bailiff to his estatesi dont know rightly its a very honourable post that gentlemen take and the income you are to have evan will be near a thousand a year now what do i deserve for my news she put up her mouth for another kiss out of breath true looked evans eyes true she said smiling and feasting on his bewilderment after the bubbling in his brain had a little subsided evan breathed as a man on whom fresh air is blown were not these tidings of release his ridiculous pride must nevertheless inquire whether caroline had been begging this for him no dearindeed caroline asserted with more than natural vehemence its something that you yourself have done that has pleased him i dont know what only he says he believes you are a man to be trusted with the keys of anythingand so you are you are to call on him to morrow will you while evan was replying her face became white she had heard the majors voice in the shop his military step advanced and caroline exclaiming dont let me see him bustled to a door evan nodded and she slipped through the next moment he was facing the stiff marine well young man the major commenced and seating himself added be seated i want to talk to you seriously sir you didnt think fit to wait till i had done with the directors today youre devilishly out in your discipline whatever you are at two and two i suppose theres no fear of being intruded on here none of your acquaintances likely to be introducing themselves to me there is not one that i would introduce to you said evan the major nodded a brief recognition of the compliment and then throwing his back against the chair fired out come sir is this your doing in military phrase evan now changed front his first thought had been that the major had come for his wife he perceived that he himself was the special object of his visitation i must ask you what you allude to he answered you are not at your office but you will speak to me as if there was some distinction between us said the major my having married your sister does not reduce me to the ranks i hope the major drummed his knuckles on the table after this impressive delivery hem he resumed now sir understand before you speak a word that i can see through any number of infernal lies i see that youre prepared for prevarication by george it shall come out of you if i get it by main force the duke compelled me to give you that appointment in my company now sir did you or did you not go to him and deliberately state to him that you believed the affairs of the company to be in a bad conditioninfamously handled likely to involve his honour as a gentleman i ask you sir did you do this or did you not do it evan waited till the sharp rattle of the majors close had quieted if i am to answer the wording of your statement i may say that i did not very good very good that will do are you aware that the duke has sent in his resignation as a director of our company i hear of it first from you confound your familiarity cried the irritable officer rising am i always to be told that i married your sister address me sir as becomes your duty evan heard the words beggarly tailor mumbled out of the gutters and cursed connection he stood in the attitude of attention while the major continued now young man listen to these facts you came to me this day last week and complained that you did not comprehend some of our transactions and affairs i explained them to your damned stupidity you went away three days after that you had an interview with the duke stop sir what the devil do you mean by daring to speak while i am speaking you saw the duke i say now what took place at that interview the major tried to tower over evan powerfully as he put this query they were of a common height and to do so he had to rise on his toes so that the effect was but momentary i think i am not bound to reply said evan very well sir that will do the majors fingers were evidently itching for an absent rattan confess it or not you are dismissed from your post do you hear you are kicked in the street a beggarly tailor you were born and a beggarly tailor you will die i must beg you to stop now said evan i told you that i was not bound to reply but i will if you will sit down major strike you shall hear what you wish to know this being presently complied with though not before a glare of the majors eyes had shown his doubt whether it might not be construed into insolence evan pursued i came to you and informed you that i could not reconcile the cash accounts of the company and that certain of the later proceedings appeared to me to jeopardize its prosperity your explanations did not satisfy me i admit that you enjoined me to be silent but the duke as a director had as strong a right to claim me as his servant and when he questioned me as to the position of the company i told him what i thought just as i had told you you told him we were jobbers and swindlers sir the duke inquired of me whether i would under the circumstances while proceedings were going on which i did not approve of take the responsibility of allowing my name to remain ha ha ha the major burst out this was too good a joke the name of a miserable young tailor go on sir go on he swallowed his laughter like oil on his rage i have said sufficient jumping up the major swore by the lord that he had said sufficient now look you here young man he squared his finger before evan eyeing him under a hard frown you have been playing your game again as you did down at that place in hampshire i heard of itdeserved to be shot by heaven you think you have got hold of the duke and you throw me over you imagine i dare say that i will allow my wife to be talked about to further your interestsyou selfseeking young dog as long as he lent the company his name i permitted a great many things do you think me a blind idiot sir but now she must learn to be satisfied with people who ve got no titles or carriages and who cant give hundred guinea compliments youre all of a piecea set of the major paused for half a word was on his mouth which had drawn lightning to evans eyes not to be baffled he added but look you sir i may be ruined i dare say the company will go to the dogsevery ass will follow a duke but mark this goes on no more i will be no womans tally mind sir i take excellent care that you dont traffic in your sister the major delivered this culminating remark with a welltimed deflection of his forefinger and slightly turned aside when he had done you might have seen evans figure rocking as he stood with his eyes steadily levelled on his sisters husband the major who whatever he was was physically no coward did not fail to interpret the look and challenge it evan walked to the door opened it and said between his teeth you must go at once eh sir eh whats this exclaimed the warrior but the door was open mr goren was in the shop the scandal of an assault in such a house and the consequent possibility of his matrimonial alliance becoming bruited in the newspapers held his arm after it had given an involuntary jerk he marched through with becoming dignity and marched out into the street and if necks unelastic and heads erect may be taken as the sign of a proud soul and of nobility of mind my artist has the major for his model evan displayed no such a presence he returned to the little parlour shut and locked the door to the shop and forgetting that one was near sat down covered his eyes and gave way to a fit of tearless sobbing with one foot in the room caroline hung watching him a pain that she had never known wrung her nerves his whole manhood seemed to be shaken as if by regular pulsations of intensest misery she stood in awe of the sight till her limbs failed her and then staggering to him she fell on her knees clasping his passionately kissing them chapter xl in which the countess still scents game mr raikes and his friend frank remand surnamed franko to suit the requirements of metre in which they habitually conversed were walking arminarm along the drive in societys park on a fine frosty sunday afternoon of midwinter the quips and jokes of franko were lively and he looked into the carriages passing as if he knew that a cheerful countenance is not without charms for their inmates raikes face on the contrary was barren and bleak being of that nature that when a pun was made he must perforce outstrip it he fell into frankos humour from time to time but albeit aware that what he uttered was good and by comparison transcendent he refused to enjoy it nor when franko started from his arm to declaim a passage did he do other than make limp efforts to unite himself to franko again a further sign of immense depression in him was that instead of the creative it was the critical faculty he exercised and rather than reply to franko in his form of speech he scanned occasional lines and objected to particular phrases he had clearly exchanged the sanguine for the bilious temperament and was fast stranding on the rocky shores of prose franko bore this very well for he like raikes in happier days claimed all the glances of lovely woman as his own and on his right there flowed a stream of beauties at last he was compelled to observe this change is sudden wherefore so downcast with tigrine claw thou mangiest my speech thy cheeks are like decembers pippin and thy tongue most sour then of it make a farce said raikes for the making of farces was frankos profession wherefore so downcast what a line there lets walk on let us the left foot forward stout advance i care not for the herd tis love cried franko ay an it be jack gloomily returned for ever cruel is the sweet saldar raikes winced at this name a truce to banter franko he said sternly but the subject was opened and the wound love he pursued mildly groaning suppose you adored a fascinating woman and she knewpositively knewyour manly weakness and you saw her smiling upon everybody and she told you to be happy and egad when you came to reflect you found that after three months suit you were nothing better than her errandboy a thing to boast of is it not quotha loves yellowfever jealousy methinks franko commenced in reply but raikes spat at the emphasized word jealousywhos jealous of clergymen and that crew not i by pluto i carried five messages to one fellow with a coattail straight to his heels last week she thought i should drive my curriclei couldnt afford an omnibus i had to run when i returned to her i was dirty she made remarks thy sufferings are severebut such is woman said franko gad its a good idea though he took out a notebook and pencilled down a point or two raikes watched the process sardonically my tragedy is then thy farce he exclaimed well be it so i believe i shall come to songwriting again myself shortlybeneath the shield of catnach ill a nations ballads frame ive spent my income in four months and now i m living on my curricle i underlet it it s like tradeit s as bad as poor old harrington by jove but that isnt the worst franko jack dropped his voice i believe im furiously loved by a poor country wench morals was frankos most encouraging reproof oh i dont think ive even kissed her rejoined raikes who doubted because his imagination was vivid it s my intellect that dazzles her i ve got lettersshe calls me clever by jove since i gave up driving ive had thoughts of rushing down to her and making her mine in spite of home family fortune friends name positioneverything i have indeed franko looked naturally astonished at this amount of selfsacrifice the countess he shrewdly suggested id rather be my pollys prince than yon great ladys errandboy raikes burst into song he stretched out his hand as if to discard all the great ladies who were passing by the strangest misfortune ever known the direction taken by his fingers was toward a carriage wherein beautifully smiling opposite an elaborately reverend gentleman of middle age the countess de saldar was sitting this great lady is not to be blamed for deeming that her errandboy was pointing her out vulgarly on a public promenade ineffable disdain curled off her sweet olive visage she turned her head i ll go down to that girl tonight said raikes with compressed passion and then he hurried franko along to the bridge where behold the countess alighted with the gentleman and walked beside him into the gardens follow her said raikes in agitation do you see her by yon long tailed ravens side follow her franko see if he kisses her hand anything and meet me here in half an hour ill have evidence franko did not altogether like the office but raikes dinners singular luck and superiority in the encounter of puns gave him the upper hand with his friend and so franko went turning away from the last glimpse of his countess raikes crossed the bridge and had not strolled far beneath the bare branches of one of the long green walks when he perceived a gentleman with two ladies leaning on him now there moralized this youth now what do you say to that do you call that fair he cant be happy and its not in nature for them to be satisfied and yet if i went up and attempted to please them all by taking one away the probabilities are that he would knock me down such is life we wont be made comfortable nevertheless he passed them with indifference for it was merely the principle he objected to and indeed he was so wrapped in his own conceptions that his name had to be called behind him twice before he recognized evan harrington mrs strike and miss bonner the arrangement he had previously thought good was then spontaneously adopted mrs strike reposed her fair hand upon his arm and juliana with a timid glance of pleasure walked ahead in evans charge close neighbourhood between the couples was not kept the genius of mr raikes was wasted in manoeuvres to lead his beautiful companion into places where he could be seen with her and envied it was perhaps more flattering that she should betray a marked disposition to prefer solitude in his society but this idea illumined him only near the moment of parting then he saw it then he groaned in soul and besought evan to have one more promenade saying with characteristic cleverness in the masking of his real thoughts it gives us an appetite you know in evans face and julianas there was not much sign that any protraction of their walk together would aid this beneficent process of nature he took her hand gently and when he quitted it it dropped the rose the rose of beckley court raikes sang aloud why this is a day of meetings behold john thomas in the reara tower of plush and powder shall i rushshall i pluck her from the aged stem on the gravelwalk above them rose passed with her aristocratic grandmother muffled in furs she marched deliberately looking coldly before her evans face was white and juliana whose eyes were fixed on him shuddered im chilled she murmured to caroline let us go caroline eyed evan with a meaning sadness we will hurry to our carriage she said they were seen to make a little circuit so as not to approach rose after whom thoughtless of his cruelty evan bent his steps slowly halting when she reached her carriage he believedrather he knew that she had seen him there was a consciousness in the composed outlines of her face as she passed the indifference was too perfect let her hate him if she pleased it recompensed him that the air she wore should make her appearance more womanly and that black dress and crapebonnet in some way touched him to mournful thoughts of her that helped a partial forgetfulness of wounded self rose had driven off he was looking at the same spot where carolines hand waved from her carriage juliana was not seen caroline requested her to nod to him once but she would not she leaned back hiding her eyes and moving a petulant shoulder at carolines hand has he offended you my child juliana answered harshly nono the wheels rolled on and caroline tried other subjects knowing possibly that they would lead juliana back to this of her own accord you saw how she treated him the latter presently said without moving her hand from before her eyes yes dear he forgives her and will forget it oh she clenched her long thin hand i pray that i may not die before i have made her repent it she shall juliana looked glitteringly in carolines face and then fell aweeping and suffered herself to be folded and caressed the storm was long subsiding dearest you are better now said caroline she whispered yes my brother has only to know you dear hush thats past juliana stopped her and on a deep breath that threatened to break to sobs she added in a sweeter voice than was common to her ah whywhy did you tell him about the beckley property caroline vainly strove to deny that she had told him julianas head shook mournfully at her and now caroline knew what juliana meant when she begged so earnestly that evan should be kept ignorant of her change of fortune some days after this the cold struck julianas chest and she sickened the three sisters held a sitting to consider what it was best to do with her caroline proposed to take her to beckley without delay harriet was of opinion that the least they could do was to write to her relatives and make them instantly aware of her condition but the countess said no to both her argument was that juliana being independent they were by no means bound to bundle her in her state back to a place where she had been so shamefully maltreated that here she would live while there she would certainly die that absence of excitement was her medicine and that here she had it mrs andrew feeling herself responsible as the young ladys hostess did not acquiesce in the countesss views till she had consulted juliana and then apologies for giving trouble were breathed on the one hand sympathy condolences and professions of esteem on the other juliana said she was but slightly ill would soon recover entreated not to leave them before she was thoroughly reestablished and to consent to be looked on as one of the family she sighed and said it was the utmost she could hope of course the ladies took this compliment to themselves but evan began to wax in importance the countess thought it nearly time to acknowledge him and supported the idea by a citation of the doctrine that to forgive is christian it happened however that harriet who had less art and more will than her sisters was inflexible she living in a society but a few steps above tailordom however magnificent in expenditure and resources abhorred it solemnly from motives of prudence as well as personal disgust she continued firm in declining to receive her brother she would not relent when the countess pointed out a dim a dazzling prospect growing out of evans proximity to the heiress of beckley court she was not to be moved when caroline suggested that the specific for the frail invalid was evans presence as to this juliana was sufficiently open though as she conceived her art was extreme do you know why i stay to vex and trouble you she asked caroline well then it is that i may see your brother united to you all and then i shall go happy the pretext served also to make him the subject of many conversations twice a week a bunch of the best flowers that could be got were sorted and arranged by her and sent namelessly to brighten evans chamber i may do such a thing as this you know without incurring blame she said the sight of a love so humble in its strength and affluence sent caroline to evan on a fruitless errand what availed it that accused of giving lead to his pride in refusing the heiress evan should declare that he did not love her he did not caroline admitted as possible but he might he might learn to love her and therefore he was wrong in wounding her heart she related flattering anecdotes she drew tearful pictures of julianas love for him and noticing how he seemed to prize his bouquet of flowers said do you love them for themselves or the hand that sent them evan blushed for it had been a struggle for him to receive them as he thought from rose in secret the flowers lost their value the song that had arisen out of them thou livest in my memory ceased but they came still how many degrees from love gratitude may be i have not reckoned i rather fear it lies on the opposite shore from a youth to a girl it may yet be very tender the more so because their ages commonly exclude such a sentiment and nature seems willing to make a transition stage of it evan wrote to juliana incidentally he expressed a wish to see her juliana was under doctors interdict but she was not to be prevented from going when evan wished her to go they met in the park as before and he talked to her five minutes through the carriage window was it worth the risk my poor child said caroline pityingly juliana cried oh i would give anything to live a man might have thought that she made no direct answer dont you think i am patient dont you think i am very patientshe asked caroline winningly on their way home caroline could scarcely forbear from smiling at the feverish anxiety she showed for a reply that should confirm her words and hopes so we must all beshe said tend that commonplace remark caused juliana to exclaim prisoners have lived in a dungeon on bread and water for years whereat caroline kissed her so tenderly that juliana tried to look surprised and failing her thin lips quivered she breathed a soft hush and fell on carolines bosom she was transparent enough in one thing but the flame which burned within her did not light her through others on other matters were quite as transparent to her caroline never knew that she had as much as told her the moral suicide evan had committed at beckley so cunningly had she been probed at intervals with little casual questions random interjections that one who loved him could not fail to meet petty doubts requiring elucidations and the countess kind as her sentiments had grown toward the afflicted creature was compelled to proclaim her densely stupid in material affairs for the countess had an itch of the simplest feminine curiosity to know whether the dear child had any notion of accomplishing a certain holy duty of the perishable on this earth who might possess worldly goods and no hintsnot even plain speaking would do juliana did not understand her at all the countess exhibited a mourningring on her finger mrs bonners bequest to her how fervent is my gratitude to my excellent departed friend for this a legacy however trifling embalms our dear lost ones in the memory it was of no avail juliana continued densely stupid was she not worse the countess could not in decency as she observed reveal to her who had prompted mrs bonner so to bequeath the beckley estates as to ensure sweet julianas future but ought not juliana to divine it juliana at least had hints sufficient cold spring winds were now blowing juliana had resided no less than two months with the cogglesbys she was entreated still to remain and she did from lady jocelyn she heard not a word of remonstrance but from miss carrington and mrs shorne she received admonishing letters finally mr harry jocelyn presented himself in london and without any of that needful subsistence which a young gentleman feels the want of in london more than elsewhere harry began to have thoughts of his own without any instigation from his aunts about devoting himself to business so he sent his card up to his cousin and was graciously met in the drawingroom by the countess who ruffled him and smoothed him and would possibly have distracted his soul from business had his circumstances been less straitened juliana was declared to be too unwell to see him that day he called a second time and enjoyed a similar greeting his third visit procured him an audience alone with juliana when at once despite the warnings of his aunts the frank fellow plunged medias res mrs bonner had left him totally dependent on his parents and his chances a desperate state of things isnt it juley i think i shall go for a soldiercommon you know instead of shrieking out against such a debasement of his worth and gentility as was to be expected juliana said thats what mr harrington thought of doing he if hed had the pluck he would his duty forbade it and he did not duty a confounded tailor what fools we were to have him at beckley has the countess been unkind to you harry i havent seen her today and dont want to its my little dear old juley i came for dear harry she thanked him with eyes and hands come often wont you why aint you coming back to us juley not yet they are very kind to me here how is rose oh quite jolly she and ferdinand are thick again balls every night she dances like the deuce they want me to go but i aint the sort of figure for those places and besides i shant dance till i can lead you out a spur of laughter at harrys generous nod brought on julianas cough harry watched her little body shaken and her reddened eyes some real emotionperhaps the fear which healthy young people experience at the sight of deadly diseasemade harry touch her arm with the softness of a childs touch dont be alarmed harry she said its nothingonly winter im determined to get well thats right quoth he recovering i know youve got pluck or you wouldnt have stood that operation let me see when was that she asked slyly harry coloured for it related to a time when he had not behaved prettily to her there juley that s all forgotten i was a foola scoundrel if you like i m sorry for it now do you want money harry oh money have you repaid mr harrington yet thereno i havent bother it that fellows names always on your tongue ill tell you what juleybut its no use hes a low vulgar adventurer dear harry said juliana softly dont bring your aunts with you when you come to see me well then ill tell you juley its enough that hes a beastly tailor quite enough she responded and he is neither a fool nor a scoundrel harrys memory for his own speech was not quick when julianas calm glance at him called it up he jumped from his chair crying upon my honour ill tell you what juley if i had money to pay him tomorrow id insult him on the spot juliana meditated and said then all your friends must wish you to continue poor this girl had once been on her knees to him she had looked up to him with admiring love and he had given her a crumb or so occasionally thinking her something of a fool and more of a pest but now he could not say a word to her without being baffled in an elderlysisterly tone exasperating him so far that he positively wished to marry her and coming to the point offered himself with downright sincerity and was rejected harry left in a passion juliana confided the secret to caroline who suggested interested motives which juliana would not hear of ah said the countess when caroline mentioned the case to her of course the poor thing cherishes her first offer she would believe a curate to be disinterested but mind that evan has due warning when she is to meet him mind that he is dressed becomingly caroline asked why because my dear she is enamoured of his person these little unhealthy creatures are always attracted by the person she thinks it to be evans qualities i know better it is his person beckley court may be lost by a shabby coat the countess had recovered from certain spiritual languors into which she had fallen after her retreat ultimate victory hung still in the balance oh if evan would only marry this little sufferer who was so sure to die within a year or if she lived for marriage has often been as a resurrection to some poor female invalids there was beckley court a splendid basis for future achievements reflecting in this fashion the countess pardoned her brother glowing hopes hung fresh lamps in her charitable breast she stepped across the threshold of tailordom won mr gorens heart by her condescension and worked evan into a sorrowful mood concerning the invalid was not juliana his only active friend in return he said things which only required a little colouring to be very acceptable to her the game waxed exciting again the enemy the jocelyn party was alert but powerless the three sisters were almost wrought to perform a sacrifice far exceeding evans they nearly decided to summon him to the house but the matter being broached at table one evening major strike objected to it so angrily that they abandoned it with the satisfactory conclusion that if they did wrong it was the majors fault meantime juliana had much on her conscience she knew evan to be innocent and she allowed rose to think him guilty could she bring her heart to join them that was not in her power but desiring to be lulled by a compromise she devoted herself to make his relatives receive him and on days of bitter winds she would drive out to meet him answering all expostulations withi should not go if he were here the game waxed hot it became a question whether evan should be admitted to the house in spite of the major juliana now made an extraordinary move having the count with her in the carriage one day she stopped in front of mr gorens shop and evan had to come out the count returned home extremely mystified once more the unhappy countess was obliged to draw bills on the fabulous and as she had recommenced the system which was not without its fascinations to her juliana who had touched the spring had the full benefit of it the countess had deceived her beforewhat of that she spoke things sweet to hear who could be false that gave her heart food on which it lived one night juliana returned from her drive alarmingly ill she was watched through the night by caroline and the countess alternately in the morning the sisters met she has consented to let us send for a doctor said caroline her chief desire seems to be a lawyer said the countess yes but the doctor must be sent for first yes indeed but it behoves us to previse that the doctor does not kill her before the lawyer comes caroline looked at louisa and said are you ignorant nowhat cried the countess eagerly evan has written to tell lady jocelyn the state of her health and and that naturally has aggravated her malady the countess cramped her long fingers the child heard it from him yesterday oh i could swear at that brother she dropped into a chair and sat rigid and squarejawed a sculpture of unutterable rage in the afternoon lady jocelyn arrived the doctor was therethe lawyer had gone without a word of protest juliana accompanied her ladyship to beckley court here was a blow but andrew was preparing one more mighty still what if the cogglesby brewery proved a basis most unsound where must they fall then alas on that point whence they sprang if not to perditiontailordom chapter xli reveals an abominable plot of the brothers cogglesby a lively april day with strong gusts from the southwest and long sweeping clouds saluted the morning coach from london to lymport thither tailordom triumphant was bearing its victim at a rattling pace to settle him and seal him for ever out of the ranks of gentlemen society meantime howling exclusion to him in the background out of our halls degraded youth the smiles of turbaned matrons the sighs of delicate maids genial wit educated talk refined scandal vice in harness dinners sentineled by stately plush these the flavour of life are not for you though you stole a taste of them wretched impostor pay for it with years of remorse the coach went rushing against the glorious high wind it stirred his blood freshened his cheeks gave a bright tone of zest to his eyes as he cast them on the young green country not banished from the breath of heaven or from selfrespect or from the appetite for the rewards that are to follow duties done not banished from the help that is always reached to us when we have fairly taken the right road and that for him is the road to lymport let the kingdom of gilt gingerbread howl as it will we are no longer children but men men who have bitten hard at experience and know the value of a tooth who have had our hearts bruised and cover them with armour who live not to feed but look to food that we may live what matters it that yonder highspiced kingdom should excommunicate such as we are we have rubbed off the gilt and have assumed the command of our stomachs we are men from this day now you would have thought evans companions right and left of him were the wretches under sentence to judge from appearances in contrast with his look of insolent pleasure andrew the moment an eye was on him exhibited the cleverest impersonation of the dumps ever seen while mr raikes was from head to foot nothing better than a moan made visible nevertheless they both agreed to rally evan and bid him be of good cheer dont be down van dont be down my boy said andrew rubbing his hands gloomily i do i look it evan answered laughing capital acting exclaimed raikes try and keep it up well i hope youre acting too said evan raikes let his chest fall like a collapsing bellows at the end of five minutes he remarked ive been sitting on it the whole morning theres violent inflammation im persuaded another hour and i jump slap from the summit of the coach evan turned to andrew do you think hell be let off mr raikes cant say you see van it depends upon how old tom has taken his bad luck ahem perhaps hell be all the stricter and as a man of honour mr raikes you see cant very well by jove i wish i wasnt a man of honour raikes interposed heavily you see van old toms circumstancesandrew ducked to smother a sort of laughterare now such that hed be glad of the money to let him off no doubt but mr raikes has spent it i cant lend it and you havent got it and there we all are at the end of the year hes free and he ha ha im not a bit the merrier for laughing i can tell you catching another glimpse of evans serious face andrew fell into louder laughter checking it with doleful solemnity up hill and down hill and past little homesteads shining with yellow crocuses across wide brown heaths whose outlines raised in evans mind the night of his funeral walk and tossed up old feelings dead as the whirling dust at last raikes called out the towers of fallow field heigho and andrew said now then van if old toms anywhere hes here you get down at the dragon and dont you talk to me but let me go in itll be just the hour he dines in the country isnt it a shame of him to make me face every man of the creditorseh evan gave andrews hand an affectionate squeeze at which andrew had to gulp down somethingreciprocal emotion doubtless hark said raikes as the horn of the guard was heard once that sound used to set me caracoling before an abject multitude i did wonders all london looked on me it had more effect on me than champagne now i hear itthe whole charm has vanished i cant see a single old castle would you have thought it possible that a small circular bit of tin on a mans person could produce such changes in him you are a donkey to wear it said evan i pledged my word as a gentleman and thought it small for the money said raikes this is the first coach i ever travelled on without making the old whip burst with laughing im not myself im haunted im somebody else the three passengers having descended a controversy commenced between evan and andrew as to which should pay evan had his money out andrew dashed it behind him evan remonstrated well you mustnt pay for us two andrew i would have let you do it once but stuff cried andrew i aint payingit s the creditors of the estate my boy evan looked so ingenuously surprised and hurt at his lack of principle that andrew chucked a sixpence at a small boy saying if you dont let me have my own way van i ll shy my purse after it what do you mean sir by treating me like a beggar our friend harrington cant humour us quoth raikes for myself i candidly confess i prefer being paid for and he leaned contentedly against one of the posts of the inn till the filthy dispute was arranged to the satisfaction of the ignobler mind there andrew left them and went to mrs sockley who recovered from her illness smiled her usual placid welcome to a guest you know me maam oh yes the london mr cogglesby now maam look here ive come for my brother dont be alarmed no danger as yet but mind if you attempt to conceal him from his lawful brother ill summon here the myrmidons of the law mrs sockley showed a serious face you know his habits mr cogglesby and one doesnt go against any one of his whimsies or theres consequences but the house is open to you sir i dont wish to hide him andrew accepted this intelligent evasion of tom cogglesbys orders as sufficient and immediately proceeded upstairs a door shut on the first landing andrew went to this door and knocked no answer he tried to open it but found that he had been forestalled after threatening to talk business through the keyhole the door was unlocked and old tom appeared so now youre dogging me into the country be off make an appointment saturdays my holiday you know that andrew pushed through the doorway and by way of an emphatic reply and a silencing one delivered a punch slap into old toms belt confound you nan said old tom grimacing but friendly as if his sympathies had been irresistibly assailed it s done tom ive done it won my bet now andrew exclaimed the womenpoor creatures what a state theyre in i pity em old tom pursed his lips and eyed his brother incredulously but with curious eagerness oh lord what a face ive had to wear andrew continued and while he sank into a chair and rubbed his handkerchief over his crisp hair old tom let loose a convinced and exulting ha ha yes you may laugh ive had all the bother said andrew serve ye rightmarrying such cattle old tom snapped at him they believe were bankruptowe fifty thousand clear tom ha ha brewery stock and household furniture to be sold by general auction friday week ha ha not a place for any of us to poke our heads into i talked about pitiless storms to my poor harryno shelter to be had unless we go down to lymport and stop with their brother in shop old tom did enjoy this he took a great gulp of air for a tremendous burst of laughter and when this was expended and reflection came his features screwed as if the acidest of flavours had ravished his palate bravo nan didnt think you were man enough ha ha nani say eh how did ye get on behind the curtains the tale to guess by andrews face appeared to be too strongly infused with pathos for revelation will they go nan eh d ye think they ll go where else can they go tom they must go there or on the parish you know theyll all troop down to the young tailoreh they cant sleep in the parks tom no they cant get into buckingham palace neithercept as housemaids gad theyre howling like cats id swearnuisance to the neighbourhoodha ha old toms cruel laughter made andrew feel for the unhappy ladies he stuck his forehead and leaned forward saying i dont knowpon my honour i dont knowcant think wevequite done right to punish em so this acted like cold water on old toms delight he pitched it back in the shape of a doubt of what andrew had told him whereupon andrew defied him to face three miserable women on the verge of hysterics and old tom beginning to chuckle again rejoined that it would bring them to their senses and emancipate him you may laugh mr tom said andrew but if poor harry should find me out deuce a bit more home for me old tom looked at him keenly and rapped the table swear you did it nan you promise youll keep the secret said andrew never make promises then theres a pretty life for me i did it for that poor dear boy you were only up to one of your jokesi see that confound you old tom youve been making a fool of me the flattering charge was not rejected by old tom who now had his brother to laugh at as well andrew affected to be indignant and desperate if youd had a heart tom youd have saved the poor fellow without any bother at all what do you think when i told him of our smashha ha it isnt such a bad jokewell i went to him hanging my head and he offered to arrange our affairsthat is damned meddlesome young dog cried old tom quite in a rage thereyoure up in a twinkling said andrew dont you see he believed it you stupid old tom lord to hear him say how sorry he was and to see how glad he looked at the chance of serving us serving us tom sneered ha went andrew yes there youre a deuced deal prouder than fifty peers youre an upsidedown old despot no sharper retort rising to old toms lips he permitted his brothers abuse of him to pass declaring that bandying words was not his business he not being a parliament man how about the major nan he coming down too major cried andrew lucky if he keeps his commission coming down no hes off to the continent find plenty of scamps there to keep him company added tom so hes brokeeh ha ha tom said andrew seriously ill tell you all about it if you ll swear not to split on me because it would really upset poor harry so she d think me such a beastly hypocrite i couldnt face her afterwards lose what pluck you haveeh tom jerked out his hand and bade his brother continue compelled to trust in him without a promise andrew said well then after wed arranged it i went back to harry and begged her to have poor van at the house told her what i hoped youd do for him about getting him into the brewery shes very kind tom pon my honour she is she was willing only onlyeh well she was so afraid itd hurt her sisters to see him there old tom saw he was in for excellent fun and wouldnt spoil it for the world yes nan so i went to caroline she was easy enough and she went to the countess well and she she was willing too till lady jocelyn came and took miss bonner home to beckley and because evan had written to my lady to fetch her the countessshe was angry that was all because of that you know but yet she agreed but when miss bonner had gone it turned out that the major was the obstacle they were all willing enough to have evan there but the major refused i didnt hear him i wasnt going to ask him i maynt be a match for three women but man to man eh tom youd back me there so harry said the major d make caroline miserable if his wishes were disrespected by george i wish id know then dont you think it odd tom now theres a duke of belfield the fellow had hooked into his company andthrough evan i heardthe duke had his name struck off after that the major swore at the duke once or twice and said caroline wasnt to go out with him suddenly he insists that she shall go days the poor thing kept crying one day he makes her go she hasnt the spirit of my harry or the countess by good luck van who was hunting ferns for some friends of his met them on sunday in richmond park and van took her away from the duke but tom think of van seeing a fellow watching her wherever she went and hearing the dukes coachman tell that fellow he had orders to drive his master and a lady hard on to the sea that night i dont believe itit wasnt caroline but what do you think of our finding out that beast of a spy to be in the majors pay we did van put a constable on his track we found him out and he confessed it a fact tom that decided me if it was only to get rid of a brute i determined i d do it and i did strike came to me to get my name for a bill that night gad he looked blanker than his bill when he heard of us two bankrupt i showed him one or two documents id got ready says he never mind itll only be a couple of hundred more in the schedule stop tom hes got some of our blood i dont think he meant it he is hard pushed well i gave him a twentier and he was off the next night you ll soon see all about the company in the papers at the conclusion of andrews recital old tom thrummed and looked on the floor under a heavy frown his mouth worked dubiously and from moment to moment he plucked at his waistcoat and pulled it down throwing back his head and glaring i ve knocked that fellow over once he said wish he hadnt got up again andrew nodded one good thing nan he never boasted of our connection much obliged to him yes said andrew who was gladly watching old toms change of mood with a quiescent aspect ummust keep it quiet from his poor old mother andrew again affirmatived his seniors remarks that his treatment of old tom was sound he presently had proof of the latter stood up and after sniffing in an injured way for about a minute launched out his right leg and vociferated that he would like to have it in his power to kick all the villains out of the world a modest demand andrew at once chimed in with adding that were such a faculty extended to him he would not object to lose the leg that could benefit mankind so infinitely and consented to its following them then old tom who was of a practical turn meditated swung his foot and gave one grim kick at the imaginary bundle of villains discharged them headlong straight into space andrew naturally imitative and seeing that he had now to kick them flying attempted to excel old tom in the vigour of his delivery no wonder that the efforts of both were heating they were engaged in the task of ridding the globe of the larger half of its inhabitants tom perceived andrews useless emulation and with a sound translated by yack sent his leg out a long way not to be outdone andrew immediately with a still louder yack committed himself to an effort so violent that the alternative between his leg coming off or his being taken off his leg was propounded by nature and decided by the laws of gravity in a trice joyful grunts were emitted by old tom at the sight of andrew prostrate rubbing his pate but mrs sockley to whom the noise of andrews fall had suggested awful fears of a fratricidal conflict upstairs hurried forthwith to announce to them that the sovereign remedy for human ills the promoter of concord the healer of feuds the central point of mans destiny in the fleshdinner was awaiting them to the dinner they marched of this great festival be it simply told that the supply was copious and of good qualitymuch too good and copious for a bankrupt host that evan and mr john raikes were formally introduced to old tom before the repast commenced and welcomed some three minutes after he had decided the flavour of his first glass that mr raikes in due time preferred his petition for release from a dreadful engagement and furnished vast amusement to the company under old toms hand until by chance he quoted a scrap of latin at which the brothers cogglesby who would have faced peers and princes without being disconcerted or performing mental genuflexions shut their mouths and looked injured unhappy and in the presence of a superior mr raikes not being the man to spare them moreover a surprise was afforded to evan andrew stated to old tom that the hospitality of main street lymportwas open to him strange to say old tom accepted it on the spot observing youre master of the housecan do what you like if you re man enough and adding that he thanked him and would come in a day or two the case of mr raikes was still left uncertain for as the bottle circulated he exhibited such a faculty for apt but to the brothers totally incomprehensible quotation that they fled from him without leaving him time to remember what special calamity was on his mind or whether this earth was other than an abode conceived in great jollity for his lifelong entertainment chapter xlii juliana the sick nightlight burned steadily in julianas chamber on a couch beside her bed caroline lay sleeping tired with a long watch two sentences had been passed on juliana one on her heart one on her body thou art not loved and thou must die the frail passion of her struggle against her destiny was over with her quiet as that quiet which nature was taking her to her body reposed calm as the solitary nightlight before her open eyes her spirit was wasting away if i am not loved then let me die in such a sense she bowed to her fate at an hour like this watching the round of light on the ceiling with its narrowing inner rings a sufferer from whom pain has fled looks back to the shores she is leaving and would be well with them who walk there it is false to imagine that schemers and workers in the dark are destitute of the saving gift of conscience they have it and it is perhaps made livelier in them than with easy people and therefore they are imperatively spurred to hoodwink it hence their selfdelusion is deep and endures they march to their object and gaining or losing it the voice that calls to them is the voice of a blind creature whom any answer provided that the answer is ready will silence and at an hour like this when finally they snatch their minute of sight on the threshold of black night their souls may compare with yonder shining circle on the ceiling which as the light below gasps for air contracts and extends but to mingle with the darkness they would be nobler better boundlessly good to allto those who have injured them to those whom they have injured alas for any definite deed the limit of their circle is immoveable and they must act within it the trick they have played themselves imprisons them beyond it they cease to be lying in this utter stillness juliana thought of rose of her beloved by evan the fever that had left her blood had left it stagnant and her thoughts were quite emotionless she looked faintly on a far picture she saw rose blooming with pleasures in elburne house sliding as a boat borne by the rivers tide to sea away from her living joy the breast of rose was lucid to her and in that hour of insight she had clear knowledge of her cousins heart how it scoffed at its base love and unwittingly betrayed the power on her still by clinging to the world and what it would give her to fill the void how externally the lake was untroubled and a mirror to the passing day and how within there pressed a flood against an iron dam evan too she saw the countess was right in her judgement of julianas love juliana looked very little to his qualities she loved him when she thought him guilty which made her conceive that her love was of a diviner cast than rose was capable of guilt did not spoil his beauty to her his gentleness and glowing manhood were unchanged and when she knew him as he was the revelation of his high nature simply confirmed her impression of his physical perfections she had done him a wrong at her death news would come to him and it might be that he would bless her name because she sighed no longer for those dear lips and strong arms to close about her tremulous frame it seemed to her that she had quite surrendered him generous to evan she would be just to rose beneath her pillow she found pencil and paper and with difficulty scarce seeing her letters in the brown light she began to trace lines of farewell to rose her conscience dictated to her thus tell rose that she was too ready to accept his guilt and that in this as in all things she acted with the precipitation of her character tell her that you always trusted and that now you know him innocent give her the proofs you have show that he did it to shield his intriguing sister tell her that you write this only to make her just to him end with a prayer that rose may be happy ere juliana had finished one sentence she resigned the pencil was it not much even at the gates of death to be the instrument to send rose into his arms the picture swayed before her helping her weakness she found herself dreaming that he had kissed her once dorothy she remembered had danced up to her one day to relate what the maids of the house said of the gentlemanat whom it is known they look with the licence of cats toward kings and dorothys fresh careless mouth had told how one observant maid amorously minded proclaimed of evan to a companion of her sex that he was the only gentleman who gave you an idea of how he would look when he was kissing you juliana cherished that vision likewise young ladies are not supposed to do so if menial maids are but juliana did cherish it and it possessed her fancy bear in your recollection that she was not a healthy person diseased little heroines may be made attractive and are now popular but strip off the cleverly woven robe which is fashioned to cover them and you will find them in certain matters bearing a resemblance to menial maids while the thoughts of his kiss lasted she could do nothing but lay with her two hands out on the bed and her eyelids closed then waking she took the pencil again it would not move her bloodless fingers fell from it if they do not meet and he never marries i may claim him in the next world she mused but conscience continued uneasy she turned her wrist and trailed a letter from beneath the pillow it was from mrs shorne juliana knew the contents she raised it unopened as high as her faltering hands permitted and read like one whose shut eyes read syllables of fire on the darkness rose has at last definitely engaged herself to ferdinand you will be glad to hear and we may now treat her as a woman having absorbed these words julianas hand found strength to write with little difficulty what she had to say to rose she conceived it to be neither sublime nor generous not even good merely her peculiar duty when it was done she gave a long low sigh of relief caroline whispered dearest child are you awake yes she answered sorrowful dear very quiet caroline reached her hand over to her and felt the paper what is this my goodbye to rose i want it folded now caroline slipped from the couch to fulfil her wish she enclosed the pencilled scrap of paper sealed it and asked is that right now unlock my desk juliana uttered feebly put it beside a letter addressed to a lawgentleman post both the morning i am gone caroline promised to obey and coming to juliana to mark her looks observed a faint pleased smile dying away and had her hand gently squeezed julianas conscience had preceded her contentedly to its last sleep and she beneath that round of light on the ceiling drew on her counted breaths in peace till dawn chapter xliii rose have you seen a young audacious spirit smitten to the earth it is a singular study and in the case of young women a trap for inexperienced men rose who had commanded and managed every one surrounding her since infancy how humble had she now becomehow much more womanly in appearance and more childlike at heart she was as wax in lady elburnes hands a hint of that veiled episode the beckley campaign made rose pliant as if she had woven for herself a rod of scorpions the high ground she had taken the perfect trust in one the scorn of any judgement save her own these had vanished from her rose the tameless heroine who had once put her mothers philosophy in action was the easiest filly that turbaned matron ever yet drove into the straight road of the world it even surprised lady jocelyn to see how wonderfully she had been broken in by her grandmother her ladyship wrote to drummond to tell him of it and drummond congratulated her saying however changes of this sort dont come of conviction wait till you see her at home i think they have been sticking pins into the sore part drummond knew rose well in reality there was no change in her she was only a suppliant to be spared from ridicule spared from the application of the scourge she had woven for herself and ah to one who deigned to think warmly still of such a disgraced silly creature with what gratitude she turned he might well suppose love alone could pour that profusion of jewels at his feet ferdinand now lord laxley understood the merits of his fingernails better than the nature of young women but he is not to be blamed for presuming that rose had learnt to adore him else why did she like his company so much he was not mistaken in thinking she looked up to him she seemed to beg to be taken into his noble serenity in truth she sighed to feel as he did above everybodyshe that had fallen so low above everybodyborn above them and therefore superior by grace divine to this rose jocelyn had comeshe envied the mind of ferdinand he you may be sure was quite prepared to accept her homage rose he had always known to be just the girl for him spirited fresh and with fine teeth and once tied to you safe to be staunch they walked together rode together danced together her soft humility touched him to eloquence say she was a little hypocrite if you like when the blood came to her cheeks under his eyes say she was a heartless minx for allowing it to be bruited that she and ferdinand were betrothed i can but tell you that her blushes were blushes of gratitude to one who could devote his time to such a disgraced silly creature and that she in her abject state felt a secret pleasure in the protection ferdinands name appeared to extend over her and was hardly willing to lose it so far lady elburnes tact and discipline had been highly successful one morning in may ferdinand strolling with rose down the garden made a positive appeal to her common sense and friendly feeling by which she understood that he wanted her consent to his marriage with her rose answered who would have me ferdinand spoke pretty well and ultimately got possession of her hand she let him keep it thinking him noble for forgetting that another had pressed it before him some minutes later the letters were delivered one of them contained julianas darkwinged missive poor poor juley said rose dropping her head after reading all that was on the crumpled leaf with an inflexible face and then talking on long low sighs lifted her bosom at intervals she gazed from time to time with a wistful conciliatory air on ferdinand rushing to her chamber the first cry her soul framed was he did not kiss me the young have a superstitious sense of something incontestably true in the final protestations of the dead evan guiltless she could not quite take the meaning this revelation involved that which had been dead was beginning to move within her but blindly and now it stirred and troubled now sank guiltless all she had thought him oh she knew she could not have been deceived but why why had he hidden his sacrifice from her it is better for us both of course said rose speaking the worlds wisdom parrotlike and bursting into tears the next minute guiltless and gloriously guiltless but nothingnothing to her she tried to blame him it would not do she tried to think of that grovelling loathsome position painted to her by lady elburnes graphic hand evan dispersed the gloomy shades like sunshine then in a sort of terror she rejoiced to think she was partially engaged to ferdinand and found herself crying again with exultation that he had not kissed her for a kiss on her mouth was to rose a pledge and a bond the struggle searched her through bared her weakness probed her strength and she seeing herself suffered grievously in her selflove am i such a coward inconstant cold she asked confirmatory answers coming flung her back under the shield of ferdinand if for a moment her soul stood up armed and defiant it was evans hand she took to whom do i belong was another terrible question in her ideas if evan was not chargeable with that baseness which had sundered them he might claim her yet if he would if he did what then must she go to him impossible she was in chains besides what a din of laughter there would be to see her led away by him twisting her joined hands weeping for her cousin as she thought rose passed hours of torment over julianas legacy to her why did i doubt him she cried jealous that any soul should have known and trusted him better jealous and i am afraid that the kindling of that one feature of love relighted the fire of her passion thus fervidly to be outstripped in generosity was hateful to her rose naturally could not reflect that a young creature like herself fighting against the world as we call it has all her faculties at the utmost stretch and is often betrayed by failing nature when the will is still valiant and here she satin chains yes i am fit only to be the wife of an idle brainless man with money and a title she said in extreme self contempt she caught a glimpse of her whole life in the horrid tomb of his embrace and questions whether she could yield her hand to him whether it was right in the eyes of heaven rushed impetuously to console her and defied anything in the shape of satisfactory affirmations nevertheless the end of the struggle was that she felt that she was bound to ferdinand but this i will do said rose standing with heatbright eyes and deep coloured cheeks before the glass i will clear his character at beckley i will help him i will be his friend i will wipe out the injustice i did him and this brideelect of a lord absolutely added that she was unworthy to be the wife of a tailor he how unequalled he is there is nothing he fears except shame oh how sad it will be for him to find no woman in his class to understand him and be his helpmate over this sad subject of which we must presume her to be accurately cognizant rose brooded heavily by midday she gave her grandmother notice that she was going home to julianas funeral well rose if you think it necessary to join the ceremony said lady elburne beckley is bad quarters for you as you have learnt there was never much love between you cousins no and i dont pretend to it rose answered i am sorry poor juleys gone shes better gone for many reasonsshe appears to have been a little venomous toad said lady elburne and rose thinking of a snakelike deathbite working through her blood rejoined yes she isnt to be pitied she s better off than most people so it was arranged that rose should go ferdinand and her aunt mrs shorne accompanied her mrs shorne gave them their opportunities albeit they were all stowed together in a carriage and ferdinand seemed willing to profit by them but roses hand was dead and she sat by her future lord forming the vow on her lips that they should never be touched by him arrived at beckley she to her great delight found caroline there waiting for the funeral in a few minutes she got her alone and after kisses looked penetratingly into her lovely eyes shook her head and said why were you false to me false echoed caroline you knew him you knew why he did that why did you not save me caroline fell upon her neck asking pardon she spared her the recital of facts further than the broad avowal evans present condition she plainly stated and rose when the bitter pangs had ceased made oath to her soul she would rescue him from it in addition to the task of clearing evans character and rescuing him rose now conceived that her engagement to ferdinand must stand icebound till evan had given her back her troth how could she obtain it from him how could she take anything from one so noble and so poor happily there was no hurry though before any bond was ratified she decided conscientiously that it must be done you see that like a lithe snake she turns on herself and must be tracked in and out not being a girl to solve the problem with tears or outright perfidy she had to ease her heart to the great shock little by littlesincere as far as she knew as far as one who loves may be the day of the funeral came and went the jocelyns were of their mothers opinion that for many reasons juliana was better out of the way mrs bonners bequest had been a severe blow to sir franks however all was now well the estate naturally lapsed to lady jocelyn no one in the house dreamed of a will signed with julianas name attested under due legal forms being in existence none of the members of the family imagined that at beckley court they were then residing on somebody elses ground want of hospitable sentiments was not the cause that led to an intimation from sir franks to his wife that mrs strike must not be pressed to remain and that rose must not be permitted to have her own way in this knowing very well that mrs shorne spoke through her husbands mouth lady jocelyn still acquiesced and rose who had pressed caroline publicly to stay had to be silent when the latter renewed her faint objections so caroline said she would leave on the morrow morning juliana with her fretfulness her hand bounties her petty egoisms and sudden farleaping generosities and all the contradictory impulses of her malady had now departed utterly the joys of a landed proprietor mounted into the head of sir franks he was up early the next morning and he and harry walked over a good bit of the ground before breakfast sir franks meditated making it entail and favoured harry with a lecture on the duty of his shaping the course of his conduct at once after the model of the landed gentry generally and you may think yourself lucky to come into that cataloguethe son of a younger son said sir franks tapping mr harrys shoulder harry also began to enjoy the look and smell of land at the breakfast which though early was well attended harry spoke of the adviseability of felling timber here planting there and so forth after the model his father held up sir franks nodded approval of his interest in the estate but reserved his opinion on matters of detail all i beg of you is said lady jocelyn that you wont let us have turnips within the circuit of a mile which was obligingly promised the morning letters were delivered and opened with the customary calmness letter from old george harry sings out and buzzes over a few lines halloahum he was going to make a communication but catching sight of caroline tossed the letter over to ferdinand who read it and tossed it back with the comment of a careless face read it rosey says harry smiling bluntly rather to his surprise rose took the letter study her eyes if you wish to gauge the potency of one strong dose of ridicule on an ingenuous young heart she read that mr george uplift had met our friend mr snip riding by moonlight on the road to beckley that great orbed night of their deep tender love flashed luminously through her frame storming at the base epithet by which her lover was mentioned flooding grandly over the ignominies cast on him by the world she met the world as it were in a deathgrapple she matched the living heroic youth she felt him to be with that dead wooden image of him which it thrust before her her heart stood up singing like a craven who sees the tide of victory setting toward him but this passed beneath her eyelids when her eyes were lifted ferdinand could have discovered nothing in them to complain of had his suspicions been light to raise nor could mrs shorne perceive that there was the opening for a shrewd bodkinthrust rose had got a mask at last her colour voice expression were perfectly at command she knew it to be a cowardice to wear any mask but she had been burnt horribly burnt how much so you may guess from the supple dissimulation of such a bold clearvisaged girl she conquered the sneers of the world in her soul but her sensitive skin was yet alive to the pangs of the scorching it had been subjected to when weak helpless and betrayed by evan she stood with no philosophic parent to cry fair play for her among the skilful torturers of elburne house sir franks had risen and walked to the window news said lady jocelyn wheeling round in her chair the one eyebrow up of the easygoing baronet signified trouble of mind he finished his third perusal of a letter that appeared to be written in a remarkably plain legal hand and looking as men do when their intelligences are just equal to the comprehension or expression of an oath handed the letter to his wife and observed that he should be found in the library nevertheless he waited first to mark its effect on lady jocelyn at one part of the document her forehead wrinkled slightly doesnt sound like a joke he said she answered no sir franks apparently quite satisfied by her ready response turned on his heel and left the room quickly an hour afterward it was rumoured and confirmed that juliana bonner had willed all the worldly property she held in her own right comprising beckley court to mr evan harrington of lymport tailor an abstract of the will was forwarded the lawyer went on to say that he had conformed to the desire of the testatrix in communicating the existence of the aforesaid will six days subsequent to her death being the day after her funeral there had been railing and jeering at the countess de saldar the clever outwitted exposed adventuress at elburne house and beckley court what did the crowing cleverer aristocrats think of her now on rose the blow fell bitterly was evan also a foul schemer was he of a piece with his intriguing sister his close kinship with the countess had led her to think baseness possible to him when it was confessed by his own mouth once she heard black names cast at him and the whole of the great mels brood and incapable of quite disbelieving them merited unable to challenge and rebut them she dropped into her recent state of selfcontempt into her latelyinstilled doubt whether it really was in natures power unaided by familyportraits coatsofarms ballroom practice and at least one small phial of essence of society to make a gentleman chapter xliv contains a warning to all conspirators this if you have done me the favour to read it aright has been a chronicle of desperate heroism on the part of almost all the principal personages represented but not the countess de saldar scaling the embattled fortress of society nor rose tossing its keys to her lover from the shining turrettops nor evan keeping bright the lamp of self respect in his bosom against south wind and east none excel friend andrew cogglesby who having fallen into old toms plot to humiliate his wife and her sisters simply for evans sake and without any distinct notion of the terror confusion and universal upset he was bringing on his home could yet after a scared contemplation of the scene when he returned from his expedition to fallow field continue to wear his rueful mask and persevere in treacherously outraging his lofty wife he did it to vindicate the ties of blood against accidents of position was he justified i am sufficiently wise to ask my own sex alone on the other side be it said since in our modern days every hero must have his weak heel that now he had gone this distance it was difficult to recede it would be no laughing matter to tell his solemn harriet that he had been playing her a little practical joke his temptations to give it up were incessant and most agitating but if to advance seemed terrific there was in stopping short an awfulness so overwhelming that andrew abandoned himself to the current his real dismay adding to his acting powers the worst was that the joke was no longer his it was old toms he discovered that he was in old toms hands completely andrew had thought that he would just frighten the women a bit get them down to lymport for a week or so and then announce that matters were not so bad with the brewery as he had feared concluding the farce with a few domestic fireworks conceive his dismay when he entered the house to find there a man in possession andrew flew into such a rage that he committed an assault on the man so ungovernable was his passion that for some minutes harriets measured voice summoned him from over the banisters above quite in vain the miserable englishman refused to be taught that his house had ceased to be his castle it was something beyond a joke this the intruder perfectly docile seeing that by accurate calculation every shake he got involved a bottle of wine for him and ultimate compensation probably to the amount of a couple of sovereigns allowed himself to be lugged up stairs in default of summary ejection on the point of andrews toe into the street there he was faced to the lady of the house who apologized to him and requested her husband to state what had made him guilty of this indecent behaviour the man showed his papers they were quite in order at the suit of messrs grist my own lawyers cried andrew smacking his forehead and old toms devilry flashed on him at once he sank into a chair why did you bring this person up here said harriet like a speaking statue my dear andrew answered and spread out his hand and waggled his head mypleaseii dont know we all want exercise the man laughed which was kindly of him but offensive to mrs cogglesby who gave andrew a glance which was full payment for his imbecile pleasantry and promised more with a hospitable inquiry as to the condition of his appetite and a request that he would be pleased to satisfy it to the full the man was dismissed whereat as one delivered of noxious presences the countess rustled into sight not noticing andrew she lisped to harriet misfortunes are sometimes no curses i bless the catarrh that has confined silva to his chamber and saved him from a bestial exhibition the two ladies then swept from the room and left andrew to perspire at leisure fresh tribulations awaited him when he sat down to dinner andrew liked his dinner to be comfortable good and in plenty this may not seem strange the fact is stated that i may win for him the warm sympathies of the body of his countrymen he was greeted by a piece of cold boiled neck of mutton and a solitary dish of steaming potatoes the blank expanse of tablecloth returned his desolate stare why whats the meaning of this andrew brutally exclaimed as he thumped the table the countess gave a start and rolled a look as of piteous supplication to spare a ladys nerves addressed to a ferocious brigand harriet answered it means that i will have no butchers bills butchers bills butchers bills echoed andrew why you must have butchers bills why confound why youll have a bill for this wont you harry eh of course there will be no more bills dating from yesterday said his wife what this is paid for then yes mr cogglesby and so will all household expenses be while my pocketmoney lasts resting his eyes full on harriet a minute andrew dropped them on the savourless whiterimmed chop which looked as lonely in his plate as its parent dish on the table the poor dear creatures pocketmoney had paid for it the thought mingling with a rush of emotion made his ideas spin his imagination surged deliriously he fancied himself at the zoological gardens exchanging pathetic glances with a melancholy marmoset wonderfully like one the chop looked there was no use in his trying to eat it he seemed to be fixing his teeth in solid tears he choked twice he took up knife and fork put them down again and plucking forth his handkerchief blew a tremendous trumpet that sent the countesss eyes rolling to the ceiling as if heaven were her sole refuge from such vulgarity damn that old tom he shouted at last and pitched back in his chair mr cogglesby and in the presence of ladies were the admonishing interjections of the sisters at whom the little man frowned in turns do you wish us to quit the room sir inquired his wife god bless your soul you little darling he apostrophized that stately person here come along with me harry a wifes a wife i sayhang it just outside the roomjust a second or up in a corner will do mrs cogglesby was amazed to see him jump up and run round to her she was prepared to defend her neck from his caress and refused to go but the words something particular to tell you awakened her curiosity which urged her to compliance she rose and went with him to the door well sir what is it no doubt he was acting under a momentary weakness he was about to betray the plot and take his chance of forgiveness but her towering port her commanding aspect restored his courage there may be a contrary view of the case he enclosed her briskly in a connubial hug and remarked with mad ecstasy what a duck you are harry what a likeness between you and your mother mrs cogglesby disengaged herself imperiously had he called her aside for this gratuitous insult contrite he saw his dreadful error harry i declare was all he was allowed to say mrs cogglesby marched back to her chair and recommenced the repast in majestic silence andrew sighed he attempted to do the same he stuck his fork in the blanched whiskerage of his marmoset and exclaimed i cant he was unnoticed you do not object to plain diet said harriet to louisa oh no in verity murmured the countess however plain it be absence of appetite dearest you are aware i partook of luncheon at midday with the honourable and reverend mr duffian you must not look condemnation at your louy for that luncheon is not conversion harriet observed that this might be true but still to her mind it was a mistake to be too intimate with dangerous people and besides she added mr duffian is no longer the reverend we deprive all renegades of their spiritual titles his worldly ones let him keep her superb disdain nettled the countess dear harriet she said with less languor you are utterly and totally and entirely mistaken i tell you so positively renegade the application of such a word to such a man oh and it is false harriet quite renegade means one who has gone over to the turks my dear i am almost certain i saw it in johnsons dictionary or an improvement upon johnson by a more learned author but there is the fact if harriet can only bring hershall i say stiffnecked prejudices to envisage it harriet granted her sister permission to apply the phrases she stood in need of without impeaching her intimacy with the most learned among lexicographers and is there no such thing as being too severe the countess resumed what our enemies call unchristian mr duffian has no cause to complain of us said harriet nor does he do so dearest calumny may assail him you may utterly denude him adam interposed andrew distractedly listening he did not disturb the countesss flow you may vilify and victimize mr duffian and strip him of the honours of his birth but like the martyrs he will still continue the perfect nobleman stoned i assure you that mr duffian would preserve his breeding in character he is exquisite a polish to defy misfortune i suppose his table is good said harriet almost ruffled by the countesss lecture plate was remarked in the cold tone of supreme indifference hem good wines andrew asked waking up a little and not wishing to be excluded altogether all is of the very best the countess pursued her eulogy not looking at him dont you think you couldeh harrymanage a pint for me my dear andrew humbly petitioned this cold waterha ha my stomach dont like cold bathing his wretched joke rebounded from the impenetrable armour of the ladies the winecellar is locked said his wife i have sealed up the key till an inventory can be taken by some agent of the creditors what creditors roared andrew you can have some of the servants beer mrs cogglesby appended andrew studied her face to see whether she really was not hoisting him with his own petard perceiving that she was sincerely acting according to her sense of principle he fumed and departed to his privacy unable to stand it any longer then like a kite the countess pounced upon his character would the honourable and reverend mr duflian decline to participate in the sparest provender would he be guilty of the discourtesy of leaving table without a bow or an apology even if reduced to extremest poverty no indeed which showed that under all circumstances a gentleman was a gentleman and oh how she pitied her poor harrieteternally tied to a most vulgar little man without the gilding of wealth and a fool in his business to boot dear these comparisons do no good said harriet andrew at least is not a renegade and never shall be while i live i will do my duty by him however poor we are and now louisa putting my husband out of the question what are your intentions i dont understand bankruptcy but i imagine they can do nothing to wife and children my little ones must have a roof over their heads and besides there is little maxwell you decline to go down to lymport of course decline cried the countess melodiously and do not you as far as i am concernedyes but i am not to think of myself the countess meditated and said dear mr duflian has offered me his hospitality renegades are not absolutely inhuman they may be generous i have no moral doubt that mr duflian would upon my representationdare i venture sleep in his house break bread with him exclaimed harriet what do you think i am made of i would perishgo to the workhouse rather i see you trooping there said the countess intent on the vision and have you accepted his invitation for yourself louisa the countess was never to be daunted by threatening aspects she gave her affirmative with calmness and a deliberate smile you are going to live with him live with him what expressions my husband accompanies me harriet drew up i know nothing louisa that could give me more pain the countess patted harriets knee it succeeds to bankruptcy assuredly but would you have me drag silva to thethe shop harriet love alternatives mrs andrew got up and rang the bell to have the remains of their dinner removed when this was done she said louisa i dont know whether i am justified you told me today i might keep my jewels trinkets and lace and such like to me i know they do not belong now but i will dispose of them to procure you an asylum somewherethey will fetch i should think lto prevent your going to mr duffian no exhibition of greatmindedness which the countess could perceive ever found her below it never love never she said then will you go to evan evan i hate him the olivehued visage was dark it brightened as she added at least as much as my religious sentiments permit me to a boy who has thwarted me at every turndisgraced us indeed i find it difficult to pardon you the supposition of such a possibility as your own consent to look on him ever again harriet you have no children said mrs andrew the countess mournfully admitted it there lies your danger with mr duffian louisa what do you doubt my virtue asked the countess pish i fear something different you understand me mr duflians moral reputation is none of the best perhaps that was before he renegaded said the countess harriet bluntly rejoined you will leave that house a roman catholic now you have spoken said the countess pluming now let me explain myself my dear i have fought worldly battles too long and too earnestly i am rightly punished i do but quote herbert duffians own words he is no flatterer though you say he has such soft fingers i am now engaged in a spiritual contest he is very wealthy i have resolved to rescue back to our church what can benefit the flock of which we form a portion so exceedingly at this revelation of the countesss spiritual contest mrs andrew shook a worldly head you have no chance with men there louisa my harriet complains of female weakness yes we are strong in our own element louisa dont be tempted out of it sublime the countess rose element am i to be confined to one what but spiritual solaces could assist me to live after the degradations i have had heaped on me i renounce the world i turn my sight to realms where caste is unknown i feel no shame there of being a tailors daughter you see i can bring my tongue to name the thing in its actuality once that member would have blistered confess to me that in spite of your children you are tempted to howl at the idea of lymport the countess paused and like a lady about to fire off a gun appeared to tighten her nerves crying out rapidly shop shears geese cabbage snip nine to a man even as the silence after explosions of cannon that which reigned in the room was deep and dreadful see the countess continued you are horrified you shudder i name all our titles and if i wish to be red in my cheeks i must rouge it is in verity as if my senseless clay were pelted as we heard of evan at his first lymport boys school you remember when he told us the story he lisped a trifle then im the thon of a thnip oh it was hellfire to us then but now what do i feel why i avowed it to herbert duffian openly and he said that the misfortune of dear papas birth did not the less enable him to proclaim himself in conduct a noblemans offspring which he never was harriet broke the rhapsody in a monotonous low tone the countess was not compelled to hear and that a large outfitterone of the very largest was in reality a merchant whose daughters have often wedded nobles of the land and become ancestresses now harriet do you see what a truly religious mind can do for us in the way of comfort oh i bow in gratitude to herbert duffian i will not rest till i have led him back to our fold recovered from his error he was our own preacher and pastor he quitted us from conviction he shall return to us from conviction the countess quoted texts which i respect and will not repeat she descanted further on spiritualism and on the balm that it was to tailors and their offspring to all outcasts from society overpowered by her harriet thus summed up her opinions you were always selfwilled louisa say full of sacrifice if you would be just added the countess and the victim of basest ingratitude well you are in a dangerous path louisa harriet had the last word which usually the countess was not disposed to accord but now she knew herself strengthened to do so and was content to smile pityingly on her sister full upon them in this frame of mind arrived carolines great news from beckley it was then that the countesss conduct proved a memorable refutation of cynical philosophy she rejoiced in the good fortune of him who had offended her though he was not crushed and annihilated as he deserved to be by the wrong he had done the greathearted woman pardoned him her first remark was let him thank me for it or not i will lose no moment in hastening to load him with my congratulations pleasantly she joked andrew and defended him from harriet now so we are not all bankrupts you see dear brotherinlaw andrew had become so demoralized by his own plot that in every turn of events he scented a similar piece of human ingenuity harriet was angry with his disbelief or say the grudging credit he gave to the glorious news notwithstanding her calmness the thoughts of lymport had sickened her soul and it was only for the sake of her children and from a sense of the dishonesty of spending a farthing of the money belonging as she conceived to the creditors that she had consented to go i see your motive mr cogglesby she observed your measures are disconcerted i will remain here till my brother gives me shelter oh thatll do my love thats all i want said andrew sincerely both of you fools the countess interjected know you evan so little he will receive us anywhere his arms are open to his kindred but to his heart the road is through humiliation and it is to his heart we seek admittance what do you mean harriet inquired just this the countess answered in bold english and her eyes were lively her figure elastic we must all of us go down to the old shop and shake his hand thereevery man jack of usim only quoting the sailors harrietand thats the way to win him she snapped her fingers laughing harriet stared at her and so did andrew though for a different reason she seemed to be transformed seeing him inclined to gape she ran up to him caught up his chin between her ten fingers and kissed him on both cheeks saying you neednt come if youre too proud you know little man and to harriets look of disgust the cause for which she divined with her native rapidity she said what does it matter they will talk but they cant look down on us now why this is my doing she came tripping to her tall sister to ask plaintively maynt i be glad and bobbed a curtsey harriet desired andrew to leave them flushed and indignant she then faced the countess so unnecessary she began what can excuse your indiscretion louisa the countess smiled to hear her talking to her younger sister once more she shrugged oh if you will keep up the fiction do andrew knowshe isnt an idiotand to him we can make light of it now what does anybodys birth matter whos well off it was impossible for harriet to take that view the shop if not the thing might still have been concealed from her husband she thought it mattered to me when i was well off she said sternly yes and to me when i was but weve had a fall and a lesson since that my dear half the aristocracy of england spring from shops shall i measure you harriet never felt such a desire to inflict a slap upon mortal cheek she marched away from her in a tiff on the other hand andrew was half fascinated by the countesss sudden reassumption of girlhood and returnedsilly fellow to have another look at her she had ceased on reflection to be altogether so vivacious her stronger second nature had somewhat resumed its empire still she was fresh and could at times be roguishly affectionate and she patted him and petted him and made much of him slightly railed at him for his uxoriousness and domestic subjection and proffered him her fingers to try the taste of the truth must be told mr duflian not being handy she in her renewed earthly happiness wanted to see her charms in a womans natural mirror namely the face of man if of man on his knees all the better and though a little man is not much of a man and a sisters husband is or should be hardly one at all still some sort of a reflector he must be two or three jests adapted to andrews palate achieved his momentary captivation he said gad i never kissed you in my life louy and she with a flavour of delicate irish brogue why dont ye catch opportunity by the tail then perfect innocence i assure you on both sides but mark how stupidity betrays andrew failed to understand her and act on the hint immediately had he done so the affair would have been over without a witness as it happened delay permitted harriet to assist at the ceremony it wasnt your mouth louy said andrew oh my mouththat i keep for my chosen was answered gad you make a fellow almost wish andrews fingers worked over his poll and then the spectre of righteous wrath flashed on himnaughty little man that he was he knew himself naughty for it was the only time since his marriage that he had ever been sorry to see his wife this is a comedy and i must not preach lessons of life here but i am obliged to remark that the husband must be proof the sisterinlaw perfect where arrangements exist that keep them under one roof she may be so like his wife or from the knowledge she has of his circumstances she may talk to him almost as his wife he may forget that she is not his wife and then again the small beginnings which are in reality the mighty barriers are so easily slid over but what is the use of telling this to a pure generation my constant error is in supposing that i write for the wicked people who begat us note however the difference between the woman and the man shame confessed andrews naughtiness he sniggered pitiably whereas the countess jumped up and pointing at him asked her sister what she thought of that her next sentence coolly delivered related to some millinery matter if this was not innocence what is nevertheless i must here state that the scene related innocent as it was and as one would naturally imagine of puny consequence if any did no less a thing than subsequently to precipitate the protestant countess de saldar into the bosom of the roman catholic church a little bit of play it seems barely just but if as i have heard a lady has trod on a pebble and broken her nose tremendous results like these warn us to be careful how we walk as for play it was never intended that we should play with flesh and blood and oh be charitable matrons of britain see here andrew cogglesby who loved his wife as his very soul and who almost disliked her sister in ten minutes the latter had set his head spinning the whole of the day he went about the house meditating frantically on the possibility of his harriet demanding a divorce she was not the sort of woman to do that but one thing she resolved to do and it was to go to lymport with louisa and having once got her out of her dwellingplace never to allow her to enter it wherever it might be in the light of a resident again whether anything but the menace of a participation in her conjugal possessions could have despatched her to that hateful place i doubt she went she would not let andrew be out of her sight growing haughtier toward him at every step she advanced to the strange old shop evan harrington over the door there the countess having meantime returned to her state of womanhood shared her shudders they entered and passed in to mrs mel leaving their footman apparently in the rear evan was not visible a man in the shop with a yard measure negligently adorning his shoulders said that mr harrington was in the habit of quitting the shop at five deuced good habit too said andrew why sir observed another stepping forward as you truly sayyes butah mr andrew cogglesby pleasure of meeting you once in fallow field remember mr perkinsthe lawyer not the maltster will you do me the favour to step out with me andrew followed him into the street are you aware of our young friends good fortune said lawyer perkins yes ah wellwould you believe that any sane person in his condition nownonsense apartcould bring his mind wilfully to continue a beggar no um well mr cogglesby i may tell you that i hold here in my hands a document by which mr evan harrington transfers the whole of the property bequeathed to him to lady jocelyn and that i have his orders to execute it instantly and deliver it over to her ladyship after the will is settled probate and so forth i presume there will be an arrangement about his fathers debts now what do you think of that think sirthink cried andrew cocking his head at him like an indignant bird i think hes a damned young idiot to do so and youre a confounded old rascal to help him leaving mr perkins to digest his judgement which he had solicited andrew bounced back into the shop chapter xlv in which the shop becomes the centre of attraction under the first lustre of a maynight evan was galloping over the moon shadowed downs toward beckley at the ridge commanding the woods the park and the stream his horse stopped as if from habit snorted and puffed its sides while he gazed steadily across the long lighted vale soon he began to wind down the glaring chalktrack and reached grass levels here he broke into a round pace till gaining the first straggling cottages of the village he knocked the head of his whip against the gardengate of one and a man came out who saluted him and held the reins animal does work sir said the man evan gave directions for it to be looked to and went on to the doorway where he was met by a young woman she uttered a respectful greeting and begged him to enter the door closed he flung himself into a chair and said well susan how is the child oh hes always well mr harrington he dont know the tricks o trouble yet will polly be here soon at a quarter after nine she said sir evan bade her sit down after examining her features quietly he said i m glad to see you here susan you dont regret that you followed my advice no sir now its over i dont mothers kind enough and father doesnt mention anything shes abed with bilefathers out but what theres something on your mind i shall cry if i begin mr harrington see how far you can get without oh sir then said susan on a sharp rise of her bosom it aint my fault i wouldnt cause trouble to mr harry or any friend of yours but sir father have got hold of his letters to me and he says there s a promise in emleast one of em and its as good as law he says he heard it in a publichouse and hes gone over to fallfield to a lawgentleman there susan was compelled to give way to some sobs it aint for mefather does it sir she pleaded i tried to stop him knowing how itd vex you mr harrington but hes heady about points though a quiet man ordinary and he says he dont expectand i know now no gentleman d marry such as mei aint such a stupid gaper at words as i used to be but father says its for the childs sake and he does it to have him provided for please dont ye be angry with me sir susans halfcontrolled spasms here got the better of her while evan was awaiting the return of her calmer senses the latch was lifted and polly appeared at it again was her sneering comment after a short survey of her apronscreened sister and then she bobbed to evan its whimper whimper and squeak squeak half their lives with some girls after that they go wondering they cant see to thread a needle the neighbours i suppose i should like to lift the top off some o their houses i hope i havent kept you sir no polly said evan but you must be charitable or i shall think you want a lesson yourself mr raikes tells me you want to see me what is it you seem to be correspondents polly replied oh no mr harrington only accidental oneswhen something particulars to be said and he danceslike on the paper so that you cant help laughing isnt he a very eccentric gentleman sir very said evan i ve no time to lose polly here you must go the latter called to her sister now pack at once sue do rout out and do leave off thinking youve got a candle at your eyes for goodness sake susan was too well accustomed to pollys usage to complain she murmured a gentle good night sir and retired whereupon polly exclaimed bless her poor dear soft heart it s us hard ones that get on best in the world im treated better than her mr harrington and i know i aint worth half of her it goes nigh to make one religious only to see how exactly like scripture is the way beckley treats her whose only sin is her being so soft as to believe in a man oh dear mr harrington i wish i had good news for you in spite of all his selfcontrol evan breathed quickly and looked eagerly speak it out polly oh dear i must i suppose polly answered mr laxleys become a lord now mr harrington evan tasted in his soul the sweets of contrast well and my miss roseshe what moved by the keen hunger of his eyes polly hesitated her face betrayed a sudden change of mind wants to see you sir she said resolutely to see me evan stood up so pale that polly was frightened where is she where can i meet her please dont take it so mr harrington evan commanded her to tell him what her mistress had said now up to this point polly had spoken truth she was positive her mistress did want to see him polly also with a maidens tender guile desired to bring them together for once though it were for the last time and for no good on earth she had been about to confide to him her young mistresss position toward lord laxley when his sharp interrogation stopped her shrinking from absolute invention she remarked that of course she could not exactly remember miss roses words which seemed indeed too much to expect of her she will see me tonight said evan i dont know about tonight polly replied go to her instantly tell her i am ready i will be at the west park gates this is why you wrote polly why did you lose time dont delay my good girl come evan had opened the door he would not allow polly an instant for expostulation but drew her out saying you will attend to the gates yourself or come and tell me the day if she appoints another polly made a final effort to escape from the pit she was being pushed into mr harrington it wasnt to tell you this i wrote miss rose is engaged sir i understand said evan hoarsely scarcely feeling it as is the case with men who are shot through the heart ten minutes later he was on horseback by the fallow field gates with the tidings shrieking through his frame the night was still and stiller in the pauses of the nightingales he sat there neither thinking of them nor reproached in his manhood for the tears that rolled down his cheeks presently his horses ears pricked and the animal gave a low neigh evans eyes fixed harder on the length of gravel leading to the house there was no sign no figure out from the smooth grass of the lane a couple of horsemen issued and came straight to the gates he heard nothing till one spoke it was a familiar voice by jove ferdy here is the fellow and weve been all the way to lymport evan started from his trance it s you harrington yes harry sir exclaimed that youth evidently flushed with wine what the devil do you mean by addressing me by my christian name laxley pushed his horses head in front of harry in a manner apparently somewhat improved by his new dignity he said we have ridden to lymport to speak to you sir favour me by moving a little ahead of the lodge evan bowed and moved beside him a short way down the lane harry following the purport of my visit sir laxley began was to make known to you that miss jocelyn has done me the honour to accept me as her husband i learn from her that during the term of your residence in the house you contrived to extract from her a promise to which she attaches certain scruples she pleases to consider herself bound to you till you release her my object is to demand that you will do so immediately there was no reply should you refuse to make this reparation for the harm you have done to her and her family laxley pursued i must let you know that there are means of compelling you to it and that those means will be employed harry fuming at these postured sentences burst out what do you talk to the fellow in that way for a fellow who makes a fool of my cousin and then wants to get us to buy off my sister whats he spying after here the place is ours till we troop i tell you theres only one way of dealing with him and if you dont do it i will laxley pulled his reins with a jerk that brought him to the rear miss jocelyn has commissioned you to make this demand on me in her name said evan i make it in my own right returnedlaxley i demand a prompt reply my lord you shall have it miss jocelyn is not bound to me by any engagement should she entertain scruples which i may have it in my power to obliterate i shall not hesitate to do sobut only to her what has passed between us i hold sacred hark at that shouted harry the damned tradesman means money you ass ferdinand what did we go to lymport for not to bandy words here ive got my own quarrel with you harrington youve been setting that girls father on me can you deny that it was enough for harry that evan did not deny it the calm disdain which he read on evans face acted on his fury and digging his heels into his horses flanks he rushed full at him and dealt him a sharp flick with his whip evans beast reared accept my conditions sir or afford me satisfaction cried laxley you do me great honour my lord but i have told you i cannot said evan curbing his horse at that moment rose came among them evan raised his hat as did laxley harry a little behind the others performed a laborious mock salute and then ordered her back to the house a quick altercation ensued the end being that harry managed to give his sister the context of the previous conversation now go back rose said laxley i have particular business with mr harrington i came to see him said rose in a clear voice laxley reddened angrily then tell him at once you want to be rid of him her brother called to her rose looked at evan could he not see that she had no word in her soul for him of that kind yes but love is not always to be touched to tenderness even at the sight of love rose he said i hear from lord laxley that you fancy yourself not at liberty and that you require me to disengage you he paused did he expect her to say there that she wished nothing of the sort her stedfast eyes spoke as much but misery is wanton and will pull all down to it even harry was checked by his tone and laxley sat silent the fact that something more than a tailor was speaking seemed to impress them since i have to say it rose i hold you in no way bound to me the presumption is forced upon me may you have all the happiness i pray god to give you gentlemen good night he bowed and was gone how keenly she could have retorted on that false prayer for her happiness her limbs were nerveless her tongue speechless he had thrown her offthere was no barrier now between herself and ferdinand why did ferdinand speak to her with that air of gentle authority bidding her return to the house she was incapable of seeing what the young lord acutely felt that he had stooped very much in helping to bring about such a scene she had no idea of having trifled with him and her own heart when she talked feebly of her bondage to another as one who would be warmer to him were she free swiftly she compared the two that loved her and shivered as if she had been tossed to the embrace of a block of ice you are cold rose said laxley bending to lay his hand on her shoulder pray never touch me she answered and walked on hastily to the house entering it she remembered that evan had dwelt there a sense of desolation came over her she turned to ferdinand remorsefully saying dear ferdinand and allowed herself to be touched and taken close to him when she reached her bedroom she had time to reflect that he had kissed her on the lips and then she fell down and shed such tears as had never been drawn from her before next day she rose with an undivided mind belonging henceforth to ferdinand it was necessary that she should invest him immediately with transcendent qualities the absence of character in him rendered this easy what she had done for evan she did for him but now as if the fates had been lying in watch to entrap her and chain her that they might have her at their mercy her dreams of evans high naturehitherto dreams onlywere to be realized with the purposeless waywardness of her sex pony wheedle while dressing her young mistress and though quite aware that the parting had been spoken must needs relate her sisters story and evans share in it rose praised him like one forever aloof from him nay she could secretly congratulate herself on not being deceived upon that came a letter from caroline do not misjudge my brother he knew julianas love for him and rejected it you will soon have proofs of his disinterestedness then do not forget that he works to support us all i write this with no hope save to make you just to him that is the utmost he will ever anticipate it gave no beating of the heart to rose to hear good of evan now but an increased serenity of confidence in the accuracy of her judgement of persons the arrival of lawyer perkins supplied the key to carolines communication no one was less astonished than rose at the news that evan renounced the estate she smiled at harrys contrite stupefaction and her fathers incapacity of belief in conduct so singular caused her to lift her head and look down on her parent shows he knows nothing of the world poor young fellow said sir franks nothing more clearly observed lady jocelyn i presume i shall cease to be blamed for having had him here upon my honour he must have the soul of a gentleman said the baronet theres nothing he can expect in return you know one would think papa you had always been dealing with tradesmen remarked rose to whom her father now accorded the treatment due to a sensible girl laxley was present at the family consultation what was his opinion rose manifested a slight anxiety to hear it what those sort of fellows do never surprises me he said with a semi yawn rose felt fire on her cheeks its only what the young man is bound to do said mrs shorne his duty aunt i hope we may all do it rose interjected championing him again rose quietly turned her face too sure of her cold appreciation of him to retort but yesterday night a word from him might have made her his and here she sat advocating the nobility of his nature with the zeal of a barrister in full swing of practice remember however that a kiss separates them and how many millions of leagues that counts for in love in a pure girls thought i leave you to guess now in what way was evan to be thanked how was he to be treated sir franks proposed to go down to him in person accompanied by harry lady jocelyn acquiesced but rose said to her mother will not you wound his sensitiveness by going to him there possibly said her ladyship shall we write and ask him to come to us no mama could we ask him to make a journey to receive our thanks not till we have solid ones to offer perhaps he will not let us help him mama unless we have all given him our hands probably not theres always a fund of nonsense in those who are capable of great things i observe it shall be a family expedition if you like what exclaimed mrs shorne do you mean that you intend to allow rose to make one of the party franks is that your idea sir franks looked at his wife what harm lady jocelyn asked for roses absence of conscious guile in appealing to her reason had subjugated that great faculty simply a sense of propriety emily said mrs shorne with a glance at ferdinand you have no objection i suppose lady jocelyn addressed him ferdinand will join us said rose thank you rose id rather not he replied i thought we had done with the fellow for good last night last night quoth lady jocelyn no one spoke the interrogation was renewed was it roses swift instinct which directed her the shortest way to gain her point or that she was glad to announce that her degrading engagement was at an end she said ferdinand and mr harrington came to an understanding last night in my presence that strange as it struck on their ears appeared to be quite sufficient to all albeit the necessity for it was not so very clear the carriage was ordered forthwith lady jocelyn went to dress rose drew ferdinand away into the garden then with all her powers she entreated him to join her thank you rose he said i have no taste for the genus for my sake i beg it ferdinand its really too much to ask of me rose if you care for me you will pon my honour quite impossible you refuse ferdinand my london tailor d find me out and never forgive me this pleasantry stopped her soft looks why she wished him to be with her she could not have said for a thousand reasons which implies no distinct one something prophetically pressing in her blood chapter xlvi a lovers parting now to suppose oneself the fashioner of such a chain of events as this which brought the whole of the harrington family in tender unity together once more would have elated an ordinary mind but to the countess de saldar it was simply an occasion for reflecting that she had misunderstoodand could most sincerely forgiveprovidence she admitted to herself that it was not entirely her work for she never would have had their place of meeting to be the shop seeing however that her end was gained she was entitled to the credit of it and could pardon the means adopted her brother lord of beckley court and all of them assembled in the old main street lymport what matter for proud humility providence had answered her numerous petitions but in its own way stipulating that she must swallow this pill providence consented to serve her she swallowed it with her wonted courage in half an hour subsequent to her arrival at lymport she laid siege to the heart of old tom cogglesby whom she found installed in the parlour comfortably sipping at a tumbler of rumandwater old tom was astonished to meet such an agreeable unpretentious woman who talked of tailors and lords with equal ease appeared to comprehend a mans habits instinctively and could amuse him while she ministered to them can you cook maam asked old tom all but that said the countess with a smile of sweet meaning ha then you wont suit me as well as your mother take care you do not excite my emulation she returned graciously albeit disgusted at his tone to harriet old tom had merely nodded there he sat in the armchair sucking the liquor with the glimpse of a sour chuckle on his cheeks now and then during the evening he rubbed his hands sharply but spoke little the unbending harriet did not conceal her disdain of him when he ventured to allude to the bankruptcy she cut him short pray excuse mei am unacquainted with affairs of businessi cannot even understand my husband lord bless my soul old tom exclaimed rolling his eyes caroline had informed her sisters upstairs that their mother was ignorant of evans change of fortune and that evan desired her to continue so for the present caroline appeared to be pained by the subject and was glad when louisa sounded his mysterious behaviour by saying evan has a native love of concealmenthe must be humoured at the supper mr raikes made his bow he was modest and reserved it was known that this young gentleman acted as shopman there with a tenderness for his position worthy of all respect the countess spared his feelings by totally ignoring his presence whereat he unaccustomed to such greatminded treatment retired to bed a hater of his kind harriet and caroline went next the countess said she would wait up for evan but hearing that his hours of return were about the chimes of matins she cried exultingly darling papa all over and departed likewise mrs mel when she had mixed old toms third glass wished the brothers good night and they were left to exchange what sentiments they thought proper for the occasion the countess had certainly disappointed old toms farce in a measure and he expressed himself puzzled by her you aint the only one said his brother andrew with some effort held his tongue concerning the news of evanhis fortune and his folly till he could talk to the youth in person all took their seats at the early breakfast next morning has evan not comehome yet was the countesss first question mrs mel replied no do you know where he has gone dear mama he chooses his own way and you fear that it leads somewhere added the countess i fear that it leads to knocking up the horse he rides the horse mama he is out on a horse all night but dont you see dear old pet his morals at least are safe on horseback the horse has to be paid for louisa said her mother sternly and then for she had a lesson to read to the guests of her son ready money doesnt come by joking what will the creditors think if he intends to be honest in earnest he must give up fourfeet mouths fourteenfeet maam you mean said old tom counting the heads at table bravo mama cried the countess and as she was sitting near her mother she must show how prettily she kissed by pouting out her playful lips to her parent do be economical always and mind for the sake of the wretched animals i will intercede for you to be his inspector of stables this with a glance of intelligence at her sisters well mr raikes said andrew you keep good hours at all events eh up with the lark said old tom ha fraid he wont be so early when he gets rid of his present habitseh nec dierum numerum ut nos sed noctium computant said mr raikes and both the brothers sniffed like dogs that have put their noses to a hot coal and the countess who was less insensible to the aristocracy of the dead languages than are women generally gave him the recognition that is occasionally afforded the family tutor about the hour of ten evan arrived he was subjected to the hottest embrace he had ever yet received from his sister louisa darling she called him before them all oh how i suffer for this ignominy i see you compelled for a moment to endure but it is but for a moment they must vacate and you will soon be out of this horrid hole where he just said he was glad to give us a welcome muttered old tom evan heard him and laughed the countess laughed too no we will not be impatient we are poor insignificant people she said and turning to her mother added and yet i doubt not you think the smallest of our landed gentry equal to great continental seigneurs i do not say the contrary you will fill evans head with nonsense till you make him knock up a horse a week and never go to his natural bed said mrs mel angrily look at him is a face like that fit for business certainly certainly not said the countess well mother the horse is dismissedyou wont have to complain any more said evan touching her hand another history commences from today the countess watched him admiringly such powers of acting she could not have ascribed to him another history indeed she said by the way van love was it out of glamorganshirewere we tudors according to papa or only powys chieftains its of no moment but it helps one in conversation not half so much as good ale though was old toms comment the countess did not perceive its fitness till evan burst into a laugh and then she said oh we shall never be ashamed of the brewery do not fear that mr cogglesby old tom saw his farce reviving and encouraged the countess to patronize him she did so to an extent that called on her mrs mels reprobation which was so cutting and pertinent that harriet was compelled to defend her sister remarking that perhaps her mother would soon learn that louisa was justified in not permitting herself and family to be classed too low at this andrew coming from a private interview with evan threw up his hands and eyes as one who foretold astonishment but counselled humility what with the effort of those who knew a little to imply a great deal of those who knew all to betray nothing and of those who were kept in ignorance to strain a fact out of the conflicting innuendos the general mystification waxed apace and was at its height when a name struck on evans ear that went through his blood like a touch of the torpedo he had been called into the parlour to assist at a consultation over the brewery affairs raikes opened the door and announced sir franks and lady jocelyn them he could meet though it was hard for his pride to pardon their visit to him there but when his eyes discerned rose behind them the passions of his lower nature stood up armed what could she have come for but to humiliate or play with him a very few words enabled the countess to guess the cause for this visit of course it was to beg time but they thanked evan for something generous no doubt sir franks took him aside and returning remarked to his wife that she perhaps would have greater influence with him all this while rose sat talking to mrs andrew cogglesby mrs strike and evans mother she saw by his face the offence she had committed and acted on by one of her impulses said mama i think if i were to speak to mr harrington ere her mother could make light of the suggestion old tom had jumped up and bowed out his arm allow me to conduct ye to the drawing room upstairs young lady hell follow safe enough rose had not stipulated for that nevertheless seeing no cloud on her mothers face or her fathers she gave old tom her hand and awaited a movement from evan it was too late to object to it on either side old tom had caught the tide at the right instant much as if a grim old genie had planted them together the lovers found themselves alone evan you forgive me she began looking up at him timidly with all my heart rose he answered with great cheerfulness no i know your heart better oh evan you must be sure that we respect you too much to wound you we came to thank you for your generosity do you refuse to accept anything from us how can we take this that you thrust on us unless in some way say no more he interposed you see me here you know me as i am now yes yes the tears stood in her eyes why did i come you would ask that is what you cannot forgive i see now how useless it was evan why did you betray me betray you rose you said that you loved me once she was weeping and all his spirit melted and his love cried out i said till death and till death it will be rose then why why did you betray me evan i know it all but if you blackened yourself to me was it not because you loved something better than me and now you think me false which of us two has been false it s silly to talk of these things now too late but be just i wish that we may be friends can we unless you bend a little the tears streamed down her cheeks and in her lovely humility he saw the baseness of that pride of his which had hitherto held him up now that you are in this house where i was born and am to live can you regret what has come between us rose her lips quivered in pain can i do anything else but regret it all my life evan how was it possible for him to keep his strength rose he spoke with a passion that made her shrink are you bound to this man and to the drooping of her eyes no impossible for you do not love him break it break the engagement you cannot fulfil break it and belong to me it sounds ill for me to say that in such a place but rose i will leave it i will accept any assistance that your fatherthat any man will give me belovednoble girl i see my falseness to you though i little thought it at the timefool that i was be my help my guideas the soul of my body be mine oh evan she clasped her hands in terror at the change in him that was hurrying her she knew not whither and trembling held them supplicatingly yes rose you have taught me what love can be you cannot marry that man but my honour evan no i do not love him for i can love but one he has my pledge can i break it the stress on the question choked him just as his heart sprang to her can you face the world with me rose oh evan is there an escape for me think decidenono there is not my mother i know looks on it so why did she trust me to be with you here but that she thinks me engaged to him and has such faith in me oh help mebe my guide think whether you would trust me hereafter i should despise myself not if you marry him said evan bitterly and then thinking as men will think when they look on the figure of a fair girl marching serenely to a sacrifice the horrors of which they insist that she ought to know halfhating her for her calmnessadoring her for her innocence he said it rests with you rose the world will approve you and if your conscience does whyfarewell and may heaven be your help she murmured farewell did she expect more to be said by him what did she want or hope for now and yet a light of hunger grew in her eyes brighter and brighter as it were on a wave of yearning take my hand once she faltered her hand and her whole shape he took and she with closed eyes let him strain her to his breast their swoon was broken by the opening of the door where old tom cogglesby and lady jocelyn appeared gad he seems to have got his recompenseeh my lady cried old tom however satisfactorily they might have explained the case it certainly did seem so lady jocelyn looked not absolutely displeased old tom was chuckling at her elbow the two principal actors remained dumb i suppose if we leave young people to settle a thing this is how they do it her ladyship remarked gad and they do it well cried old tom rose with a deep blush on her cheeks stepped from evan to her mother not in effrontery but earnestly and as the only way of escaping from the position she said i have succeeded mama he will take what i offer and whats that now old tom inquired rose turned to evan he bent and kissed her hand call it recompense for the nonce said lady jocelyn do you still hold to your original proposition tom every penny my lady i like the young fellow and shes a jolly little lassif she means itshes a woman true said lady jocelyn considering that fact you will oblige me by keeping the matter quiet does she want to try whether the tailors a gentleman still my lady eh no i fancy she will have to see whether a certain nobleman may be one the countess now joined them sir franks had informed her of her brothers last fine performance after a short uneasy pause she said glancing at evan you know his romantic nature i can assure you he was sincere and even if you could not accept at least but we have accepted countess said rose the estate the estate countess and what is more to increase the effect of his generosity he has consented to take a recompense indeed exclaimed the countess directing a stony look at her brother may i presume to ask what recompense rose shook her head such a very poor one countess he has no idea of relative value the countesss great mind was just then running hot on estates and thousands or she would not have played goose to them you may be sure she believed that evan had been wheedled by rose into the acceptance of a small sum of money in return for his egregious gift with an internal groan the outward aspect of which she had vast difficulty in masking she said you are righthe has no head easily cajoled old tom sat down in a chair and laughed outright lady jocelyn in pity for the poor lady who always amused her thought it time to put an end to the scene i hope your brother will come to us in about a week she said may i expect the favour of your company as well the countess felt her dignity to be far superior as she responded lady jocelyn when next i enjoy the gratification of a visit to your hospitable mansion i must know that i am not at a disadvantage i cannot consent to be twice pulled down to my brothers level evans heart was too full of its dim young happiness to speak or care for words the cold elegance of the countesss curtsey to lady jocelyn her ladyships kindly pressure of his hand roses stedfast look into his eyes old toms smothered exclamation that he was not such a fool as he seemed all passed dreamlike and when he was left to the fury of the countess he did not ask her to spare him nor did he defend himself she bade adieu to him and their mutual relationship that very day but her star had not forsaken her yet chancing to peep into the shop to intrust a commission to mr john raikes who was there doing penance for his career as a gentleman she heard old tom and andrew laughing utterly unlike bankrupts who d have thought the women such fools and the countess too this was andrews voice he chuckled as one emancipated the countess had a short interview with him before she took her departure to join her husband under the roof of the honourable herbert duffian and andrew chuckled no more chapter xlvii a year later the countess de saldar de sancorvo to her sister caroline rome let the postmark be my reply to your letter received through the consulate and most courteously delivered with the consuls compliments we shall yet have an ambassador at romemark your louisas words yes dearest i am here body and spirit i have at last found a haven a refuge and let those who condemn me compare the peace of their spirits with mine you think that you have quite conquered the dreadfulness of our origin my love i smile at you i know it to be impossible for the protestant heresy to offer a shade of consolation earthlyborn it rather encourages earthly distinctions it is the sweet sovereign pontiff alone who gathers all in his arms not excepting tailors here if they could know it is their blessed comfort thank harriet for her message she need say nothing by refusing me her hospitality when she must have known that the house was as free of creditors as any foreigner under the rank of count is of soap she drove me to mr duflian oh how i rejoice at her exceeding unkindness how warmly i forgive her the unsisterlyto say the leastvindictiveness of her unaccountable conduct her sufferings will one day be terrible good little andrew supplies her place to me why do you refuse his easily afforded bounty no one need know of it i tell you candidly i take double and the small good punch of a body is only too delighted but then i can be discreet oh the gentlemanliness of these infinitely maligned jesuits they remind me immensely of sir charles grandison and those frontispiece pictures to the novels we read when girlsi mean in manners and the ideas they imposenot in dress or length of leg of course the same winning softness the same irresistible ascendancy over the female mind they require virtue for two i assure you and so i told silva who laughed but the charms of confession my dear i will talk of evan first i have totally forgiven him attache to the naples embassy sounds tol lol in such a position i can rejoice to see him for it permits me to acknowledge him i am not sure that spiritually rose will be his most fitting helpmate however it is done and i did it and there is no more to be said the behaviour of lord laxley in refusing to surrender a young lady who declared that her heart was with another exceeds all i could have supposed one of the noble peers among his ancestors must have been a pig oh the roman nobility grace refinement intrigue perfect comprehension of your ideas wishesthe meanest trifles here you have every worldly charm and all crowned by religion this is my true delight i feel at last that whatsoever i do i cannot go far wrong while i am within hail of my gentle priest i never could feel so before the idea of mr parsley proposing for the beautiful widow strike it was indecent to do so so soonwidowed under such circumstances but i dare say he was as disinterested as a protestant curate ever can be beauty is a good dowry to bring a poor lean worldly curate of your church and he knows that your bishops and arches are quite susceptible to beautiful petitioners and we know here how your livings and benefices are dispensed what do you intend to do come to me come to the bosom of the old and the only true church and i engage to marry you to a roman prince the very next morning or two that is if you have no ideas about prosecuting a certain enterprise which i should not abandon in that case stay as duchess of b mr duffian says you would be cordially welcome to his holiness who may see women that absurd report is all nonsense we do not kiss his toe certainly but we have privileges equally enviable herbert is all charm i confess he is a little wearisome with his old ruins and his dante the poet he is quite of my opinion that evan will never wash out the trade stain on him until he comes over to the church of rome i adjure you caroline to lay this clearly before our dear brother in fact while he continues a protestant to me he is a tailor but here rose is the impediment i know her to be just one of those little dogged minds that are incapable of receiving new impressions was it not evident in the way she stuck to evan after i had once brought them together i am not at all astonished that mr raikes should have married her maid it is a case of natural selection but it is amusing to think of him carrying on the old business in and with credit i suppose his parents are to be pitied but what better is the creature fit for mama displeases me in consenting to act as housekeeper to old grumpus i do not object to the fact for it is prospective but she should have insisted on another place of resort than fallow field i do not agree with you in thinking her right in refusing a second marriage her age does not shelter her from scandal in your protestant communities i am every day expecting harry jocelyn to turn up he was rightly sent away for to think of the folly evan put into his empty head no he shall have another wife and protestantism shall be his forsaken mistress see how your louy has given up the world and its vanities you expected me to creep up to you contrite and whimpering on the contrary i never felt prouder and i am not going to live a lazy life i can assure you the church hath need of me if only for the peace it hath given me on one point i am eternally bound to serve it postscript i am persuaded of this that it is utterly impossible for a man to be a true gentleman who is not of the true church what it is i cannot say but it is as a convert that i appreciate my husband love is made to me dear for catholics are human the other day it was a question whether a lady or a gentleman should be compromised it required the grossest fib the gentleman did not hesitate and why his priest was handy fancy lord laxley in such a case i shudder this shows that your religion precludes any possibility of the being the real gentleman and whatever evan may think of himself or rose think of him i know the thing etext editors bookmarks a man to be trusted with the keys of anything because you loved something better than me bitten hard at experience and know the value of a tooth from head to foot nothing better than a moan made visible glimpse of her whole life in the horrid tomb of his embrace gratuitous insult how many degrees from love gratitude may be in truth she sighed to feel as he did above everybody it s us hard ones that get on best in the world it is better for us both of course never intended that we should play with flesh and blood she was unworthy to be the wife of a tailor sincere as far as she knew as far as one who loves may be small beginnings which are in reality the mighty barriers spiritualism and on the balm that it was we deprive all renegades of their spiritual titles
