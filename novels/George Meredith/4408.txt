and david widger widgercecometnet the ordeal of richard feverel by george meredith book xxi richard is summoned to town to hear a sermon xxii indicates the approaches of fever xxiii crisis in the apple disease xxiv of the spring primrose and the autumnal xxv in which the hero takes a step xxvi records the rapid development of the hero xxvii contains an intercession for the heroine chapter xxi by twelve o'clock at noon next day the inhabitants of raynham abbey knew that berry the baronet's man had arrived post haste from town with orders to conduct mr richard thither and that mr richard had refused to go had sworn he would not defied his father and despatched berry to the shades berry was all that benson was not whereas benson hated woman berry admired her warmly second to his own stately person woman occupied his reflections and commanded his homage berry was of majestic port and used dictionary words among the maids of raynham his conscious calves produced all the discord and the frenzy those adornments seem destined to create in tender bosoms he had moreover the reputation of having suffered for the sex which assisted his object in inducing the sex to suffer for him what with his calves and his dictionary words and the attractive halo of the mysterious vindictiveness of venus surrounding him this adonis of the lower household was a mighty man below and he moved as one on hearing the tumult that followed berry's arrival adrian sent for him and was informed of the nature of his mission and its result you should come to me first said adrian i should have imagined you were shrewd enough for that berry pardon me mr adrian berry doubled his elbow to explain pardon me sir acting recipient of special injunctions i was not a free agent go to mr richard again berry there will be a little confusion if he holds back perhaps you had better throw out a hint or so of apoplexy a slight hint will do and here berry when you return to town you had better not mention anything to quote johnson of benson's spiflication certainly not sir the wise youth's hint had the desired effect on richard he dashed off a hasty letter by tom to belthorpe and mounting his horse galloped to the bellingham station sir austin was sitting down to a quiet early dinner at his hotel when the hope of raynham burst into his room the baronet was not angry with his son on the contrary for he was singularly just and self accusing while pride was not up in arms he had been thinking all day after the receipt of benson's letter that he was deficient in cordiality and did not by reason of his excessive anxiety make himself sufficiently his son's companion was not enough as he strove to be mother and father to him preceptor and friend previsor and associate he had not to ask his conscience where he had lately been to blame towards the system he had slunk away from raynham in the very crisis of the magnetic age and this young woman of the parish as benson had termed sweet lucy in his letter was the consequence yes pride and sensitiveness were his chief foes and he would trample on them to begin he embraced his son hard upon an englishman at any time doubly so to one so shamefaced at emotion in cool blood as it were it gave him a strange pleasure nevertheless and the youth seemed to answer to it he was excited was his love then beginning to correspond with his father's as in those intimate days before the blossoming season but when richard inarticulate at first in his haste cried out my dear dear father you are safe i feared you are better sir thank god sir austin stood away from him safe he said what has alarmed you instead of replying richard dropped into a chair and seized his hand and kissed it sir austin took a seat and waited for his son to explain those doctors are such fools richard broke out i was sure they were wrong they don't know headache from apoplexy it's worth the ride sir to see you you left raynham so suddenly but you are well it was not an attack of real apoplexy his father's brows contorted and he said no it was not richard pursued if you were ill i couldn't come too soon though if coroners' inquests sat on horses those doctors would be found guilty of mare slaughter cassandra'll be knocked up i was too early for the train at bellingham and i wouldn't wait she did the distance in four hours and three quarters pretty good sir wasn't it it has given you appetite for dinner i hope said the baronet not so well pleased to find that it was not simple obedience that had brought the youth to him in such haste i'm ready replied richard i shall be in time to return by the last train to night i will leave cassandra in your charge for a rest his father quietly helped him to soup which he commenced gobbling with an eagerness that might pass for appetite all well at raynham said the baronet quite sir nothing new nothing sir the same as when i left no change whatever i shall be glad to get back to the old place said the baronet my stay in town has certainly been profitable i have made some pleasant acquaintances who may probably favour us with a visit there in the late autumn people you may be pleased to know they are very anxious to see raynham i love the old place cried richard i never wish to leave it why boy before i left you were constantly begging to see town was i sir how odd well i don't want to remain here i've seen enough of it how did you find your way to me richard laughed and related his bewilderment at the miles of brick and the noise and the troops of people concluding there's no place like home the baronet watched his symptomatic brilliant eyes and favoured him with a double dealing sentence to anchor the heart by any object ere we have half traversed the world is youth's foolishness my son reverence time a better maxim that than your horatian he knows all thought richard and instantly drew away leagues from his father and threw up fortifications round his love and himself dinner over richard looked hurriedly at his watch and said with much briskness i shall just be in time sir if we walk will you come with me to the station the baronet did not answer richard was going to repeat the question but found his father's eyes fixed on him so meaningly that he wavered and played with his empty glass i think we will have a little more claret said the baronet claret was brought and they were left alone the baronet then drew within arm's reach of his son and began i am not aware what you may have thought of me richard during the years we have lived together and indeed i have never been in a hurry to be known to you and if i had died before my work was done i should not have complained at losing half my reward in hearing you thank me perhaps as it is i never may everything save selfishness has its recompense i shall be content if you prosper he fetched a breath and continued you had in your infancy a great loss father and son coloured simultaneously to make that good to you i chose to isolate myself from the world and devote myself entirely to your welfare and i think it is not vanity that tells me now that the son i have reared is one of the most hopeful of god's creatures but for that very reason you are open to be tempted the most and to sink the deepest it was the first of the angels who made the road to hell he paused again richard fingered at his watch in our house my son there is peculiar blood we go to wreck very easily it sounds like superstition i cannot but think we are tried as most men are not i see it in us all and you my son are compounded of two races your passions are violent you have had a taste of revenge you have seen in a small way that the pound of flesh draws rivers of blood but there is now in you another power you are mounting to the table land of life where mimic battles are changed to real ones and you come upon it laden equally with force to create and to destroy he deliberated to announce the intelligence with deep meaning there are women in the world my son the young man's heart galloped back to raynham it is when you encounter them that you are thoroughly on trial it is when you know them that life is either a mockery to you or as some find it a gift of blessedness they are our ordeal love of any human object is the soul's ordeal and they are ours loving them or not the young man heard the whistle of the train he saw the moon lighted wood and the vision of his beloved he could barely hold himself down and listen i believe the baronet spoke with little of the cheerfulness of belief good women exist oh if he knew lucy but and he gazed on richard intently it is given to very few to meet them on the threshold i may say to none we find them after hard buffeting and usually when we find the one fitted for us our madness has misshaped our destiny our lot is cast for women are not the end but the means of life in youth we think them the former and thousands who have not even the excuse of youth select a mate or worse with that sole view i believe women punish us for so perverting their uses they punish society the baronet put his hand to his brow as his mind travelled into consequences 'our most diligent pupil learns not so much as an earnest teacher' says the pilgrim's scrip and sir austin in schooling himself to speak with moderation of women was beginning to get a glimpse of their side of the case cold blood now touched on love to hot blood cold blood said it is a passion coming in the order of nature the ripe fruit of our animal being hot blood felt it is a divinity all that is worth living for in the world cold blood said it is a fever which tests our strength and too often leads to perdition hot blood felt lead whither it will i follow it cold blood said it is a name men and women are much in the habit of employing to sanctify their appetites hot blood felt it is worship religion life and so the two parallel lines ran on the baronet became more personal you know my love for you my son the extent of it you cannot know but you must know that it is something very deep and i do not wish to speak of it but a father must sometimes petition for gratitude since the only true expression of it is his son's moral good if you care for my love or love me in return aid me with all your energies to keep you what i have made you and guard you from the snares besetting you it was in my hands once it is ceasing to be so remember my son what my love is it is different i fear with most fathers but i am bound up in your welfare what you do affects me vitally you will take no step that is not intimate with my happiness or my misery and i have had great disappointments my son so far it was well richard loved his father and even in his frenzied state he could not without emotion hear him thus speak unhappily the baronet who by some fatality never could see when he was winning the battle thought proper in his wisdom to water the dryness of his sermon with a little jocoseness on the subject of young men fancying themselves in love and when they were raw and green absolutely wanting to be that most awful thing which the wisest and strongest of men undertake in hesitation and after self mortification and penance married he sketched the foolish young fellow the object of general ridicule and covert contempt he sketched the woman the strange thing made in our image and with all our faculties passing to the rule of one who in taking her proved that he could not rule himself and had no knowledge of her save as a choice morsel which he would burn the whole world and himself in the bargain to possess he harped upon the foolish young fellow till the foolish young fellow felt his skin tingle and was half suffocated with shame and rage after this the baronet might be as wise as he pleased he had quite undone his work he might analyze love and anatomize woman he might accord to her her due position and paint her fair he might be shrewd jocose gentle pathetic wonderfully wise he spoke to deaf ears closing his sermon with the question softly uttered have you anything to tell me richard and hoping for a confession and a thorough re establishment of confidence the callous answer struck him cold i have not the baronet relapsed in his chair and made diagrams of his fingers richard turned his back on further dialogue by going to the window in the section of sky over the street twinkled two or three stars shining faintly feeling the moon the moon was rising the woods were lifting up to her his star of the woods would be there a bed of moss set about flowers in a basket under him breathed to his nostril of the woodland keenly and filled him with delirious longing a succession of hard sighs brought his father's hand on his shoulder you have nothing you could say to me my son tell me richard remember there is no home for the soul where dwells a shadow of untruth nothing at all sir the young man replied meeting him with the full orbs of his eyes the baronet withdrew his hand and paced the room at last it grew impossible for richard to control his impatience and he said do you intend me to stay here sir am i not to return to raynham at all to night his father was again falsely jocular what and catch the train after giving it ten minutes' start cassandra will take me said the young man earnestly i needn't ride her hard sir or perhaps you would lend me your winkelried i should be down with him in little better than three hours even then you know the park gates would be locked well i could stable him in the village dowling knows the horse and would treat him properly may i have him sir the cloud cleared off richard's face as he asked at least if he missed his love that night he would be near her breathing the same air marking what star was above her bedchamber hearing the hushed night talk of the trees about her dwelling looking on the distances that were like hope half fulfilled and a bodily presence bright as hesper since he knew her there were two swallows under the eaves shadowing lucy's chamber windows two swallows mates in one nest blissful birds who twittered and cheep cheeped to the sole lying beauty in her bed around these birds the lover's heart revolved he knew not why he associated them with all his close veiled dreams of happiness seldom a morning passed when he did not watch them leave the nest on their breakfast flight busy in the happy stillness of dawn it seemed to him now that if he could be at raynham to see them in to morrow's dawn he would be compensated for his incalculable loss of to night he would forgive and love his father london the life the world just to see those purple backs and white breasts flash out into the quiet morning air he wanted no more the baronet's trifling had placed this enormous boon within the young man's visionary grasp he still went on trying the boy's temper you know there would be nobody ready for you at raynham it is unfair to disturb the maids richard overrode every objection well then my son said the baronet preserving his half jocular air i must tell you that it is my wish to have you in town then you have not been ill at all sir cried richard as in his despair he seized the whole plot i have been as well as you could have desired me to be said his father why did they lie to me the young man wrathfully exclaimed i think richard you can best answer that rejoined sir austin kindly severe dread of being signalized as the foolish young fellow prevented richard from expostulating further sir austin saw him grinding his passion into powder for future explosion and thought it best to leave him for awhile chapter xxii for three weeks richard had to remain in town and endure the teachings of the system in a new atmosphere he had to sit and listen to men of science who came to renew their intimacy with his father and whom of all men his father wished him to respect and study practically scientific men being in the baronet's estimation the only minds thoroughly mated and enviable he had to endure an introduction to the grandisons and meet the eyes of his kind haunted as he was by the foolish young fellow the idea that he might by any chance be identified with him held the poor youth in silent subjection and it was horrible for it was a continued outrage on the fair image he had in his heart the notion of the world laughing at him because he loved sweet lucy stung him to momentary frenzies and developed premature misanthropy in his spirit also the system desired to show him whither young women of the parish lead us and he was dragged about at nighttime to see the sons and daughters of darkness after the fashion prescribed to mr thompson how they danced and ogled down the high road to perdition but from this sight possibly the teacher learnt more than his pupil since we find him seriously asking his meditative hours in the note book wherefore wild oats are only of one gender a question certainly not suggested to him at raynham and again whether men might not be attaching too rigid an importanceto a subject with a dotted tail apparently for he gives it no other in the note book but as i apprehend he had come to plead in behalf of women here and had deduced something from positive observation to richard the scenes he witnessed were strange wild pictures likely if anything to have increased his misanthropy but for his love certain sweet little notes from lucy sustained the lover during the first two weeks of exile they ceased and now richard fell into such despondency that his father in alarm had to take measures to hasten their return to raynham at the close of the third week berry laid a pair of letters bearing the raynham post mark on the breakfast table and after reading one attentively the baronet asked his son if he was inclined to quit the metropolis for raynham air cried richard and relapsed saying as you will aware that he had given a glimpse of the foolish young fellow berry accordingly received orders to make arrangements for their instant return to raynham the letter sir austin lifted his head from to bespeak his son's wishes was a composition of the wise youth adrian's and ran thus benson is doggedly recovering he requires great indemnities happy when a faithful fool is the main sufferer in a household i quite agree with you that our faithful fool is the best servant of great schemes benson is now a piece of history i tell him that this is indemnity enough and that the sweet muse usually insists upon gentlemen being half flayed before she will condescend to notice them but benson i regret to say rejects the comfort so fine a reflection should offer and had rather keep his skin and live opaque heroism seems partly a matter of training faithful folly is benson's nature the rest has been thrust upon the young person has resigned the neighbourhood i had an interview with the fair papist myself and also with the man blaize they were both sensible though one swore and the other sighed she is pretty i hope she does not paint i can affirm that her legs are strong for she walks to bellingham twice a week to take her scarlet bath when having confessed and been made clean by the romish unction she walks back the brisker of which my protestant muscular systems is yet aware it was on the road to bellingham i engaged her she is well in the matter of hair madam godiva might challenge her it would be a fair match has it never struck you that woman is nearer the vegetable than man mr blaize intends her for his son a junction that every lover of fairy mythology must desire to see consummated young tom is heir to all the agremens of the beast the maids of lobourne say i hear that he is a very proculus among them possibly the envious men say it for the maids beauty does not speak bad grammar and altogether she is better out of the way the other letter was from lady blandish a lady's letter and said i have fulfilled your commission to the best of my ability and heartily sad it has made me she is indeed very much above her station pity that it is so she is almost beautiful quite beautiful at times and not in any way what you have been led to fancy the poor child had no story to tell i have again seen her and talked with her for an hour as kindly as i could i could gather nothing more than we know it is just a woman's history as it invariably commences richard is the god of her idolatry she will renounce him and sacrifice herself for his sake are we so bad she asked me what she was to do she would do whatever was imposed upon her all but pretend to love another and that she never would and i believe never will you know i am sentimental and i confess we dropped a few tears together her uncle has sent her for the winter to the institution where it appears she was educated and where they are very fond of her and want to keep her which it would be a good thing if they were to do the man is a good sort of man she was entrusted to him by her father and he never interferes with her religion and is very scrupulous about all that pertains to it though as he says he is a christian himself in the spring but the poor child does not know this she is to come back and be married to his lout of a son i am determined to prevent that may i not reckon on your promise to aid me when you see her i am sure you will it would be sacrilege to look on and permit such a thing you know they are cousins she asked me where in the world there was one like richard what could i answer they were your own words and spoken with a depth of conviction i hope he is really calm i shudder to think of him when he comes and discovers what i have been doing i hope i have been really doing right a good deed you say never dies but we cannot always know i must rely on you yes it is i should think easy to suffer martyrdom when one is sure of one's cause but then one must be sure of it i have done nothing lately but to repeat to myself that saying of yours no c ps and it has consoled me i cannot say why except that all wisdom consoles whether it applies directly or not 'for this reason so many fall from god who have attained to him that they cling to him with their weakness not with their strength' i like to know of what you are thinking when you composed this or that saying what suggested it may not one be admitted to inspect the machinery of wisdom i feel curious to know how thoughts real thoughts are born not that i hope to win the secret here is the beginning of one but we poor women can never put together even two of the three ideas which you say go to form a thought 'when a wise man makes a false step will he not go farther than a fool' it has just flitted through me i cannot get on with gibbon so wait your return to recommence the readings i dislike the sneering essence of his writings i keep referring to his face until the dislike seems to become personal how different is it with wordsworth and yet i cannot escape from the thought that he is always solemnly thinking of himself but i do reverence him but this is curious byron was a greater egoist and yet i do not feel the same with him he reminds me of a beast of the desert savage and beautiful and the former is what one would imagine a superior donkey reclaimed from the heathen to be a very superior donkey i mean with great power of speech and great natural complacency and whose stubbornness you must admire as part of his mission the worst is that no one will imagine anything sublime in a superior donkey so my simile is unfair and false is it not strange i love wordsworth best and yet byron has the greater power over me how is that because sir austin wrote beside the query in pencil women are cowards and succumb to irony and passion rather than yield their hearts to excellence and nature's inspiration the letter pursued i have finished boiardo and have taken up berni the latter offends me i suppose we women do not really care for humour you are right in saying we have none ourselves and 'cackle' instead of laugh it is true of me at least that 'falstaff is only to us an incorrigible fat man' i want to know what he illustrates and don quixote what end can be served in making a noble mind ridiculous i hear you say practical so it is we are very narrow i know but we like wit practical again or in your words when i really think they generally come to my aid perhaps it is that it is often all your thought we 'prefer the rapier thrust to the broad embrace of intelligence' he trifled with the letter for some time re reading chosen passages as he walked about the room and considering he scarce knew what there are ideas language is too gross for and shape too arbitrary which come to us and have a definite influence upon us and yet we cannot fasten on the filmy things and make them visible and distinct to ourselves much less to others why did he twice throw a look into the glass in the act of passing it he stood for a moment with head erect facing it his eyes for the nonce seemed little to peruse his outer features the grey gathered brows and the wrinkles much action of them had traced over the circles half up his high straight forehead the iron grey hair that rose over his forehead and fell away in the fashion of richard's plume his general appearance showed the tints of years but none of their weight and nothing of the dignity of his youth was gone it was so far satisfactory but his eyes were wide as one who looks at his essential self through the mask we wear perhaps he was speculating as he looked on the sort of aspect he presented to the lady's discriminative regard of her feelings he had not a suspicion but he knew with what extraordinary lucidity women can when it pleases them and when their feelings are not quite boiling under the noonday sun seize all the sides of a character and put their fingers on its weak point he was cognizant of the total absence of the humorous in himself the want that most shut him out from his fellows and perhaps the clear thoughted intensely self examining gentleman filmily conceived me also in common with the poet she gazes on as one of the superior grey beasts he may have so conceived the case he was capable of that great mindedness and could snatch at times very luminous glances at the broad reflector which the world of fact lying outside our narrow compass holds up for us to see ourselves in when we will unhappily the faculty of laughter which is due to this gift was denied him and having seen he like the companion of friend balsam could go no farther for a good wind of laughter had relieved him of much of the blight of self deception and oddness and extravagance had given a healthier view of our atmosphere of life but he had it not journeying back to bellingham in the train with the heated brain and brilliant eye of his son beside him sir austin tried hard to feel infallible as a man with a system should feel and because he could not do so after much mental conflict he descended to entertain a personal antagonism to the young woman who had stepped in between his experiment and success he did not think kindly of her lady blandish's encomiums of her behaviour and her beauty annoyed him forgetful that he had in a measure forfeited his rights to it he took the common ground of fathers and demanded why he was not justified in doing all that lay in his power to prevent his son from casting himself away upon the first creature with a pretty face he encountered deliberating thus he lost the tenderness he should have had for his experiment the living burning youth at his elbow and his excessive love for him took a rigorous tone it appeared to him politic reasonable and just that the uncle of this young woman who had so long nursed the prudent scheme of marrying her to his son should not only not be thwarted in his object but encouraged and even assisted at least not thwarted sir austin had no glass before him while these ideas hardened in his mind and he had rather forgotten the letter of lady blandish father and son were alone in the railway carriage both were too preoccupied to speak as they neared bellingham the dark was filling the hollows of the country over the pine hills beyond the station a last rosy streak lingered across a green sky richard eyed it while they flew along it caught him forward it seemed full of the spirit of his love and brought tears of mournful longing to his eyelids the sad beauty of that one spot in the heavens seemed to call out to his soul to swear to his lucy's truth to him was like the sorrowful visage of his fleur de luce as he called her appealing to him for faith that tremulous tender way she had of half closing and catching light on the nether lids when sometimes she looked up in her lover's face as look so mystic sweet that it had grown to be the fountain of his dreams he saw it yonder and his blood thrilled know you those wand like touches of i know not what before which our grosser being melts and we much as we hope to be in the awaking stand etherealized trembling with new joy they come but rarely rarely even in love when we fondly think them revelations mere sensations they are doubtless and we rank for them no higher in the spiritual scale than so many translucent glorious polypi that quiver on the shores the hues of heaven running through them yet in the harvest of our days it is something for the animal to have had such mere fleshly polypian experiences to look back upon and they give him an horizon pale seas of luring splendour one who has had them when they do not bound him may find the isles of bliss sooner than another sensual faith in the upper glories is something let us remember says the pilgrim's scrip that nature though heathenish reaches at her best to the footstool of the highest she is not all dust but a living portion of the spheres in aspiration it is our error to despise her forgetting that through nature only can we ascend cherished trained and purified she is then partly worthy the divine mate who is to make her wholly so st simeon saw the hog in nature and took nature for the hog it was one of these strange bodily exaltations which thrilled the young man he knew not how it was for sadness and his forebodings vanished the soft wand touched him at that moment had sir austin spoken openly richard might have fallen upon his heart he could not he chose to feel injured on the common ground of fathers and to pursue his system by plotting lady blandish had revived his jealousy of the creature who menaced it and jealousy of a system is unreflecting and vindictive as jealousy of woman heath roots and pines breathed sharp in the cool autumn evening about the bellingham station richard stood a moment as he stepped from the train and drew the country air into his lungs with large heaves of the chest leaving his father to the felicitations of the station master he went into the lobourne road to look for his faithful tom who had received private orders through berry to be in attendance with his young master's mare cassandra and was lurking in a plantation of firs unenclosed on the borders of the road where richard knowing his retainer's zest for conspiracy too well to seek him anywhere but in the part most favoured with shelter and concealment found him furtively whiffing tobacco what news tom is there an illness tom sent his undress cap on one side to scratch at dilemma an old agricultural habit to which he was still a slave in moments of abstract thought or sudden difficulty no i don't want the rake mr richard he whinnied with a false grin as he beheld his master's eye vacantly following the action speak out he was commanded i haven't had a letter for a week richard learnt the news he took it with surprising outward calm only getting a little closer to cassandra's neck and looking very hard at tom without seeing a speck of him which had the effect on tom of making him sincerely wish his master would punch his head at once rather than fix him in that owl like way go on said richard huskily yes she's gone well tom was brought to understand he must make the most of trifles and recited how he had heard from a female domestic at belthorpe of the name of davenport formerly known to him that the young lady never slept a wink from the hour she knew she was going but sat up in her bed till morning crying most pitifully though she never complained hereat the tears unconsciously streamed down richard's cheeks tom said he had tried to see her but mr adrian kept him at work ciphering at a terrible sum that and nothing else all day saying it was to please his young master on his return likewise something in lat'n added tom nom'tive mouser 'nough to make ye mad sir he exclaimed with pathos the wretch had been put to acquire a latin declension tom saw her on the morning she went away he said she was very sorrowful looking and nodded kindly to him as she passed in the fly along with young tom blaize she have got uncommon kind eyes sir said tom and cryin' don't spoil them for which his hand was wrenched tom had no more to tell save that in rounding the road the young lady had hung out her hand and seemed to move it forward and back as much as to sap good bye tom and though she couldn't see me said tom i took off my hat i did take it so kind of her to think of a chap like me he was at high pressure sentiment what with his education for a hero and his master's love stricken state you saw no more of her tom no sir that was the last that was the last you saw of her tom well sir i saw nothin' more and so she went out of sight clean gone that she were sir why did they take her away what have they done with her where have they taken her to these red hot questionings were addressed to the universal heaven rather than to tom why didn't she write they were resumed why did she leave she's mine she belongs to me who dared take her away why did she leave without writing tom yes sir said the well drilled recruit dressing himself up to the word of command he expected a variation of the theme from the change of tone with which his name had been pronounced but it was again where have they taken her to and this was even more perplexing to tom than his hard sum in arithmetic had been he could only draw down the corners of his mouth hard and glance up queerly she had been crying you saw that tom no mistake about that mr richard cryin' all night and all day i sh'd say and she was crying when you saw her she look'd as if she'd just done for a moment sir but her face was white white as a sheet richard paused to discover whether his instinct had caught a new view from these facts he was in a cage always knocking against the same bars fly as he might her tears were the stars in his black night he clung to them as golden orbs inexplicable as they were they were at least pledges of love the hues of sunset had left the west no light was there but the steadfast pale eye of twilight thither he was drawn he mounted cassandra saying tell them something tom i shan't be home to dinner and rode off toward the forsaken home of light over belthorpe whereat he saw the wan hand of his lucy waving farewell receding as he advanced his jewel was stolen he must gaze upon the empty box chapter xxiii night had come on as richard entered the old elm shaded grass bordered lane leading down from raynham to belthorpe the pale eye of twilight was shut the wind had tossed up the bank of western cloud which was now flying broad and unlighted across the sky broad and balmy the charioted south west at full charge behind his panting coursers as he neared the farm his heart fluttered and leapt up he was sure she must be there she must have returned why should she have left for good without writing he caught suspicion by the throat making it voiceless if it lived he silenced reason her not writing was now a proof that she had returned he listened to nothing but his imperious passion and murmured sweet words for her as if she were by tender cherishing epithet's of love in the nest she was there she moved somewhere about like a silver flame in the dear old house doing her sweet household duties his blood began to sing o happy those within to see her and be about her by some extraordinary process he contrived to cast a sort of glory round the burly person of farmer blaize himself and oh to have companionship with a seraph one must know a seraph's bliss and was not young tom to be envied the smell of late clematis brought on the wind enwrapped him and went to his brain and threw a light over the old red brick house for he remembered where it grew and the winter rose tree and the jessamine and the passion flower the garden in front with the standard roses tended by her hands the long wall to the left striped by the branches of the cherry the peep of a further garden through the wall and then the orchard and the fields beyond the happy circle of her dwelling it flashed before his eyes while he looked on the darkness and yet it was the reverse of hope which kindled this light and inspired the momentary calm he experienced it was despair exaggerating delusion wilfully building up on a groundless basis for the tenacity of true passion is terrible says the pilgrim's scrip it will stand against the hosts of heaven god's great array of facts rather than surrender its aim and must be crushed before it will succumb sent to the lowest pit he knew she was not there she was gone but the power of a will strained to madness fought at it kept it down conjured forth her ghost and would have it as he dictated poor youth the great array of facts was in due order of march he had breathed her name many times and once over loud almost a cry for her escaped him he had not noticed the opening of a door and the noise of a foot along the gravel walk he was leaning over cassandra's uneasy neck watching the one window intently when a voice addressed him out of the darkness be that you young gentleman mr fev'rel richard's trance was broken mr blaize he said recognizing the farmer's voice good even'n t' you sir returned the farmer i knew the mare though i didn't know you rather bluff to night it be will ye step in mr fev'rel it's beginning' to spit going to be a wildish night i reckon richard dismounted the farmer called one of his men to hold the mare and ushered the young man in once there richard's conjurations ceased there was a deadness about the rooms and passages that told of her absence the walls he touched these were the vacant shells of her he had never been in the house since he knew her and now what strange sweetness and what pangs young tom blaize was in the parlour squared over the table in open mouthed examination of an ancient book of the fashions for a summer month which had elapsed during his mother's minority young tom was respectfully studying the aspects of the radiant beauties of the polite work he also was a thrall of woman newly enrolled and full of wonder what tom the farmer sang out as soon as he had opened the door there ye be at yer folly agin are ye what good'll them fashens do to you i'd like t'know come shut up and go and see to mr fev'rel's mare he's al'ays at that ther' folly now i say there never were a better name for a book than that ther' folly talk about attitudes the farmer laughed his fat sides into a chair and motioned his visitor to do likewise it's a comfort they're most on 'em females he pursued sounding a thwack on his knee as he settled himself agreeably in his seat it don't matter much what they does except pinchin' in waspin' it at the waist give me nature i say woman as she's made eh young gentleman you seem very lonely here said richard glancing round and at the ceiling lonely quoth the farmer well for the matter o' that we be jest now so't happens i've got my pipe and tom've got his folly he's on one side the table and i'm on t'other he gapes and i gazes we are a bit lonesome but there it's for the best richard resumed i hardly expected to see you to night mr blaize y'acted like a man in coming young gentleman and i does ye honour for it said farmer blaize with sudden energy and directness the thing implied by the farmer's words caused richard to take a quick breath they looked at each other and looked away the farmer thrumming on the arm of his chair above the mantel piece surrounded by tarnished indifferent miniatures of high collared well to do yeomen of the anterior generation trying their best not to grin and high waisted old ladies smiling an encouraging smile through plentiful cap puckers there hung a passably executed half figure of a naval officer in uniform grasping a telescope under his left arm who stood forth clearly as not of their kith and kin his eyes were blue his hair light his bearing that of a man who knows how to carry his head and shoulders the artist while giving him an epaulette to indicate his rank had also recorded the juvenility which a lieutenant in the naval service can retain after arriving at that position by painting him with smooth cheeks and fresh ruddy lips to this portrait richard's eyes were directed farmer blaize observed it and said her father sir richard moderated his voice to praise the likeness yes said the farmer pretty well next best to havin' her though it's a long way off that an old family mr blaize is it not richard asked in as careless a tone as he could assume gentlefolks what's left of 'em replied the farmer with an equally affected indifference and that's her father said richard growing bolder to speak of her that's her father young gentleman mr blaize richard turned to face him and burst out where is she gone sir packed off can't have her here now the farmer thrummed a step brisker and eyed the young man's wild face resolutely mr blaize richard leaned forward to get closer to him he was stunned and hardly aware of what he was saying or doing where has she gone why did she leave you needn't to ask sir ye know said the farmer with a side shot of his head but she did not it was not her wish to go no i think she likes the place mayhap she likes't too well why did you send her away to make her unhappy mr blaize the farmer bluntly denied it was he was the party who made her unhappy nobody can't accuse me tell ye what sir i wunt have the busybodies set to work about her and there's all the matter so let you and i come to an understandin' a blind inclination to take offence made richard sit upright he forgot it the next minute and said humbly am i the cause of her going well returned the farmer to speak straight ye be what can i do mr blaize that she may come back again the young hypocrite asked now said the farmer you're coming to business glad to hear ye talk in that sensible way mr feverel you may guess i wants her bad enough the house ain't itself now she's away and i ain't myself well sir this ye can do if you gives me your promise not to meddle with her at all i can't mak' out how you come to be acquainted not to try to get her to be meetin' you and if you'd 'a seen her when she left you would when did ye meet last grass wasn't it your word as a gentleman not to be writing letters and spyin' after her i'll have her back at once back she shall come give her up cried richard ay that's it said the farmer give her up the young man checked the annihilation of time that was on his mouth you sent her away to protect her from me then he said savagely that's not quite it but that'll do rejoined the farmer do you think i shall harm her sir people seem to think she'll harm you young gentleman the farmer said with some irony harm me she what people people pretty intimate with you sir what people who spoke of us richard began to scent a plot and would not be balked well sir look here said the farmer it ain't no secret and if it be i don't see why i'm to keep it it appears your education's peculiar the farmer drawled out the word as if he were describing the figure of a snake you ain't to be as other young gentlemen all the better you're a fine bold young gentleman and your father's a right to be proud of ye well sir i'm sure i thank him for't he comes to hear of you and luce and of course he don't want nothin' o' that more do i i meets him there what's more i won't have nothin' of it she be my gal she were left to my protection and she's a lady sir let me tell ye ye won't find many on 'em so well looked to as she be my luce well mr fev'rel it's you or it's her one of ye must be out o' the way so we're told and luce i do believe she's just as anxious about yer education as yer father she says she'll go and wouldn't write and'd break it off for the sake o' your education and she've kep' her word haven't she she's a true'n what she says she'll do true blue she be my luce so now sir you do the same and i'll thank ye any one who has tossed a sheet of paper into the fire and seen it gradually brown with heat and strike to flame may conceive the mind of the lover as he listened to this speech his anger did not evaporate in words but condensed and sank deep mr blaize he said this is very kind of the people you allude to but i am of an age now to think and act for myself i love her sir his whole countenance changed and the muscles of his face quivered well said the farmer appeasingly we all do at your age somebody or other it's natural i love her the young man thundered afresh too much possessed by his passion to have a sense of shame in the confession farmer his voice fell to supplication will you bring her back farmer blaize made a queer face he asked what for and where was the promise required but was not the lover's argument conclusive he said he loved her and he could not see why her uncle should not in consequence immediately send for her that they might be together all very well quoth the farmer but what's to come of it what was to come of it why love and more love and a bit too much the farmer added grimly then you refuse me farmer said richard i must look to you for keeping her away from me not to to these people you will not have her back though i tell you i love her better than my life farmer blaize now had to answer him plainly he had a reason and an objection of his own and it was that her character was at stake and god knew whether she herself might not be in danger he spoke with a kindly candour not without dignity he complimented richard personally but young people were young people baronets' sons were not in the habit of marrying farmers' nieces at first the son of a system did not comprehend him when he did he said farmer if i give you my word of honour as i hope for heaven to marry her when i am of age will you have her back he was so fervid that to quiet him the farmer only shook his head doubtfully at the bars of the grate and let his chest fall slowly richard caught what seemed to him a glimpse of encouragement in these signs and observed it's not because you object to me mr blaize the farmer signified it was not that it's because my father is against me richard went on and undertook to show that love was so sacred a matter that no father could entirely and for ever resist his son's inclinations argument being a cool field where the farmer could meet and match him the young man got on the tramroad of his passion and went ahead he drew pictures of lucy of her truth and his own he took leaps from life to death from death to life mixing imprecations and prayers in a torrent perhaps he did move the stolid old englishman a little he was so vehement and made so visible a sacrifice of his pride farmer blaize tried to pacify him but it was useless his jewel he must have the farmer stretched out his hand for the pipe that allayeth botheration may smoke heer now he said not when somebody's present smoke in the kitchen then don't mind smell richard nodded and watched the operations while the farmer filled and lighted and began to puff as if his fate hung on them who'd a' thought when you sat over there once of its comin' to this ejaculated the farmer drawing ease and reflection from tobacco you didn't think much of her that day young gentleman i introduced ye well things comes about can't you wait till she returns in due course now this suggestion the work of the pipe did but bring on him another torrent it's queer said the farmer putting the mouth of the pipe to his wrinkled up temples richard waited for him and then he laid down the pipe altogether as no aid in perplexity and said after leaning his arm on the table and staring at richard an instant look young gentleman my word's gone i've spoke it i've given 'em the 'surance she shan't be back till the spring and then i'll have her and then well i do hope for more reasons than one ye'll both be wiser i've got my own notions about her but i an't the man to force a gal to marry 'gainst her inclines depend upon it i'm not your enemy mr fev'rel you're jest the one to mak' a young gal proud so wait and see that's my 'dvice jest tak' and wait i've no more to say richard's impetuosity had made him really afraid of speaking his notions concerning the projected felicity of young tom if indeed they were serious the farmer repeated that he had no more to say and richard with wait till the spring wait till the spring dinning despair in his ears stood up to depart farmer blaize shook his slack hand in a friendly way and called out at the door for young tom who dreading allusions to his folly did not appear a maid rushed by richard in the passage and slipped something into his grasp which fixed on it without further consciousness than that of touch the mare was led forth by the bantam a light rain was falling down strong warm gusts and the trees were noisy in the night farmer blaize requested richard at the gate to give him his hand and say all was well he liked the young man for his earnestness and honest outspeaking richard could not say all was well but he gave his hand and knitted it to the farmer's in a sharp squeeze when he got upon cassandra and rode into the tumult a calm clear dawn succeeded the roaring west and threw its glowing grey image on the waters of the abbey lake before sunrise tom bakewell was abroad and met the missing youth his master jogging cassandra leisurely along the lobourne park road a sorry couple to look at cassandra's flanks were caked with mud her head drooped all that was in her had been taken out by that wild night on what heaths and heavy fallows had she not spent her noble strength recklessly fretting through the darkness take the mare said richard dismounting and patting her between the eyes she's done up poor old gal look to her tom and then come to me in my room tom asked no questions three days would bring the anniversary of richard's birth and though tom was close the condition of the mare and the young gentleman's strange freak in riding her out all night becoming known prepared everybody at raynham for the usual bad luck birthday the prophets of which were full of sad gratification sir austin had an unpleasant office to require of his son no other than that of humbly begging benson's pardon and washing out the undue blood he had spilt in taking his pound of flesh heavy benson was told to anticipate the demand for pardon and practised in his mind the most melancholy christian deportment he could assume on the occasion but while his son was in this state sir austin considered that he would hardly be brought to see the virtues of the act and did not make the requisition of him and heavy benson remained drawn up solemnly expectant at doorways and at the foot of the staircase a saurian caryatid wherever he could get a step in advance of the young man while richard heedlessly passed him as he passed everybody else his head bent to the ground and his legs bearing him like random instruments of whose service he was unconscious it was a shock to benson's implicit belief in his patron and he was not consoled by the philosophic explanation that good in a strong many compounded nature is of slower growth than any other mortal thing and must not be forced damnatory doctrines best pleased benson he was ready to pardon as a christian should but he did want his enemy before him on his knees and now though the saurian eye saw more than all the other eyes in the house and saw that there was matter in hand between tom and his master to breed exceeding discomposure to the system benson as he had not received his indemnity and did not wish to encounter fresh perils for nothing held his peace sir austin partly divined what was going on in the breast of his son without conceiving the depths of distrust his son cherished or quite measuring the intensity of the passion that consumed him he was very kind and tender with him like a cunning physician who has nevertheless overlooked the change in the disease superinduced by one false dose he meditated his prescriptions carefully and confidently sure that he knew the case and was a match for it he decreed that richard's erratic behaviour should pass unnoticed two days before the birthday he asked him whether he would object to having company to which richard said have whom you will sir the preparation for festivity commenced accordingly on the birthday eve he dined with the rest lady blandish was there and sat penitently at his right hippias prognosticated certain indigestion for himself on the morrow the eighteenth century wondered whether she should live to see another birthday adrian drank the two years' distant term of his tutorship and algernon went over the list of the lobourne men who would cope with bursley on the morrow sir austin gave ear and a word to all keeping his mental eye for his son to please lady blandish also adrian ventured to make trifling jokes about london's mrs grandison jokes delicately not decent but so delicately so that it was not decent to perceive it after dinner richard left them nothing more than commonly peculiar was observed about him beyond the excessive glitter of his eyes but the baronet said yes yes that will pass he and adrian and lady blandish took tea in the library and sat till a late hour discussing casuistries relating mostly to the apple disease converse very amusing to the wise youth who could suggest to the two chaste minds situations of the shadiest character with the air of a seeker after truth and lead them unsuspecting where they dared not look about them the aphorist had elated the heart of his constant fair worshipper with a newly rounded if not newly conceived sentence when they became aware that they were four heavy benson stood among them he said he had knocked but received no answer there was however a vestige of surprise and dissatisfaction on his face beholding adrian of the company which had not quite worn away and gave place when it did vanish to an aspect of flabby severity well benson well said the baronet the unmoving man replied if you please sir austin mr richard well he's out well with bakewell well and a carpet bag the carpet bag might be supposed to contain that funny thing called a young hero's romance in the making out richard was and with a carpet bag which tom bakewell carried he was on the road to bellingham under heavy rain hasting like an escaped captive wild with joy while tom shook his skin and grunted at his discomforts the mail train was to be caught at bellingham he knew where to find her now through the intervention of miss davenport and thither he was flying an arrow loosed from the bow thither in spite of fathers and friends and plotters to claim her and take her and stand with her against the world they were both thoroughly wet when they entered bellingham and tom's visions were of hot drinks he hinted the necessity for inward consolation to his master who could answer nothing but tom tom i shall see her tomorrow it was bad travelling in the wet tom hinted again to provoke the same insane outcry and have his arm seized and furiously shaken into the bargain passing the principal inn of the place tom spoke plainly for brandy no cried richard there's not a moment to be lost and as he said it he reeled and fell against tom muttering indistinctly of faintness and that there was no time to lose tom lifted him in his arms and got admission to the inn brandy the country's specific was advised by host and hostess and forced into his mouth reviving him sufficiently to cry out tom the bell's ringing we shall be late after which he fell back insensible on the sofa where they had stretched him excitement of blood and brain had done its work upon him the youth suffered them to undress him and put him to bed and there he lay forgetful even of love a drowned weed borne onward by the tide of the hours there his father found him was the scientific humanist remorseful he had looked forward to such a crisis as that point in the disease his son was the victim of when the body would fail and give the spirit calm to conquer the malady knowing very well that the seeds of the evil were not of the spirit moreover to see him and have him was a repose after the alarm benson had sounded mark he said to lady blandish when he recovers he will not care for her the lady had accompanied him to the bellingham inn on first hearing of richard's seizure what an iron man you can be she exclaimed smothering her intuitions she was for giving the boy his bauble promising it him at least if he would only get well and be the bright flower of promise he once was can you look on him she pleaded can you look on him and persevere it was a hard sight for this man who loved his son so deeply the youth lay in his strange bed straight and motionless with fever on his cheeks and altered eyes old dr clifford of lobourne was the medical attendant who with head shaking and gathering of lips and reminiscences of ancient arguments guaranteed to do all that leech could do in the matter the old doctor did admit that richard's constitution was admirable and answered to his prescriptions like a piano to the musician but he said at a family consultation for sir austin had told him how it stood with the young man drugs are not much in cases of this sort change that's what's wanted and as soon as may be distraction he ought to see the world and know what he is made of it's no use my talking i know added the doctor on the contrary said sir austin i am quite of your persuasion and the world he shall see now we have dipped him in styx you know doctor adrian remarked but doctor said lady blandish have you known a case of this sort before never my lady said the doctor they're not common in these parts country people are tolerably healthy minded but people and country people have died for love doctor the doctor had not met any of them men or women inquired the baronet lady blandish believed mostly women ask the doctor whether they were healthy minded women said the baronet no you are both looking at the wrong end between a highly cultured being and an emotionless animal there is all the difference in the world but of the two the doctor is nearer the truth the healthy nature is pretty safe if he allowed for organization he would be right altogether to feel but not to feel to excess that is the problem if i can't have the one i chose to some fresh maid i will propose adrian hummed a country ballad chapter xxiv when the young experiment again knew the hours that rolled him onward he was in his own room at raynham nothing had changed only a strong fist had knocked him down and stunned him and he opened his eyes to a grey world he had forgotten what he lived for he was weak and thin and with a pale memory of things his functions were the same everything surrounding him was the same he looked upon the old blue hills the far lying fallows the river and the woods he knew them they seemed to have lost recollection of him nor could he find in familiar human faces the secret of intimacy of heretofore they were the same faces they nodded and smiled to him what was lost he could not tell something had been knocked out of him he was sensible of his father's sweetness of manner and he was grieved that he could not reply to it for every sense of shame and reproach had strangely gone he felt very useless in place of the fiery love for one he now bore about a cold charity to all thus in the heart of the young man died the spring primrose and while it died another heart was pushing forth the primrose of autumn the wonderful change in richard and the wisdom of her admirer now positively proved were exciting matters to lady blandish she was rebuked for certain little rebellious fancies concerning him that had come across her enslaved mind from time to time for was he not almost a prophet it distressed the sentimental lady that a love like richard's could pass off in mere smoke and words such as she had heard him speak in abbey wood resolve to emptiness nay it humiliated her personally and the baronet's shrewd prognostication humiliated her for how should he know and dare to say that love was a thing of the dust that could be trodden out under the heel of science but he had said so and he had proved himself right she heard with wonderment that richard of his own accord had spoken to his father of the folly he had been guilty of and had begged his pardon the baronet told her this adding that the youth had done it in a cold unwavering way without a movement of his features had evidently done it to throw off the burden of the duty he had conceived he had thought himself bound to acknowledge that he had been the foolish young fellow wishing possibly to abjure the fact by an set of penance he had also given satisfaction to benson and was become a renovated peaceful spirit whose main object appeared to be to get up his physical strength by exercise and no expenditure of speech in her company he was composed and courteous even when they were alone together he did not exhibit a trace of melancholy sober he seemed as one who has recovered from a drunkenness and has determined to drink no more the idea struck her that he might be playing a part but tom bakewell in a private conversation they had informed her that he had received an order from his young master one day while boxing with him not to mention the young lady's name to him as long as he lived and tom could only suppose that she had offended him theoretically wise lady blandish had always thought the baronet she was unprepared to find him thus practically sagacious she fell many degrees she wanted something to cling to so she clung to the man who struck her low love then was earthly its depth could be probed by science a man lived who could measure it from end to end foretell its term handle the young cherub as were he a shot owl we who have flown into cousinship with the empyrean and disported among immortal hosts our base birth as a child of time is made bare to us our wings are cut oh then if science is this victorious enemy of love let us love science was the logic of the lady's heart and secretly cherishing the assurance that she should confute him yet and prove him utterly wrong she gave him the fruits of present success as it is a habit of women to do involuntarily partly the fires took hold of her she felt soft emotions such as a girl feels and they flattered her it was like youth coming back pure women have a second youth the autumn primrose flourished we are advised by the pilgrim's scrip that the ways of women which are involution and their practices which are opposition are generally best hit upon by guess work and a bold word it being impossible to track them and hunt them down in the ordinary style so that we may not ourselves become involved and opposed let us each of us venture a guess and say a bold word as to how it came that the lady who trusted love to be eternal grovelled to him that shattered her tender faith and loved him hitherto it had been simply a sentimental dalliance and gossips had maligned the lady just when the gossips grew tired of their slander and inclined to look upon her charitably she set about to deserve every word they had said of her which may instruct us if you please that gossips have only to persist in lying to be crowned with verity or that one has only to endure evil mouths for a period to gain impunity she was always at the abbey now she was much closeted with the baronet it seemed to be understood that she had taken mrs doria's place benson in his misogynic soul perceived that she was taking lady feverel's but any report circulated by benson was sure to meet discredit and drew the gossips upon himself which made his meditations tragic no sooner was one woman defeated than another took the field the object of the system was no sooner safe than its great author was in danger i can't think what has come to benson he said to adrian he seems to have received a fresh legacy of several pounds of lead returned the wise youth and imitating dr clifford's manner change is what he wants distraction send him to wales for a month sir and let richard go with him the two victims of woman may do each other good unfortunately i can't do without him said the baronet then we must continue to have him on our shoulders all day and on our chests all night adrian ejaculated i think while he preserves this aspect we won't have him at the dinner table said the baronet adrian thought that would be a relief to their digestions and added you know sir what he says receiving a negative adrian delicately explained to him that benson's excessive ponderosity of demeanour was caused by anxiety for the safety of his master you must pardon a faithful fool sir he continued for the baronet became red and exclaimed his stupidity is past belief i have absolutely to bolt my study door against him adrian at once beheld a charming scene in the interior of the study not unlike one that benson had visually witnessed for like a wary prophet benson that he might have warrant for what he foretold of the future had a care to spy upon the present warned haply by the pilgrim's scrip of which he was a diligent reader and which says rather emphatically could we see time's full face we were wise of him now to see time's full face it is sometimes necessary to look through keyholes the veteran having a trick of smiling peace to you on one cheek and grimacing confusion on the other behind the curtain decency and a sense of honour restrain most of us from being thus wise and miserable for ever benson's excuse was that he believed in his master who was menaced and moreover notwithstanding his previous tribulation to spy upon cupid was sweet to him so he peeped and he saw a sight he saw time's full face or in other words he saw the wiles of woman and the weakness of man which is our history as benson would have written it and a great many poets and philosophers have written it yet it was but the plucking of the autumn primrose that benson had seen a somewhat different operation from the plucking of the spring one very innocent our staid elderly sister has paler blood and has or thinks she has a reason or two about the roots she is not all instinct for this high cause and for that i know men and know him to be the flower of men i give myself to him she makes that lofty inward exclamation while the hand is detaching her from the roots even so strong a self justification she requires she has not that blind glory in excess which her younger sister can gild the longest leap with and if moth like she desires the star she is nervously cautious of candles hence her circles about the dangerous human flame are wide and shy she must be drawn nearer and nearer by a fresh reason she loves to sentimentalize lady blandish had been sentimentalizing for ten years she would have preferred to pursue the game the dark eyed dame was pleased with her smooth life and the soft excitement that did not ruffle it not willingly did she let herself be won sentimentalists says the pilgrim's scrip are they who seek to enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done it is the writer says of sentimentalism elsewhere a happy pastime and an important science to the timid the idle and the heartless but a damning one to them who have anything to forfeit however one who could set down the dying for love as a sentimentalism can hardly be accepted as a clear authority assuredly he was not one to avoid the incurring of the immense debtorship in any way but he was a bondsman still to the woman who had forsaken him and a spoken word would have made it seem his duty to face that public scandal which was the last evil to him what had so horrified the virtuous benson richard had already beheld in daphne's bower a simple kissing of the fair white hand doubtless the keyhole somehow added to benson's horror the two similar performances so very innocent had wondrous opposite consequences the first kindled richard to adore woman the second destroyed benson's faith in man but lady blandish knew the difference between the two she understood why the baronet did not speak excused and respected him for it she was content since she must love to love humbly and she had besides her pity for his sorrows to comfort her a hundred fresh reasons for loving him arose and multiplied every day he read to her the secret book in his own handwriting composed for richard's marriage guide containing advice and directions to a young husband full of the most tender wisdom and delicacy so she thought nay not wanting in poetry though neither rhymed nor measured he expounded to her the distinctive character of the divers ages of love giving the palm to the flower she put forth over that of spring or the summer rose and while they sat and talked my wound has healed he said how she asked at the fountain of your eyes he replied and drew the joy of new life from her blushes without incurring further debtor ship for a thing done chapter xxv let it be some apology for the damage caused by the careering hero and a consolation to the quiet wretches dragged along with him at his chariot wheels that he is generally the last to know when he has made an actual start such a mere creature is he like the rest of us albeit the head of our fates by this you perceive the true hero whether he be a prince or a pot boy that he does not plot fortune does all for him he may be compared to one to whom in an electric circle it is given to carry the battery we caper and grimace at his will yet not his the will not his the power 'tis all fortune's whose puppet he is she deals her dispensations through him yea though our capers be never so comical he laughs not intent upon his own business the true hero asks little services of us here and there thinks it quite natural that they should be acceded to and sees nothing ridiculous in the lamentable contortions we must go through to fulfil them probably he is the elect of fortune because of that notable faculty of being intent upon his own business which is says the pilgrim's scrip with men to be valued equal to that force which in water makes a stream this prelude was necessary to the present chapter of richard's history it happened that in the turn of the year and while old earth was busy with her flowers the fresh wind blew the little bird sang and hippias feverel the dyspepsy amazed felt the spring move within him he communicated his delightful new sensations to the baronet his brother whose constant exclamation with regard to him was poor hippias all his machinery is bare and had no hope that he would ever be in a condition to defend it from view nevertheless hippias had that hope and so he told his brother making great exposure of his machinery to effect the explanation he spoke of all his physical experiences exultingly and with wonder the achievement of common efforts not usually blazoned he celebrated as triumphs and of course had adrian on his back very quickly but he could bear him or anything now it was such ineffable relief to find himself looking out upon the world of mortals instead of into the black phantasmal abysses of his own complicated frightful structure my mind doesn't so much seem to haunt itself now said hippias nodding shortly and peering out of intense puckers to convey a glimpse of what hellish sufferings his had been i feel as if i had come aboveground a poor dyspepsy may talk as he will but he is the one who never gets sympathy or experiences compassion and it is he whose groaning petitions for charity do at last rout that christian virtue lady blandish a charitable soul could not listen to hippias though she had a heart for little mice and flies and sir austin had also small patience with his brother's gleam of health which was just enough to make his disease visible he remembered his early follies and excesses and bent his ear to him as one man does to another who complains of having to pay a debt legally incurred i think said adrian seeing how the communications of hippias were received that when our nemesis takes lodgings in the stomach it's best to act the spartan smile hard and be silent richard alone was decently kind to hippias whether from opposition or real affection could not be said as the young man was mysterious he advised his uncle to take exercise walked with him cultivated cheerful impressions in him and pointed out innocent pursuits he made hippias visit with him some of the poor old folk of the village who bewailed the loss of his cousin austin wentworth and did his best to waken him up and give the outer world a stronger hold on him he succeeded in nothing but in winning his uncle's gratitude the season bloomed scarce longer than a week for hippias and then began to languish the poor dyspepsy's eager grasp at beatification relaxed he went underground again he announced that he felt spongy things one of the more constant throes of his malady his bitter face recurred he chewed the cud of horrid hallucinations he told richard he must give up going about with him people telling of their ailments made him so uncomfortable the birds were so noisy pairing the rude bare soil sickened him richard treated him with a gravity equal to his father's he asked what the doctors said oh the doctors cried hippias with vehement scepticism no man of sense believes in medicine for chronic disorder do you happen to have heard of any new remedy then richard no they advertise a great many cures for indigestion i assure you my dear boy i wonder whether one can rely upon the authenticity of those signatures i see no reason why there should be no cure for such a disease eh and it's just one of the things a quack as they call them would hit upon sooner than one who is in the beaten track do you know richard my dear boy i've often thought that if we could by any means appropriate to our use some of the extraordinary digestive power that a boa constrictor has in his gastric juices there is really no manner of reason why we should not comfortably dispose of as much of an ox as our stomachs will hold and one might eat french dishes without the wretchedness of thinking what's to follow and this makes me think that those fellows may after all have got some truth in them some secret that of course they require to be paid for we distrust each other in this world too much richard i've felt inclined once or twice but it's absurd if it only alleviated a few of my sufferings i should be satisfied i've no hesitation in saying that i should be quite satisfied if it only did away with one or two and left me free to eat and drink as other people do not that i mean to try them it's only a fancy eh what a thing health is my dear boy ah if i were like you i was in love once were you said richard coolly regarding him i've forgotten what i felt hippias sighed you've very much improved my dear boy so people say quoth richard hippias looked at him anxiously if i go to town and get the doctor's opinion about trying a new course eh richard will you come with me i should like your company we could see london together you know enjoy ourselves and hippias rubbed his hands richard smiled at the feeble glimmer of enjoyment promised by his uncle's eyes and said he thought it better they should stay where they were an answer that might mean anything hippias immediately became possessed by the beguiling project he went to the baronet and put the matter before him instancing doctors as the object of his journey not quacks of course and requesting leave to take richard sir austin was getting uneasy about his son's manner it was not natural his heart seemed to be frozen he had no confidences he appeared to have no ambition to have lost the virtues of youth with the poison that had passed out of him he was disposed to try what effect a little travelling might have on him and had himself once or twice hinted to richard that it would be good for him to move about the young man quietly replying that he did not wish to quit raynham at all which was too strict a fulfilment of his father's original views in educating him there entirely on the day that hippias made his proposal adrian seconded by lady blandish also made one the sweet spring season stirred in adrian as well as in others not to pastoral measures to the joys of the operatic world and bravura glories he also suggested that it would be advisable to carry richard to town for a term and let him know his position and some freedom sir austin weighed the two proposals he was pretty certain that richard's passion was consumed and that the youth was now only under the burden of its ashes he had found against his heart at the bellingham inn a great lock of golden hair he had taken it and the lover after feeling about for it with faint hands never asked for it this precious lock miss davenport had thrust it into his hand at belthorpe as lucy's last gift what sighs and tears it had weathered the baronet laid it in richard's sight one day and beheld him take it up turn it over and drop it down again calmly as if he were handling any common curiosity it pacified him on that score the young man's love was dead dr clifford said rightly he wanted distractions the baronet determined that richard should go hippias and adrian then pressed their several suits as to which should have him hippias when he could forget himself did not lack sense he observed that adrian was not at present a proper companion for richard and would teach him to look on life from the false point you don't understand a young philosopher said the baronet a young philosopher's an old fool returned hippias not thinking that his growl had begotten a phrase his brother smiled with gratification and applauded him loudly excellent worthy of your best days you're wrong though in applying it to adrian he has never been precocious all he has done has been to bring sound common sense to bear upon what he hears and sees i think however the baronet added he may want faith in the better qualities of men and this reflection inclined him not to let his son be alone with adrian he gave richard his choice who saw which way his father's wishes tended and decided so to please him naturally it annoyed adrian extremely he said to his chief i suppose you know what you are doing sir i don't see that we derive any advantage from the family name being made notorious for twenty years of obscene suffering and becoming a byword for our constitutional tendency to stomachic distension before we fortunately encountered quackem's pill my uncle's tortures have been huge but i would rather society were not intimate with them under their several headings adrian enumerated some of the most abhorrent you know him sir if he conceives a duty he will do it in the face of every decency all the more obstinate because the conception is rare if he feels a little brisk the morning after the pill he sends the letter that makes us famous we go down to posterity with heightened characteristics to say nothing of a contemporary celebrity nothing less than our being turned inside out to the rabble i confess i don't desire to have my machinery made bare to them sir austin assured the wise youth that hippias had arranged to go to dr bairam he softened adrian's chagrin by telling him that in about two weeks they would follow to london hinting also at a prospective summer campaign the day was fixed for richard to depart and the day came madame the eighteenth century called him to her chamber and put into his hand a fifty pound note as her contribution toward his pocket expenses he did not want it he said but she told him he was a young man and would soon make that fly when he stood on his own feet the old lady did not at all approve of the system in her heart and she gave her grandnephew to understand that should he require more he knew where to apply and secrets would be kept his father presented him with a hundred pounds which also richard said he did not want he did not care for money spend it or not said the baronet perfectly secure in him hippias had few injunctions to observe they were to take up quarters at the hotel algernon's general run of company at the house not being altogether wholesome the baronet particularly forewarned hippias of the imprudence of attempting to restrict the young man's movements and letting him imagine he was under surveillance richard having been as it were pollarded by despotism was now to grow up straight and bloom again in complete independence as far as he could feel so did the sage decree and we may pause a moment to reflect how wise were his previsions and how successful they must have been had not fortune the great foe to human cleverness turned against him or he against himself the departure took place on a fine march morning the bird of winter sang from the budding tree in the blue sky sang the bird of summer adrian rode between richard and hippias to the bellingham station and vented his disgust on them after his own humorous fashion because it did not rain and damp their ardour in the rear came lady blandish and the baronet conversing on the calm summit of success you have shaped him exactly to resemble yourself she said pointing with her riding whip to the grave stately figure of the young man outwardly perhaps he answered and led to a discussion on purity and strength the lady saying that she preferred purity but you do not said the baronet and there i admire the always true instinct of women that they all worship strength in whatever form and seem to know it to be the child of heaven whereas purity is but a characteristic a garment and can be spotted how soon for there are questions in this life with which we must grapple or be lost and when hunted by that cold eye of intense inner consciousness the clearest soul becomes a cunning fox if it have not courage to stand and do battle strength indicates a boundless nature like the maker strength is a god to you purity a toy a pretty one and you seem to be fond of playing with it he added with unaccustomed slyness the lady listened pleased at the sportive malice which showed that the constraint on his mind had left him it was for women to fight their fight now she only took part in it for amusement this is how the ranks of our enemies are thinned no sooner do poor women put up a champion in their midst than she betrays them i see she said archly we are the lovelier vessels you claim the more direct descent men are seedlings women slips nay you have said so she cried out at his gestured protestation laughing but i never printed it oh what you speak answers for print with me exquisite blandish he could not choose but love her tell me what are your plans she asked may a woman know he replied i have none or you would share them i shall study him in the world this indifference must wear off i shall mark his inclinations now and he shall be what he inclines to occupation will be his prime safety his cousin austin's plan of life appears most to his taste and he can serve the people that way as well as in parliament should he have no stronger ambition the clear duty of a man of any wealth is to serve the people as he best can he shall go among austin's set if he wishes it though personally i find no pleasure in rash imaginations and undigested schemes built upon the mere instinct of principles look at him now said the lady he seems to care for nothing not even for the beauty of the day or adrian's jokes added the baronet adrian could be seen to be trying zealously to torment a laugh or a confession of irritation out of his hearers stretching out his chin to one and to the other with audible asides richard he treated as a new instrument of destruction about to be let loose on the slumbering metropolis hippias as one in an interesting condition and he got so much fun out of the notion of these two journeying together and the mishaps that might occur to them that he esteemed it almost a personal insult for his hearers not to laugh the wise youth's dull life at raynham had afflicted him with many peculiarities of the professional joker oh the spring the spring he cried as in scorn of his sallies they exchanged their unmeaning remarks on the sweet weather across him you seem both to be uncommonly excited by the operations of turtles rooks and daws why can't you let them alone 'wind bloweth cock croweth doodle doo hippy verteth ricky sterteth sing cuckoo' there's an old native pastoral why don't you write a spring sonnet ricky the asparagus beds are full of promise i hear and eke the strawberry berries i fancy your pegasus has a taste for what kind of berry was that i saw some verses of yours about once amatory verses to some kind of berry yewberry blueberry glueberry pretty verses decidedly warm lips eyes bosom legs legs i don't think you gave her any legs no legs and no nose that appears to be the poetic taste of the day it shall be admitted that you create the very beauties for a chaste people 'o might i lie where leans her lute' and offend no moral community that's not a bad image of yours my dear boy 'her shape is like an antelope upon the eastern hills' but as a candid critic i would ask you if the likeness can be considered correct when you give her no legs you will see at the ballet that you are in error about women at present richard that admirable institution which our venerable elders have imported from gallia for the instruction of our gaping youth will edify and astonish you i assure you i used from reading the pilgrim's scrip to imagine all sorts of things about them till i was taken there and learnt that they are very like us after all and then they ceased to trouble me mystery is the great danger to youth my son mystery is woman's redoubtable weapon o richard of the ordeal i'm aware that you've had your lessons in anatomy but nothing will persuade you that an anatomical figure means flesh and blood you can't realize the fact do you intend to publish when you're in town it'll be better not to put your name having one's name to a volume of poems is as bad as to an advertising pill i will send you an early copy adrian when i publish quoth richard hark at that old blackbird uncle yes hippias quavered looking up from the usual subject of his contemplation and trying to take an interest in him fine old fellow what a chuckle he gives out before he flies not unlike july nightingales you know that bird i told you of the blackbird that had its mate shot and used to come to sing to old dame bakewell's bird from the tree opposite a rascal knocked it over the day before yesterday and the dame says her bird hasn't sung a note since extraordinary hippias muttered abstractedly i remember the verses but where's your moral interposed the wrathful adrian where's constancy rewarded 'the ouzel cock so black of hue with orange tawny bill the rascal with his aim so true the poet's little quill' where's the moral of that except that all's game to the poet certainly we have a noble example of the devotedness of the female who for three entire days refuses to make herself heard on account of a defunct male i suppose that's what ricky dwells on as you please my dear adrian says richard and points out larch buds to his uncle as they ride by the young green wood the wise youth was driven to extremity such a lapse from his pupil's heroics to this last verge of arcadian coolness adrian could not believe in hark at this old blackbird he cried in his turn and pretending to interpret his fits of song oh what a pretty comedy don't we wear the mask well my fiesco genoa will be our own to morrow only wait until the train has started jolly jolly jolly we'll be winners yet not a bad verse eh ricky my lucius junius you do the blackbird well said richard and looked at him in a manner mildly affable adrian shrugged you're a young man of wonderful powers he emphatically observed meaning to say that richard quite beat him for which opinion richard gravely thanked him and with this they rode into bellingham there was young tom blaize at the station in his sunday beaver and gala waistcoat and neckcloth coming the lord over tom bakewell who had preceded his master in charge of the baggage he likewise was bound for london richard as he was dismounting heard adrian say to the baronet the beast sir appears to be going to fetch beauty but he paid no heed to the words whether young tom heard them or not adrian's look took the lord out of him and he shrunk away into obscurity where the nearest approach to the fashions which the tailors of bellingham could supply to him sat upon him more easily and he was not stiffened by the eyes of the superiors whom he sought to rival the baronet lady blandish and adrian remained on horseback and received richard's adieux across the palings he shook hands with each of them in the same kindly cold way elicitating from adrian a marked encomium on his style of doing it the train came up and richard stepped after his uncle into one of the carriages now surely there will come an age when the presentation of science at war with fortune and the fates will be deemed the true epic of modern life and the aspect of a scientific humanist who by dint of incessant watchfulness has maintained a system against those active forties cannot be reckoned less than sublime even though at the moment he but sit upon his horse on a fine march morning such as this and smile wistfully to behold the son of his heart his system incarnate wave a serene adieu to tutelage neither too eager nor morbidly unwilling to try his luck alone for a term of two weeks at present i am aware an audience impatient for blood and glory scorns the stress i am putting on incidents so minute a picture so little imposing an audience will come to whom it will be given to see the elementary machinery at work who as it were from some slight hint of the straws will feel the winds of march when they do not blow to them will nothing be trivial seeing that they will have in their eyes the invisible conflict going on around us whose features a nod a smile a laugh of ours perpetually changes and they will perceive moreover that in real life all hangs together the train is laid in the lifting of an eyebrow that bursts upon the field of thousands they will see the links of things as they pass and wonder not as foolish people now do that this great matter came out of that small one such an audience then will participate in the baronet's gratification at his son's demeanour wherein he noted the calm bearing of experience not gained in the usual wanton way and will not be without some excited apprehension at his twinge of astonishment when just as the train went sliding into swiftness he beheld the grave cold self possessed young man throw himself back in the carriage violently laughing science was at a loss to account for that sir austin checked his mind from inquiring that he might keep suspicion at a distance but he thought it odd and the jarring sensation that ran along his nerves at the sight remained with him as he rode home lady blandish's tender womanly intuition bade her say you see it was the very thing he wanted he has got his natural spirits already it was adrian put in his word the exact thing he wanted his spirits have returned miraculously something amused him said the baronet with an eye on the puffing train probably something his uncle said or did lady blandish suggested and led off at a gallop her conjecture chanced to be quite correct the cause for richard's laughter was simple enough hippias on finding the carriage door closed on him became all at once aware of the bright haired hope which dwells in change for one who does not woo her too frequently and to express his sudden relief from mental despondency at the amorous prospect the dyspepsy bent and gave his hands a sharp rub between his legs which unlucky action brought adrian's pastoral hippy verteth sing cuckoo in such comic colours before richard that a demon of laughter seized him hippy verteth every time he glanced at his uncle the song sprang up and he laughed so immoderately that it looked like madness come upon him why why why what are you laughing at my dear boy said hippias and was provoked by the contagious exercise to a modest ha ha why what are you laughing at uncle cried richard i really don't know hippias chuckled nor i uncle sing cuckoo they laughed themselves into the pleasantest mood imaginable hippias not only came aboveground he flew about in the very skies verting like any blithe creature of the season he remembered old legal jokes and anecdotes of circuit and richard laughed at them all but more at him he was so genial and childishly fresh and innocently joyful at his own transformation while a lurking doubt in the bottom of his eyes now and then that it might not last and that he must go underground again lent him a look of pathos and humour which tickled his youthful companion irresistibly and made his heart warm to him i tell you what uncle said richard i think travelling's a capital thing the best thing in the world my dear boy hippias returned it makes me wish i had given up that work of mine and tried it before instead of chaining myself to a task we're quite different beings in a minute i am hem what shall we have for dinner leave that to me uncle i shall order for you you know i intend to make you well how gloriously we go along i should like to ride on a railway every day hippias remarked they say it rather injures the digestion nonsense see how you'll digest to night and to morrow perhaps i shall do something yet sighed hippias alluding to the vast literary fame he had aforetime dreamed of i hope i shall have a good night to night of course you will what after laughing like that ugh hippias grunted i daresay richard you sleep the moment you get into bed the instant my head's on my pillow and up the moment i wake health's everything health's everything echoed hippias from his immense distance and if you'll put yourself in my hands richard continued you shall do just as i do you shall be well and strong and sing 'jolly' like adrian's blackbird you shall upon my honour uncle he specified the hours of devotion to his uncle's recovery no less than twelve a day that he intended to expend and his cheery robustness almost won his uncle to leap up recklessly and clutch health as his own mind quoth hippias with a half seduced smile mind your dishes are not too savoury light food and claret regular meals and amusement lend your heart to all but give it to none exclaims young wisdom and hippias mutters yes yes and intimates that the origin of his malady lay in his not following that maxim earlier love ruins us my dear boy he said thinking to preach richard a lesson and richard boisterously broke out the love of monsieur francatelli it was the ruin of et coetera hippias blinked exclaiming really my dear boy i never saw you so excited it's the railway it's the fun uncle ah hippias wagged a melancholy head you've got the golden bride keep her if you can that's a pretty fable of your father's i gave him the idea though austin filches a great many of my ideas here's the idea in verse uncle 'o sunless walkers by the tide o have you seen the golden bride they say that she is fair beyond all women faithful and more fond you know the young inquirer comes to a group of penitent sinners by the brink of a stream they howl and answer faithful she is but she forsakes and fond yet endless woe she makes and fair but with this curse she's cross'd to know her not till she is lost' then the doleful party march off in single file solemnly and the fabulist pursues 'she hath a palace in the west bright hesper lights her to her rest and him the morning star awakes whom to her charmed arms she takes so lives he till he sees alas the maids of baser metal pass' and prodigal of the happiness she lends him he asks to share it with one of them there is the silver maid and the copper and the brassy maid and others of them first you know he tries argentine and finds her only twenty to the pound and has a worse experience with copperina till he descends to the scullery and the lower he goes the less obscure become the features of his bride of gold and all her radiance shines forth my uncle verse rather blunts the point well keep to her now you've got her says hippias we will uncle look how the farms fly past look at the cattle in the fields and how the lines duck and swim up 'she claims the whole and not the part the coin of an unused heart to gain his golden bride again he hunts with melancholy men' and is waked no longer by the morning star not if he doesn't sleep till an hour before it rises hippias interjected you don't rhyme badly but stick to prose poetry's a base metal maid i'm not sure that any writing's good for the digestion i'm afraid it has spoilt mine fear nothing uncle laughed richard you shall ride in the park with me every day to get an appetite you and i and the golden bride you know that little poem of sandoe's 'she rides in the park on a prancing bay she and her squires together her dark locks gleam from a bonnet of grey and toss with the tossing feather 'too calmly proud for a glance of pride is the beautiful face as it passes the cockneys nod to each other aside the coxcombs lift their glasses 'and throng to her sigh to her you that can breach the ice wall that guards her securely you have not such bliss though she smile on you each as the heart that can image her purely' wasn't sandoe once a friend of my father's i suppose they quarrelled he understands the heart what does he make his 'humble lover' say 'true madam you may think to part conditions by a glacier ridge but beauty's for the largest heart and all abysses love can bridge hippias now laughed grimly as men laugh at the emptiness of words largest heart he sneered what's a 'glacier ridge' i've never seen one i can't deny it rhymes with 'bridge' but don't go parading your admiration of that person richard your father will speak to you on the subject when he thinks fit i thought they had quarrelled said richard what a pity and he murmured to a pleased ear beauty's for the largest heart the flow of their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of passengers at a station richard examined their faces with pleasure all faces pleased him human nature sat tributary at the feet of him and his golden bride as he could not well talk his thoughts before them he looked out at the windows and enjoyed the changing landscape projecting all sorts of delights for his old friend ripton and musing hazily on the wondrous things he was to do in the world of the great service he was to be to his fellow creatures in the midst of his reveries he was landed in london tom bakewell stood at the carriage door a glance told richard that his squire had something curious on his mind and he gave tom the word to speak out tom edged his master out of hearing and began sputtering a laugh dash'd if i can help it sir he said that young tom he've come to town dressed that spicy and he don't know his way about no more than a stag he's come to fetch somebody from another rail and he don't know how to get there and he ain't sure about which rail 'tis look at him mr richard there he goes young tom appeared to have the weight of all london on his beaver who has he come for richard asked don't you know sir you don't like me to mention the name mumbled tom bursting to be perfectly intelligible is it for her tom miss lucy sir richard turned away and was seized by hippias who begged him to get out of the noise and pother and caught hold of his slack arm to bear him into a conveyance but richard by wheeling half to the right or left always got his face round to the point where young tom was manoeuvring to appear at his ease even when they were seated in the conveyance hippias could not persuade him to drive off he made the excuse that he did not wish to start till there was a clear road at last young tom cast anchor by a policeman and doubtless at the official's suggestion bashfully took seat in a cab and was shot into the whirlpool of london richard then angrily asked his driver what he was waiting for are you ill my boy said hippias where's your colour he laughed oddly and made a random answer that he hoped the fellow would drive fast i hate slow motion after being in the railway he said hippias assured him there was something the matter with him nothing uncle nothing said richard looking fiercely candid they say that when the skill and care of men rescue a drowned wretch from extinction and warm the flickering spirit into steady flame such pain it is the blood forcing its way along the dry channels and the heavily ticking nerves and the sullen heart the struggle of life and death in him grim death relaxing his gripe such pain it is he cries out no thanks to them that pull him by inches from the depths of the dead river and he who has thought a love extinct and is surprised by the old fires and the old tyranny he rebels and strives to fight clear of the cloud of forgotten sensations that settle on him such pain it is the old sweet music reviving through his frame and the charm of his passion filing him afresh still was fair lucy the one woman to richard he had forbidden her name but from an instinct of self defence must the maids of baser metal dominate him anew it is in lucy's shape thinking of her now so near him his darling all her graces her sweetness her truth for despite his bitter blame of her he knew her true swam in a thousand visions before his eyes visions pathetic and full of glory that now wrung his heart and now elated it as well might a ship attempt to calm the sea as this young man the violent emotion that began to rage in his breast i shall not see her he said to himself exultingly and at the same instant thought how black was every corner of the earth but that one spot where lucy stood how utterly cheerless the place he was going to then he determined to bear it to live in darkness there was a refuge in the idea of a voluntary martyrdom for if i chose i could see her this day within an hour i could see her and touch her hand and oh heaven but i do not choose and a great wave swelled through him and was crushed down only to swell again more stormily then tom bakewell's words recurred to him that young tom blaize was uncertain where to go for her and that she might be thrown on this babylon alone and flying from point to point it struck him that they had known at raynham of her return and had sent him to town to be out of the way they had been miserably plotting against him once more they shall see what right they have to fear me i'll shame them was the first turn taken by his wrathful feelings as he resolved to go and see her safe and calmly return to his uncle whom he sincerely believed not to be one of the conspirators nevertheless after forming that resolve he sat still as if there were something fatal in the wheels that bore him away from it perhaps because he knew as some do when passion is lord that his intelligence juggled with him though none the less keenly did he feel his wrongs and suspicions his golden bride was waning fast but when hippias ejaculated to cheer him we shall soon be there the spell broke richard stopped the cab saying he wanted to speak to tom and would ride with him the rest of the journey he knew well enough which line of railway his lucy must come by he had studied every town and station on the line before his uncle could express more than a mute remonstrance he jumped out and hailed tom bakewell who came behind with the boxes and baggage in a companion cab his head a yard beyond the window to make sure of his ark of safety the vehicle preceding what an extraordinary impetuous boy it is said hippias we're in the very street within a minute the stalwart berry despatched by the baronet to arrange everything for their comfort had opened the door and made his bow mr richard sir evaporated was berry's modulated inquiry behind among the boxes fool hippias growled as he received berry's muscular assistance to alight lunch ready eh luncheon was ordered precise at two o'clock sir been in attendance one quarter of an hour heah berry sang out to the second cab which with its pyramid of luggage remained stationary some thirty paces distant at his voice the majestic pile deliberately turned its back on them and went off in a contrary direction chapter xxvi on the stroke of the hour when ripton thompson was accustomed to consult his gold watch for practical purposes and sniff freedom and the forthcoming dinner a burglarious foot entered the clerk's office where he sat and a man of a scowling countenance who looked a villain and whom he was afraid he knew slid a letter into his hands nodding that it would be prudent for him to read and be silent ripton obeyed in alarm apparently the contents of the letter relieved his conscience for he reached down his hat and told mr beazley to inform his father that he had business of pressing importance in the west and should meet him at the station mr beazley zealously waited upon the paternal thompson without delay and together making their observations from the window they beheld a cab of many boxes into which ripton darted and was followed by one in groom's dress it was saturday the day when ripton gave up his law readings magnanimously to bestow himself upon his family and mr thompson liked to have his son's arm as he walked down to the station but that third glass of port which always stood for his second and the groom's suggestion of aristocratic acquaintances prevented mr thompson from interfering so ripton was permitted to depart in the cab ripton made a study of the letter he held it had the preciseness of an imperial mandate dear ripton you are to get lodgings for a lady immediately not a word to a soul then come along with tom rdf lodgings for a lady ripton meditated aloud what sort of lodgings where am i to get lodgings who's the lady i say he addressed the mysterious messenger so you're tom bakewell are you tom tom grinned his identity do you remember the rick tom ha ha we got out of that neatly we might all have been transported though i could have convicted you tom safe it's no use coming across a practised lawyer now tell me ripton having flourished his powers commenced his examination who's this lady better wait till you see mr richard sir tom resumed his scowl to reply ah ripton acquiesced is she young tom tom said she was not old handsome tom some might think one thing some another tom said and where does she come from now asked ripton with the friendly cheerfulness of a baffled counsellor comes from the country sir a friend of the family i suppose a relation ripton left this insinuating query to be answered by a look tom's face was a dead blank ah ripton took a breath and eyed the mask opposite him why you're quite a scholar tom mr richard is well all right at home come to town this mornin' with his uncle said tom all well thank ye sir ha cried ripton more than ever puzzled now i see you all came to town to day and these are your boxes outside so so but mr richard writes for me to get lodgings for a lady there must be some mistake he wrote in a hurry he wants lodgings for you all eh 'm sure i d'n know what he wants said tom you'd better go by the letter sir ripton re consulted that document 'lodgings for a lady and then come along with tom not a word to a soul' i say that looks like but he never cared for them you don't mean to say tom he's been running away with anybody tom fell back upon his first reply better wait till ye see mr richard sir and ripton exclaimed hanged if you ain't the tightest witness i ever saw i shouldn't like to have you in a box some of you country fellows beat any number of cockneys you do tom received the compliment stubbornly on his guard and ripton as nothing was to be got out of him set about considering how to perform his friend's injunctions deciding firstly that a lady fresh from the country ought to lodge near the parks in which direction he told the cabman to drive thus unaware of his high destiny ripton joined the hero and accepted his character in the new comedy it is nevertheless true that certain favoured people do have beneficent omens to prepare them for their parts when the hero is in full career so that they really may be nerved to meet him ay and to check him in his course had they that signal courage for instance mrs elizabeth berry a ripe and wholesome landlady of advertised lodgings on the borders of kensington noted as she sat rocking her contemplative person before the parlour fire this very march afternoon a supernatural tendency in that fire to burn all on one side which signifies that a wedding approaches the house why who shall say omens are as impassable as heroes it may be because in these affairs the fire is thought to be all on one side enough that the omen exists and spoke its solemn warning to the devout woman mrs berry in her circle was known as a certificated lecturer against the snares of matrimony still that was no reason why she should not like a wedding expectant therefore she watched the one glowing cheek of hymen and with pleasing tremours beheld a cab of many boxes draw up by her bit of garden and a gentleman emerge from it in the set of consulting an advertisement paper the gentleman required lodgings for a lady lodgings for a lady mrs berry could produce and a very roseate smile for a gentleman so much so that ripton forgot to ask about the terms which made the landlady in mrs berry leap up to embrace him as the happy man but her experienced woman's eye checked her enthusiasm he had not the air of a bridegroom he did not seem to have a weight on his chest or an itch to twiddle everything with his fingers at any rate he was not the bridegroom for whom omens fly abroad promising to have all ready for the lady within an hour mrs berry fortified him with her card curtsied him back to his cab and floated him off on her smiles the remarkable vehicle which had woven this thread of intrigue through london streets now proceeded sedately to finish its operations ripton was landed at a hotel in westminster ere he was halfway up the stairs a door opened and his old comrade in adventure rushed down richard allowed no time for salutations have you done it was all he asked for answer ripton handed him mrs berry's card richard took it and left him standing there five minutes elapsed and then ripton heard the gracious rustle of feminine garments above richard came a little in advance leading and half supporting a figure in a black silk mantle and small black straw bonnet young that was certain though she held her veil so close he could hardly catch the outlines of her face girlishly slender and sweet and simple in appearance the hush that came with her and her soft manner of moving stirred the silly youth to some of those ardours that awaken the knight of dames in our bosoms he felt that he would have given considerable sums for her to lift her veil he could see that she was trembling perhaps weeping it was the master of her fate she clung to they passed him without speaking as she went by her head passively bent ripton had a glimpse of noble tresses and a lovely neck great golden curls hung loosely behind pouring from under her bonnet she looked a captive borne to the sacrifice what ripton after a sight of those curls would have given for her just to lift her veil an instant and strike him blind with beauty was fortunately for his exchequer never demanded of him and he had absolutely been composing speeches as he came along in the cab gallant speeches for the lady and sly congratulatory ones for his friend to be delivered as occasion should serve that both might know him a man of the world and be at their ease he forgot the smirking immoralities he had revelled in this was clearly serious ripton did not require to be told that his friend was in love and meant that life and death business called marriage parents and guardians consenting or not presently richard returned to him and said hurriedly i want you now to go to my uncle at our hotel keep him quiet till i come say i had to see you say anything i shall be there by the dinner hour rip i must talk to you alone after dinner ripton feebly attempted to reply that he was due at home he was very curious to hear the plot of the new comedy and besides there was richard's face questioning him sternly and confidently for signs of unhesitating obedience he finished his grimaces by asking the name and direction of the hotel richard pressed his hand it is much to obtain even that recognition of our devotion from the hero tom bakewell also received his priming and to judge by his chuckles and grins rather appeared to enjoy the work cut out for him in a few minutes they had driven to their separate destinations ripton was left to the unusual exercise of his fancy such is the nature of youth and its thirst for romance that only to act as a subordinate is pleasant when one unfurls the standard of defiance to parents and guardians he may be sure of raising a lawless troop of adolescent ruffians born rebels to any amount the beardless crew know that they have not a chance of pay but what of that when the rosy prospect of thwarting their elders is in view though it is to see another eat the forbidden fruit they will run all his risks with him gaily ripton took rank as lieutenant in the enterprise and the moment his heart had sworn the oaths he was rewarded by an exquisite sense of the charms of existence london streets wore a sly laugh to him he walked with a dandified heel the generous youth ogled aristocratic carriages and glanced intimately at the ladies overflowingly happy the crossing sweepers blessed him he hummed lively tunes he turned over old jokes in his mouth unctuously he hugged himself he had a mind to dance down piccadilly and all because a friend of his was running away with a pretty girl and he was in the secret it was only when he stood on the doorstep of richard's hotel that his jocund mood was a little dashed by remembering that he had then to commence the duties of his office and must fabricate a plausible story to account for what he knew nothing about a part that the greatest of sages would find it difficult to perform the young however whom sages well may envy seldom fail in lifting their inventive faculties to the level of their spirits and two minutes of hippias's angry complaints against the friend he serenely inquired for gave ripton his cue we're in the very street within a stone's throw of the house and he jumps like a harlequin out of my cab into another he must be mad that boy's got madness in him and carries off all the boxes my dinner pills too and keeps away the whole of the day though he promised to go to the doctor and had a dozen engagements with me said hippias venting an enraged snarl to sum up his grievances ripton at once told him that the doctor was not at home why you don't mean to say he's been to the doctor hippias cried out he has called on him twice sir said ripton expressively on leaving me he was going a third time i shouldn't wonder that's what detains him he's so determined by fine degrees ripton ventured to grow circumstantial saying that richard's case was urgent and required immediate medical advice and that both he and his father were of opinion richard should not lose an hour in obtaining it he's alarmed about himself said ripton and tapped his chest hippias protested he had never heard a word from his nephew of any physical affliction he was afraid of making you anxious i think sir algernon feverel and richard came in while he was hammering at the alphabet to recollect the first letter of the doctor's name they had met in the hall below and were laughing heartily as they entered the room ripton jumped up to get the initiative have you seen the doctor he asked significantly plucking at richard's fingers richard was all abroad at the question algernon clapped him on the back what the deuce do you want with doctor boy the solid thump awakened him to see matters as they were oh ay the doctor he said smiling frankly at his lieutenant why he tells me he'd back me to do milo's trick in a week from the present day uncle he came forward to hippias i hope you'll excuse me for running off as i did i was in a hurry i left something at the railway this stupid rip thinks i went to the doctor about myself the fact was i wanted to fetch the doctor to see you here so that you might have no trouble you know you can't bear the sight of his instruments and skeletons i've heard you say so you said it set all your marrow in revolt 'fried your marrow' i think were the words and made you see twenty thousand different ways of sliding down to the chambers of the grim king don't you remember hippias emphatically did not remember and he did not believe the story irritation at the mad ravishment of his pill box rendered him incredulous as he had no means of confuting his nephew all he could do safely to express his disbelief in him was to utter petulant remarks on his powerlessness to appear at the dinner table that day upon which berry just then trumpeting dinner algernon seized one arm of the dyspepsy and richard another and the laughing couple bore him into the room where dinner was laid ripton sniggering in the rear the really happy man of the party they had fun at the dinner table richard would have it and his gaiety his by play his princely superiority to truth and heroic promise of overriding all our laws his handsome face the lord and possessor of beauty that he looked as it were a star shining on his forehead gained the old complete mastery over ripton who had been mentally at least half patronizing him till then because he knew more of london and life and was aware that his friend now depended upon him almost entirely after a second circle of the claret the hero caught his lieutenant's eye across the table and said we must go out and talk over that law business rip before you go do you think the old lady has any chance not a bit said ripton authoritatively but it's worth fighting eh rip oh certainly was ripton's mature opinion richard observed that ripton's father seemed doubtful ripton cited his father's habitual caution richard made a playful remark on the necessity of sometimes acting in opposition to fathers ripton agreed to it in certain cases yes yes in certain cases said richard pretty legal morality gentlemen algernon interjected hippias adding and lay too the pair of uncles listened further to the fictitious dialogue well kept up on both sides and in the end desired a statement of the old lady's garrulous case hippias offering to decide what her chances were in law and algernon to give a common sense judgment rip will tell you said richard deferentially signalling the lawyer i'm a bad hand at these matters tell them how it stands rip ripton disguised his excessive uneasiness under endeavours to right his position on his chair and inwardly praying speed to the claret jug to come and strengthen his wits began with a careless aspect oh nothing she very curious old character she a wears a wig she a very curious old character indeed she a quite the old style there's no doing anything with her and ripton took a long breath to relieve himself after his elaborate fiction so it appears hippias commented and algernon asked well and about her wig somebody stole it while richard whose features were grim with suppressed laughter bade the narrator continue ripton lunged for the claret jug he had got an old lady like an oppressive bundle on his brain and he was as helpless as she was in the pangs of ineffectual authorship his ideas shot at her wig and then at her one characteristic of extreme obstinacy and tore back again at her wig but she would not be animated the obstinate old thing would remain a bundle law studies seemed light in comparison with this tremendous task of changing an old lady from a doll to a human creature he flung off some claret perspired freely and with a mental tribute to the cleverness of those author fellows recommenced oh nothing she richard knows her better than i do an old lady somewhere down in suffolk i think we had better advise her not to proceed the expenses of litigation are enormous she i think we had better advise her to stop short and not make any scandal and not make any scandal algernon took him up come come there's something more than a wig then ripton was commanded to proceed whether she did or no the luckless fictionist looked straight at his pitiless leader and blurted out dubiously she there's a daughter born with effort ejaculated hippias must give her pause after that and i'll take the opportunity to stretch my length on the sofa heigho that's true what austin says 'the general prayer should be for a full stomach and the individual for one that works well for on that basis only are we a match for temporal matters and able to contemplate eternal' sententious but true i gave him the idea though take care of your stomachs boys and if ever you hear of a monument proposed to a scientific cook or gastronomic doctor send in your subscriptions or say to him while he lives go forth and be a knight ha they have a good cook at this house he suits me better than ours at raynham i almost wish i had brought my manuscript to town i feel so much better aha i didn't expect to digest at all without my regular incentive i think i shall give it up what do you say to the theatre to night boys richard shouted bravo uncle let mr thompson finish first said algernon i want to hear the conclusion of the story the old girl has a wig and a daughter i'll swear somebody runs away with one of the two fill your glass mr thompson and forward so somebody does ripton received his impetus and they're found in town together he made a fresh jerk she a that is the old lady found them in company she finds him with her wig on in company said algernon capital here's matter for the lawyers and you advise her not to proceed under such circumstances of aggravation hippias observed humorously twinkling with his stomachic contentment it's the daughter ripton sighed and surrendering to pressure hurried on recklessly a runaway match beautiful girl the only son of a baronet married by special licence a the point is he now brightened and spoke from his own element the point is whether the marriage can be annulled as she's of the catholic persuasion and he's a protestant and they're both married under age that's the point having come to the point he breathed extreme relief and saw things more distinctly not a little amazed at his leader's horrified face the two elders were making various absurd inquiries when richard sent his chair to the floor crying what a muddle you're in rip you're mixing half a dozen stories together the old lady i told you about was old dame bakewell and the dispute was concerning a neighbour of hers who encroached on her garden and i said i'd pay the money to see her righted ah said ripton humbly i was thinking of the other her garden cabbages don't interest me here come along richard beckoned to him savagely i'll be back in five minutes uncle he nodded coolly to either the young men left the room in the hall passage they met berry dressed to return to raynham richard dropped a helper to the intelligence into his hand and warned him not to gossip much of london berry bowed perfect discreetness what on earth induced you to talk about protestants and catholics marrying rip said richard as soon as they were in the street why ripton answered i was so hard pushed for it 'pon my honour i didn't know what to say i ain't an author you know i can't make a story i was trying to invent a point and i couldn't think of any other and i thought that was just the point likely to make a jolly good dispute capital dinners they give at those crack hotels why did you throw it all upon me i didn't begin on the old lady the hero mused it's odd it's impossible you could have known i'll tell you why rip i wanted to try you you fib well at long range but you don't do at close quarters and single combat you're good behind walls but not worth a shot in the open i just see what you're fit for you're staunch that i am certain of you always were lead the way to one of the parks down in that direction you know where she is ripton led the way his dinner had prepared this young englishman to defy the whole artillery of established morals with the muffled roar of london around them alone in a dark slope of green the hero leaning on his henchman and speaking in a harsh clear undertone delivered his explanations doubtless the true heroic insignia and point of view will be discerned albeit in common private's uniform they've been plotting against me for a year rip when you see her you'll know what it was to have such a creature taken away from you it nearly killed me never mind what she is she's the most perfect and noble creature god ever made it's not only her beauty i don't care so much about that but when you've once seen her she seems to draw music from all the nerves of your body but she's such an angel i worship her and her mind's like her face she's pure gold there you'll see her to night well he pursued after inflating ripton with this rapturous prospect they got her away and i recovered it was mister adrian's work what's my father's objection to her because of her birth she's educated her manners are beautiful full of refinement quick and soft can they show me one of their ladies like her she's the daughter of a naval lieutenant because she's a catholic what has religion to do with he pronounced love a little modestly as it were a blush in his voice well when i recovered i thought i did not care for her it shows how we know ourselves and i cared for nothing i felt as if i had no blood i tried to imitate my dear austin i wish to god he were here i love austin he would understand her he's coming back this year and then but it'll be too late then well my father's always scheming to make me perfect he has never spoken to me a word about her but i can see her in his eyes he wanted to give me a change he said and asked me to come to town with my uncle hippy and i consented it was another plot to get me out of the way as i live i had no more idea of meeting her than of flying to heaven he lifted his face hook at those old elm branches how they seem to mix among the stars glittering fruits of winter ripton tipped his comical nose upward and was in duty bound to say yes though he observed no connection between them and the narrative well the hero went on i came to town there i heard she was coming too coming home it must have been fate ripton heaven forgive me i was angry with her and i thought i should like to see her once only once and reproach her for being false for she never wrote to me and oh the dear angel what she must have suffered i gave my uncle the slip and got to the railway she was coming by there was a fellow going to meet her a farmer's son and good god they were going to try and make her marry him i remembered it all then a servant of the farm had told me that fellow went to the wrong station i suppose for we saw nothing of him there she was not changed a bit looking lovelier than ever and when she saw me i knew in a minute that she must love me till death you don't know what it is yet rip will you believe it though i was as sure she loved me and had been true as steel as that i shall see her to night i spoke bitterly to her and she bore it meekly she looked like a saint i told her there was but one hope of life for me she must prove she was true and as i give up all so must she i don't know what i said the thought of losing her made me mad she tried to plead with me to wait it was for my sake i know i pretended like a miserable hypocrite that she did not love me at all i think i said shameful things oh what noble creatures women are she hardly had strength to move i took her to that place where you found us rip she went down on her knees to me i never dreamed of anything in life so lovely as she looked then her eyes were thrown up bright with a crowd of tears her dark brows bent together like pain and beauty meeting in one and her glorious golden hair swept off her shoulders as she hung forward to my hands could i lose such a prize if anything could have persuaded me would not that i thought of dante's madonna guido's magdalen is there sin in it i see none and if there is it's all mine i swear she's spotless of a thought of sin i see her very soul cease to love her who dares ask me cease to love her why i live on her to see her little chin straining up from her throat as she knelt to me there was one curl that fell across her throat ripton listened for more richard had gone off in a muse at the picture well said ripton and how about that young farmer fellow the hero's head was again contemplating the starry branches his lieutenant's question came to him after an interval young tom why it's young torn blaize son of our old enemy rip i like the old man now oh i saw nothing of the fellow lord cried ripton are we going to get into a mess with blaizes again i don't like that his commander quietly passed his likes or dislikes but when he goes to the train and finds she's not there ripton suggested i've provided for that the fool went to the south east instead of the south west all warmth all sweetness comes with the south west i've provided for that friend rip my trusty tom awaits him there as if by accident he tells him he has not seen her and advises him to remain in town and go for her there to morrow and the day following tom has money for the work young tom ought to see london you know rip like you we shall gain some good clear days and when old blaize hears of it what then i have her she's mine besides he won't hear for a week this tom beats that tom in cunning i'll wager ha ha the hero burst out at a recollection what do you think rip my father has some sort of system with me it appears and when i came to town the time before he took me to some people the grandisons and what do you think one of the daughters is a little girl a nice little thing enough very funny and he wants me to wait for her he hasn't said so but i know it i know what he means nobody understands him but me i know he loves me and is one of the best of men but just consider a little girl who just comes up to my elbow isn't it ridiculous did you ever hear such nonsense ripton emphasized his opinion that it certainly was foolish no no the die's cast said richard they've been plotting for a year up to this day and this is what comes of it if my father loves me he will love her and if he loves me he'll forgive my acting against his wishes and see it was the only thing to be done come step out what a time we've been and away he went compelling ripton to the sort of strides a drummer boy has to take beside a column of grenadiers ripton began to wish himself in love seeing that it endowed a man with wind so that he could breathe great sighs while going at a tremendous pace and experience no sensation of fatigue the hero was communing with the elements his familiars and allowed him to pant as he pleased some keen eyed kensington urchins noticing the discrepancy between the pedestrian powers of the two aimed their wit at mr thompson junior's expense the pace and nothing but the pace induced ripton to proclaim that they had gone too far when they discovered that they had over shot the mark by half a mile in the street over which stood love's star the hero thundered his presence at a door and evoked a flying housemaid who knew not mrs berry the hero attached significance to the fact that his instincts should have betrayed him for he could have sworn to that house the door being shut he stood in dead silence haven't you got her card ripton inquired and heard that it was in the custody of the cabman neither of them could positively bring to mind the number of the house you ought to have chalked it like that fellow in the forty thieves ripton hazarded a pleasantry which met with no response betrayed by his instincts the magic slaves of love the hero heavily descended the steps ripton murmured that they were done for his commander turned on him and said take all the houses on the opposite side one after another i'll take these with a wry face ripton crossed the road altogether subdued by richard's native superiority to adverse circumstances then were families aroused then did mortals dimly guess that something portentous was abroad then were labourers all day in the vineyard harshly wakened from their evening's nap hope and fear stalked the street as again and again the loud companion summonses resounded finally ripton sang out cheerfully he had mrs berry before him profuse of mellow curtsies richard ran to her and caught her hands she's well upstairs oh quite well only a trifle tired with her journey and fluttering like mrs berry replied to ripton alone the lover had flown aloft the wise woman sagely ushered ripton into her own private parlour there to wait till he was wanted chapter xxvii in all cases where two have joined to commit an offence punish one of the two lightly is the dictum of the pilgrim's's scrip it is possible for young heads to conceive proper plans of action and occasionally by sheer force of will to check the wild horses that are ever fretting to gallop off with them but when they have given the reins and the whip to another what are they to do they may go down on their knees and beg and pray the furious charioteer to stop or moderate his pace alas each fresh thing they do redoubles his ardour there is a power in their troubled beauty women learn the use of and what wonder they have seen it kindle ilium to flames so often but ere they grow matronly in the house of menelaus they weep and implore and do not in truth know how terribly two edged is their gift of loveliness they resign themselves to an incomprehensible frenzy pleasant to them because they attribute it to excessive love and so the very sensible things which they can and do say are vain i reckon it absurd to ask them to be quite in earnest are not those their own horses in yonder team certainly if they were quite in earnest they might soon have my gentleman as sober as a carter a hundred different ways of disenchanting him exist and adrian will point you out one or two that shall be instantly efficacious for love the charioteer is easily tripped while honest jog trot love keeps his legs to the end granted dear women are not quite in earnest still the mere words they utter should be put to their good account they do mean them though their hearts are set the wrong way 'tis a despairing pathetic homage to the judgment of the majority in whose faces they are flying punish helen very young lightly after a certain age you may select her for special chastisement an innocent with theseus with paris she is an advanced incendiary the fair young girl was sitting as her lover had left her trying to recall her stunned senses her bonnet was un removed her hands clasped on her knees dry tears in her eyes like a dutiful slave she rose to him and first he claimed her mouth there was a speech made up of all the pretty wisdom her wild situation and true love could gather awaiting him there but his kiss scattered it to fragments she dropped to her seat weeping and hiding her shamed cheeks by his silence she divined his thoughts and took his hand and drew it to her lips he bent beside her bidding her look at him keep your eyes so she could not do you fear me lucy a throbbing pressure answered him do you love me darling she trembled from head to foot then why do you turn from me she wept o richard take me home take me home look at me lucy her head shrank timidly round keep your eyes on me darling now speak but she could not look and speak too the lover knew his mastery when he had her eyes you wish me to take you home she faltered o richard it is not too late you regret what you have done for me dearest it is ruin you weep because you have consented to be mine not for me o richard for me you weep look at
