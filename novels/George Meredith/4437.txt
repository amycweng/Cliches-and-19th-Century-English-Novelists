vittoria by george meredith book xiv at the maestros door xv ammiani through the midnight xvi countess ammiani xvii in the piazza darmi xviii the night of the fifteenth xix the prima donna chapter xiv at the maestros door the house of the maestro rocco ricci turned off the borgo della stella carlo ammiani conducted vittoria to the maestros door they conversed very little on the way you are a good swordsman she asked him abruptly i have as much skill as belongs to a perfect intimacy with the weapon he answered your father was a soldier signor carlo he was a general officer in what he believed to be the army of italy we used to fence together every day for two hours i love the fathers who do that said vittoria after such speaking ammiani was not capable of the attempt to preach peace and safety to her he postponed it to the next minute and the next vittorias spirit was in one of those angry knots which are half of the intellect half of the will and are much under the domination of one or other of the passions in the ascendant she was resolved to go forward she felt justified in going forward but the divine afflatus of enthusiasm buoyed her no longer and she required the support of all that accuracy of insight and that senseless stubbornness which there might be in her nature the feeling that it was she to whom it was given to lift the torch and plant the standard of italy had swept her as through the strings of a harp laura and the horrible little bronze butterfly and the sei sospetta now made her duty seem dry and miserably fleshless imaging itself to her as if a skeleton had been told to arise and walk say the thing obeys and fills a ghastly distension of mens eyelids for a space and again lies down and men get their breath but who is the rosier for it where is the glory of it what is the good this milan and verona padua vicenza brescia venice florence the whole venetian tuscan and lombardic lands down to far sicily and that rome which always lay under the crown of a dead sunset in her ideathey too might rise but she thought of them as skeletons likewise even the shadowy vision of italy free had no bloom on it and stood fronting the blown trumpets of resurrection lazaruslike at these moments young hearts though full of sap and fire cannot do common nursing labour for the little suckling sentiments and hopes the dreams the languors and the energies hanging about them for nourishment vittorias horizon was within five feet of her she saw neither splendid earth nor ancient heaven nothing save a breach to be stepped over in defiance of foes and what was harder to brave of friends some wayward activity of old associations set her humming a quaint english tune by which she was brought to her consciousness dear friend she said becoming aware that there might be a more troubled depth in ammianis absence of speech than in her own yes said he quickly as for a sentence to follow none came and he continued the signora laura is also your friend she rejoined coldly i am not thinking of her vittoria had tried to utter what might be a word of comfort for him and she found she had not a thought or an emotion here she differed from laura who if the mood to heal a favourites little sore at any season came upon her would shower out lively tendernesses and all cajoleries possible to the tongue of woman yet the irritation of action narrowed laura more than it did vittoria fevered her and distracted her sympathies being herself a plaything at the time she could easily play a part for others vittoria had not grown probably never would grow to be so plastic off the stage she was stringing her hand to strike a blow as men strike and women when they do that cannot be quite feminine how dull the streets are she remarked they are just now said ammiani thinking of them on the night to come convulsed with strife and of her tossed perhaps like a weed along the torrent of bloody deluge waters her step was so firm her face so assured that he could not fancy she realized any prospect of the sort and it filled him with pity and a wretched quailing if i speak now i shall be talking like a coward he said to himself and he was happily too prudent to talk to her in that strain so he said nothing of peace and safety she was almost at liberty to believe that he approved the wisdom of her resolution at the maestros door she thanked him for his escort and begged for it further within an hour and do bring me some chocolate she struck her teeth together champing in a pretty hunger for it i have no chocolate in my pocket and i hardly know myself what will your signor antonio say vittoria filliped her fingers his rule is over and he is my slave i am not his i will not eat much but some some i must have ammiani laughed and promised to obtain it that is if theres any to be had break open doors to get it for me she said stamping with fun to inspirit him no sooner was she standing alone than her elbow was gently plucked at on the other side a voice was sibilating sssignorina she allowed herself to be drawn out of the light of the open doorway having no suspicion and no fear signorina here is chocolate she beheld two hands in cupshape surcharged with packets of turin chocolate lugi it is you the motterone spy screwed his eyelids to an expression of the shrewdest secresy hist signorina take some you shall have all but waitbyandby aha you look at my eyes as you did on the monterone because one of them takes the shoulderview but the truth is my father was a contrabandist and had his eye in his ear when the frontier guard sent a bullet through his back cottonbags and cutleries and all i inherit from him and have been wryeyed ever since how does that touch a mans honesty signorina not at all dont even suspect that you wont appreciate luigi byandby so you wont ask me a word signorina but up you go to the maestrosignorina i swear i am your faithful servant up to the maestro and down first come down first not lastfirst let the other one come down after you and you come down first leave her behind la lazzeruola and here luigi displayed a black veil the common headdress of the milanese women and twisted his fingers round and round on his forehead to personate the horns of the veil take it signorina you know how to wear it luigi and the saints watch over you vittoria found herself left in possession of the veil and a packet of chocolate if i am watched over by the saints and luigi she thought and bit at the chocolate when the door had closed upon her luigi resumed his station near it warily casting his glances along the housefronts and moving his springy little legs like a heathcock alert they carried him sharp to an opposite corner of the street at a noise of some one running exposed to all eyes right down the middle of the road straight to the house in which foolish person he discerned beppo all of whose proceedings luigi observed and commented on from the safe obscurity under eaves and starlight while beppo was in the light of the lamps you thunder at the door my beppo you are a fireballoon you are going to burn yourself up with what you carry you think you can do something because you read books and frequent the talking theatresfourteen syllables to a word mother of heaven will you never learn anything from natural intelligence there you are in at the door and now you will disturb the signorina and you will do nothing but make la lazzeruolas ears lively bounce you are up the stairs bounce you are on the landing thrum you drum at the door and they are singing they dont hear you and now youre meek as a mouse thats itif you dont hit the mark when you go like a bullet you re stupid as lead and they call you a clever fellow luigis day is to come when all have paid him all round they will acknowledge luigis worth you are honest enough my beppo but you might as well be a countryman you are the signorinas servant but i know the turnings said the rat to the cavaliere weazel in a few minutes beppo stepped from the house and flung himself with his back against the lintel of the doorway that looks like determination to stop on guard said luigi he knew the exact feeling expressed by it when one has come violently on an errand and has done no good a flea my feathery lad will set you flying again as it was imperative in luigis schemes that beppo should be set flying again he slipped away stealthily and sped fast into the neighbouring corso where a light english closed carriage drawn by a pair of the island horses moved at a slow pace two men were on the drivers seat one of whom luigi hailed to come down then he laid a strip of paper on his knee and after thumping on the side of his nose to get a notion of englishitalian he wrote with a pencil dancing upon one leg all the while for a balance come beppo daughter sake now at once immediate beppo signor thats to the very extremity how the little signora inglese would write said luigi yet cogitating profoundly in a dubitative twinkle of a second as to whether it might not be the english habit to wind up a hasty missive with an expediting oath he had heard the oath of emphasis in that island but he decided to let it go as it stood the man he had summoned was directed to take it straightway and deliver it to one who would be found at the housedoor of the maestro rocco ricci thus like a drunken sentinel said luigi folding his arms crossing his legs and leaning back forward matteo my cherub all goes right the coachman addressed luigi as honey as butter as a mulberry leaf with a score of worms on it the wine and the bread and the creamcheeses are inside my dainty one are they she must not starve nor must i are our hampers fastened out side good we shall be among the germans in a day and a night i ve got the route and i pronounce the name of the chateau very perfectly schloss sonnenberg do that if you can the unpractised italian coachman declined to attempt it he and luigi compared time by their watches in threequarters of an hour he was to be within hail of the maestros house thither luigi quietly returned beppos place there was vacant thats better than a draught of asti said luigi the lighted windows of the maestros house and the piano striking corrective notes assured him that the special rehearsal was still going on and as he might now calculate on two or three minutes to spare he threw back his coatcollar lifted his head and distended his chest apparently to chime in with the singing but simply to listen to it for him it was imperative that he should act the thing in order to apprehend and appreciate it a hurried footing told of the approach of one whom he expected luigi here padrone you have the chocolate signor antonio i have deposited it in the carriage she is in up there i beheld her entering good that is fixed fact the signor antonio drove at his moustache right and left i give you see italian money and german money german money in paper and a paper written out by me to explain the value of the german papermoney silence engine that you are and not a man i am preventive of stupidity i am do i not know that hein am i in need of the acclamation of you my friend on to the chateau sonnenberg drive on drive on and one who stops you you drive over him the gendarmes in white will peruse this paper if there is any question and will pass you and the cage bowing you hear it is a pass the military pass you when you show this paper my good friend captain weisspriess on the staff of general pierson gives it signed and it is effectual but you lose not the paper put it away with the papermoney quite safe for yourself this is half your payi give you napoleons ten count and nowonce at the chateau sonnenberg i repeat you leave her in charge of two persons one a woman at the gate and then backfrrrrr antoniopericles smacked on the flat of his hand and sounded a rapid course of wheels back and drop not a crumb upon the road you have your map it is after roveredo straight up the adige by bolzano say botzen botz said luigi submissively botzbotzass fool double idiot botzon antoniopericles corrected him furiously exclaiming to the sovereign skies though i pay for brains can i get them no but make a fiasco luigi and not a second ten for you my friend and away out of my sight show yourself no more luigi humbly said that he was not the instrument of a fiasco half spurning him antoniopericles snarled an end both to his advices and his prophetic disgust of the miserable tools furnished unto masterly minds upon this earth he paced forward and back murmuring in french mon dieu was there ever such a folly as in the head of this girl it is her occasionshall i be a star shall i be a cinder it is tomorrow night her moment of birth no she prefers to be extinguished for what for this thing she calls her country it is infamous yes vile little cheat but do you know antoniopericles not yet i will nourish you i will imprison you i will have you tortured by love by the very devil of love by the redhot pincers of love till you scream a music and die to melt him with your voice and kick your country to the gutter and know your italy for a birthplace and a cradle of song and no more and enough bah having thus delivered himself of the effervescence of his internal agitation he turned sharply round upon luigi with a military stamp of the foot and shout of the mans name it is love she wants antoniopericles resumed his savage soliloquy she wants to be kindled on fire too much government of brain not sufficient insurrection of heart there it is there it lies but little fool you shall find people with arms and shots and cannon running all up and down your body firing and crying out victory for love till you are beaten till you gasp love love love and then comes a beatificoh a heaven and a hell to your voice i will pay the excited connoisseur pursued more deliberately i will pay half my fortune to bring this about i am fortified for i know such a voice was sent to be sublime he exclaimed in an ecstasy it opens the skies and immediately appended it is destined to suffocate the theatres pausing as before a splendid vision moneylet it go like dust i have an object sandra belloniyou stupid vittoria campai have millions and the whole austrian government to back me and you to be wilful little rebel i could laugh it is only love you want your voice is now in a marble chamber i will put it in a palace of cedarwood this ammiani i let visit you in the hope that he would touch you bah he is a patriotnot a man he cannot make you wince and pine and be cold and be hot andbah i give a chance to some one else who is not a patriot he has done mischief with the inflammable little anna von lenkensteini know it your proper lovers you women are the broad the business lovers and weisspriess is your man antoniopericles glanced up at the maestros windows hark it is her voice he said and drew up his clenched fists with rage as if pumping cold as ice not a flaw she is a lantern with no light in it crystal if you like hark now at irma the storkneck aie what a long way it is from your throat to your head mademoiselle irma you were reared upon lemons the split hair of your mural crown is not thinner than that voice of yours it is a mockery to hear you but you are good enough for the people my dear and you do work running up and down that ladder of wires between your throat and your headyou work it is true you puss sleek as a puss bony as a puss musical as a puss but you are good enough for the people hola this exclamation was addressed to a cavalier who was dismounting from his horse about fifty yards down the street and who giving the reins to a mounted servant advanced to meet the signor antonio it is you herr captain von weisspriess when he makes an appointment you see him as a rule my dear pericles returned the captain you are out of uniformgood we will go up remember you are a connoisseur from bonnfrom berlinfrom leipsic not of the kk army abjure it or you make no way with this mad thing you shall see her and hear her and judge if she is worth your visit to schloss sonnenberg and a short siege good we go aloft you bow to the maestro respectfully twice as in duty then a third time as from a whisper of your soul vanitas vanitatis you speak of the ut de poitrine you remark albrechtsberger has said and you slap your head and stop they think he is polite and will not quote a german authority to us and they think he will not continue his quotation in truth he scornfully considers it superfluous to talk of counterpoint to us poor italians your christian name is johannyou are herr johannes look at her well i shall not expose you longer than ten minutes to their observation frown meditative the elbow propped and two fingers in the left cheek and walk into the room with a stoop touch a note of the piano leaning your ear to it as in detection of fivefifteenths of a shade of discord frown in trouble as of a tooth so when you smile it is immense praise to them and easy for you the names of the signor antoniopericles and herr johannes were taken up to the maestro tormented with curiosity luigi saw them enter the house the face and the martial or sanguinary reputation of captain weisspriess were not unknown to him what has he to do with this affair thought luigi and sauntered down to the captains servant who accepted a cigar from him but was rendered incorruptible by ignorance of his language he observed that the horses were fresh and were furnished with saddlebags as for an expedition what expedition to serve as escort to the carriagea nonsensical idea but the discovery that an idea is nonsensical is not a satisfactory solution of a difficulty luigi squatted on his haunches beside the doorstep a little under one of the lower windows of rocco riccis house earlier than he expected the captain and signor antonio came out and as soon as the door had closed behind them the captain exclaimed i give you my hand on it my brave pericles you have done me many services but this is finest of all shes superb shes a nice little wild woman to tame i shall go to the sonnenberg immediately i have only to tell general pierson that his nephew is to be prevented from playing the fool and i get leave at once if theres no active work his nephew lieutenant pierson or polehein interposed the greek that s the man he s on the marshals staff he s engaged to the countess lena von lenkenstein she has fire enough my pericles the countess anna you say the greek stretched forward his ear and was never so near getting it vigorously cuffed deafness is an unpardonable offence my dear pericles antoniopericles sniffed and assented it is the stupidity of the ear i said the countess lena von lenkenstein but i choose to be further deaf to the devil sir do you pretend to be angry cried weisspriess the devil sir with your recommendation is too black for me to visit him antoniopericles rejoined by heaven pericles for less than what you allow yourself to say ive sent men to him howling they faced one another pulling at their moustachios weisspriess laughed youre not a fighting man pericles the greek nodded affably one is in my way i have him put out of my way it is easiest ah easiest is it captain weisspriess frowned meditative over this remarkable statement of a system well it certainly saves trouble besides my good pericles none but an ass would quarrel with you i was observing that general pierson wants his nephew to marry the countess lena immediately and if as you tell me this girl belloni who is called la vittoriathe precious little womanhas such power over him its quite as well from the generals point of view that she should be out of the way at sonnenberg i have my footing at the duchess of graaths i believe she hopes that i shall some day challenge and kill her husband and as i am supposed to have saved major de pyrmonts life i am also an object of present gratitude do you imagine that your little browneyed belloni scented one of her enemies in me i know nothing of imagination the signor antonio observed frigidly till we meet captain weisspriess kissed his fingers half as up toward the windows and half to the greek save me from having to teach love to your irma he ran to join his servant luigi had heard much of the conversation as well as the last sentence it shall be to la irma if it is to anybody luigi muttered let weisspriesshe will not awake love in herlet him kindle hate it will do said the signor antonio she has seen him and if he meets her on the route to meran she will think it her fascination looking at his watch and at the lighted windows he repeated his special injunctions to luigi it is near the time i go to sleep i am getting old i grow nervous tentwenty in addition you shall have if all is done right your weekly pay runs on twentyyou shall have thirty thirty napoleons additional ten fingers were flashed thrice luigi gave a jump padrone they are mine animal that shake your bellybag and brainbox stand cried the greek who desired to see luigi standing firm that he might inspire himself with confidence in his integrity when luigis posture had satisfied him he turned and went off at great strides he does pay luigi reflected seeing that immense virtue in his patron yes he pays but what is he about it is this question for medo i serve my hand or do i serve my heart my hand takes the money and it is not german money my heart gives the affection and the signorina has my heart she reached me that cigarette on the motterone like the madonna it is never to be forgotten i serve my heart now beppo you may come come quick for her i see the carriage and there are three stout fellows in it who could trip and muzzle you at a signal from me before you could count the letters of your fathers baptismal name oh but if the signorina disobeys me and comes out lastthe signor antonio will ask the maestro who will say yes la vittoria was here with me last of the two and i lose my ten my twenty my thirty napoleons luigis chest expanded largely with a melancholy draught of air the carriage meantime had become visible at the head of the street where it remained within hearing of a whistle one of the milanese hired vehicles drove up to the maestros door shortly after and luigi cursed it his worst fears for the future of the thirty napoleons were confirmed the door opened and the maestro rocco ricci bareheaded and in his black silk dressinggown led out irma di karski by some called rival to la vittoria a tall slavic damsel whose laughter was not soft and smooth whose cheeks were bright and whose eyes were deep in the head and dull but she had vivacity both of lips and shoulders the shoulders were bony the lips were sharp and red like winterberries in the morningtime freshness was not absent from her aspect the critical objection was that it seemed a plastered freshness and not true bloom or rather it was a savage and a hard not a sweet freshness hence perhaps the name which distinguished her la lazzeruola crab apple it was a freshness that did not invite the bite sour to italian taste she was apparently in vast delight there will be a perfect inundation tomorrow night from prague and vienna to see me even in so miserable a part as michiella she said here i am supposed to be a beginner i am no debutante there i can believe it i can believe it responded rocco bowing for her speedy departure you are not satisfied with my singing of michiellas score now tell me kind good harsh old master you think that miss vittoria would sing it better so do i and i can sing another part better you do not know my capacities i am sure there is nothing you would not attempt said rocco bowing resignedly there never was question of my courage yes but courage courage away with your courage rocco was spurred by his personal grievances against her in a manner to make him forget his desire to be rid of her your courage sets you flying at once at every fioritura and bravura passage to subdue not to learn not to accomplish but to conquer it and the ability let me say is not in proportion to the courage which is probably too great to be easily equalled but you have the opportunity to make your part celebrated tomorrow night if as you tell me the house is to be packed with viennese and signorina you let your hair down the hair of irma di karski was of singular beauty and so dear to her that the allusion to the triumphant feature of her person passed off roccos irony in sugar addio i shall astonish you before many hours have gone by she said and this time they bowed together and the maestro tripped back hurriedly and shut his door luigis astonishment eclipsed his chagrin when he beheld the lady step from her place bidding the driver move away as if he carried a freight and indicating a position for him at the end of the street with an imperative sway and deflection of her hand luigi heard the clear thin sound of a key dropped to her from one of the upper windows she was quick to seize it the door opened stealthily to her and she passed out of sight without casting a look behind thats a woman going to discover a secret if she can remarked the observer meaning that he considered the sex bad generals save when they have occasion to preserve themselves secret then they look behind them carefully enough the situation was one of stringent torment to a professional and natural spy luigi lost count of minutes in his irritation at the mystery which he took as a personal offence some suspicion or wariness existed in the lighted room for the maestro threw up a window and inspected the street to right and left apparently satisfied he withdrew his head and the window was closed in a little while vittorias voice rose audible out of the stillness though she restrained its volume its effect upon luigi was to make him protest to her whimpering with pathos as if she heard and must be melted signorina signorina most dear for charitys sake i am one of you i am a patriot every man to his trade but my heart is all with you and so on louder by fits in a running murmur like one having his conscience ransacked from which he was diverted by a sidethought of irma di karski la lazzeruola listening taking poison in at her ears for luigi had no hesitation in ascribing her behaviour to jealousy does not that note drive through your bosom excellent lady i can fancy the tremble going all down your legs you are poisoned with honey how you hate it if you only had a dagger vittoria sang but for a short space simultaneously with the cessation of her song ammiani reached the door but had scarcely taken his stand there when catching sight of luigi he crossed the street and recognizing him questioned him sternly as to his business opposite the maestros house luigi pointed to a female figure emerging see take her home he said ammiani released him and crossed back hurriedly when smiting his forehead luigi cried in despair thirty napoleons and my professional reputation lost he blew a whistle the carriage dashed down from the head of the street while ammiani was following the swiftlystepping figure in wonderment knowing it could not be vittoria yet supposing it must be without any clear aim of his wits the carriage drew up a little in advance of her three menmen of bulk and sinew jumped from it one threw himself upon ammiani the others grasped the affrighted lady tightening a veil over her face and the carriage door shut sharp upon her ammianis assailant then fell away luigi flung himself on the box and shouted the signorina is behind you and ammiani beheld vittoria standing in alarm too joyful to know that it was she in the spasm of joy he kissed her hands before they could intercommunicate intelligibly the carriage was out of their sight going at a gallop along the eastern strada of the circumvallation of the city chapter xv ammiani through the midnight ammiani hurried vittoria out of the street to make safety sure home she said ashamed of her excitement and not daring to speak more words lest the heart in her throat should betray itself he saw what the fright had done for her perhaps also he guessed that she was trying to conceal her fancied cowardice from him i have kissed her hands he thought and the memory of it was a song of tenderness in his blood by the way vittorias dwellingplace was near the duomo in a narrow thoroughfare leading from the duomo to the piazza of la scala where a confectioner of local fame conferred upon the happier members of the population most piquant bocconi and tartlets and offered by placard to give an emotion to the nobility the literati and the epicures of milan and to all foreigners if the aforesaid would adventure upon a trial of his art meanwhile he let lodgings it was in the house of this famous confectioner zotti that vittoria and her mother had lived after leaving england for italy as vittoria came under the fretted shadow of the cathedral she perceived her mother standing with zotti at the house door though the night was far advanced she laughed and walked less hurriedly ammiani now asked her if she had been alarmed not alarmed she said but a little more nervous than i thought i should be he was spared from putting any further question by her telling him that luigi the motterone spy had in all probability done her a service in turning one or other f the machinations of the signor antonio my madman she called this latter he has got his irma instead of me we shall have to supply her place tomorrow she is travelling rapidly and on my behalf i think signor carlo you would do well by going to the maestro when you leave me and telling him that irma has been caught into the skies say jealous that earth should possess such overpowering loveliness or attracted in spite of themselves by that combination of genius and beauty which is found united nowhere but in irma the spirits of heaven determined to rob earth of her lazzeruola only tell it to him seriously for my dear rocco will have to work with one of the singers all day and i ought to be at hand by them to help her if i dared stir out what do you think ammiani pronounced his opinion that it would be perilous for her to go abroad i shall in truth i fear have a difficulty in getting to la scala unseen she said except that we are cunning people in our house we not only practise singing and invent wonderful confectionery but we do conjuring tricks we profess to be able to deceive anybody whom we please do the dupes enlist in a regiment said ammiani with an intonation that professed his readiness to serve as a recruit his humour striking with hers they smiled together in the bright fashion of young people who can lose themselves in a ray of fancy at any season vittoria heard her mothers wailful voice twenty gnats in one she said ammiani whispered quickly to know whether she had decided for the morrow she nodded and ran up to her mother who cried at this hour and beppo has been here after you and he told me i wrote for him in italian when not a word can i put to paper i wouldntand you are threatened by dreadful dangers he declares his behaviour was mad they are all mad over in this country i believe i have put the last stitch to your dress there is a letter or two upstairs for you always letters my dear good zotti vittoria turned to the artist in condiments you must insist upon my mother going to bed at her proper time when i am out signorina rejoined zotti a fat little roundheaded man with vivacious starting brown eyes i have only to tell her to do a thing i pull a dog by the collar be it said with reverence however i am very glad to see you both such good friends yes signorina we are good friends till we quarrel again i regret to observe to you that the respectable lady is incurably suspicious of me zotti mother of heaven it is you that are suspicious of me sir retorted madame of me of all persons its tell me this tell me that all day with you and because i cant answer you are angry behold the signora speaks english we have quarrelled again said zotti my mother thinks him a perfect web of plots vittoria explained the case between them laughing to ammiani and zotti is persuaded that she is an inveterate schemer they are both entirely innocent only they are both excessively timid out of that it grows the pair dramatized her outline on the instant did i not see him speak to an english lady and he will not tell me a word about it though shes my own countrywoman is it not true that she received two letters this afternoon and still does she pretend to be ignorant of what is going on happily said vittoria my mother is not a widow or these quarrels might some day end in a fearful reconciliation my child her mother whimpered you know what these autumn nights are in this country as sure as you live emilia you will catch cold and then youre like a shop with shutters up for the dead at the same time zotti whispered signorina i have kept the minestra hot for your supper come in come in and little things little dainty bitsdo you live in zottis house for nothing sweetest delicacies that make the tongue run a streamjust notions of a tastethe palate smacks and forgets the soul seizes and remembers oh such seductions vittoria exclaimed it is zotti pursued his idea with fingers picturesquely twirling in a spiderlike distension it is like the damned and they have but a crumb of a chance of paradise and down swoops st peter and has them in the gates fast you are worthy of all that a man can do for you signorina let him study let him work let him inventyou are worthy of all i hope i am not too hungry to discriminate zotti i see monte rosa signorina you are pleased to say so when you are famishing it is because the enthusiastic confectioner looked deep and oblique as one who combined a remarkable subtlety of insight with profound reflection it is because the lighter you get the higher you mount up like an eagle of the peaks but well give that hungry fellow a fall a dish of hot minestra shoots him dead then a tart of pistachios and chocolate and creamand my head to him who shall reveal to me the flavouring when i wake in the morning i shall have lived a month or two in arabia zotti tell me no more i will come in said vittoria then signorina a little crisp filbertbiscuita composition you crack it and a surprise and then and then my dish zottis dish that is not yet christened signorina let italy rise first the great inventor of the dish winked and nodded temperately let her rise a battle or a treaty will do i have two or three original conceptions compositions that only wait for some brilliant feat of arms or a diplomatic triumph and i send them forth baptized vittoria threw large eyes upon ammiani and set the underlids humorously quivering she kissed her fingers addio a rivederla he bowed formally he was startled to find the golden thread of their companionship cut with such cruel abruptness but it was cut the door had closed on her the moment it had closed she passed into his imagination by what charm had she allayed the fever of his anxiety her naturalness had perforce given him assurance that peace must surround one in whom it shone so steadily and smiling at the thought of zottis repast and her twinkle of subdued humour he walked away comforted which for a lover in the season of peril means exalted as in a sudden conflagration of the dry stock of his intelligence she must have some great faith in her heart he thought no longer attributing his exclusion from it to a lovers rivalry which will show that more than imagination was on fire within him for when the soul of a youth can be heated above common heat the vices of passion shrivel up and aid the purer flame it was well for ammiani that he did perceive dimly though it was perceived the force of idealistic inspiration by which vittoria was supported he saw it at this one moment and it struck a light to light him in many subsequent perplexities it was something he had never seen before he had read tuscan poetry to her in old agostinos rooms he had spoken of secret preparations for the revolt he had declaimed upon italythe poetry was good though the declamation may have been badbut she had always been singularly irresponsive with a practical turn for ciphers a quick reckoning a sharp display of figures in italys cause kindled her cheeks and took her breath ammiani now understood that there lay an unspoken depth in her distinct from her visible nature he had first an interview with rocco ricci whom he prepared to replace irma his way was then to the office of his journal where he expected to be greeted by two members of the polizia who would desire him to march before the central bureau and exhibit proofs of articles and the items of news for inspection for correction haply and possibly for approval there is a partial delight in the contemplated submission to an act of servitude for the last time ammiani stepped in with combative gaiety but his stiff glance encountered no enemy this astonished him he turned back into the street and meditated the popes mouth might he thought hold the key to the riddle it is not always most comfortable for a conspirator to find himself unsuspected he reads the blank significantly it looked ill that the authorities should allow anything whatsoever to be printed on such a morrow especially ill if they were on the alert the neighbourhood by the popes mouth was desolate under dark starlight ammiani got his fingers into the opening behind the rubbish of brick and tore them on six teeth of a saw that had been fixed therein those teeth were as voluble to him as loud tongues the mouth was empty of any shred of paper they meant that the enemy was ready to bite and that the conspiracy had ceased to be active he perceived that a stripped ivytwig with the leaves scattered around it stretched at his feet that was another and corroborative sign clearer to him than printed capitals the reading of it declared that the revolt had collapsed he wound and unwound his handkerchief about his fingers mechanically great curses were in his throat i would start for south america at dawn but for her he said the country of bolivar still had its attractions for italian youth for a certain space ammianis soul was black with passion he was the son of that fiery paolo ammiani who had cast his glove at eugenes feet and bade the viceroy deliver it to his french master the general was preparing to break his sword on his knee when eugene rushed up to him and kissed him carlo was of this blood englishmen will hardly forgive him for having tears in his eyes but italians follow the greek classical prescription for the emotions while we take example by the roman there is no sneer due from us he sobbed it seemed that a country was lost ammiani had moved away slowly he was accidentally the witness of a curious scene there came into the irregular triangle and walking up to where the fruitstalls stood by day a woman and a man the man was an austrian soldier it was an italian woman by his side the sight of the couple was just then like an incestuous horror to ammiani she led the soldier straight up to the mouth directing his hand to it and what was far more wonderful directing it so that he drew forth a packet of papers from where ammiani had found none ammiani could see the light of them in his hand the austrian snatched an embrace and ran ammiani was moving over to her to seize and denounce the traitress when he beheld another figure like an apparition by her side but this one was not a whitecoat had it risen from the earth it was earthy for a cloud of dust was about it and the woman gave a stifled scream barto barto she cried pressing upon her eyelids a strong husky laugh came from him he tapped her shoulder heartily and his ha ha rang in the night air you never trust me she whimpered from shaken nerves he called her brave little woman rare girl but you never trust me do i not lay traps to praise you you make a woman try to deceive you if she could if only she could ammiani was up with them you are barto rizzo he spoke half leaning over the man in his impetuosity barto stole a defensive rearward step the thin light of dawn had in a moment divided the extreme starry darkness and ammiani who knew his face had not to ask a second time it was scored by a recent swordcut he glanced at the woman saw that she was handsome it was enough he knew she must be bartos wife and if not more cunning than barto his accomplice his instrument his slave five minutes ago i would have sworn you were a traitress he said to her she was expressionless as if she had heard nothing which fact considering that she was very handsome seemed remarkable to the young man youth will not believe that stupidity and beauty can go together she is the favourite pupil of bartolommeo rizzo signor carlo ammiani quoth barto having quite regained his composure she is my pretty puppetpatriot i am not in the habit of exhibiting her but since you see her there she is barto had fallen into the southern habit of assuming ease in quasi rhetorical sentences but with wary eyes over them the peculiar contracting owllike twinkle defied ammianis efforts to penetrate his look so he took counsel of his anger and spoke bluntly she does your work much of it signor carlo as the bullet does the work of the rifle beast was it your wife who pinned the butterfly to the signorina vittorias dress signor carlo ammiani you are the son of paolo the general you call me beast i have dandled you in my arms my little lad while the bands played theres yet a heart in italy do you remember it barto sang out halfadozen bars you call me beast im the one man in milan who can sing you that beast or man devil or whatever you are cried ammiani feeling nevertheless oddly unnerved you have committed a shameful offence you or the woman your wife who serves you as i see you have thwarted the best of plots you have dared to act in defiance of your chief eyes to him barto interposed touching over his eyeballs and you have thrown your accursed stupid suspicions on the signorina vittoria you are a mad fool if i had the power i would order you to be shot at five this morning and that s the last rising of the light you should behold why did you do it dont turn your hellish eyes in upon one another but answer at once why did you do it the signorina vittoria returned bartohis articulation came forth serpentlikeshe is not a spy you think she has been in england i have been in england she writes i can read she is a thing of whims shall she hold the goblet of italy in her hand till it overflows she writes loveletters to an english whitecoat i have read them who bids her write her whim she warns her friends not to enter milan she whose puppet is she not yours not mine she is the puppet of an english austrian barto drew back for ammiani was advancing what is it you mean he cried i mean said ammiani still moving on him i mean to drag you first before count medole and next before the signorina and you shall abjure your slander in her presence after that i shall deal with you mark me i have you i am swifter on foot and i am stronger come quietly barto smiled in grim contempt keep your foot fast on that stone youre a prisoner he replied and seeing ammiani coming net him my slingstone my serpent he signalled to his wife who threw herself right round ammiani in a tortuous twist hard as wirerope stung with irritation and a sense of disgrace and ridicule and pitifulness in one ammiani after a struggle ceased the attempt to disentwine her arms and dragged her clinging to him he was much struck by hearing her count deliberately in her desperation numbers from somewhere about twenty to one hundred one hundred was evidently the number she had to complete for when she had reached it she threw her arms apart barto was out of sight ammiani waved her on to follow in his steps he was sick of her presence and had the sensations of a shamefaced boy whom a girl has kissed she went without uttering a word the dawn had now traversed the length of the streets and thrown open the wide spaces of the city ammiani found himself singing theres yet a heart in italy but it was hardly the song of his own heart he slept that night on a chair in the private room of his office preferring not to go to his mothers house there s yet a heart in italy was on his lips when he awoke with scattered sensations all of which collected in revulsion against the song theres a very poor heart in italy he said while getting his person into decent order its like the bell in the lunatics tower between venice and the lido it beats now and then for meals hangs like a carrionlump in the vultures beak meanwhile these and some other similar sentiments and a heat about the brows whenever he set them frowning over what barto had communicated concerning an english austrian assured ammiani that he had no proper command of himself or was as the doctors would have told him bilious it seemed to him that he must have dreamed of meeting the dark and subtle barto rizzo overnight on realizing that fact he could not realize how the man had escaped him except that when he thought over it he breathed deep and shook his shoulders the mind will as you may know sometimes refuse to work when the sensations are shameful and astonished he despatched a messenger with a good morrow to his mother and then went to a fencingsaloon that was fitted up in the house of count medole where among two or three there was the ordinary shrugging talk of the collapse of the projected outbreak bitter to hear luciano romara came in and ammiani challenged him to smallsword and broadsword both being ireful to boiling point and mad to strike at something they attacked one another furiously though they were dear friends and the helmet wires and the padding rattled and smoked to the thumps for half an hour they held on to it when their blood being up they flashed upon the men present including the count crying shame to them for letting a woman alone be faithful to her task that night the blood forsook count medoles cheeks leaving its dead hue as when blottingpaper is laid on runningink he deliberately took a pair of foils and offering the handle of one to ammiani broke the button off the end of his own and stood to face an adversary ammiani followed the example a streak of crimson was on his shirtsleeve and his eyes had got their hard black look as of the flintstone before romara in amazement discovered the couple to be at it in all purity of intention on the sharp edge of the abyss he knocked up their weapons and stood between them puffing his cigarette leisurely i fine you both he said he touched ammianis swordarm nodded with satisfaction to find that there was no hurt and cried you have an austrian out on the ground by this time tomorrow morning so according to the decree captain weisspriess is in the city was remarked there are a dozen on the list said little pietro cardi drawing out a paper if you are to be doing nothing else tomorrow morning added leone rufo we may as well march out the whole dozen these two were boys under twenty shall it be the first hit for captain weisspriess count medole said this while handing a fresh and fairlybuttoned foil to ammiani romara laughed you will require to fence the round of milan city my dear count to win a claim to captain weisspriess in the first place i yield him to no man who does not show himself a better man than i its the point upon which i dont pay compliments count medole bowed but if you want occupation added luciano closing his speech with a merely interrogative tone i scarcely want that as those who know me will tell you said medole so humbly that those who knew him felt that he had risen to his high seat of intellectual contempt he could indulge himself having shown his courage certainly not if you are devising means of subsistence for the widows and orphans of the men who will straggle out to be slaughtered tonight said luciano you have occupation in that case i will do my best to provide for themthe count persisted in his air of humility though it is a question with some whether idiots should live he paused effectively and sucked in a soft smile of self approbation at the stroke then he pursued we meet the day after tomorrow the popes mouth is closed we meet here at nine in the morning the next day at eleven at faruginos the barbers in monza the day following at camerlata at eleven likewise those who attend will be made aware of the dispositions for the week and the day we shall name for the rising it is known to you all that without affixing a stigma on our new primadonna we exclude her from any share in this business all the heads have been warned that we yield this night to the austrians gentlemen i cannot be more explicit i wish that i could please you better oh by all means said pietro cardi but patience is the pestilence i shall roam in quest of adventure another quiet week is a tremendous trial he crossed foils with leone rufo but finding no stop to the drawn swish of the steel he examined the end of his weapon with a lengthening visage for it was buttonless ammiani burst into laughter at the spontaneous boyishness in the faces of the pair of ambitious lads they both offered him one of the rapiers upon equal terms count medoles example of intemperate vanity was spoiling them you know my opinion ammiani said to the count i told you last night and i tell you again today that barto rizzo is guilty of gross misconduct and that you must plead the same to a sort of excuseable treason count medole you cannot wind and unwind a conspiracy like a watch who is the head of this one it is the man barto rizzo he took proceedings before he got you to sanction them you may be the vessel but he commands or at least he steers it the count waited undemonstratively until ammiani had come to an end you speak my good ammiani with an energy that does you credit he said considering that it is not in your own interest but another persons remember i can bear to have such a word as treason ascribed to my acts fresh visitors more or less mixed in the conspiracy and generally willing to leave the management of it to count medole now entered the saloon these were count rasati angelo dovili a piedmontese general a tuscan duke and one or two aristocratic notabilities and historic nobodies they were hostile to the chief whom luciano and carlo revered and obeyed the former lit a cigarette and saying to his friend do you breakfast with your mother i will come too slipped his hand on ammianis arm they walked out indolently together with the smallest shade of an appearance of tolerating scorn for those whom they left behind medole has money and rank and influence and a kind of idontknowwhat womanishness that makes him push like a needle for the lead and he will have the lead and when he has got the lead there s the last chapter of him said luciano his point of ambition is the perch of the weather cock why did he set upon you my carlo i saw the big v running up your forehead when you faced him if you had finished him no great harm would have been done i saw him for a short time last night and spoke to him in my fathers style said carlo the reason was that he defended barto rizzo for putting the ring about the signorina vittorias name and causing the black butterfly to be pinned to her dress lucianos brows stood up if she sings tonight depend upon it there will be a disturbance he said there may be a rising in spite of medole and such poor sparks whore afraid to drop on powder and twirl and dance till the wind blows them out and mind the chance rising is commonly the luckiest if i get a command i march to the alps we must have the passes of the tyrol it seems to me that whoever holds the alps must ride the lombard mare you spring booted and spurred into the saddle from the alps carlo was hurt by his friends indifference to the base injury done to vittoria i have told medole that she will sing tonight in spite of him he was saying with the intention of bringing round some reproach upon luciano for his want of noble sympathy when the crash of an austrian regimental band was heard coming up the corso it stirred him to love his friend with all his warmth at any rate for my sake luciano you will respect and uphold her yes while shes true said luciano unsatisfactorily the regiment in review uniform followed by two pieces of artillery passed by then came a squadron of hussars and one of uhlans and another foot regiment more artillery fresh cavalry carlo if three generations of us pour out our blood to fertilize italian ground its not too much to pay to chase those drilled curs luciano spoke in vehement undertone we ll breakfast and have a look at them in the piazza darmi and show that we milanese are impressed with a proper idea of their power said carlo brightening as he felt the correction of his morbid lovers anger in lucianos reaching view of their duties as italian citizens the heat and whirl of the hour struck his head for tomorrow they might be wrestling with that living engine which had marched past and surely all the hate he could muster should be turned upon the outer enemy he gained his mothers residence with clearer feelings chapter xvi countess ammiani countess ammiani was a venetian lady of a famous house the name of which is as a trumpet sounding from the inner pages of the republic her face was like a leaf torn from an antique volume the hereditary features told the story of her days the face was sallow and fireless life had faded like a painted cloth upon the imperishable moulding she had neither fire in her eyes nor colour on her skin the thin close multitudinous wrinkles ran up accurately ruled from the chin to the foreheads centre and touched faintly once or twice beyond as you observe the ocean ripples run in threads confused to smoothness within a space of the grey horizon sky but the chin was firm the mouth and nose were firm the forehead sat calmly above these shows of decay it was a most noble face a fortress face strong and massive and honourable in ruin though stripped of every flower this lady in her girlhood had been the one lamb of the family dedicated to heaven paolo the general her lover had wrenched her from that fate to share with him a life of turbulent sorrows till she should behold the blood upon his grave she like laura fiaveni had bent her head above a slaughtered husband but unlike laura marcellina ammiani had not buried her heart with him her heart and all her energies had been his while he lived from the visage of death it turned to her son she had accepted the passion for italy from paolo she shared it with carlo italian girls of that period had as little passion of their own as flowers kept out of sunlight have hues she had given her son to her country with that intensely apprehensive foresight of a mothers love which runs quick as eastern light from the fervour of the devotion to the remote realization of the hour of the sacrifice seeing both in one other forms of love devotion in other bosoms may be deluded but hers will not be she sees the sunset in the breast of the springing dawn often her son carlo stood a ghost in her sight with this haunting prophetic vision it was only a mother who was at the same time a supremely noble woman that could feel all human to him notwithstanding her heart beat thick and fast when carlo and luciano entered the morning room where she sat and stopped to salute her in turn well she said without betraying anxiety or playing at carelessness carlo answered let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die i think thats the language of peaceful men you are to be peaceful men tomorrow my carlo the thing is in count medoles hands said luciano and he is constitutionally of our agostinos opinion that we are bound to wait till the gods kick us into action and as agostino says medole has raised himself upon our shoulders so as to be the more susceptible to their wishes when they blow a gale he informed her of the momentary thwarting of the conspiracy and won carlos gratitude by not speaking of the suspicion which had fallen on vittoria medole he said has the principal conduct of the business in milan as you know countess our chief cannot be everywhere at once so medole undertakes to decide for him here in old milan he decided yesterday afternoon to put off our holiday for what he calls a week checco the idiot in whom he confides gave me the paper signifying the fact at four oclock there was no appeal for we can get no place of general meeting under medoles prudent management he fears our being swallowed in a body if we all meet the news sent her heart sinking in short throbs down to a delicious rest but countess ammiani disdained to be servile to the pleasure even as she had strengthened herself to endure the shocks of pain it was a conquered heart that she and every venetian and lombard mother had to carry one that played its tune according to its nature shaping no action sporting no mask if you know what is meant by that phrase a conquered heart you will at least respect them whom you call weak women for having gone through the harshest schooling which this world can show example of in such mothers italy revived the pangs and the martyrdom were theirs fathers could march to the field or to the grey glacis with their boys there was no intoxication of hot blood to cheer those who sat at home watching the rise and fall of trembling scales which said life or death for their dearest their least shadowy hope could be but a shrouded contentment in prospect a shrouded submission in feeling what bloom of hope was there when austria stood like an iron wall and their own ones dashing against it were as little feeble waves that left a red mark and no more but duty to their country had become their religion sacrifice they accepted as their portion when the last stern evil befell them they clad themselves in a veil and walked upon an earth they had passed from for all purposes save service of hands italy revived in these mothers their torture was that of the reanimation of her frame from the deathtrance carlo and luciano fell hungrily upon dishes of herbflavoured cutlets and neapolitan maccaroni green figs green and red slices of melon chocolate and a dry red florentine wine the countess let them eat and then gave her son a letter that been delivered at her door an hour back by the confectioner zotti it proved to be an enclosure of a letter addressed to vittoria by the chief genoa was its superscription from that place it was forwarded by running relays of volunteer messengers there were points of italy which the chief could reach fourandtwenty hours in advance of the government with all its aids and machinery vittoria had simply put her initials at the foot of the letter carlo read it eagerly and cast it aside it dealt in ideas and abstract phraseology he could get nothing of it between his impatient teeth he was reduced to a blank wonder at the reason for her sending it on to him it said indeedand so far it seemed to have a meaning for her no backward step we can bear to fall we cannot afford to draw back and again remember that these uprisings are the manifested pulsations of the heart of your country so that none shall say she is a corpse and knowing that she lives none shall say that she deserves not freedom it is the protest of her immortal being against her impious violator evidently the chief had heard nothing of the counterstroke of barto rizzo and of count medoles miserable weakness but how thought carlo how can a mind like vittorias find matter to suit her in such sentences he asked himself the question forgetting that a little time gone by while he was aloof from the tumult and dreaming of it this airy cloudy language and every symbolism had been strong sustaining food a vital atmosphere to him he did not for the moment though by degrees he recovered his last nights conception of her understand that among the noble order of women there is when they plunge into strife a craving for idealistic truths which men are apt under the heat and hurry of their energies to put aside as stars that are meant merely for shining his mother perused the letterholding it out at arms lengthand laid it by luciano likewise countess ammiani was an aristocrat the tone and style of the writing were distasteful to her she allowed her sons judgement of the writer to stand for her own feeling that she could surrender little prejudices in favour of one who appeared to hate the austrians so mortally on the other hand she defended count medole her soul shrank at the thought of the revolution being yielded up to theorists and men calling themselves men of the peoplea class of men to whom paolo her soldierhusbands aversion had always been formidably pronounced it was an old and a wearisome task for carlo to explain to her that the times were changed and the necessities of the hour different since the day when his father conspired and fought for freedom yet he could not gainsay her when she urged that the nobles should be elected to lead if they consented to lead for if they did not lead were they not excluded from the movement i fancy you have defined their patriotism said carlo nay my son but you are one of them indeed my dearest mother that is not what they will tell you because you have chosen to throw yourself into the opposite ranks you perceive that you divide our camp madame my mother for me there is no natural opposition of ranks what are we we are slaves all are slaves while i am a slave shall i boast that i am of noble birth proud of a coronet with gems of paste some one writes save me from that sort of pride i am content to take my patent of nobility for good conduct in the revolution then i will be count or marquis or duke i am not a republican pure bloodbut not till then and in the meantime carlo is composing for his newspaper the countess said to luciano those are the leaders who can lead the latter replied give the men who are born to it the first chance old agostino is rightthe people owe them their vantage ground but when they have been tried and they have failed decapitate them medole looks upon revolution as a description of conjuring trick he shuffles cards and arranges them for a solemn performance but he refuses to cut them if you look too serious or i look too eager for that gives him a suspicion that you know what is going to turn up and his object is above all things to produce a surprise you are both of you unjust to count medole said the countess he imperils more than all of you magnificent estates it is true but of head or of heart not quite so much as some of us said luciano stroking his thick black pendent moustache and chintuft ah pardon me yes he does imperil a finer cocks comb when he sinks and his vanity is cut in two medole will bleed so as to flood his lombard flats it will be worse than death to him carlo said do you know what our agostino says of count medole oh for ever agostino with you young men the countess exclaimed i believe he laughs at you to be sure he does he laughs at all but what he says of count medole holds the truth of the thing and may make you easier concerning the counts estates he says that medole is vaccine matter which the austrians apply to this generation of italians to spare us the terrible disease they will or they wont deal gently with medole byandby but for the present he will be handled tenderly he is useful i wish i could say that we thought so too and now carlo stooped to her and took her hand shall we see you at la scala tonight the countess with her hands lying in his replied i have received an intimation from the authorities that my box is wanted so you claim your right to occupy it that is my very humble protest for personal liberty good i shall be there and shall much enjoy an introduction to the gentleman who disputes it with you besides mother if the signorina vittoria sings countess ammianis gaze fixed upon her son with a level steadiness his voice threatened to be unequal all the pleading force of his eyes was thrown into it as he said she will sing and she gives the signal that is certain we may have to rescue her if i can place her under your charge i shall feel that she is safe and is really protected the countess looked at luciano before she answered yes carlo whatever i can do but you know i have not a scrap of influence let her lie on your bosom my mother is this to be another violetta her name is vittoria said carlo colouring deeply a certain violetta had been his boys passion further distracting austrian bandmusic was going by this time it was a regiment of italians in the white and blue uniform carlo and luciano leaned over the balcony smoking and scanned the marching of their fellowcountrymen in the livery of servitude they dont step badly said one and the other with a smile of melancholy derision said we are all brothers following the italians came a regiment of hungarian grenadiers tall swamfaced and particularly lightlimbed men looking brilliant in the clean tight military array of austria then a squadron of blue hussars and croat regiment after which in the midst of czech dragoons and german uhlans and blue magyar light horsemen with general officers and aides about him the veteran austrian fieldmarshal rode his easy hand and erect figure and goodhumoured smile belying both his age and his reputation among italians artillery and some bravelyclad horse of the eastern frontier possibly serb wound up the procession it gleamed down the length of the corso in a blinding sunlight brass helmets and hussar feathers white and violet surcoats green plumes maroon capes bright steel scabbards bayonetpointsas gallant a show as some portentouslymagnified summer field flowing with the wind might be and over all the banner of austriathe black doubleheaded eagle ramping on a yellow ground this was the flower of iron meaning on such a field the two young men held their peace countess ammiani had pushed her chair back into a dark corner of the room and was sitting there when they looked back like a sombre figure of black marble chapter xvii in the piazza darmi carlo and luciano followed the regiments to the piazza darmi drawn after them by that irresistible attraction to youths who have as yet had no shroud of grief woven for themdesire to observe the aspect of a brilliant foe the piazza darmi was the field of mars of milan and an austrian review of arms there used to be a tropical pageant the place was too narrow for broad manoeuvres or for much more than to furnish an inspection of all arms to the general and a display with its meaning to the populace an unusually large concourse of spectators lined the square like a black border to a vast bed of flowers nodding now this way now that carlo and luciano passed among the groups presenting the perfectly smooth faces of young men of fashion according to the universal aristocratic pattern handed down to querulous mortals from olympusthe secret of which is to show a triumphant inaction of the heart and the brain that are rendered positively subservient to elegance of limb they knew the chances were in favour of their being arrested at any instant none of the higher members of the milanese aristocracy were visible the people looked sullen carlo was attracted by the tall figure of the signor antoniopericles whom he beheld in converse with the commandant of the citadel out in the square among chatting and laughing general officers at carlos elbow there came a burst of english tongues he heard vittorias english name spoken with animation admire those faces he said to luciano but the latter was interchanging quiet recognitions among various heads of the crowd a language of the eyelids and the eyebrows when he did look round he admired the fair island faces with an italians ardour their women are splendid and he no longer pushed upon carlos arm to make way ahead in the english group were two sunnyhaired girls and a blueeyed lady with the famous english curls full and rounding richly this lady talked of her brother and pointed him out as he rode down the line in the marshals staff the young officer indicated presently broke away and galloped up to her bending over his horses neck to join the conversation emilia bellonis name was mentioned he stared and appeared to insist upon a contrary statement carlo scrutinized his features while doing so he was accosted and beheld his former adversary of the motterone with whom he had yesterday shaken hands in the piazza of la scala the ceremony was cordially renewed luciano unlinked his arm from carlo and left him it appears that you are mistaken with reference to mademoiselle belloni said captain gambier we hear on positive authority that she will not appear at la scala tonight its a disappointment though from what you did me the honour to hint to me i cannot allow myself to regret it carlo had a passionate inward prompting to trust this englishman with the secret it was a weakness that he checked when one really takes to foreigners there is a peculiar impulse i speak of the people who are accessible to impulse to make brothers of them he bowed and said she does not appear she has in fact quitted milan not willingly i would have stopped the business if i had known anything of it but she is better out of the way and will be carefully looked after where she is by this time she is in the tyrol and where asked carlo with friendly interest at a schloss near meran or she will be there in a very few hours i fearedi may inform you that we were very good friends in england i feared that when she once came to italy she would get into political scrapes i dare say you agree with me that women have nothing to do with politics observe you see the lady who is speaking to the austrian officerhe is her brother like mademoiselle belloni he has adopted a fresh name its the name of his uncle a general pierson in the austrian service i knew him in england he has been in our service mademoiselle belloni lived with his sisters for some years two or three as you may suppose they are all anxious to see her shall i introduce you they will be glad to know one of her italian friends carlo hesitated he longed to hear those ladies talk of vittoria do they speak french oh dear yes that is as we luckless english people speak it perhaps you will more easily pardon their seminary italian see there captain gambier pointed at some trotting squadrons these austrians have certainly a matchless cavalry the artillery seems good the infantry are fine menvery fine men they have a woodeny movement but thats in the nature of the case tremendous discipline alone gives homogeneity to all those nationalities somehow they get beaten i doubt whether anything will beat their cavalry they are useless in streetfighting said carlo oh streetfighting captain gambier vented a soldiers disgust at the notion theyre not in paris will you step forward just then the tall greek approached the party of english the introduction was delayed he was addressed by the fair lady in the island tongue as mr pericles she thanked him for his extreme condescension in deigning to notice them but whatever his condescension had been it did not extend to an admitted acquaintance with the poor speech of the land of fogs an exhibition of aching deafness was presented to her so resolutely that at last she faltered what have you forgotten english mr pericles you spoke it the other day it is ze language of necessityof commerce he replied but surely mr pericles you dare not presume to tell me you choose to be ignorant of it whenever you please i do not take grits into ze teeth madame no more but you speak it perfectly perfect it may be for ze transactions of commerce i wish to keep my teez alas said the lady compelled i must endeavour to swim in french at your service madame quoth the greek with an immediate doubling of the length of his body carlo heard little more than he knew but the confirmation of what we know will sometimes instigate us like fresh intelligence and the lovers heart was quick to apprehend far more than he knew in one direction he divined instantaneously that the englishaustrian spoken of by barto rizzo was the officer sitting on horseback within halfadozen yards of him the certainty of the thought cramped his muscles for the rest it became clear to him that the attempt of the millionaire connoisseur to carry off vittoria had received the tacit sanction of the austrian authorities for reasons quite explicable mr pericles as the english lady called him distinctly hinted it while affirming with vehement selflaudation that his scheme had succeeded for the vindication of art the opera you will hear zis night he said will be hissed you will hear a chorus of screechowls to each song of that poor irma whom the italian people call crabapple well she pleases german ears and if they can support her it is well but la vittoriayour belloniyou will not hear and why she has been false to her art false she has become a little devil in politics it is a guy fawkes femelle she has been guilty of the immense crime of ingratitude she is dismissed to study to penitence and to the society of her old friends if they will visit her of course we will said the english lady either before or after our visit to venicedelicious venice which you have not seenhein mr pericles snarled and have not smelt there is no music in venice but you have nothing but street tinkletinkle a place to live in mon dieu the lady smiled my husband insists upon trying the baths of bormio and then we are to go over a pass for him to try the grapecure at meran if i can get him to promise me one whole year in italy our visit to venice may be deferred our doctor monsieur indicates our route if my brother can get leave of absence we shall go to bormio and to meran with him he is naturally astonished that emilia refused to see him and she refused to see us too she wrote a letter dated from the conservatorio to him he had it in his saddlebag and was robbed of it and other precious documents when the wretched odious people set upon him in veronapoor boy she said in the letter that she would see him in a few days after the fifteenth which is today ah a few days after the fifteenth which is today mr pericles repeated i saw you but the day before yesterday madame or i could have brought you together she is now awayoffout of sightthe perfule ah false that she is speak not of her you remember her in england there it was trouble trouble but here we are a pot on a fire with her speak not of her she has used me ill madame i am sick his violent gesticulation drooped in a temporary abandonment to chagrin he wiped the moisture from his forehead unwilling or heedless of the mild ironical mouthing of the ladies and looked about for carlo had made a movement to retirehe had heard enough for discomfort ah my dear ammiani the youngest editor in europe how goes it with you the greek called out with revived affability captain gambier perceived that it was time to present his italian acquaintance to the ladies by name as a friend of mademoiselle belloni my most dear ammiani antoniopericles resumed he barely attempted to conceal his acrid delight in casting a mysterious shadow of coming vexation over the youth i am afraid you will not like the opera camilla or perhaps it is the camilla you will not like but shoulder arms march a foot regiment in motion suggested the form of the recommendation what is not for today may be for tomorrow let us wait i think my ammiani you are to have a lemon and not an orange never mind let us wait carlo got his forehead into a show of smoothness and said suppose my dear signor antonio the prophet of dark things were to say to himself let us wait heinit is deep antoniopericles affected to sound the sentence eye upon earth as a sparrow spies worm or crumb permit me he added rapidly an idea had struck him from his malicious reserve stores here is lieutenant pierson of the staff of the fieldmarshal of austria unattached an old friend of mademoiselle emilia belloni permit mehere is count ammiani of the lombardia milanese journal a new friend of the signorina vittoria campamademoiselle belloni the signorina campait is the same person messieurs permit me to introduce you antoniopericles waved his arm between the two young men their plain perplexity caused him to dash his fingers down each side of his moustachios in tugs of enjoyment for lieutenant pierson who displayed a certain readiness to bow had caught a sight of the repellent stare on ammianis face a still and flat look not aggressive yet anything but inviting like a shield nevertheless the lieutenants head produced a stiff nod carlos did not respond but he lifted his hat and bowed humbly in retirement to the ladies captain gambier stepped aside with him inform lieutenant pierson i beg you said ammiani that i am at his orders if he should consider that i have insulted him by all means said gambier only you know its impossible for me to guess what is the matter and i dont think he knows luciano happened to be coming near carlo went up to him and stood talking for half a minute he then returned to captain gambier and said i put myself in the hands of a man of honour you are aware that italian gentlemen are not on terms with austrian officers if i am seen exchanging salutes with any one of them i offend my countrymen and they have enough to bear already perceiving that there was more in the background gambier simply bowed he had heard of italian gentlemen incurring the suspicion of their fellows by merely being seen in proximity to an austrian officer as they were parting carlo said to him with a very direct meaning in his eyes go to the opera tonight yes i suppose so the englishman answered and digested the look and the recommendation subsequently lieutenant pierson had ridden off the warmachine was in motion from end to end the field of flowers was a streaming flood regiment by regiment the crash of bands went by outwardly the italians conducted themselves with the air of ordinary heedless citizens in whose bosoms the music set no hellbroth boiling patrician and plebeian they were chiefly boys though here and there a middleaged workman cast a look of intelligence upon carlo and luciano when these two passed along the crowd a gloom of hoarded hatred was visible in the mass of faces ready to spring fierily arms were in the city with hatred to prompt the blow with arms to strike so much dishonour to avenge we need not wonder that these youths beheld the bit of liberty in prospect magnified by their mighty obfuscating ardour like a lantern in a fog reason did not act they were in such a state when just to say italia italia gave them nerve to match an athlete so the parading of austria the towering athlete failed of its complete lesson of intimidation and only ruffled the surface of insurgent hearts it seemed and it was an insult to the trodden people who read it as a lesson for cravens their instinct commonly hits the bell they felt that a secure supremacy would not have paraded itself so they divined indistinctly that there was weakness somewhere in the councils of the enemy when the show had vanished their spirits hung pausing like the hollow air emptied of big sound and reacted austria had gained little more by her display than the conscientious satisfaction of the pedagogue who lifts the rod to advise intending juvenile culprits how richly it can be merited and how poor will be their future grounds of complaint but before austria herself had been taught a lesson she conceived that she had but one man and his feeble instruments and occasional frenzies opposed to her him whom we saw on the motterone which was ceasing to be true though it was true that the whole popular movement flowed from that one man she observed travelling sparks in the embers of italy and crushed them under her heel without reflecting that a vital heat must be gathering where the spots of fire run with such a swiftness it was her belief that if she could seize that one man whom many of the younger nobles and all the people acknowledged as their chieffor he stood then without a rival in his taskshe would have the neck of conspiracy in her angry grasp had she caught him the conspiracy for italian freedom would not have crowed for many long seasons the torch would have been ready but not the magazine he prepared it it was he who preached to the italians that opportunity is a mocking devil when we look for it to be revealed or in other words wait for chance as it is gods angel when it is created within us the ripe fruit of virtue and devotion he cried out to italians to wait for no inspiration but their own that they should never subdue their minds to follow any alien example nor let a foreign city of fire be their beacon watching over his italy her wrist in his meditative clasp year by year he stood like a mystic leech by the couch of a fair and hopeless frame pledged to revive it by the inspired assurance shared by none that life had not forsaken it a body given over to death and vultureshe stood by it in the desert is it a marvel to you that when the carrionwings swooped low and the claws fixed and the beak plucked and savoured its morsel he raised his arm and urged the halfresuscitated frame to some vindicating show of existence arise he said even in what appeared most fatal hours of darkness the slack limbs moved the body rose and fell the cost of the effort was the breaking out of innumerable wounds old and new the gain was the display of the miracle that italy lived she tasted her own blood and herself knew that she lived then she felt her chains the time was coming for her to prove by the virtues within her that she was worthy to live when others of her sons subtle and adept intricate as serpents bold unquestioning as well bestridden steeds should grapple and play deep for her in the game of worldly strife nowat this hour of which i speakwhen austrians marched like a merry flame down milan streets and italians stood like the burntout cinders of the firegrate italys faint wrist was still in the clutch of her grave leech who counted the beating of her pulse between long pauses that would have made another think life to be heaving its last not beginning the piazza darmi was empty of its glittering show chapter xviii the night of the fifteenth we quit the piazza darmi rumour had its home in milan on their way to the caffe la scala luciano and carlo who held together determined to be taken together if the arrest should come heard it said that the chief was in milan a man passed by and uttered it going they stopped a second man who was known to them and he confirmed the rumour glad as sunlight once more they hurried to count medole forgivingly the counts servant assured them that his master had left the city for monza is medole a coward cried luciano almost in the servants hearing the fleeing of so important a man looked vile now that they were sharpened by new eagerness forthwith they were off to agostino believing that he would know the truth they found him in bed well and what said agostino replying to their laughter i am old too old to stride across a day and night like you giants of youth i take my rest when i can for i must have it but you know o conscript father said carlo willing to fall a little into his mood you know that nothing will be done tonight do i know so much agostino murmured at full length do you know that the chief is in the city said luciano a man who is lying in bed knows this returned agostino that he knows less than those who are up though what he does know he perhaps digests better tis you who are the fountains my boys while i am the pool into which you play say on they spoke of the rumour he smiled at it they saw at once that the rumour was false for the chief trusted agostino proceed to barto the mole he said barto the miner he is the father of daylight in the city of the daylight of knowledge you understand for which men must dig deep proceed to himif you can find him but carlo brought flame into agostinos eyes the accursed beast he has pinned the black butterfly to the signorinas dress agostino rose on his elbow he gazed at them we are followers of a blind mole he uttered with an inner voices while still gazing wrathfully and then burst out in grief patria o mea creatrix patria o mea genetrix the signorina takes none of his warnings nor do we she escaped a plot last night and tonight she sings she must not said agostino imperiously she does i must stop that agostino jumped out of bed the young men beset him with entreaties to leave the option to her fools he cried plunging a rageing leg into his garments here iris mercury fly to jupiter and say we are all old men and boys in italy and are ready to accept a few middleaged mortals as gods if they will come and help us young fools do you know that when you conspire you are in harness and yokefellows every one yoked to that barto rizzo yes and the worse horse of the two listen you pair of nuremberg puppetheads if the chief were here i would lie still in my bed medole has stopped the outbreak right or wrong he moves a mass we are subordinatesparticles the chief cant be everywhere milan is too hot for him two men are here concealedrinaldo and angelo guidascarpi the rumour springs from that they have slain count paul lenkenstein and rushed to old milan for work with the blood on their swords oh the tragedywhen i have time to write it let me now go to my girl to my daughter the blood of the lenkenstein must rust on the steel angelo slew him rinaldo gave him the cross to kiss you shall have the whole story byandby but this will be a lesson to germans not to court our italian damsels lift not that curtain you pannonian burglars much do we pardon but bow and viol meet not save that they be of one wood especially not when signor bow is from yonderside the rhoetian alps and donzella viol is a growth of warm lombardy witness to it angelo and rinaldo guidascarpi bravo you boys thereyou stand like two tyrolese saladspoons i say that my girl my daughter shall never help to fire blank shot i sent my paternal commands to her yesterday evening does the wanton disobey her father and look up to a pair of rocketheaded rascals like you apes if she sings that song tonight the ear of italy will be deaf to her for ever after theres no engine to stir tonight all the locks are on it she will send halfadozen milkings like you to perdition and there will be a circle of black blood about her name in the traditions of the insurrectiondo you hear have i cherished her for that purpose to have her dedicated to a brawl agostino fumed up and down the room in a confusion of apparel savouring his epithets and imaginative peeps while he stormed to get a relish out of something as beseems the poetic temperament the youths were silenced by him carlo gladly troop said the old man affecting to contrast his attire with theirs two graces and a satyr never yet went together and well not frighten the classic government of milan i go out alone no signor luciano i am not sworn to count medole i see your sneer contain it ah what a thing is hurry to a mind like mine it tears up the trees by the roots floods the land darkens utterly my poor quiet universe i was composing a pastoral when you came in observe what you have done with my lovely age of gold agostinos transfigurement from lymphatic poet to fiery man of action lasted till his breath was short when the necessity for taking a deep draught of air induced him to fall back upon his idle irony heads you illustrious young gentlemenheads not legs and arms move a conspiracy now youthink what you will of itare only legs and arms in this business and if you are insubordinate you present the shocking fabular spirit of the members of the body in revolt which is not the revolt we desire to see i go to my daughter immediately and we shall all have a fat sleep for a week while the tedeschi hunt and stew and exhaust their naughty suspicions do you know that the popes mouth is closed we made it tell a big lie before it shut tight on its teetha bad omen i admit but the idea was rapturously neat barto the sinner be sure i throttle him for putting that blot on my swan only not yet not yet hes a blind mole a mad patriot but as i say our beast barto drew an austrian to the mouth last night and led the dog to take a letter out of it detailing the whole plot of tonight and how men will be stationed at the vicolo here ready to burst out on the corso and at the vicolo there and elsewhere all over the city carrying fire and sword a systematic map of the plot it was addressed to count serabiglionemy boys my boys what do you think of it bravo though barto is a deadly beast if heagostino paused yes he went too far too far has he only gone too far do you say carlo spoke sternly his elder was provoked enough by his deadness of enthusiasm and that the boy should dare to stalk on a bare egoistical lovers sentiment to be critical of him agostino struck him as monstrous with the treachery of controlled rage agostino drew near him and whispered some sentences in his ear agostino then called him his good spartan boy for keeping brave countenance wait till you comprehend women philosophically alls trouble with them till then at la scala tonight my sons we have rehearsed the fiasco the tedeschi perform it off with you that i may go out alone he seemed to think it an indubitable matter that he would find vittoria and bend her will agostino had betrayed his weakness to the young men who read him with the keen eyes of a particular disapprobation he delighted in the dark web of intrigue and believed himself to be no ordinary weaver of that sunless work it captured his imagination filling his pride with a mounting gas thus he had become allied to medole on the one hand and to barto rizzo on the other the young men read him shrewdly but speaking was useless before carlo parted from luciano he told him the burden of the whisper which had confirmed what he had heard on the piazzi darmi it was this barto rizzo aware that lieutenant pierson was the bearer of despatches from the archduke in milan to the marshal then in verona had followed and by extraordinary effort reached verona in advance had there tricked and waylaid him and obtained instead of despatches a letter of recent date addressed to him by vittoria which compromised the insurrectionary project if thats the case my carlo said his friend and shrugged and spoke in a very worldly fashion of the fair sex carlo shook him off for the rest of the day he was alone shut up with his journalistic pen the pen traversed seas and continents like an old hack to whom his master has thrown the reins apart from the desperate perturbation of his soul he thought of the guidascarpi whom he knew and was allied to and of the lenkensteins whom he knew likewise or had known in the days when giacomo piaveni lived and bianca von lenkenstein lauras sister visited among the people of her country countess anna and countess lena von lenkenstein were the german beauties of milan lively little women and sweet between himself and countess lena there had been tender dealings about the age when sweetmeats have lost their attraction and the charm has to be supplied she was rich passionate for austria romantic concerning italy a vixen in temper but with a pearly light about her temples that kept her picture in his memory and besides during those days when women are bountiful to us as goddesses give they never so little she had deigned to fondle hands with him had set the universe rocking with a visible heave of her bosom jingled all the keys of mystery and had once as to embalm herself in his recollection once had surrendered her lips to him countess lena would have espoused ammiani believing in her power to make an austrian out of such italian material the piaveni revolt had stopped that and all their intercourse by the division of the white hand as it was called otherwise the hand of the corpse ammiani had known also count paul von lenkenstein to his mind death did not mean much however pleasant life might be his father and his friend had gone to it gaily and he himself stood ready for the summons but the contemplation of a domestic judicial execution which the guidascarpi seemed to have done upon count paul affrighted him and put an end to his temporary capacity for labour he felt as if a spent shot were striking on his ribs it was the unknown sensation of fear changeing it became pity horrible deaths these austrians die he said for a while he regarded their lot as the hardest a shaft of sunlight like blazing brass warned him that the day dropped he sent to his mothers stables and rode at a gallop round milan dining alone in one of the common hotel gardens where he was a stranger a man may have good nerve to face the scene which he is certain will be enacted who shrinks from an hour that is suspended in doubt he was aware of the pallor and chill of his looks and it was no marvel to him when two sbirri in mufti foreign to milan set their eyes on him as they passed by to a vacant table on the farther side of the pattering goldfish pool where he sat he divined that they might be in pursuit of the guidascarpi and alive to read a troubled visage yet neither rinaldo nor angelo would look as i do now he thought perceiving that these men were judging by such signs and had their ideas democrat as he imagined himself to be he despised with a noblemans contempt creatures who were so dead to the character of men of birth as to suppose that they were pale and remorseful after dealing a righteous blow and that they trembled ammiani looked at his hand no force of his will could arrest its palsy the guidascarpi were sons of bologna the stupidity of italian sbirri is proverbial or a milanese cavalier would have been astonished to conceive himself mistaken for a bolognese he beckoned to the waiter and said tell me what place has bred those two fellows on the other side of the fountain after a sideglance of scrutiny the reply was neapolitans the waiter was ready to make an additional remark but ammiani nodded and communed with a toothpick he was sure that those neapolitans were recruits of the bolognese polizia on the track of the guidascarpi possibly as he was not unlike angelo guidascarpi in figure he became uneasy lest they should blunder twixt him and la scala and the notion of any human power stopping him short of that destination made ammianis hand perfectly firm he drew on his gloves and named the place whither he was going aloud excellency said the waiter while taking up and pretending to reckon the money for the bill they have asked me whether there are two counts ammiani in milan carlos eyebrows started can they be after me he thought and said certainly there is twice anything in this world and milan is the epitome of it acting a part gave him agostinos catching manner of speech the waiter who knew him now took this for an order to say yes he had evidently a respect for ammianis name carlo supposed that he was one of milans fighting men a sort of answer leading to yes by a circuit and the assistance of the hearer was conveyed to the sbirri they were true neapolitans quick to suspect irresolute upon their suspicions he was soon aware that they were not to be feared more than are the general race of bunglers whom the gods sometimes strangely favour they perplexed him for why were they after him and what had made them ask whether he had a brother he was followed but not molested on his way to la scala ammianis heart was in full play as he looked at the curtain of the stage the night of the fifteenth had come for the first few moments his strong excitement fronting the curtain amid a great host of hearts thumping and quivering up in the smaller measures like his own together with the predisposing belief that this was to be a night of events stopped his consciousness that all had been thwarted that there was nothing but plot plot counterplot and tangle disunion silly subtlety jealousy vanity a direful congregation of antagonistic elements threads all loose tongues wagging pressure here pressure there like an uncertain rage in the entrails of the undirected earth and no master hand on the spot to fuse and point the intense distracted forces the curtain therefore hung like any common operascreen big only with the fate of the new prima donna he was robbed even of the certainty that vittoria would appear from the blank aspect of the curtain he turned to the house which was crowding fast and was not like listless milan about to criticize an untried voice the commonly empty boxes of the aristocracy were full of occupants and for a wonder the white uniforms were not in excess though they were to be seen the first person whom ammiani met was agostino who spoke gruffly vittoria had been invisible to him neither the maestro nor the impresario nor the waitingwoman had heard of her uncertainty was behind the curtain as well as in front but in front it was the uncertainty which is tipped with expectation hushing the usual noisy chatter and setting a daylight of eyes forward ammiani spied about the house and caught sight of laura piaveni with colonel corte by her side the lenkensteins were in the archdukes box antoniopericles and the english lady and captain gambier were next to them the appearance of a white uniform in his mothers box over the stage caused ammiani to shut up his glass he was making his way thither for the purpose of commencing the hostilities of the night when countess ammiani entered the lobby and took her sons arm with a grave face and a trembling touch chapter xix the prima donna whover is in my box is my guest said the countess adding a convulsive imperative pressure on carlos arm to aid the meaning of her deep underbreath she was a woman who rarely exacted obedience and she was spontaneously obeyed no questions could be put no explanations given in the crash and they threaded on amid numerous greetings in a place where milanese society had habitually ceased to gather and found itself now in assembly with unconcealed sensations of strangeness a card lay on the table of the countesss private retiringroom it bore the name of general pierson she threw off her black lace scarf angelo guidascarpi is in milan she said he has killed one of the lenkensteins sword to sword he came to me an hour after you left the sbirri were on his track he passed for my son he is now under the charge of barto rizzo disguised probably in this house his brother is in the city keep the cowl on your head as long as possible if these hounds see and identify you there will be mischief she said no more satisfied that she was understood but opening the door of the box passed in and returned a stately acknowledgement of the salutations of two military officers carlo likewise bent his head to them it was like bending his knee for in the younger of the two intruders he recognized lieutenant pierson the countess accepted a vacated seat the cavity of her ear accepted the generals apologies he informed her that he deeply regretted the intrusion he was under orders to be present at the opera and to be as near the stage as possible the countesss box being designated her face had the unalterable composure of a painted head upon an old canvas the general persisted in tendering excuses she replied it is best when one is too weak to resist to submit to an outrage quietly general pierson at once took the position assigned to him it was not an agreeable one between carlo and the lieutenant no attempt at conversation was made the general addressed his nephew in english did you see the girl behind the scenes wilfrid the answer was no pericles has her fast shut up in the tyrol the best habitat for her if she objects to a whipping did you see irma no she has disappeared too then i suppose we must make up our minds to an opera without head or tail as pat said of the sack of potatoes twould be a mighty fine beast if it had them the officers had taken refuge in their operaglasses and spoke while gazing round the house if neither this girl nor irma is going to appear there is no positive necessity for my presence here said the general reduced to excuse himself to himself ill sit through the first scene and then beat a retreat i might be off at once the affair looks harmless enough only you know when theres nothing to see you must report that you have seen it or your superiors are not satisfied the lieutenant was less able to cover the irksomeness of his situation with easy talk his glance rested on countess len a von lenkenstein a quick motion of whose hand made him say that he should go over to her very well said the general be careful that you give no hint of this horrible business they will hear of it when they get home time enough lieutenant pierson touched at his sisters box on the way she was very excited asked innumerable thingswhether there was danger whether he had a whole regiment at hand to protect peaceable persons otherwise she said i shall not be able to keep that man her husband in italy another week he refused to stir out tonight though we know that nothing can happen your prima donna celestissima is out of harms way oh she is safeze minx cried antoniopericles laughing and saluting the duchess of graatli who presented herself at the front of her box major de pyrmont was behind her and it delighted the greek to point them out to the english lady with a simple intimation of the character of their relationship at which her curls shook sadly pardon madame said pericles in italy a husband away ze friend takes title it is no more it is very disgraceful she said ze morales madame suit ze sun captain gambier left the box with wilfrid expressing in one sentence his desire to fling pericles over to the pit and in another his belief that an english friend named merthyr powys was in the house he wont be in the city fourandtwenty hours said wilfrid well youll keep your tongue silent by heavens gambier if you knew the insults we have to submit to the temper of angels couldnt stand it im sorry enough for these fellows with their confounded country but its desperate work to be civil to them upon my honour it is i wish they would stand up and let us have it over we have to bear more from the women than the men i leave you to cool said gambier the delayed absence of the maestro from his post at the head of the orchestra where the musicians sat awaiting him seemed to confirm a rumour that was now circling among the audience warning all to prepare for a disappointment his baton was brought in and laid on the book of the new overture when at last he was seen bearing onward through the musicstands a low murmur ran round rocco paid no heed to it his demeanour produced such satisfaction in the breast of antoniopericles that he rose and was guilty of the barbarism of clapping his hands meeting ammiani in the lobby he said come my good friend you shall help me to pull irma through tonight she is vinegarwe will mix her with oil it is only for tonight to save that poor roccos opera irma said ammiani she is by this time in tyrol your irma will have some difficulty in showing herself here within sixty hours how cried pericles amazed and plucking after carlo to stop him i bet you how much i bet you a thousand florins you do not see la vittoria tonight good i bet you a thousand florins you do not see irma no vittoria i say and i say no lazzeruola agostino who was pacing the lobby sent pericles distraught with the same tale of the rape of irma he rushed to signora piavenis box and heard it repeated there he beheld sitting in the background an old english acquaintance with whom captain gambier was conversing my dear powys you have come all the way from england to see your favourites first night you will be shocked sir she has neglected her art she is exiled banished sent away to study and to compose her mind i think you are mistaken said laura you will see her almost immediately signora pardon me do i not know best you may have contrived badly pericles blinked and gnawed his moustache as if it were food for patience i would wager a milliard of francs he muttered with absolute pathos he related to mr powys the aberrations of the divinelygifted voice the wreck which vittoria strove to become and from which he alone was striving to rescue her he used abundant illustrations coarse and quaint and was half hysterical flashing a white fist and thumping the long projection of his knee with a wolfish aspect his grotesque sincerity was little short of the shedding of tears and your sister my dear powys he asked as one returning to the consideration of shadows my sister accompanies me but not to the opera for another campaignhein to winter in italy at all events carlo ammiani entered and embraced merthyr powys warmly the englishman was at home among italians pericles feeling that he was not so and regarding them all as a community of feverpatients without hospital retired to his mind it was the vilest treason the grossest selfishness to conspire or to wink at the sacrifice of a voice like vittorias to such a temporal matter as this which they called patriotism he looked on it as one might look on the hindoo drama of a suttee he saw in it just that stupid action of a whole body of fanatics combined to precipitate the devotion of a precious thing to extinction and worse for life was common and women and hindoo widows were common but a vittorian voice was but one in a generationin a cycle of years the religious belief of the connoisseur extended to the devout conception that her voice was a spiritual endowment the casting of which priceless jewel into the bloody ditch of patriots was far more tragic and lamentable than any disastrous concourse of dedicated lives he shook the lobby with his tread thinking of the great night this might have been but for vittorias madness the overture was coming to an end by tightening his arms across his chest he gained some outward composure and fixed his eyes upon the stage while sitting with laura piaveni and merthyr powys ammiani saw the apparition of captain weisspriess in his mothers box he forgot her injunction and hurried to her side leaving the doors open his passion of anger spurned her admonishing grasp of his arm and with his glove he smote the austrian officer on the face weisspriess plucked his sword out the house rose there was a moment like that of a wild beasts show of teeth it passed captain weisspriess withdrew in obedience to general piersons command the latter wrote on a slip of paper that two pieces of artillery should be placed in position and a squad of men about the doors he handed it out to weisspriess i hope the general said to carlo we shall be able to arrange things for you without the interposition of the authorities carlo rejoined general he has the blood of our family on his hands i am ready the general bowed he glanced at the countess for a sign of maternal weakness saw none and understood that a duel was down in the morrows bill of entertainments as well as a riot possibly before dawn the house had revealed its temper in that short outburst as a quivering of quick lightningflame betrays the forehead of the storm countess ammiani bade her son make fast the outer door her sedate energies could barely control her agitation in helping angelo guidascarpi to evade the law she had imperilled her son and herself many of the bolognese sbirri were in pursuit of angelo some knew his person some did not but if those two before whom she had identified angelo as being her son carlo chanced now to be in the house and to have seen him and heard his name the risks were great and various do you know that handsome young count ammiani countess lena said to wilfrid perhaps you do not think him handsome he was for a short time a playfellow of mine he is more passionate than i am and that does not say a little i warn you look how excited he is no wonder he iseverybody knows ithe is la vittorias lover countess lena uttered that sentence in italian the soft tongue sent it like a coiling serpent through wilfrids veins in english or in german it would not have possessed the deadly meaning she may have done it purposely for she and her sister countess anna studied his face the lifting of the curtain drew all eyes to the stage rocco riccis baton struck for the opening of one of his spirited choruses a chorus of villagers who sing to the burden that happiness the aim of all humanity has promised to visit the earth this day that she may witness the union of the noble lovers camillo and camilla then a shepherd sings a verse with his hand stretched out to the impending castle there lives count orso will he permit their festivities to pass undisturbed the puling voice is crushed by the chorus which protests that the heavens are above count orso but another villager tells of orsos power and hints at his misdeeds the chorus rises in reply warning all that count orso has ears wherever three are congregated the villagers break apart and eye one another distrustfully reuniting to the song of happiness before they disperse camillo enters solus montini as camillo enjoyed a warm reception but as he advanced to deliver his canzone it was seen that he and rocco interchanged glances of desperate resignation camillo has had love passages with michiella count orsos daughter and does not hesitate to declare that he dreads her the orphan camilla who has been reared in yonder castle with her as her sister is in danger during all these last minutes which still retain her from his arms if i should never see heri who like a poor ghost upon the shores of the dead river have been flattered with the thought that she would fall upon my breast like a ray of the light of elysiumif i should never see her more the famous tenore threw his whole force into that outcry of projected despair and the house was moved by it there were many in the house who shared his apprehension of a foul mischance thenceforward the opera and the italian audience were as one all that was uttered had a meaning and was sympathetically translated camilla they perceived to be a grave burlesque with a core to it the quick witted italians caught up the interpretation in a flash count orso austria michiella is austrias spirit of intrigue camillo is indolent italy amorous italy italy aimless camilla is young italy their eagerness for sight of vittoria was now redhot and when camillo exclaimed she comes many rose from their seats a scrap of paper was handed to antoniopericles from captain weisspriess saying briefly that he had found irma in the carriage instead of the little v thanked him for the joke and had brought her back pericles was therefore not surprised when irma as michiella came on breathless and looking in an excitement of anger he knew that he had been tricked between camillo and michiella a scene of some vivacity ensued reproaches threats of calamity offers of returning endearment upon her part a display of courtly scorn upon his irma made her voice claw at her quondam lover very finely it was a voice with claws that entered the hearing sharpedged and left it plucking at its repose she was applauded relishingly when after vainly wooing him she turned aside and said what change is this in one who like a reed bent to my twisting hands does he recoil is this the hound whom i have used to feed with sops of vinegar and sops of oil michiellas further communications to the audience make it known that she has allowed the progress toward the ceremonies of espousal between camillo and camilla in order at the last moment to show her power over the youth and to plunge the detested camilla into shame and wretchedness camillo retires count orso appears there is a duet between father and daughter she confesses her passion for camillo and entreats her father to stop the ceremony and here the justice of the feelings of italians even in their heat of blood was noteworthy count orso says that he would willingly gratify his daughter as it would gratify himself but that he must respect the law the law is of your own making says michiella then the more must i respect it count orso replies the audience gave austria credit for that much in a short murmur michiellas aside till anger seizes him i wait created laughter it came in contrast with an extraordinary pomposity of selfsatisfaction exhibited by count orsothe flowerfaced tunbellied basso lebruno it was irresistible he stood swollen out like a morning cock to make it further telling he took off his yellow bonnet with a blackgloved hand and thumped the significant colours prominently on his immense chestan idea not of agostinos but lebrunos own and agostino cursed with fury both he and rocco knew that their joint labour would probably have only one nights display of existence in the austrian dominions but they grudged to lebruno the chief merit of despatching it to the shades the villagers are heard approaching my father cries michiella distractedly the hour is near it will be death to your daughter imprison camillo i can bring twenty witnesses to prove that he has sworn you are illegally the lord of this country you will rue the marriage do as you once did be bold in time the arrowhead is on the string cut the string as i once did replies orso with frown terrific like a black crest he turns broadly and receives the chorus of countrymen in paternal fashionan admirably acted bit of grave burlesque by this time the german portion of the audience had by one or other of the senses dimly divined that the opera was a shadow of something concealedthanks to the buffobasso lebruno doubtless they would have seen this before but that the austrian censorship had seemed so absolute a safeguard my children all are my children in this my gladsome realm count orso says and marches forth after receiving the compliment of a choric song in honour of his paternal government michiella follows him then came the deep suspension of
