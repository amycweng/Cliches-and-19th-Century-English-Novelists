note there is a short list of bookmarks or pointers at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the authors ideas before making an entire meal of them dw diana of the crossways by george meredith book xviii the authoress xix a drive in sunlight and a drive in moonlight xx dianas nightwatch in the chamber of death xxi the young minister of state xxii between diana and dacier the wind east over bleak land xxiii records a visit to diana from one of the worlds good women xxiv indicates a soul prepared for desperation xxv once more the crossways and a change of turnings xxvi in which a disappointed lover receives a multitude of lessons chapter xviii the authoress the effect of a great success upon diana at her second literary venture was shown in the transparent sedateness of a letter she wrote to emma dunstane as much as in her immediate and complacent acceptance of the magical change of her fortunes she spoke one thing and acted another but did both with a lofty calm that deceived the admiring friend who clearly saw the authoress behind her mask and feared lest she should be too confidently trusting to the powers of her pen to support an establishment if the public were a perfect instrument to strike on i should be tempted to take the wonderful success of my princess at her first appearance for a proof of natural aptitude in composition and might think myself the genius i know it to be as little a stradivarius as i am a paganini it is an eccentric machine in tune with me for the moment because i happen to have hit it in the ringing spot the book is a new face appealing to a mirror of the common surface emotions and the kitchen rather than the dairy offers an analogy for the real value of that topskim i have not seen what i consider good in the book once mentioned among the laudatory noticesexcept by your dear hand my emmy be sure i will stand on guard against the vaporous generalizations and other tricks you fear now that you are studying latin for an occupationhow good and wise it was of mr redworth to propose it i look upon you with awe as a classic authority and critic i wish i had leisure to study with you what i do is nothing like so solid and durable the princess egeria originally i must have written word of it to you i remember the evening off palermo was conceived as a sketch by gradations she grew into a sort of semiscudery romance and swelled to her present portliness that was done by a great deal of piecing not to say puffing of her frame she would be healthier and have a chance of living longer if she were reduced by a reversal of the processes but how would the judicious clippings and prickings affect our pensive public now that i have furnished a house and have a fixed address under the paws of creditors i feel i am in the wizardcircle of my popularity and subscribe to its laws or waken to incubus and the desert have i been rash you do not pronounce if i have bound myself to pipe as others please it need not be entirely and i can promise you it shall not be but still i am sensible when i lift my little quill of having forced the note of a woodland wren into the popular nightingaleswhich may end in the daws from straining or worse a toywhistle that is in the field of literature otherwise within me deep i am not aware of any transmutation of the celestial into coined gold i sound myself and ring clear incessant writing is my refuge my solaceescape out of the personal net i delight in it as in my early morning walks at lugano when i went threading the streets and by the lake away to the heavenly mount like a dim idea worming upward in a sleepy head to bright wakefulness my anonymous critic of whom i told you is intoxicating with eulogy the signature apollonius appears to be of literarymiddle indication he marks passages approved by you i have also had a complimentary letter from mr dacier for an instance of this delight i have in writing so strong is it that i can read pages i have written and tear the stuff to strips i did yesterday and resume as if nothing had happened the waves within are ready for any displacement that must be a good sign i do not doubt of excelling my princess and if she received compliments the next may hope for more consider too the novel pleasure of earning money by the labour we delight in it is an answer to your question whether i am happy yes as the savage islander before the ship entered the bay with the firewater my blood is wine and i have the slumbers of an infant i dream wake forget my dream barely dress before the pen is galloping barely breakfast no toilette till noon a savage in good sooth you see my emmy i could not house with the companionable person you hint at the poles can never come together till the earth is crushed she would find my habits intolerable and i hers contemptible though we might both be companionable persons my dear i could not even live with myself my blessed little quill which helps me divinely to live out of myself is and must continue to be my one companion it is my mountain height morning light wings cup from the springs my horse my goal my lancet and replenisher my key of communication with the highest grandest holiest between earth and heaventhe vital air connecting them in justice let me add that i have not been troubled by hearing of any of the mysterious legal claims et caetera i am sorry to hear bad reports of health i wish him entire felicityno step taken to bridge division the thought of it makes me tigrish a new pianist playing his own pieces at lady singlebys concert has given me exquisite pleasure and set me composing songsnot to his music which could be rendered only by sylphs moving to soft recorders in the humour of wildness languor bewitching caprices giving a new sense to melody how i wish you had been with me to hear him it was the most aeolian thing ever caught from a nightbreeze by the soul of a poet but do not suppose me having headlong tendencies to the melting mood the above by the way is a pole settled in paris and he is to be introduced to me at lady pennonswhat do you say to my being invited by mr whitmonby to aid him in writing leading articles for the paper he is going to conduct write as you talk and it will do he says i am choosing my themes to writeof politicsas i talk seems to me like an effort to jump away from my shadow the black dog of consciousness declines to be shaken off if some one commanded me to talk as i write i suspect it would be a way of winding me up to a sharp critical pitch rapidly not good news of lord d i have had messages mr dacier conceals his alarm the princess gave great gratification she did me her best service there is it not cruel that the interdict of the censor should force me to depend for information upon such scraps as i get from a gentleman passing my habitation on his way to the house and he is not he never has been sympathetic in that direction he sees my grief and assumes an undertakerly air with some notion of acting in concert one supposes little imagining how i revolt from that crapehatband formalism of sorrow one word of her we call our inner i i am not drawing upon her resources for my daily needs not wasting her at all i trust certainly not walling her up to deafen her voice it would be to fall away from you she bids me sign myself my beloved ever ever your tony the letter had every outward show of sincereness in expression and was endowed to wear that appearance by the writers impulse to protest with so resolute a vigour as to delude herself lady dunstane heard of mr daciers novel attendance at concerts the world made a note of it for the gentleman was notoriously without ear for music dianas comparison of her hours of incessant writing to her walks under the dawn at lugano her boast of the similarity of her delight in both deluded her uncorrupted conscience to believe that she was now spiritually as free as in that fair season of the new spring in her veins she was not an investigating physician nor was lady dunstane otherwise they would have examined the material points of her conduct indicators of the spiritual secret always what are the patients acts the patients mind was projected too far beyond them to see the fore finger they stretched at her and the friends was not that of a prying doctor on the look out for betraying symptoms lady dunstane did ask herself why tony should have incurred the burden of a costly household a very costly sir lukin had been at one of tonys little dinners but her wish to meet the world on equal terms after a long dependency accounted for it in seeming to excuse the guests on the occasion were lady pennon lady singleby mr whitmonby mr percy dacier mr tonans some other woman sir lukin said and himself he reported the cookery as matching the conversation and that was princely the wines not lessan extraordinary fact to note of a woman but to hear whitmonby and diana warwick how he told a story neat as a postmans knock and she tipped it with a remark and ran to a second drawing in lady pennon and then dacier and me cried sir lukin she made us all toss the ball from hand to hand and all talk up to the mark and none of us noticed that we all went together to the drawingroom where we talked for another hour and broke up fresher than we began that break between the men and the women after dinner was tonys aversion and i am glad she has instituted a change said lady dunstane she heard also from redworth of the unexampled concert of the guests at mrs warwicks dinner parties he had met on one occasion the esquarts the pettigrews mr percy dacier and a miss paynham redworth had not a word to say of the expensive household whatever mrs warwick did was evidently good to him on another evening the party was composed of lady pennon lord larrian miss paynham a clever mrs wollasley mr henry wilmers and again mr percy dacier when diana came to copsley lady dunstane remarked on the recurrence of the name of miss paynham in the list of her guests and mr percy daciers too said diana smiling they are invited each for specific reasons it pleases lord dannisburgh to hear that a way has been found to enliven his nephew and my little dinners are effective i think he wakes yesterday evening he capped flying jests with mr sullivan smith but you speak of miss paynham diana lowered her voice on half a dozen syllables till the halftones dropped into her steady look you approve emmy the answer was i dotrue or not between us two dear i fear in either case she has been badly used society is big engine enough to protect itself i incline with british juries to do rough justice to the victims she has neither father nor brother i have had no confidences but it wears the look of a cowardly business with two words in his ear i could arm an irishman to do some work of chastisement he would select the rascals necktie for a cause of quarrel and lords have to stand their ground as well as commoners they measure the same number of feet when stretched their length however vengeance with the heavens though they seem tardy lady pennon has been very kind about it and the esquarts invite her to lockton shoulder to shoulder the tide may be stemmed she would have gone under but for you dear tony said emma folding arms round her darlings neck anal kissing her bring her here some day diana did not promise it she had her vision of sir lukin in his fit of lunacy i am too weak for london now emma resumed i should like to be useful is she pleasant sprightly by nature she has worn herself with fretting then bring her to stay with me if i cannot keep you she will talk of you to me i will bring her for a couple of days diana said i am too busy to remain longer she paints portraits to amuse herself she ought to be pushed wherever she is received about london while the season is warm one season will suffice to establish her she is pretty near upon six and twenty foolish of courseshe pays for having had a romantic head heavy payment emmy i drive at laws but hers is an instance of the creatures wanting simple human kindness the good law will come with a better civilization but before society can be civilized it has to be debarbarized emma remarked and diana sighed over the task and the truism i should have said in younger days because it will not look plainly on our nature and try to reconcile it with our conditions but now i see that the sin is cowardice the more i know of the world the more clearly i perceive that its top and bottom sin is cowardice physically and morally alike lord larrian owns to there being few heroes in an army we must fawn in society what is the meaning of that dread of one example of tolerance o my dear let us give it the right name society is the best thing we have but it is a crazy vessel worked by a crew that formerly practised piracy and now in expiation professes piety fearful of a discovered omnipotence which is in the image of themselves and captain their old habits are not quite abandoned and their new one is used as a lash to whip the exposed of us for a propitiation of the capricious potentate whom they worship in the place of the true god lady dunstane sniffed i smell the leading article diana joined with her smile no the style is rather different have you not got into a trick of composing in speaking at times diana confessed i think i have at times perhaps the daily writing of all kinds and the nightly talking i may be getting strained no tony but longer visits in the country to me would refresh you i miss your lighter touches london is a school but you know it not a school for comedy nor for philosophy that is gathered on my hills with london distantly in view and then occasional descents on it well digested i wonder whether it is affecting me said diana musing a metropolitan hack and while thinking myself free thrice harnessed and all my fun gone am i really as dull as a tract my dear i must be or i should be proving the contrary instead of asking my pitfall is to fancy i have powers equal to the first lookout of the eyes of the morning enough of me we talked of mary paynham if only some right good man would marry her lady dunstane guessed at the right good man in dianas mind do you bring them together diana nodded and then shook doleful negatives to signify no hope none whateverif we mean the same person said lady dunstane bethinking her in the spirit of wrath she felt at such a scheme being planned by diana to snare the right good man that instead of her own true lover redworth it might be only percy dacier so filmy of mere sensations are these little ideas as they flit in converse that she did not reflect on her friends ignorance of redworths love of her or on the unlikely choice of one in daciers high station to reinstate a damsel they did not name the person passing the instance which is cruel i will be just to society thus far said diana i was in a boat at richmond last week and leander was revelling along the mudbanks and took it into his head to swim out to me and i was moved to take him on board the ladies in the boat objected for he was not only wet but very muddy i was forced to own that their objections were reasonable my sentimental humaneness had no argument against muslin dresses though my dear dogs eyes appealed pathetically and he would keep swimming after us the analogy excuses the world for protecting itself in extreme cases nothing nothing excuses its insensibility to cases which may be pleaded you see the pirate crew turned piousferocious in sanctity she added half laughing i am reminded by the boat i have unveiled my anonymous critic and had a woeful disappointment he wrote like a veteran he is not much more than a boy i received a volume of verse and a few lines begging my acceptance i fancied i knew the writing and wrote asking him whether i had not to thank him and inviting him to call he seems a nice lad of about two and twenty mad for literature and he must have talent arthur rhodes by name i may have a chance of helping him he was an articled clerk of mr braddocks the same who valiantly came to my rescue once he was with us in the boat bring him to me some day said lady dunstane miss paynhams visit to copsley was arranged and it turned out a failure the poor young lady came in a flutter thinking that the friend of mrs warwick would expect her to discourse cleverly she attempted it to dianas amazement lady dunstanes opposingly corresponding stillness provoked miss paynham to expatiate for she had sprightliness and some mental reserves of the common order clearly lady dunstane mused while listening amiably tony never could have designed this gabbler for the mate of thomas redworth percy dacier seemed to her the more likely one in that light and she thought so still after sir lukin had introduced him at copsley for a couple of days of the hunting season tonys manner with him suggested it she had a dash of leadership they were not intimate in look or tongue but percy dacier also was too good for miss paynham if that was tonys plan for him lady dunstane thought with the relentlessness of an invalid and recluses distaste an aspect of penitence she had not demanded but the silly gabbier under a stigma she could not pardon her opinion of miss paynham was diffused in her silence speaking of mr dacier she remarked as you say of him tony he can brighten and when you give him a chance he is entertaining he has fine gifts if i were a member of his family i should beat about for a match for him he strikes me as one of the young men who would do better married he is doing very well but the wonder is that he doesnt marry said diana he ought to be engaged lady esquart told me that he was a miss aspergreat heiress and the daciers want money however there it is not many weeks later diana could not have spoken of mr percy dacier with this air of indifference without corruption of her inward guide chapter xix a drive in sunlight and a drive in moonlight the fatal time to come for her was in the summer of that year emma had written her a letter of unwonted bright spirits contrasting strangely with an inexplicable oppression of her own that led her to imagine her recent placid life the pause before thunder and to sharp the mood of her solitary friend she flew to copsley finding sir lukin absent as usual they drove out immediately after breakfast on one of those high mornings of the bared bosom of june when distances are given to our eyes and a soft air fondles leaf and grassblade and beauty and peace are overhead reflected if we will rain had fallen in the night here and there hung a milkwhite cloud with folded sail the southwest left it in its bay of blue and breathed below at moments the fresh scent of herb and mould swung richly in warmth the young beechleaves glittered pools of rainwater made the roadways laugh the grassbanks under hedges rolled their interwoven weeds in cascades of manyshaded green to right and left of the pair of dappled ponies and a squirrel crossed ahead a lark went up a little way to ease his heart closing his wings when the burst was over startled blackbirds darting with a clamour like a broken cockcrow looped the wayside woods from hazel to oakscrub short flights quick spirts everywhere steady sunshine above diana held the reins the whip was an ornament as the plume of feathers to the general officer lady dunstanes ponies were a present from redworth who always chose the pick of the land for his gifts they joyed in their trot and were the very lovebirds of the breed for their pleasure of going together so like that diana called them the dromios through an old gravelcutting a gateway led to the turf of the down springy turf bordered on a long line clear as a racecourse by golden gorse covers and leftward over the gorse the dark ridge of the fir and heath country ran companionably to the southwest the valley between with undulations of wood and meadow sunned or shaded clumps mounds promontories away to broad spaces of tillage banked by wooded hills and dimmer beyond and farther the faintest shadowiness of heights as a veil to the illimitable yews junipers radiant beeches and gleams of the servicetree or the whitebeam spotted the semicircle of swelling green down black and silver the sun in the valley sharpened his beams on squares of buttercups and made a pond a diamond you see tony emma said for a comment on the scene i could envy italy for having you more than you for being in italy feature and colour said diana you have them here and on a scale that one can embrace i should like to build a hut on this point and wait for such a day to return it brings me to life she lifted her eyelids on her friends worn sweet face and knowing her this friend up to death past it in her hopes she said bravely it is the emma of days and scenes to me it helps me to forget myself as i do when i think of you dearest but the subject has latterly been haunting me i dont know why and ominously as if my nature were about to horrify my soul but i am not sentimentalizing you are really this day and scene in my heart emma smiled confidingly she spoke her reflection the heart must be troubled a little to have the thought the flower i gather here tells me that we may be happy in privation and suffering if simply we can accept beauty i wont say expel the passions but keep passion sober a trotter in harness diana caressed the ponies heads with the droop of her whip i dont think i know him she said between sincerity and a suspicion so cloaked and dull that she did not feel it to be the opposite of candour she fancied she was passionless because she could accept the visible beauty which was emmas prescription and test and she forced herself to make much of it cling to it devour it with envy of emmas contemplative happiness through whose grave mind she tried to get to the peace in it imagining that she succeeded the cloaked and dull suspicion weighed within her nevertheless she took it for a mania to speculate on herself there are states of the crimson blood when the keenest wits are childish notably in greathearted women aiming at the majesty of their sex and fearful of confounding it by the look direct and the downright word yet her nature compelled her inwardly to phrase the sentence emma is a wife the character of her husband was not considered nor was the meaning of the exclamation pursued they drove through the gorse into wild land of heath and flowering hawthorn and along by tracts of yew and juniper to another point jutting on a furzy sandmound rich with the mild splendour of english scenery which emma stamped on her friends mind by saying a cripple has little to envy in you who can fly when she has feasts like these at her doors they had an inclination to boast on the drive home of the solitude they had enjoyed and just then as the road in the wood wound under great beeches they beheld a london hat the hat was plucked from its head a clearfaced youth rather flushed dusty at the legs addressed diana mr rhodes she said not discouragingly she was petitioned to excuse him he thought she would wish to hear the news in town last night as early as possible he hesitated and murmured it diana turned to emma lord dannisburgh her paleness told the rest hearing from mr rhodes that he had walked the distance from town and had been to copsley lady dunstane invited him to follow the pony carriage thither where he was fed and refreshed by a teabreakfast as he preferred walking on tea he said i took the liberty to call at mrs warwicks house he informed her the footman said she was at copsley i found it on the mapi knew the directionsand started about two in the morning i wanted a walk it was evident to her that he was one of the young squires bewitched whom beautiful women are constantly enlisting there was no concealment of it though he stirred a sad enviousness in the invalid lady by descanting on the raptures of a walk out of london in the youngest light of day and on the common objects he had noticed along the roadside and through the woods more sustaining closer with nature than her compulsory feeding on the cream of things you are not fatigued she inquired hoping for that confession at least but she pardoned his boyish vaunting to walk the distance back without any fatigue at all he had a sweeter reward for his pains and if the business of the chronicler allowed him to become attached to pure throbbing felicity wherever it is encountered he might be diverted by the blissful unexpectedness of good fortune befalling mr arthur rhodes in having the honour to conduct mrs warwick to town no imagined happiness even in the heart of a young man of two and twenty could have matched it he was by her side hearing and seeing her not less than four hours to add to his happiness lady dunstane said she would be glad to welcome him again she thought him a pleasant specimen of the selfvowed squire diana was sure that there would be a communication for her of some sort at her house in london perhaps a message of farewell from the dying lord now dead mr rhodes had only the news of the evening journals to the effect that lord dannisburgh had expired at his residence the priory hallowmere in hampshire a message of farewell from him she hoped for knowing him as she did it seemed a certainty and she hungered for that last gleam of life in her friend she had no anticipation of the burden of the message awaiting her a consultation as to the despatching of the message had taken place among the members of lord dannisburghs family present at his death percy dacier was one of them and he settled the disputed point after some time had been spent in persuading his father to take the plain view of obligation in the matter and in opposing the dowager countess his grandmother by stating that he had already sent a special messenger to london lord dannisburgh on his deathbed had expressed a wish that mrs warwick would sit with him for an hour one night before the nails were knocked in his coffin he spoke of it twice putting it the second time to percy as a formal request to be made to her and percy had promised him that mrs warwick should have the message he had done his best to keep his pledge aware of the disrelish of the whole family for the ladys name to say nothing of her presence she wont come said the earl shell come said old lady dacier if the woman respects herself shell hold off it the earl insisted because of his desire that way he signified in mutterings that the thing was improper and absurd a piece of sentiment sickly senility unlike lord dannisburgh also that percy had been guilty of excessive folly to which lady dacier nodded her assent remarking the woman is on her mettle from what ive heard of her shes not a woman to stick at trifles shell take it as a sort of ordeal by touch and she ll come they joined in abusing percy who had driven away to another part of the country lord creedmore the heir of the house was absent hunting in america or he might temporarily have been taken into favour by contrast ultimately they agreed that the woman must be allowed to enter the house but could not be received the earl was a widower his mother managed the family and being hard to convince she customarily carried her point save when it involved percys freedom of action she was one of the veterans of her sex that age to toughness and the hysterical fuss she apprehended in the visit of this woman to lord dannisburghs death bed and body did not alarm her for the sake of the household she determined to remain shut up in her room before night the house was empty of any members of the family excepting old lady dacier and the outstretched figure on the bed dacier fled to escape the hearing of the numberless ejaculations re awakened in the family by his uncles extraordinary dying request they were an outrage to the lady of whom he could now speak as a privileged champion and the request itself had an air of proving her stainless a white soul and efficacious advocate at the celestial gates reading the mind of the dying man so he thought at one moment he had thought so when charged with the message to her had even thought it a natural wish that she should look once on the face she would see no more and say farewell to it considering that in life it could not be requested but the susceptibility to sentimental emotion beside a deathbed with a dying mans voice in the ear requires fortification if it is to be maintained and the review of his uncles character did not tend to make this very singular request a proof that the ladys innocence was honoured in it his epicurean uncle had no profound esteem for the kind of innocence he had always talked of mrs warwickwith warm respect for her dacier knew that he had bequeathed her a sum of money the inferences were either way lord dannisburgh never spoke evilly of any woman and he was perhaps bound to indemnify her materially as well as he could for what she had sufferedon the other hand how easy it was to be the dupe of a woman so handsome and cleverunlikely too that his uncle would consent to sit at the platonic banquet with herjudging by himself dacier deemed it possible for man he was not quick to kindle and had lately seen much of her had found her a lady egeria helpful in counsel prompting inspiriting reviving as wellwaters and as temperately cool not one sign of native slipperiness nor did she stir the mud in him upon which proud man is built the shadow of the scandal had checked a few shifty sensations rising now and then of their own accord and had laid them with the ladys benign connivance this was good proof in her favour seeing that she must have perceived of late the besetting thirst he had for her company and alone or in the medley equally to see her hear exchange ideas with her and to talk of new books try to listen to music at the opera and at concerts and admire her playing of hostess were novel pleasures giving him fresh notions of life and strengthening rather than disturbing the course of his lifes business at any rate she was capable of friendship why not resolutely believe that she had been his uncles true and simple friend he adopted the resolution thanking her for one recognized facthe hated marriage and would by this time have been in the yoke but for the agreeable deviation of his path to her society since his visit to copsley moreover lady dunstanes idolizing of her friend had influenced him reflecting on it he recovered from the shock which his uncles request had caused certain positive calculations were running side by side with the speculations in vapour his messenger would reach her house at about four of the afternoon if then at home would she decide to start immediatelywould she come that was a question he did not delay to answer would she defer the visit death replied to that she would not delay it she would be sure to come at once and what of the welcome she would meet leaving the station at london at six in the evening she might arrive at the priory all impediments counted between ten and eleven at night thence coldly greeted or not greeted to the chamber of death a pitiable and cruel reception for a woman upon such a mission his mingled calculations and meditations reached that exclamatory terminus in feeling and settled on the picture of diana about as clear as light to blinking eyes but enough for him to realize her being there and alone woefully alone the supposition of an absolute loneliness was most possible he had intended to drive back the next day when the domestic storm would be over and take the chances of her coming it seemed now a piece of duty to return at night a traverse of twenty rough up and down miles from itchenford to the heathland rolling on the chalk wave of the surrey borders easily done after the remonstrances of his host were stopped dacier sat in an open carriage facing a slip of bright moon poetical impressions emotions any stirrings of his mind by the sensational stamp on it were new to him and while he swam in them both lulled and pricked by his novel accessibility to natures lyrical touch he asked himself whether if he were near the throes of death the thought of having diana warwick to sit beside his vacant semblance for an hour at night would be comforting and why had his uncle specified an hour of the night it was a sentiment like the request curious in a man so little sentimental yonder crescent running the shadowy round of the hoop roused comparisons would one really wish to have her beside one in death in lifeah but suppose her denied to us in life then the desire for her companionship appears passingly comprehensible enter into the sentiment you see that the hour of darkness is naturally chosen and would even a grand old pagan crave the presence beside his dead body for an hour of the night of a woman he did not esteem dacier answered no the negative was not echoed in his mind he repeated it and to the same deadness he became aware that he had spoken for himself and he had a fit of sourness for who can say he is not a fool before he has been tried by a woman daciers wretched tendency under vexation to conceive grotesque analogies antipoetic not to say cockney similes which had slightly chilled diana at rovio set him looking at yonder crescent with the hoop as at the shape of a white cat climbing a wheel men of the northern blood will sometimes lend their assent to poetical images even to those that do not stun the mind lie bludgeons and imperatively by much repetition command their assent and it is for a solid exchange and interest in usury with soft poetical creatures when they are so condescending but they are seized by the grotesque in spite of efforts to efface or supplant it he saw the white cat nothing else even to thinking that she had jumped cleverly to catch the wheel he was a true descendant of practical hardgrained fighting northerners of gnarled dwarf imaginations chivalrous though they were and heroes to have serviceable and valiant gentlemen for issue without at all tracing back to its origin his detestable image of the white cat on the dead circle he kicked at the links between his uncle and diana warwick whatever they had been particularly at the present revival of them old lady daciers blunt speech and his fathers fixed opinion hissed in his head they were ignorant of his autumnal visit to the italian lakes after the winters nileboat expedition and also of the degree of his recent intimacy with mrs warwick or else as he knew he would have heard more hissing things her patronage of miss paynham exposed her to attacks where she was deemed vulnerable lady dacier muttered old saws as to the flocking of birds he did not accurately understand it thought it indiscreet at best but in regard to his experience he could tell himself that a woman more guileless of luring never drew breath on the contrary candour said it had always been he who had schemed and pressed for the meeting he was at liberty to do it not being bound in honour elsewhere besides despite his acknowledgement of her beauty mrs warwick was not quite his ideal of the perfectly beautiful woman constance asper came nearer to it he had the english taste for red and white and for cold outlines he secretly admired a statuesque demeanour with a statues eyes the national approbation of a reserved haughtiness in woman a tempered disdain in her slightly lifted small upperlip and drooped eyelids was shared by him and constance asper if not exactly aristocratic by birth stood well for that aristocratic insular type which seems to promise the husband of it a casket of all the trusty virtues as well as the security of frigidity in the casket such was daciers native taste consequently the attractions of diana warwick for him were he thought chiefly mental those of a lady egeria she might or might not be good in the vulgar sense she was an agreeable woman an amusing companion very suggestive inciting animating and her past history must be left as her own did it matter to him what he saw was bright a silver crescent on the side of the shadowy ring were it a question of marrying herthat was out of the possibilities he remembered moreover having heard from a man who professed to know that mrs warwick had started in married life by treating her husband cavalierly to an intolerable degree such as no englishman could stand the portly old informant thundered describing it and her in racy vernacular she might be a devil of a wife she was a pleasant friend just the soft bit sweeter than male friends which gave the flavour of sex without the artful seductions he required them strong to move him he looked at last on the green walls of the priory scarcely supposing a fair watcher to be within for the contrasting pale colours of dawn had ceased to quicken the brilliancy of the crescent and summer daylight drowned it to fainter than a silver coin in water it lay dispieced like a pulled rag eastward over surrey stood the full rose of morning the priory clock struck four when the summons of the bell had gained him admittance and he heard that mrs warwick had come in the night he looked back through the doorway at the rosy colour and congratulated himself to think that her hour of watching was at an end a sleepy footman was his informant women were in my lords dressingroom he said upstairs at the deathchamber dacier paused no sound came to him he hurried to his own room paced about and returned expecting to see no one but the dead he turned the handle and the two circles of a shaded lamp on ceiling and on table met his gaze chapter xx diana a nightwatch in the chamber of death he stepped into the room and thrilled to hear the quiet voice beside the bed who is it apologies and excuses were on his tongue the vibration of those grave tones checked them it is you she said she sat in shadow her hands joined on her lap an unopened book was under the lamp he spoke in an underbreath i have just come i was not sure i should find you here pardon there is a chair he murmured thanks and entered into the stillness observing her you have been watching you must be tired no an hour was asked only one i could not leave him watchers are at hand to relieve you it is better for him to have me the chord of her voice told him of the gulf she had sunk in during the night the thought of her endurance became a burden he let fall his breath for patience and tapped the floor with his foot he feared to discompose her by speaking the silence grew more fearful as the very speech of death between them you came i thought it right to let you know instantly i hoped you would come tomorrow i could not delay you have been sitting alone here since eleven i have not found it long you must want some refreshment tea i need nothing it can be made ready in a few minutes i could not eat or drink he tried to brush away the impression of the tomb in the heavily curtained chamber by thinking of the summermorn outside he spoke of it the rosy sky the dewy grass the piping birds she listened as one hearing of a quitted sphere their breathing in common was just heard if either drew a deeper breath at moments his eyes wandered and shut alternately in his mind death had vaster meanings and doubtfuller life cowered under the shadow or outshone it he glanced from her to the figure in the bed and she seemed swallowed he said it is time for you to have rest you know your room i will stay till the servants are up she replied no let this night with him be mine i am not intruding if you wish to remain no traces of weeping were on her face the lampshade revealed it colourless and lustreless her eyes she was robed in black she held her hands clasped you have not suffered oh no she said it without sighing nor was her speech mournful only brief you have seen death before i sat by my father four nights i was a girl then i cried till i had no more tears he felt a burning pressure behind his eyeballs death is natural he said it is natural to the aged when they die honoured she looked where the dead man lay to sit beside the young cut off from their dear opening life a little shudder swept over her oh that you were very good to come we must all thank you for fulfilling his wish he knew it would be my wish her hands pressed together he lies peacefully i have raised the lamp on him and wondered each time so changeless he lies but so like a sleep that will wake we never see peace but in the features of the dead will you look they are beautiful they have a heavenly sweetness the desire to look was evidently recurrent with her dacier rose their eyes fell together on the dead man as thoughtfully as death allows to the creatures of sensation and after he said in low tones i trust to my maker she replied do you see a change since he breathed his last not any you were with him not in the room two minutes later who my father his niece lady cathairn if our lives are lengthened we outlive most of those we would have to close our eyes he had a dear sister she died some years back i helped to comfort him for that loss he told me you did the lamp was replaced on the table for a moment when i withdraw the light from him i feel sadness as if the light we lend to anything were of value to him now she bowed her head deeply dacier left her meditation undisturbed the birds on the walls outside were audible tweeting chirping he went to the windowcurtains and tried the shutterbars it seemed to him that daylight would be cheerfuller for her he had a thirst to behold her standing bathed in daylight shall i open them he asked her i would rather the lamp she said they sat silently until she drew her watch from her girdle my train starts at halfpast six it is a walk of thirtyfive minutes to the station i did it last night in that time you walked here in the dark alone there was no fly to be had the stationmaster sent one of his porters with me we had a talk on the road i like those men dacier read the hour by the mantelpiece clock if you must really go by the early train i will drive you no i will walk i prefer it i will order your breakfast at once he turned on his heel she stopped him no i have no taste for eating or drinking pray said he in visible distress she shook her head i could not i have twenty minutes longer i can find my way to the station it is almost a straight road out of the park gates his heart swelled with anger at the household for they treatment she had been subjected to judging by her resolve not to break bread in the house they resumed their silent sitting the intervals for a word to pass between them were long and the ticking of the timepiece fronting the deathbed ruled the chamber scarcely varied the lamp was raised for the final look the leavetaking dacier buried his face thinking many thingsthe common multitude in insurrection a servant should be told to come now she said i have only to put on my bonnet and i am ready you will take no nothing it is not too late for a carriage to be ordered nothe walk they separated he roused the two women in the dressingroom asleep with heads against the wall thence he sped to his own room for hat and overcoat and a sprinkle of cold water descending the stairs he beheld his companion issuing from the chamber of death her lips were shut her eyelids nervously tremulous they were soon in the warm sweet open air and they walked without an interchange of a syllable through the park into the white hawthorn lane glad to breathe her nostrils took long draughts of air but of the change of scene she appeared scarcely sensible at the parkgates she said there is no necessity four your coming his answer was i think of myself i gain something every step i walk with you today is thursday said she the funeral is monday has been fixed according to his directions he will lie in the churchyard of his villagenot in the family vault i know she said hastily they are privileged who follow him and see the coffin lowered he spoke of this quiet little restingplace yes its a good end i do not wonder at his wish for the honour you have done him i could wish it too but more living than deadthat is a natural wish it is not to be called an honour i should feel it soan honour to me it is a friends duty the word is too harsh it was his friends desire he did not ask it so much as he sanctioned it for to him what has my sitting beside him been he had the prospective happiness he knew well that my soul would be with himas it was last night but he knew it would be my poor human happiness to see him with my eyes touch him with my hand before he passed from our sight dacier exclaimed how you can love is the village church to be seen she asked to the right of those elms that is the spire the black spot below is a yew you love with the whole heart when you love i love my friends she replied you tempt me to envy those who are numbered among them they are not many they should be grateful you have some acquaintance with them all and an enemy had you ever one do you know of one direct and personal designedly i think not we give that title to those who are disinclined to us and add a dash of darker colour to our errors foxes have enemies in the dogs heroines of melodramas have their persecuting villains i suppose that conditions of life exist where one meets the original complexities the bad are in every rank the inveterately malignant i have not found circumstances may combine to make a whisper as deadly as a blow though not of such evil design perhaps if we lived at a court of a magnificent despot we should learn that we are less highly civilized than we imagine ourselves but that is a fire to the passions and the extreme is not the perfect test our civilization counts positive gainsunless you take the melodrama for the truer picture of us it is always the most popular with the english and look what a month june is yesterday morning i was with lady dunstane on her heights and i feel double the age he was fond of this wild country we think it a desert a blank whither he has gone because we will strain to see in the utter dark and nothing can come of that but the bursting of the eyeballs dacier assented theres no use in peering beyond the limits no said she the effect is like the explaining of things to a dull headthe finishing stroke to the understanding better continue to brood we get to some unravelment if we are left to our own efforts i quarrel with no priest of any denomination that they should quarrel among themselves is comprehensible in their wisdom for each has the specific but they show us their way of solving the great problem and we ought to thank them though one or the other abominate us you are advised to talk with lady dunstane on these themes she is perpetually in the antechamber of death and her soul is perennially sunshinesee the pretty cottage under the laburnum curls who lives there his gamekeeper simon rofe and what a playground for the children that bit of common by their gardenpalings and the pond and the blue hills over the furzes i hope those people will not be turned out dacier could not tell he promised to do his best for them but said she you are the lord here now not likely to be the tenant incomes are wanted to support even small estates the reason is good for courting the income he disliked the remark and when she said presently those windmills make the landscape homely he rejoined they remind one of our wheeling london gamins round the cab from the station they remind you said she and smiled at the chance discordant trick he had remembering occasions when it had crossed her this is homelier than rovio she said quite as nice in its way you do not gather flowers here because my friend has these at her feet may one petition without a rival then for a souvenir certainly if you care to have a common buttercup they reached the station five minutes in advance of the train his coming manoeuvre was early detected and she drew from her pocket the little book he had seen lying unopened on the table and said i shall have two good hours for reading you will not object i must accompany you to town permit it i beg you shall not be worried to talk no i came alone and return alone fasting and unprotected are you determined to take away the worst impression of us do not refuse me this favour as to fasting i could not eat and unprotected no woman is in england if she is a thirdclass traveller that is my experience of the class and i shall return among my natural protectorsthe most unselfishly chivalrous to women in the whole world he had set his heart on going with her and he attempted eloquence in pleading but that exposed him to her humour he was tripped it is not denied that you belong to the knightly class she said and it is not necessary that you should wear armour and plumes to proclaim it and your appearance would be ample protection from the drunken sailors travelling you say on this line and i may be deplorably mistaken in imagining that i could tame them but your knightliness is due elsewhere and i commit myself to the fortune of war it is a battle for women everywhere under the most favourable conditions among my dear common english i have not my maid with me or else i should not dare she paid for a thirdclass ticket amused by daciers look of entreaty and trouble of course i obey he murmured i have the habit of exacting it in matters concerning my independence she said and it arrested some rumbling notions in his head as to a piece of audacity on the starting of the train they walked up and down the platform till the bell rang and the train came rounding beneath an arch oh by the way may i askhe said was it your article in whitmonbys journal on a speech of mine last week the guilty writer is confessed let me thank you dont but try to believe it written on public groundsif the task is not too great i may call you will be welcome to tell you of the funeralthe last of him do not fail to come she could have laughed to see him jumping on the steps of the thirdclass carriages one after another to choose her company for her in those pre democratic blissful days before the miry deluge the opinion of the requirements of poor english travellers entertained by the seigneur directors of the class above them was that they differed from cattle in stipulating for seats with the exception of that provision to suit their weakness the accommodation extended to them resembled pens and the seats were emphatically seats of penitence intended to grind the sitter for his mean pittance payment and absence of aspiration to a higher state hard angular wood a low roof a shabby square of window aloof demanding of him to quit the seat he insisted on having if he would indulge in views of the passing scenerysuch was the furniture of dens where a refinement of castigation was practised on villain poverty by denying leathers to the windows or else buttons to the leathers so that the windows had either to be up or down but refused to shelter and freshen simultaneously dacier selected a compartment occupied by two old women a mother and babe and little maid and a labouring man there he installed her with an eager look that she would not notice you will want the window down he said she applied to her fellowtravellers for the permission and struggling to get the window down he was irritated to animadvert on these carriages of the benevolent railway company do not forget that the wealthy are well treated or you may be unjust said she to pacify him his mouth sharpened its line while he tried arts and energies on the refractory window she told him to leave it you cant breathe this atmosphere he cried and called to a porter who did the work remarking that it was rather stiff the door was banged and fastened dacier had to hang on the step to see her in the farewell from the platform he saw the top of her bonnet and why she should have been guilty of this freak of riding in an unwholesome carriage tasked his power of guessing he was too english even to have taken the explanation for he detested the distinguishing of the races in his country and could not therefore have comprehended her peculiar tenacity of the sense of injury as long as enthusiasm did not arise to obliterate it he required a course of lessons in irish sauntering down the lane he called at simon rofes cottage and spoke very kindly to the gamekeepers wife that might please diana it was all he could do at present chapter xxi the young minister of state descriptions in the newspapers of the rural funeral of lord dannisburgh had the effect of rousing flights of tattlers with a twittering of the disused name of warwick our social gods renewed their combat and the verdict of the jury was again overhauled to be attacked and maintained the carpers replying to the champions that they held to their view of it as heads of bulldogs are expected to do when they have got a grip of one it is a point of muscular honour with them never to relax their hold they will tell you whythey formed that opinion from the first and but for the swearing of a particular witness upon whom the plaintiff had been taught to rely the verdict would have been differentto prove their soundness of judgement they could speak from private positive information of certain damnatory circumstances derived from authentic sources visits of a gentleman to the house of a married lady in the absence of the husband ohthe british lucretia was very properly not legally at home to the masculine world of that day she plied her distaff in pure seclusion meditating on her absent lord or else a fair proportion of the masculine world which had not yet has not yet doubled cape turk approved her condemnation to the sack there was talk in the feminine world at lady wathins assemblies the elevation of her husband had extended and deepened her influence on the levels where it reigned before but without strange as we may think it now assisting to her own elevation much aspired for to the smooth and lively upper pavement of society above its tumbled strata she was near that distinguished surface not on it her circle was practically the same as it was previous to the coveted nominal rank enabling her to trample on those beneath it and women like that mrs warwick a woman of no birth no money not even honest character enjoyed the entry undisputed circulated among the highestbecause people took her rattle for witand because also our nobility lady wathin feared had no due regard for morality our aristocracy brilliant and ancient though it was merited rebuke she grew severe upon aristocratic scandals whereof were plenty among the frolicsome host just overhead as vexatious as the drawingroom party to the lodger in the floor below who has not received an invitation to partake of the festivities and is required to digest the noise but if ambition is oversensitive moral indignation is ever consolatory for it plants us on the judgement seat there indeed we may sitting with the very highest forget our personal disappointments in dispensing reprobation for misconduct however eminent the offenders she was lady wathin and once on an afternoons call to see poor lady dunstane at her townhouse she had been introduced to lady pennon a patroness of mrs warwick and had met a snuban icy checkbow of the aristocratic head from the top of the spinal column and not a word not a look the halfturn of a head devoid of mouth and eyes she practised that forbidding checkbow herself to perfection so the endurance of it was horrible a noli me tangere her husband termed it in his ridiculous equanimity and he might term it what he pleasedit was insulting the solace she had was in hearing that hideous radical revolutionary things were openly spoken at mrs warwicks evenings with her friendsimpudently named the elect of london pleasing to reflect upon mrs warwick as undermining her supporters to bring them some day down with a crash her elect of london were a queer gathering by report of them and mr whitmonby too no doubt a celebrity was the righthand man at these dinnerparties of mrs warwick where will not men go to be flattered by a pretty woman he had declined repeated successive invitations to lady wathins table but there of course he would not have had the freedom that is she rejoiced in thinking defensively and offensively a moral wall enclosed her topics the hon percy dacier had been brought to her thursday afternoon by mr quintin manx and he had one day dined with her and he knew mrs warwicka little he said the opportunity was not lost to convey to him entirely in the interest of sweet constance asper that the moral world entertained a settled view of the very clever woman mrs warwick certainly was he had asked diana on their morning walk to the station whether she had an enemy so prone are men educated by the drama and fiction in the belief that the garden of civilized life must be at the mercy of the old wild devourers to fancy villain whispers an indication of direct animosity lady wathin had no sentiment of the kind but she had become acquainted with the other side of the famous dannisburgh casethe unfortunate plaintiff and compassion as well as morality moved her to put on a speaking air when mr warwicks name was mentioned she pictured him to the ladies of her circle as one of our true gentlemen in his deportment and his feelings he was she would venture to say her ideal of an english gentleman but now she added commiseratingly ruined ruined in his health and in his prospects a lady inquired if it was the verdict that had thus affected him lady wathins answer was reported over moral or substratum london he is the victim of a fatal passion for his wife and would take her back to morrow were she to solicit his forgiveness morality had something to say against this active marital charity attributable it was to be feared to weakness of character on the part of the husband still mrs warwick undoubtedly was one of those women of satanic construction who have the art of enslaving the men unhappy enough to cross their path the nature of the art was hinted with the delicacy of dainty feet which have to tread in mire to get to safety men alas are snared in this way instances too numerous for the good repute of the swinish sex were cited and the question of how morality was defensible from their grossness passed without a tactical reply there is no defence those women come like the cholera morbusand owing to similar causes they will prevail until the ideas of men regarding women are purified nevertheless the husband who could forgive even propose to forgive was deemed by consent generous however weak though she might not have been wholly guilty she had bitterly offended and he despatched an emissary to herthe theme one may in their language fear was relished as a sugared acid it was renewed in the late autumn of the year when antonia published her new book entitled the young minister of state the signature of the authoress was now known and from this resurgence of her name in public suddenly a radiation of tongues from the circle of lady wathin declared that the repentant mrs warwick had gone back to her husbands bosom and forgiveness the rumour spread in spite of sturdy denials at odd corners counting the redhot proposal of mr sullivan smith to eat his head and boots for breakfast if it was proved correct it filled a yawn of the clubs for the afternoon soon this wanton rumour was met and stifled by another of more morbific density heavily charged as that which led the sad eliza to her pyre antonias hero was easily identified the young minister of state could be he only who was now at all her parties always meeting her had been spied walking with her daily in the park near her house on his march down to westminster during the session and who positively went to concerts and sat under fiddlers to be near her it accounted moreover for his treatment of constance asper what effrontery of the authoress to placard herself with him in a book the likeness of the hero to percy dacier once established became striking to glaringnessa proof of her ability and more of her audacity still more of her intention to flatter him up to his perdition by the things written of him one would imagine the conversations going on behind the scenes she had the wiles of a cleopatra not without some of the nilenes experiences a youthful antony dacier would be little likely to escape her toils and so promising a young man the sigh the tear for weeping over his destruction almost fell such vivid realizing of the prophesy appeared in its pathetic pronouncement this low rumour or malaria began blowing in the winter and did not travel fast for strangely there was hardly a breath of it in the atmosphere of dacier none in dianas it rose from groups not so rapidly and largely mixing and less quick to kindle whose crazy sincereness battened on the smallest morsel of fact and collected the fictitious by slow absorption but as guardians of morality often doing good duty in their office they are persistent when parliament assembled mr quintin manx a punctual member of the house if nothing else arrived in town he was invited to dine with lady wathin after dinner she spoke to him of the absent constance and heard of her being well and expressed a great rejoicing at that whereupon the burly old shipowner frowned and puffed constance he said had plunged into these new spangle candle and high singing services was all for symbols harps effigies what not lady wathins countenance froze in hearing of it she led mr quintin to a wallsofa and said surely the dear child must have had a disappointment for her to have taken to those foolish displays of religion it is generally a sign well maammy ladyi let girls go their ways in such things i dont interfere but its that fellow or nobody with her she has fixed her girls mind on him and if she cant columbine as a bride she will as a nun young people must be at some harlequinade but it is very shocking and he he plays last and loose warm and cold im ready to settle twenty times a noblemans dowry on my niece and shes a fine girl a handsome girl educated up to the brim fit to queen it in any drawingroom he holds her by some arts that dont hold him it seems hes all for politics constance can scarcely be his dupe so far i should think how do you mean everything points to one secret of his conduct a woman lady wathins head shook for her sexs pained affirmative mr quintin in the same fashion signified the downright negative the fellows as cold as a fish flattery will do anything there is i fear one widow wife maid married i regret to say well if hed get over with it said quintin in whose notions the seductiveness of a married woman could be only temporary for all the reasons pertaining to her state at the same time his view of percy dacier was changed in thinking it possible that a woman could divert him from his political and social interests he looked incredulous you have heard of a mrs warwick said lady wathin warwick i have ive never seen her at my brokers in the city yesterday i saw the name on a memorandum of purchase of shares in a concern promising ten per cent and not likely to carry the per annum into the plural he told me she was a grand kind of woman past advising for what amount some thousands i think it was she has no money lady wathin corrected her emphasis or ought to have none she cant have got it from him did you notice her christian name i dont recollect it if i did i thought the woman a donkey would you consider me a busybody were i to try to mitigate this womans evil influence i love dear constance and should be happy to serve her i want my girl married said old quintin hes one of my parliamentary chiefs with firstrate prospects good family good sober fellowat least i thought so by nature i mean barring your incantations he suits me she liking him she admires him i am sure shes dead on end for the fellow lady wathin felt herself empowered by quintin manx to undertake the release of sweet constance aspers knight from the toils of his enchantress for this purpose she had first an interview with mr warwick and next she hurried to lady dunstane at copsley there after jumbling mr warwicks connubial dispositions and mrs warwicks last book and mr percy daciers engagement to the great heiress in a gossipy hotchpotch she contrived to gather a few items of fact as that the young minister was probably modelled upon mr percy dacier lady dunstane made no concealment of it as soon as she grew sensible of the angling but she refused her help to any reconciliation between mr and mrs warwick she declined to listen to lady wathins entreaties she declined to give her reasonsthese bookworm women whose pride it is to fancy that they can think for themselves have a great deal of the heathen in them as morality discovers when it wears the enlistment ribands and applies yo them to win recruits for a service under the direct blessing of providence lady wathin left some darts behind her in the form of moral exclamations and really intended morally for though she did not like mrs warwick she had no wish to wound other than by stopping her further studies of the young minister and conducting him to the young lady loving him besides restoring a bereft husband to his own how sadly pale and worn poor mr warwick appeared the portrayal of his withered visage to lady dunstane had quite failed to gain a show of sympathy and so it is ever with your bookworm women pretending to be philosophical you sound them vainly for a manifestation of the commonest human sensibilities they turn over the leaves of a latin book on their laps while you are supplicating them to assist in a work of charity lady wathins interjectory notes haunted emmas ear yet she had seen nothing in tony to let her suppose that there was trouble of her heart below the surface and her tony when she came to copsley shone in the mood of the day of lord dannisburghs drive down from london with her she was running on a fresh work talked of composition as a trifle i suppose the young minister is mr percy dacier said emma between ourselves he is diana replied smiling at a secret guessed you know my model and can judge of the likeness you write admiringly of him tony and i do admire him so would you emmy if you knew him as well as i do now he pairs with mr redworth he also is the friend of women but he lifts us to rather a higher level of intellectual friendship when the ice has meltedand it is thick at firsthe pours forth all his ideas without reserve and they are deep and noble ever since lord dannisburghs death and our sitting together we have been warm friends intimate i would say if it could be said of one so selfcontained in that respect no young man was ever comparable with him and i am encouraged to flatter myself that he unbends to me more than to others he is engaged or partly i hear why does he not marry i wish he would diana said with a most brilliant candour of aspect emma read in it that it would complete her happiness possibly by fortifying her sense of security and that seemed right her own meditations illumined by the beautiful face in her presence referred to the security of mr dacier so then life is going smoothly said emma yes at a good pace and smoothly not a torrentthameslike without oerflowing full it is not lugano and the salvatore perhaps it is better as action is better than musing no troubles whatever none well except an adorer at times i have to take him as my portion an impassioned caledonian has a little bothered me i met him at lady pennons and have been meeting him as soon as i put foot out of my house ever since if i could impress and impound him to marry mary paynham i should be glad by the way i have consented to let her try at a portrait of me no i have no troubles i have friends the choicest of the nation i have health a field for labour fairish success with it a mind alive such as it is i feel like that midsummer morning of our last drive out together the sun high clearish clouded enough to be cool and still i envy emmy on her sofa mastering latin biting at greek what a wise recommendation that was of mr redworths he works well in the house he spoke excellently the other night he runs over to ireland this easter he sees for himself and speaks with authority he sees and feels englishmen mean well but they require an extremity of misery to waken their feelings it is coming he says and absit omen mr dacier says he is the one englishman who may always be sure of an irish hearing and he does not cajole them you know but the english defect is really not want of feeling so much as want of foresight they will not look ahead a famine ceasing a rebellion crushed they jog on as before with their dobbin trot and blinker confidence in saxon energy they should study the irish i think it was mr redworth who compared the governing of the irish to the management of a horse the rider should not grow restive when the steed begins to kick calmer firm calm persuasive does mr dacier agree not always he has the inveterate national belief that celtic blood is childish and the consequently illogical disregard of its hold of impressions the irishfor i have them in my heart though i have not been among them for long at a timemust love you to serve you and will hate you if you have done them injury and they have not wiped it out they with a treble revenge or you with cordial benefits i have told him so again and again ventured to suggest measures he listens to you tony he says i have brains it ends in a compliment you have inspired mr redworth if i have i have lived for some good altogether her tonys conversation proved to emma that her perusal of the model of the young minister of state was an artists free open and not discoloured by the personal tincture her heart plainly was free and undisturbed she had the same girls love of her walks where wildflowers grew if possible a keener pleasure she hummed of her happiness in being at copsley singing her planxty kelly and the puritani by turns she stood on land she was not on the seas emma thought so with good reason she stood on land it was true but she stood on a cliff of the land the seas below and about her and she was enabled to hoodwink her friend because the assured sensation of her firm footing deceived her own soul even while it took short flights to the troubled waters of her firm footing she was exultingly proud she stood high close to danger without giddiness if at intervals her soul flew out like lightning from the rift a mere shot of involuntary fancy it seemed to her the suspicion of instability made her draw on her treasury of impressions of the mornings at luganoher loftiest purest dearest and these reinforced her she did not ask herself why she should have to seek them for aid in other respects her mind was alert and held no sly covers as the fiction of a perfect ignorant innocence combined with common intelligence would have us to suppose that the minds of women can do she was honest as long as she was not directly questioned pierced to the innermost and sanctum of the bosom she could honestly summon bright light to her eyes in wishing the man were married she did not ask herself why she called it up the remorseless progressive interrogations of a jesuit father in pursuit of the bosoms verity might have transfixed it and shown her to herself even then a tossing vessel as to the spirit far away from that firm land she trod so bravely descending from the woody heights upon london diana would have said that her only anxiety concerned young mr arthur rhodes whose position she considered precarious and who had recently taken a drubbing for venturing to show a peep of his head like an early crocus in the literary market her antonias last book had been reviewed obediently to smart taps from the then commanding baton of mr tonans and mr whitmonbys choice picking of specimens down three columns of his paper a literary review charles rainers property had suggested that perhaps the talented authoress might be writing too rapidly and another actuated by the public taste of the period for our vigorous homely saxon in one and two syllable words had complained of a tendency to polysyllabic phraseology the remainder a full majority had sounded eulogy with all their bandinstruments drum trumpet fife trombone her foregoing work had raised her to fame which is the court of a queen when the lady has beauty and social influence and critics are her dedicated courtiers gaping for the royal mouth to be opened and reserving the kicks of their independent manhood for infamous outsiders whom they hoist in the style and particular service of pitchforks they had fallen upon a little volume of verse like a body of barndoor hens on a stranger chick diana complained and she chid herself angrily for letting it escape her forethought to propitiate them on the authors behalf young rhodes was left with scarce a feather and what remained to him appeared a preposterous ornament for the decoration of a shivering and welted poet he laughed or tried the mouth of laughter antonias literary conscience was vexed at the different treatment she had met and so imperatively needed that the reverse of it would have threatened the smooth sailing of her costly household a merrygoround of creditors required a corresponding whirligig of receipts she felt mercenary debased by comparison with the wellscourged verse mason orpheus of the untenanted city who had done his publishing ingenuously for glory a good instance of the comicpathetic she wrote to emma begging her to take him in at copsley for a few days i told you i had no troubles i am really troubled about this poor boy he has very little money and has embarked on literature i cannot induce any of my friends to lend him a hand mr redworth gruffly insists on his going back to his lawclerks office and stool and mr dacier says that no place is vacant the reality of lord dannisburghs death is brought before me by my helplessness he would have made him an assistant private secretary pending a government appointment rather than let me plead in vain mr rhodes with his travelling bag was packed off to copsley to enjoy a change of scene after his run of the gauntlet he was very heartily welcomed by lady dunstane both for her tonys sake and his own modest worship of that luminary which could permit of being transparent but chiefly she welcomed him as the living proof of tonys disengagement from anxiety since he was her one spot of trouble and could easily be comforted by reading with her and wandering through the spring woods along the heights he had a happy time midway in air between his accomplished hostess and his protecting goddess his bruises were soon healed each day was radiant to him whether it rained or shone and by his looks and what he said of himself lady dunstane understood that he was in the highest temper of the human creature tuned to thrilling accord with nature it was her generous tonys work she blessed it and liked the youth the better during the stay of mr arthur rhodes at copsley sir lukin came on a visit to his wife he mentioned reports in the scandalpapers one that mr p d would shortly lead to the altar the lovely heiress miss a percy dacier and constance asperanother that a reconciliation was to be expected between the beautiful authoress mrs w and her husband perhaps its the best thing she can do sir lukin added lady dunstane pronounced a womans unforgiving never the revolt of her own sensations assured her of tonys unconquerable repugnance in conversation subsequently with arthur rhodes she heard that he knew the son of mr warwicks attorney a mr fern and he had gathered from him some information of mr warwicks condition of health it had been alarming young fern said it was confirmed heartdisease his father frequently saw mr warwick and said he was fretting himself to death it seemed just a possibility that tonys natural compassionateness had wrought on her to immolate herself and nurse to his end the man who had wrecked her life lady dunstane waited for the news at last she wrote touching the report incidentally there was no reply the silence ensuing after such a question responded forcibly chapter xxii between diana and dacier the wind east over bleak land on the third day of the easter recess percy dacier landed from the havre steamer at caen and drove straightway for the sandy coast past fields of colza to brineblown meadows of coarse grass and then to the low dunes and long stretching sands of the ebb in semicircle a desolate place at that season with a dwarf fishingvillage by the shore an east wind driving landward in streamers every object that had a scrap to fly he made head to the inn where the first person he encountered in the passage was dianas maid danvers who relaxed from the dramatic exaggeration of her surprise at the sight of a real english gentleman in these woebegone regions to inform him that her mistress might be found walking somewhere along the seashore and had her dog to protect her they were to stay here a whole week danvers added for a conveyance of her private sentiments second thoughts however whispered to her shrewdness that his arrival could only be by appointment she had been anticipating something of the sort for some time dacier butted against the stringing wind that kept him at a rocking incline to his left for a mile he then discerned in what had seemed a dredgers dot on the sands a ladys figure unmistakably she without the corroborating testimony of leander pawdeep in the lowtide water she was out at a distance on the ebbsands hurtled gyred beaten to all shapes in rolls twists volumes like a blown bannerflag by the pressing wind a kerchief tied her bonnet under her chin bonnet and breastribands rattled rapidly as drummersticks she stood near the little running ripple of the flat seawater as it hurried from a long streaked back to a tiny imitation of spray when she turned to the shore she saw him advancing but did not recognize when they met she merely looked with wide parted lips this was no appointment i had to see you dacier said she coloured to a deeper red than the roseconjuring wind had whipped in her cheeks her quick intuition of the reason of his coming barred a mental evasion and she had no thought of asking either him or herself what special urgency had brought him i have been here four days lady esquart spoke of the place lady esquart should not have betrayed me she did it inadvertently without an idea of my profiting by it diana indicated the scene in a glance dreary country do you think anywheresaid he they walked up the sandheap the roaring easter with its shrieks and whistles at her ribands was not favourable to speech his anywhere had a penetrating significance the fuller for the break that left it vague speech between them was commanded he could not be suffered to remain she descended upon a sheltered pathway running along a ditch the border of pastures where cattle cropped raised heads and resumed their one comforting occupation diana gazed on them smarting from the buffets of the wind she had met no play of their tails today she said as she slackened her steps you left lady esquart well lady esquart i think was well i had to see you i thought you would be with her in berkshire she told me of a little seaside place close to caen you had to see me i miss you now if its a day i heard a story in london in london there are many stories i heard one is there a foundation for it no he breathed relieved i wanted to see you once before if it was true it would have made a change in my lifea gap you do me the honour to like my sunday evenings beyond everything london can offer a letter would have reached me i should have had to wait for the answer there is no truth in it her choice was to treat the direct assailant frankly or imperil her defence by the ordinary feminine evolutions which might be taken for inviting poor pranks always there have been overtures she said forgive me i have scarcely the right to ask speak of it my friends may use their right to take an interest in my fortunes i thought i might on my way to paris turn aside coming by this route if you determined not to lose much of your time the coolness of her fencing disconcerted a gentleman conscious of his madness she took instant advantage of any circuitous move she gave him no practicable point he was little skilled in the arts of attack and felt that she checked his impetuousness respected her for it chafed at it writhed with the fervours precipitating him here and relapsed on his pleasure in seeing her face hearing her voice your happiness i hope is the chief thought in such a case he said i am sure you would consider it i cant quite forget my own you compliment an ambitious hostess dacier glanced across the pastures what was it that tempted you to this place a poet would say it looks like a figure in the shroud it has no features it has a sort of grandeur belonging to death i heard of it as the place where i might be certain of not meeting an acquaintance and i am the intruder an hour or two will not give you that title am i to count the minutes by my watch by the sun we will supply you an omelette and piquette and send you back sobered and friarlyto caen for paris at sunset let the fare be spartan i could take my black broth with philosophy every day of the year under your auspices what i should miss you bring no news of the world or the house none you know as much as i know the irish agitation is chronic the cornlaw threatens to be the same and your chiefin personal colloquy he keeps a calm front i may tell you there is nothing i would not confide to you he has let fall some dubious words in private i dont know what to think of them but if he should waver its not wavering its the openness of his mind ah the mind we imagine it free the house and the country are the sentient frame governing the mind of the politician more than his ideas he cannot think independently of themnor i of my natural anatomy you will test the truth of that after your omelette and piquette and marvel at the quitting of your line of route for paris as soon as the mind attempts to think independently it is like a kite with the cord cut and performs a series of darts and frisks that have the look of wildest liberty till you see it fall flat to earth the openness of his mind is most honourable to him ominous for his party likely to be good for his country that is the question prepare to encounter it in politics i am with the active minority on behalf of the inert but suffering majority that is my rule it leads unless you have a despotism to the conquering side it is always the noblest i wont say listen to me only do believe my words have some weight this is a question of bread it involves many other questions and how clearly those leaders put their case they are admirable debaters if i were asked to write against them i should have but to quote them to confound my argument i tried it once and wasted a couple of my precious hours they are cogent debaters dacier assented they make me wince now and then without convincing me i own it to you the confession is not agreeable though its a small matter ones pride may feel a touch with the foils as keenly as the point of a rapier said diana the remark drew a sharp look of pleasure from him does the princess egeria propose to dismiss the individual she inspires when he is growing most sensible of her wisdom a young minister of state should be gleaning at large when holiday is granted him dacier coloured may i presume on what is currently reported parts parts a bit here a bit there she rejoined authors find their models where they can and generally hit on the nearest happy the nearest if you run to interjections i shall cite you a sentence from your latest speech in the house he asked for it and to school him she consented to flatter with her recollection of his commonest words dealing with subjects of this nature emotionally does not advance us a calculable inch i must have said that in relation to hard matter of business it applies there is my hostelry and the spectral form of danvers utterly depaysee have you spoken to the poor soul i can never discover the links of her attachment to my service she knows a good mistressi have but a few minutes if you are relentless may i shall i ever be privileged to speak your christian name my christian name it is pagan in one sphere i am hecate remember that i am not among the people who so regard you the time may come diana constance i break no tie i owe no allegiance whatever to the name keep to the formal title with me we are mrs warwick and mr dacier i think i am two years younger than you socially therefore ten in seniority and i know how this flower of friendship is nourished and may be withered you see already what you have done you have cast me on the discretion of my maid i suppose her trusty but i am at her mercy and a breath from her to the people beholding me as hecate queen of witches i have a sensation of the scirocco it would blow in that event the least i can offer is my whole life we will not conjecture the event the best i could hope for i see i shall have to revise the next edition of the young minister and make an emotional curate of him observe danvers the woman is wretched and now she sees me coming she pretends to be using her wits in studying the things about her as i have directed she is a riddle i have the idea that any morning she may explode and yet i trust her and sleep soundly i must be free though i vex the worlds watchdogsso danvers you are noticing how thoroughly frenchwomen do their work danvers replied with a slight mincing they may maam but they chatter chatter so the result proves that it is not a waste of energy they manage their fowls too theyve no such thing as mutton maam dacier patriotically laughed she strikes the apology for wealthy and leisurely landlords diana said danvers remarked that the poor fed meagrely in france she was not convinced of its being good for them by hearing that they could work on it sixteen hours out of the four and twenty mr percy daciers repast was furnished to him half an hour later at sunset diana taking danvers beside her walked with him to the line of the country road bearing on caen the wind had sunk a large brown disk paused rayless on the western hills a dacier ought to feel at home in normandy and you may have sprung from this neighbourhood said she simply to chat here the land is poorish and a mile inland rich enough to bear repeated crops of colza which tries the soil i hear as for beauty those blue hills you see enfold charming valleys i meditate an expedition to harcourt before i return an english professor of his native tongue at the lycee at caen told me on my way here that for twenty shillings a week you may live in royal ease round about harcourt so we have our bed and board in prospect if fortune fails us danvers i would rather die in england maam was the maids reply dacier set foot on his carriagestep he drew a long breath to say a short farewell and he and diana parted they parted as the plainest of sincere good friends each at heart respecting the other for the repression of that which their hearts craved any word of which might have carried them headlong bound together on a mazepparace with scandal for the hounding wolves and social ruin for the rocks and torrents dacier was the thankfuller the most admiring of the two at the same time the least satisfied he saw the abyss she had aided him in escaping and it was refreshful to look abroad after his desperate impulse prominent as he stood before the world he could not think without a shudder of behaving like a young frenetic of the passion those whose aim is at the leadership of the english people know that however truly based the charges of hypocrisy soundness of moral fibre runs throughout the country and is the national integrity which may condone old sins for present service but will not have present sins to flout it he was in tune with the english character the passion was in him nevertheless and the stronger for a slow growth that confirmed its union of the mind and heart her counsel fortified him her suggestions opened springs her phrases were goldenlettered in his memory and more she had worked an extraordinary change in his views of life and aptitude for social converse he acknowledged it with genial candour through her he was encouraged led excited to sparkle with the witty feel new gifts or a greater breadth of nature and thanking her he became thirstily susceptible to her dark beauty he claimed to have found the key of her and he prized it she was not passionless the blood flowed warm proud chaste she was nobly spirited having an intellectual refuge from the besiegings of the blood a rockfortress the wife no wife appeared to him striking the higher elements of the man the commonly masculine alsowould he espouse her had he the chance tomorrow this instant with her to back him he would be doubled in manhood doubled in brain and heartenergy to call her wife spring from her and return a man might accept his fate to fight trojan or greek sure of his mark on the enemy but if after all this imputed helen of a decayed paris passed submissive to the legitimate solicitor back to her husband the thought shot dacier on his legs for a look at the blank behind him he vowed she had promised it should not be could it ever be after the ruin the meanly suspicious fellow had brought upon herdiana voluntarily reunited to the treacherous cur he sat resolving sombrely that if the debate arose he would try what force he had to save her from such an ignominy and dedicate his life to her let the world wag its tongue so the knot would be cut men unaccustomed to a knot in their system find the prospect of cutting it an extreme relief even when they know that the cut has an edge to wound mortally as well as pacify the wound was not heavy payment for the rapture of having so incomparable a woman his own he reflected wonderingly on the husband as he had previously done and came again to the conclusion that it was a poor creature abjectly jealous of a wife he could neither master nor equal nor attract and thinking of jealousy dacier felt none none of individuals only of facts her marriage her bondage her condemnation to perpetual widowhood angered him as at an unrighteous decree the sharp sweet bloom of her beauty fresh in swarthiness under the whipping easter cried out against that loathed inhumanity or he made it cry being a stranger to the jealousy of men he took the soft assurance that he was preferred above them all competitors were numerous not any won her eyes as he did she revealed nothing of the same pleasures in the shining of the others touched by her magical wand would she have pardoned one of them the diana bursting from his mouth she was not a woman for trifling still less for secresy he was as little the kind of lover both would be ready to take up their burden if the burden was laid on them diana had thus far impressed him meanwhile he faced the cathedral towers of the ancient norman city standing up in the smoky hues of the west and a sentence out of her book seemed fitting to the scene and what he felt he rolled it over luxuriously as the next of delights to having her beside himshe wrote of thoughts that are bare dark outlines coloured by some odd passion of the soul like towers of a distant city seen in the funeral waste of dayhis bluff english antipoetic training would have caused him to shrug at the stuff coming from another pen he might condescendingly have criticized it with a sneer embalmed in humour the words were hers she had written them almost by a sort of anticipation he imagined for he at once fell into the mood they suggested and had a full crop of the bare dark outlines of thoughts coloured by his particular form of passion diana had impressed him powerfully when she set him swallowing and assimilating a sentence ethereally thin in substance of mere sentimental significance that he would antecedently have read aloud in a drawing room picking up the book by hazard as your modern specimen of romantic vapouring mr dacier however was at the time in observation of the towers of caen fresh from her presence animated to some conception of her spirit he drove into the streets desiring half determining to risk a drive back on the morrow the cold light of the morrow combined with his fear of distressing her to restrain him perhaps he thought it well not to risk his gains he was a northerner in blood he may have thought it well not further to run the personal risk immediately chapter xxiii records a visit to diana from one of the worlds good women pure disengagement of contemplativeness had selected percy dacier as the model of her young minister of state diana supposed could she otherwise have dared to sketch him she certainly would not have done it now that was a reflection similar to what is entertained by one who has dropped from a precipice to the midway ledge over the abyss where caution of the whole sensitive being is required for simple self preservation how could she have been induced to study and portray him it seemed a form of dementia she thought this while imagining the world to be interrogating her when she interrogated herself she flew to lugano and her celestial salvatore that she might be defended from a charge of the dreadful weakness of her sex surely she there had proof of her capacity for pure disengagement even in recollection the springs of spiritual happiness renewed the bubbling crystal play she believed that a divineness had wakened in her there to strengthen her to the end ward her from any complicity in her sexs culprit blushing daciers cry of her name was the cause she chose to think of the excessive circumspection she must henceforth practise precariously footing embracing hardest earth the plainest rules to get back to safety not that she was personally endangered or at least not spiritually she could always fly in soul to her heights but she had now to be on guard constantly in the fencing attitude and watchful of herself as well that was admitted with a ready frankness to save it from being a necessitated and painful confession for the voluntary acquiescence if it involved her in her sex claimed an individual exemption women are women and i am a woman but i am i and unlike them i see we are weak and weakness tempts in owning the prudence of guarded steps i am armed it is by dissembling feigning immunity that we are imperilled she would have phrased it so with some anger at her feminine nature as well as at the subjection forced on her by circumstances besides her position and percy daciers threw the fancied danger into remoteness the world was her stepmother vigilant to become her judge and the world was his taskmaster hopeful of him yet able to strike him down for an offence she saw their situation as he did the course of folly must be bravely taken if taken at all disguise degraded her to the reptiles this was faced consequently there was no fear of it she had very easily proved that she had skill and selfpossession to keep him rational and therefore they could continue to meet a little outburst of frenzy to a reputably handsome woman could be treated as the froth of a passing wave men have the trick infants their fevers dianas days were spent in reasoning her nights were not so tuneable to the superior mind when asleep she was the sport of elves that danced her into tangles too deliciously unravelled and left new problems for the wiseeyed and anxious morning she solved them with the thought that in sleep it was the mere ordinary woman who fell a prey to her tormentors awake she dispersed the swarm her sky was clear gradually the persecution ceased thanks to her active pen a letter from her legal adviser old mr braddock informed her that no grounds existed for apprehending marital annoyance and late in may her household had resumed its customary round she examined her accounts the debit and credit sides presented much of the appearance of male and female in our jogtrot civilization they matched middling well with rather too marked a tendency to strain the leash and run frolic on the part of friend debit the wanton male which deepened the blush of the comparison her father had noticed the same funny thing in his effort to balance his tugging accounts now then for a look at man and wife except that he made debit stand for the portly frisky female credit the decorous and contracted other half a prim gentleman of a constitutionally lean habit of body remonstrating with her you seem to forget that we are married my dear and must walk in step or bundle into the bench dan merion used to say diana had not so much to rebuke in mr debit or not at the first reckoning but his ways were curious she grew distrustful of him after dismissing him with a quiet admonition and discovering a series of ambush bills which he must have been aware of when he was allowed to pass as an honourable citizen his answer to her reproaches pleaded the necessitousness of his purchases and expenditure a capital plea and mrs credit was requested by him in a courteous manner to drive her pen the faster so that she might wax to a corresponding size and satisfy the worlds idea of fitness in couples she would have costly furniture because it pleased her taste and a french cook for a like reason in justice to her guests and trained servants and her tribe of pensioners flowers she would have profuse and fresh at her windows and over the rooms and the pictures and engravings on the walls were always for the good reason mentioned choice ones and she had a love of old lace she loved colours as she loved cheerfulness and silks and satin hangings indian ivory carvings countless mirrors oriental woods chairs and desks with some feature or a flourish in them delicate tables with antelope legs of approved workmanship in the chronology of european upholstery and marble clocks of cunning device to symbol time mantelpiece decorations illustrated editions of her favourite authors her bedchambers too gave the nest for sleep a dainty cosiness in aerial draperies hence more or less directly the peccant bills credit was reduced to reckon to a nicety the amount she could rely on positively her fixed income from her investments and the letting of the crossways the days of halfyearly payments that would magnify her to some proportions beside the alarming growth of her partner who was proud of it and referred her to the treasures she could summon with her pen at a murmur of dissatisfaction his compliments were sincere they were seductive he assured her that she had struck a rich vein in an inexhaustible mine by writing only a very little faster she could double her income counting a broader popularity treble it and so on a tide of success down the widening river to a sea sheer golden behold how it sparkles are we then to stint our winged hours of youth for want of courage to realize the riches we can command debit was eloquent he was unanswerable another calculator an accustomed and lamentablyscrupulous arithmetician had been at work for some time upon a speculative summing of the outlay of dianas establishment as to its chances of swamping the income redworth could guess pretty closely the cost of a house hold if his care for the holder set him venturing on aver ages he knew nothing of her ten per cent investment and considered her fixed income a beggarly regiment to marshal against the invader he fancied however in his ignorance of literary profits that a popular writer selling several editions had come to an el dorado there was the mine it required a diligent worker diana was often struck by hearing redworth ask her when her next book might be expected he appeared to have an eagerness in hurrying her to produce and she had to say that she was not a nimble writer his flattering impatience was vexatious he admired her work yet he did his utmost to render it little admirable his literary taste was not that of young arthur rhodes to whom she could read her chapters appearing to take counsel upon them while drinking the eulogies she suspected him of prosaic ally wishing her to make money and though her exchequer was beginning to know the need of it the authors lofty mind disdained such sordidness to be excused possibly for a failing productive energy she encountered obstacles to imaginative composition with the pen in her hand she would fall into heavy musings break a sentence to muse and not on the subject she slept unevenly at night was drowsy by day unless the open air was about her or animating friends redworths urgency to get her to publish was particularly annoying when she felt how greatly the young minister of state would have been improved had she retained the work to brood over it polish rewrite passages perfect it her musings embraced long dialogues of that work never printed they sprang up they passed from memory leaving a distaste for her present work the cantatrice far more poetical than the preceding in the opinion of arthur rhodes and the story was more romantic modelled on a prima donna she had met at the musical parties of henry wilmers after hearing redworth tell of charles rainers quaint passion for the woman or the idea of the woman diana had courted her studied and liked her the picture she was drawing of the amiable and gifted italian of her villain roumanian husband and of the eccentric highminded devoted englishman was good in a fashion but considering the theme she had reasonable apprehension that her cantatrice would not repay her for the time and labour bestowed on it no clever transcripts of the dialogue of the day occurred no hair breadth scapes perils by sea and land heroisms of the hero fine shrieks of the heroine no set scenes of catching pathos and humour no distinguishable points of social satireequivalent to a smacking of the public on the chaps which excites it to grin with keen discernment of the authors intention she did not appeal to the senses nor to a superficial discernment so she had the anticipatory sense of its failure and she wrote her best in perverseness of course she wrote slowly she wrote more and more realistically of the characters and the downright human emotions less of the wooden supernumeraries of her story labelled for broad guffaw or deluge tearsthe grappling natural links between our public and an author her feelings were aloof they flowed at a hint of a scene of the young minister she could not put them into the cantatrice and arthur rhodes pronounced this work poetical beyond its predecessors for the reason that the chief characters were alive and the reader felt their pulses he meant to say they were poetical inasmuch as they were creations the slow progress of a work not driven by the authors feelings necessitated frequent consultations between debit and credit resulting in altercations recriminations discord of the yoked and divergent couple to restore them to their proper trot in harness diana reluctantly went to her publisher for an advance item of the sum she was to receive and the act increased her distaste an idea came that she would soon cease to be able to write at all what then perhaps by selling her invested money and ultimately the crossways she would have enough for her term upon earth necessarily she had to think that short in order to reckon it as nearly enough i am sure she said to herself i shall not trouble the world very long a strange languor beset her scarcely melancholy for she conceived the cheerfulness of life and added to it in company but a nervelessness as though she had been left by the stream on the banks and saw beauty and pleasure sweep along and away while the sun that primed them dried her veins at this time she was gaining her widest reputation for brilliancy of wit only to welcome guests were her evenings ever spent at home she had no intimate understanding of the deadly wrestle of the conventional woman with her nature which she was undergoing below the surface perplexities she acknowledged and the prudence of guardedness but as i am sure not to live very long we may as well meet her meetings with percy dacier were therefore hardly shunned and his behaviour did not warn her to discountenance them it would have been cruel to exclude him from her select little dinners of eight whitmonby westlake henry wilmers and the rest she perhaps aiding schooled him in the conversational art she heard it said of him that the courted discarder of the sex hitherto a mere politician was wonderfully humanized lady pennon fell to talking of him hopefully she declared him to be one of the men who unfold tardily and only await the mastering passion if the passion had come it was controlled his command of himself melted diana how could she forbid his entry to the houses she frequented she was glad to see him he showed his pleasure in seeing her remembering his tentative indiscretion on those foreign sands she reflected that he had been easily checked and the like was not to be said of some others beautiful women in her position provoke an intemperateness that contrasts touchingly with the selfrestraint of a particular admirer her impassioned caledonian was one of a host to speak of whom and their fits of lunacy even to her friend emma was repulsive she bore with them foiled them passed them and recovered her equanimity but the contrast called to her to dwell on it the selfrestraint whispered of a depth of passion she was shocked at herself for a singular tremble she experienced without any beating of the heart on hearing one day that the marriage of percy dacier and miss asper was at last definitely fixed mary paynham brought her the news she had it from a lady who had come across miss asper at lady wathins assemblies and considered the great heiress extraordinarily handsome a golden miracle diana gave her words to say good looks and gold together are rather superhuman the report may be this time true next afternoon the card of lady wathin requested mrs warwick to grant her a private interview lady wathin as one of the order of women who can do anything in a holy cause advanced toward mrs warwick unabashed by the burden of her mission and spinally prepared behind benevolent smilings to repay dignity of mien with a similar erectness of dignity they touched fingers and sat the preliminaries to the matter of the interview were brief between ladies physically sensible of antagonism and mutually too scornful of subterfuges in one anothers presence to beat the bush lady wathin began i am you are aware mrs warwick a cousin of your friend lady dunstane you come to me on business diana said it may be so termed i have no personal interest in it i come to lay certain facts before you which i think you should know we think it better that an acquaintance and one of your sex should state the case to you instead of having recourse to formal intermediaries lawyers lawyers well my husband is a lawyer it is true in the course of his professional vocations he became acquainted with mr warwick we have latterly seen a good deal of him he is i regret to say seriously unwell i have heard of it he has no female relations it appears he needs more care than he can receive from hirelings are you empowered by him lady wathin i am mrs warwick we will not waste time in apologies he is most anxious for a reconciliation it seems to sir cramborne and to me the most desireable thing for all parties concerned if you can be induced to regard it in that light mr warwick may or may not live but the estrangement is quite undoubtedly the cause of his illness i touch on nothing connected with it i simply wish that you should not be in ignorance of his proposal and his condition diana bowed calmly i grieve at his condition his proposal has already been made and replied to oh but mrs warwick an immediate and decisive refusal of a proposal so fraught with consequences ah but lady wathin you are now outstepping the limits prescribed by the office you have undertaken you will not lend ear to an intercession i will not of course mrs warwick it is not for me to hint at things that lawyers could say on the subject your forbearance is creditable lady wathin believe me mrs warwick the step isi speak in my husbands name as well as my ownstrongly to be advised if i hear one word more of it i leave the country i should be sorry indeed at any piece of rashness depriving your numerous friends of your society we have recently become acquainted with mr redworth and i know the loss you would be to them i have not attempted an appeal to your feelings mrs warwick i thank you warmly lady wathin for what you have not done the aristocratic airs of mrs warwick were annoying to lady wathin when she considered that they were borrowed and that a pattern morality could regard the woman as ostracized nor was it agreeable to be looked at through eyelashes under partially lifted brows she had come to appeal to the feelings of the wife at any rate to discover if she had some and was better than a wild adventuress our life below is short she said to which diana tacitly assented we have our little term mrs warwick it is soon over on the other hand the platitudes concerning it are eternal lady wathin closed her eyes that the like effect might be produced on her ears ah they are the truths but it is not my business to preach permit me to say that i feel deeply for your husband i am glad of mr warwicks having friends and they are many i hope they cannot behold him perishing without an effort on his behalf a chasm of silence intervened wifely pity was not sounded in it he will question me mrs warwick you can report to him the heads of our conversation lady wathin would youit is your husbands most earnest wish and our house is open to his wife and to him for the purpose and it seems to us that indeed it might avert a catastrophe you would necessarily deplorewould you consent to meet him at my house it has already been asked lady wathin and refused but at my houseunder our auspices diana glanced at the clock nowhere is it notpardon mea wifes duty mrs warwick at least to listen lady wathin i have listened to you in the case of his extreme generosity so putting it for the present mrs warwick that he asks only to be heard personally by his wife it may preclude so much diana felt a hot wind across her skin she smiled and said let me thank you for bringing to an end a mission that must have been unpleasant to you but you will meditate on it mrs warwick will you not give me that assurance i shall not forget it said diana again the ladies touched fingers with an interchange of the social grimace of cordiality a few words of compassion for poor lady dunstanes invalided state covered lady wathins retreat she left it struck her ruffled sentiments an icy libertine whom any husband caring for his dignity and comfort was well rid of and if only she could have contrived allusively to bring in the name of mr percy dacier just to show these arrant coquettes or worse that they were not quite so privileged to pursue their intrigues obscurely as they imagined it would have soothed her exasperation she left a woman the prey of panic diana thought of emma and redworth and of their foolish interposition to save her character and keep her bound she might now have been free the struggle with her manacles reduced her to a state of rebelliousness from which issued vivid illuminations of the one means of certain escape an abhorrent hissing cavern that led to a place named liberty her refuge but a hectic place unable to write hating the house which held her a fixed mark for these attacks she had an idea of flying straight to her beloved lugano lake and there hiding abandoning her friends casting off the slaves name she bore and living free in spirit she went so far as to reckon the cost of a small household there and justify the violent step by an exposition of retrenchment upon her large london expenditure she had but to say farewell to emma no other tie to cut one morning on the salvatore heights would wash her clear of the webs defacing and entangling her chapter xxiv indicates a soul prepared for desperation the month was august four days before the closing of parliament and diana fancied it good for arthur rhodes to run down with her to copsley he came to her invitation joyfully reminding her of lady dunstanes wish to hear some chapters of the cantatrice and the ms was packed they started taking rail and fly and winding up the distance on foot august is the month of sober maturity and majestic foliage songless but a crowned and royalrobed queenly month and the youngsters appreciation of the homely scenery refreshed diana his delight in being with her was also pleasant she had no wish to exchange him for another and that was a strengthening thought at copsley the arrival of their luggage had prepared the welcome warm though it was diana perceived a change in emma an unwonted reserve a doubtfulness of her eyes in spite of tenderness and thus thrown back on herself thinking that if she had followed her own counsel as she called her impulse in old days there would have been no such present misery she at once and unconsciously assumed a guarded look based on her knowledge of her honest footing it was a little defiant secretly in her bosom it was sharpened to a slight hostility by the knowledge that her mind had been straying the guilt and the innocence combined to clothe her in mail the innocence being positive the guilt so vapoury but she was armed only if necessary and there was no requirement for armour emma did not question at all she saw the alteration in her tony she was too full of the tragic apprehensiveness overmastering her to speak of trifles she had never confided to tony the exact nature and the growth of her malady thinking it mortal and fearing to alarm her dearest a portion of the manuscript was read out by arthur rhodes in the evening the remainder next morning redworth perceptibly was the model of the english hero and as to his person no friend could complain of the sketch his cleareyed heartiness manliness wholesomenessa word of lady dunstanes regarding himand his handsome braced figure were well painted emma forgave the insistance on a certain bluntness of the nose in consideration of the fond limning of his honest and expressive eyes and the light on his temples which they had noticed together she could not so easily forgive the realistic picture of the man an exaggeration she thought of small foibles that even if they existed should not have been stressed the turn for calculating was shown up ridiculously mr cuthbert dering was calculating in his impassioned moods as well as in his cold his head was a long division of ciphers he had statistics for spectacles and beheld the world through them and the mistress he worshipped i see said emma during a pause he is a saxon you still affect to have the race en grippe tony i give him every credit for what he is diana replied i admire the finer qualities of the race as much as any one you want to have them presented to you in enamel emmy but the worst was an indication that the mania for calculating in and out of season would lead to the catastrophe destructive of his happiness emma could not bear that without asking herself whether it could be possible that tony knew the secret or whether she would have laid it bare her sympathy for redworth revolted at the exposure she was chilled she let it pass she merely said i like the writing diana understood that her story was condemned she put on her robes of philosophy to cloak discouragement i am glad the writing pleases you the characters are as true as life cried arthur rhodes the cantatrice drinking porter from the pewter at the slips after harrowing the hearts of her audience is dearer to me than if she had tottered to a sofa declining sustenance and because her creatrix has infused such blood of life into her that you accept naturally whatever she does she was exhausted and required the porter like a labourer in the cornfield emma looked at him and perceived the poet swamped by the admirer taken in conjunction with mr cuthbert derings frenzy for calculating she disliked the incident of the porter and the pewter while the cantatrice swallowed her draught i suppose mr dering counted the cost she said it really might be hinted said diana the discussion closed with the accustomed pro and con upon the wart of cromwells nose realism rejoicing in it idealism objecting arthur rhodes was bidden to stretch his legs on a walk along the heights in the afternoon and emma was further vexed by hearing tony complain of redworths treatment of the lad whom he would not assist to any of the snug little posts he was notoriously able to dispense he has talked of mr rhodes to me said emma he thinks the profession of literature a delusion and doubts the wisdom of having poets for clerks johnbullish diana exclaimed he speaks contemptuously of the poor boy only inasmuch as the foolishness of the young man in throwing up the law provokes his practical mind to speak he might take my word for the young mans ability i want him to have the means of living that he may write he has genius he may have it i like him and have said so if he were to go back to his lawstool i have no doubt that redworth would manage to help him and make a worthy ancient braddock of a youth of splendid promise have i sketched him too saxon it is the lens and hot the tribe tony the cantatrice was not alluded to any more but emmas disapproval blocked the current of composition already subject to chokings in the brain of the author diana stayed three days at copsley one longer than she had intended so that arthur rhodes might have his fill of country air i would keep him but i should be no companion for him emma said i suspect the gallant squire is only to be satisfied by landing me safely said diana and that small remark grated though emma saw the simple meaning when they parted she kissed her tony many times tears were in her eyes it seemed to diana that she was anxious to make amends for the fit of alienation and she was kissed in return warmly quite forgiven notwithstanding the deadly blank she had caused in the imagination of the writer for pay distracted by the squabbles of debit and credit diana chatted spiritedly to young rhodes on their drive to the train she was profoundly discouraged by emmas disapproval of her work it wanted but that one drop to make a recurrence to the work impossible there it must lie and what of the aspects of her householdperhaps after all the redworths of the world are right and literature as a profession is a delusive pursuit she did not assent to it without hostility to the worlds redworthsthey have no sensitiveness we have too much we are made of bubbles that a wind will burst and as the wind is always blowing your practical redworths have their crow of us she suggested advice to arthur rhodes upon the prudence of his resuming the yoke of the law he laughed at such a notion saying that he had some expectations of money to come but i fear said he that lady dunstane is very very ill she begged me to keep her informed of your address diana told him he was one of those who should know it whithersoever she went she spoke impulsively her sentiments of friendliness for the youth being temporarily brightened by the strangeness of emmas conduct in deputing it to him to fulfil a duty she had never omitted what can she think i am going to do on her table at home lay a letter from mr warwick she read it hastily in the presence of arthur rhodes having at a glance at the handwriting anticipated the proposal it contained and the official phrasing her gallant squire was invited to dine with her that evening costume excused they conversed of literature as a profession of poets dead and living of politics which he abhorred and shied at and of his prospects he wrote many rejected pages enjoyed an income of eighty pounds per annum and eked out a subsistence upon the modest sum his pen procured him a sum extremely insignificant but great nature was his own the world was tributary to him the future his bejewelled and expectant bride diana envied his youthfulness nothing is more enviable nothing richer to the mind than the aspect of a cheerful poverty how much nobler it was contrasted with redworths amassing of wealth when alone she went to her bedroom and tried to write tried to sleep mr warwicks letter was looked at it seemed to indicate a threat but for the moment it did not disturb her so much as the review of her moral prostration she wrote some lines to her lawyers quoting one of mr warwicks sentences that done his letter was dismissed her intolerable languor became alternately a defeating drowsiness and a fever she succeeded in the effort to smother the absolute cause it was not suffered to show a front at the cost of her knowledge of a practised selfdeception i wonder whether the world is as bad as a certain class of writers tell us she sighed in weariness and mused on their soundings and probings of poor humanity which the world accepts for the very bottom truth if their dredge brings up sheer refuse of the abominable the world imagines those to be at our natures depths who are impudent enough to expose its muddy shallows she was in the mood for such a kind of writing she could have started on it at once but that the theme was wanting and it may count on popularity a great repute for penetration it is true of its kind though the dredging of nature is the miry form of art when it flourishes we may be assured we have been overenamelling the higher forms she felt and shuddered to feel that she could draw from dark stores hitherto in her works it had been a triumph of the good they revealed a gaping deficiency of the subtle insight she now possessed exhibit humanity as it is wallowing sensual wicked behind the mask a voice called to her she was allured by the contemplation of the widemouthed old dragon ego whose portrait decently painted establishes an instant touch of exchange between author and public the latter detected and confessing next to the pantomime of humour and pathos a cynical surgical knife at the human bosom seems the surest talisman for this agreeable exchange and she could cut she gave herself a taste of her powers she cut at herself mercilessly and had to bandage the wound in a hurry to keep in life metaphors were her refuge metaphorically she could allow her mind to distinguish the struggle she was undergoing sinking under it the banished of eden had to put on metaphors and the common use of them has helped largely to civilize us the sluggish in intellect detest them but our civilization is not much indebted to that major faction especially are they needed by the pedestalled woman in her conflict with the natural diana saw herself through the haze she conjured up am i worse than other women was a piercing twithought worse would be hideous isolation the not worse abased her sex she could afford to say that the world was bad not that women were sinking deeper an anguish of humiliation smote her to a sense of drowning for what of the poetic ecstasy on her salvatore heights had not been of origin divine had sprung from other than spiritual founts had sprung from the reddened sources she was compelled to conceal could it be she would not believe it but there was matter to clip her wings quench her light in the doubt she fell asleep like the wrecked flung ashore danvers entered her room at an early hour for london to inform her that mr percy dacier was below and begged permission to wait diana gave orders for breakfast to be proposed to him she lay staring at the wall until it became too visibly a reflection of her mind chapter xxv once more the crossways and a change of turnings the suspicion of his having come to impart the news of his proximate marriage ultimately endowed her with sovereign calmness she had need to think it and she did tea was brought to her while she dressed she descended the stairs revolving phrases of happy congratulation and the worlds ordinary epigrams upon the marriagetie neatly mixed they read in one anothers faces a different meaning from the empty words of excuse and welcome daciers expressed the buckling of a strong set purpose but grieved by the look of her eyes he wasted a moment to say you have not slept you have heard what said she trying to speculate and that was a sufficient answer i hadnt the courage to call last night i passed the windows give me your hand i beg she gave her hand in wonderment and more wonderingly felt it squeezed her heart began the hammerthump she spoke an unintelligible something saw herself melting away to utter weaknesspride reserve simple prudence all going crumbled ruins where had stood a fortress imposing to men was it love her heart thumped shiveringly he kept her hand indifferent to the gentle tension this is the point i cannot live without you i have gone on who was here last night forgive me you know arthur rhodes i saw him leave the door at eleven why do you torture me theres no time to lose now you will be claimed come and let us two cut the knot it is the best thing in the world for methe only thing be brave i have your hand give it for good and for heavens sake dont play the sex be yourself dear soul of a woman i never saw the soul in one but in you i have waited nothing but the dread of losing you sets me speaking now and for you to be sacrificed a second time to that oh no you know you can trust me on my honour i take breath from you you are my better in everythingguide goddess dearest heart trust me make me master of your fate but my friend the murmur hung in her throat he was marvellously transformed he allowed no space for the arts of defence and evasion i wish i had the trick of courting theres not time and i m a simpleton at the game we can start this evening once away we leave it to them to settle the matter and then you are free and mine to the death but speak speak what is it diana said that if we delay i m in danger of losing you altogether her eyes lightened you mean that you have heard he has determined theres a process of the law but stop it just this one step and it ends whether intended or not it hangs over you and you will be perpetually tormented why waste your whole youthand mine as well for i am bound to you as much as if we had stood at the altarwhere we will stand together the instant you are free but where have you heard from an intimate friend i will tell yousufficiently intimatefrom lady wathin nothing of a friend but i see this woman at times she chose to speak of it to me it doesnt matter why she is in his confidence and pitched me a whimpering tale let those people chatter but it s exactly for those people that you are hanging in chains all your youth shrivelling let them shout their worst its the bark of a day and you wont hear it half a year and it will be over and i shall bring you backthe husband of the noblest bride in christendom you dont mistrust me it is not that said she but now drop my hand i am imprisoned its asking too much ive lost youtoo many times i have the hand and i keep it i take nothing but the hand its the hand i want i give you mine i love you now i know what love isand the word carries nothing of its weight tell me you do not doubt my honour not at all but be rational i must think and i cannot while you keep my hand he kissed it i keep my own against the world a cry of rebuke swelled to her lips at his conquerors tone it was not uttered for directness was in his character and his wooing loyalsave for bitter circumstances delicious to hear and so narrow was the ring he had wound about her senses that her loathing of the circumstances pushed her to acknowledge within her bell of a heart her love for him he was luckless enough to say diana it rang horridly of her husband she drew her hand to loosen it with repulsing brows not that name dacier was too full of his honest advocacy of the passionate lover to take a rebuff there lay his unconscious mastery where the common arts of attack would have tripped him with a quickwitted woman and where a man of passion not allowing her to succumb in dignity would have alarmed her to the breaking loose from him lady dunstane calls you tony she is my dearest and oldest friend you and i dont count by years you are the dearest to me on earth tony she debated as to forbidding that name the moments pause wrapped her in a mental hurricane out of which she came with a heart stopped her olive cheeks ashenhued she had seen that the step was possible oh percy percy are we mad not mad we take what is ours tell me have i ever ever disrespected you you were sacred to me and you are though now the change has come look back on itit is time lost years that are dust but look forward and you cannot imagine our separation what i propose is plain sense for us two since rovio i have been at your feet have i not some just claim for recompense tell me tony the sweetness of the secret name the privileged name in his mouth stole through her blood melting resistance she had consented the swarthy flaming of her face avowed it even more than the surrender of her hand he gained much by claiming little he respected her gave her no touches of fright and shame and it was her glory to fall with pride an attempt at a caress would have awakened her view of the whitherward but she was treated as a sovereign lady rationally advised is it since rovio percy since the morning when you refused me one little flower if i had given it you might have been saved i fancy i was doomed from the beginning i was worth a thought worth a life worth ten thousand you have reckoned it all like a sane manfamily position the world the scandal all i have long known that you were the mate for me you have to weather a gale tony it wont last my dearest it wont last many months i regret the trial for you but i shall be with you burning for the day to reinstate you and show you the queen you are yes we two can have no covert dealings percy said diana they would be hatefulbaseness rejecting any baseness it seemed to her that she stood in some brightness the light was of a lurid sort she called on her heart to glory in it as the light of tried love the love that defied the world her heart rose she and he would at a single step give proof of their love for one anotherand this kingdom of lovehow different from her recent craven languorsthis kingdom awaited her was hers for one word and beset with the oceans of enemies it was unassailable if only they were true to the love they vowed no human force could subvert it and she doubted him as little as of herself this new kingdom of love never entered by her acclaiming her was wellnigh unimaginable in spite of the many hooded messengers it had despatched to her of late she could hardly believe that it had come but see me as i am she said she faltered it through her direct gaze on him with chains to strike off certainly it is done he replied rather heavier than those of the slavemarket i am the deadest of burdens it means that your enemies personalif you have any and politicalyou have numbers will raise a cry realize it you may still be my friend i forgive the bit of wildness she provoked a renewed kissing of her hand for magnammity in love is an overflowing danger and when he said the burden you have to bear outweighs mine out of all comparison what is it to a mana public man or not the woman is always the victim thats why i have held myself in so longher strung frame softened she half yielded to the tug on her arm is there no talking for us without foolishness she murmured the foolishness had wafted her to sea far from sight of land now sit and speak soberly discuss the matteryes my hand but i must have my wits leave me free to use them till we choose our path let it be the brains between us as far as it can you ask me to join my fate to yours it signifies a sharp battle for you dear friend perhaps the blighting of the most promising life in england one question is can i countervail the burden i shall be by such help to you as i can afford burden is no wordi rake up a buried fever i have partially lived it down and instantly i am covered with spots the old false charges and this plain offence make a monster of me and meanwhile you are at the disposal of the man who falsely charged you and armed the world against you said dacier i can fly the world is wide time slips your youth is wasted if you escape the man he will have triumphed in keeping you from me and i thirst for you i look to you for aid and counsel i want my mate you have not to be told how you inspire me i am really less than half myself without you if i am to do anything in the world it must be with your aid you beside me our hands are joined one leap do you not see that after well it cannot be friendship it imposes rather more on me than i can bear you are not the woman to trifle nor i tony the man for it with a woman like you you are my spring of wisdom you interdict me altogethercan youor we unite our fates like these hands now try to get yours away her effort ended in a pressure resistance nay to hesitate at the joining of her life with his after her submission to what was a scorching fire in memory though it was less than an embrace accused her of worse than foolishness well then said she wait three days deliberate oh try to know yourself for your clear reason to guide you let us be something better than the crowd abusing us not simple creatures of impulseas we choose to call the animal what if we had to confess that we took to our heels the moment the idea struck us three days we may then pretend to a philosophical resolve then come to me or write to me how long is it since the old rovio morning tony an age date my deliberations from that day the thought of hers having to be dated possibly from an earlier day robbed her of her summit of feminine isolation and she trembled chilled and flushed she lost all anchorage so it must be tomorrow said he reading her closely not later better at once but women are not to be hurried oh dont class me percy pray i think of you not of myself you suppose that in a day or two i might vary she fixed her eyes on him expressing certainty of his unalterable stedfastness the look allured it changed her head shook she held away and said no leave me leave me dear dear friend percy my dearest i will not play the sex i am yours if if it is your wish it may as well be tomorrow here i am useless i cannot write not screw a thought from my head i dread that process of the law a second time tomorrow if it must be but no impulses fortune is blind she may be kind to us the blindness of fortune is her one merit and fools accuse her of it and they profit by it i fear we all of us have our turn of folly we throw the stake for good luck i hope my sin is not very great i know my position is desperate i feel a culprit but i am sure i have courage perhaps brains to help at any rate i may say this i bring no burden to my lover that he does not know of dacier pressed her hand money we shall have enough my uncle has left me fairly supplied what would he think said diana half in a glimpse of meditation think me the luckiest of the breeched i fancy i hear him thanking you for making a man of me she blushed some such phrase might have been spoken by lord dannisburgh i have but a poor sum of money she said i may be able to write abroad here i cannotif i am to be persecuted you shall write with a new pen said dacier you shall live my darling tony you have been held too long in this miserable suspension neither maid nor wife neither woman nor stockfish ah shameful but we ll right it the step for us is the most reasonable that could be considered you shake your head but the circumstances make it so courage and we come to happiness and that for you and me means work look at the case of lord and lady dulac its identical except that she is no match beside you and i do not compare her antecedents with yours but she braved the leap and forced the world to swallow it and now you see shes perfectly honoured i know a place on a peak of the maritime alps exquisite in summer cool perfectly solitary no english snow round us pastures at our feet and the mediterranean below there my tony tomorrow night we start you will meet meshall i call here well then at the railway station the southeastern for paris say twenty minutes to eight i have your pledge you will come she sighed it then said it firmly to be worthy of him kind fortune peeping under the edge of her bandaged eyes appeared willing to bestow the beginning of happiness upon one who thought she had a claim to a small taste of it before she died it seemed distinguishingly done to give a bite of happiness to the starving i fancied when you were announced that you came for congratulations upon your approaching marriage percy i shall expect to hear them from you tomorrow evening at the station dear tony said he the time was again stated the pledge repeated he forbore entreaties for privileges and won her gratitude they named once more the place of meeting and the hour more significant to them than phrases of intensest love and passion pressing hands sharply for pledge of good faith they sundered she still had him in her eyes when he had gone her old world lay shattered her new world was up without a dawn with but one figure the sun of it to light the swinging strangeness was ever man more marvellously transformed or woman more wildly swept from earth into the clouds so she mused in the hum of her tempest of heart and brain forgetful of the years and the conditions preparing both of them for this explosion she had much to do the arrangements to dismiss her servants write to houseagents and her lawyer and write fully to emma write the enigmatic farewell to the esquarts and lady pennon mary paynham arthur rhodes whitmonby stanch in friendship but requiring friendly touches henry wilmers and redworth he was reserved to the last for very enigmatical adieux he would hear the whole story from emma must be left to think as he liked the vague letters were excellently well composed she was going abroad and knew not when she would return bade her friends think the best they could of her in the meantime whitmonby was favoured with an anecdote to be read as an apologue by the light of subsequent events but the letter to emma tasked diana intending to write fully her pen committed the briefest sentences the tenderness she felt for emma wakening her heart to sing that she was loved loved and knew love at last and emmas foreseen antagonism to the love and the step it involved rendered her pleadings in exculpation a stammered confession of guiltiness ignominious unworthy of the pride she felt in her lover i am like a cartridge rammed into a gun to be discharged at a certain hour tomorrow she wrote and she sealed a letter so frigid that she could not decide to post it all day she imagined hearing a distant cannonade the light of the day following was not like earthly light danvers assured her there was no fog in london london is insupportable i am going to paris and shall send for you in a week or two said diana allow me to say maam that you had better take me with you said danvers are you afraid of travelling by yourself you foolish creature no maam but i dont like any hands to undress and dress my mistress but my own i have not lost the art said diana chafing for a magic spell to extinguish the woman to whom immediately pitying her she said you are a good faithful soul i think you have never kissed me kiss me on the forehead danvers put her lips to her mistresss forehead and was asked you still consider yourself attached to my fortunes i do maam at home or abroad and if you will take me with you not for a week or so i shall not be in the way maam they played at shutting eyes the petition of danvers was declined which taught her the more and she was emboldened to say wherever my mistress goes she ought to have her attendant with her there was no answer to it but the refusal the hours crumbled slowly each with a blow at the passages of retreat diana thought of herself as another person whom she observed not counselling her because it was a creature visibly pushed by the fates in her own mind she could not perceive a stone of solidity anywhere nor a face that had the appearance of our common life she heard the cannon at intervals the things she said set danvers laughing and she wondered at the womans mingled mirth and stiffness five oclock struck her letters were sent to the post her boxes were piled from stairs to door she read the labels for her goodbye to the hated name of warwickwhy ever adopted emma might well have questioned why women are guilty of such unreasoning acts but this was the close to that chapter the hour of six went by between six and seven came a sound of knocker and bell at the streetdoor danvers rushed into the sittingroom to announce that it was mr redworth before a word could be mustered redworth was in the room he said you must come with me at once chapter xxvi in which a disappointed lover receives a multitude of lessons dacier welted at the station a good figure of a sentinel over his luggage and a spy for one among the inpouring passengers tickets had been confidently taken the private division of the carriages happily secured on board the boat she would be veiled landed on french soil they threw off disguises breasted the facts and those they lightened he smarted with his eagerness he had come well in advance of the appointed time for he would not have had her hang about there one minute alone strange as this adventure was to a man of prominent station before the world and electrical as the turningpoint of a destiny that he was given to weigh deliberately and farsightedly dianas image strung him to the pitch of it he looked nowhere but ahead like an archer putting hand for his arrow presently he compared his watch and the terminus clock she should now be arriving he went out to meet her and do service many cabs and carriages were peered into couples inspected ladies and their maids wives and their husbandsan august exodus to the continent nowhere the starry she but he had a fund of patience she was now in some block of the streets he was sure of her sure of her courage tony and recreancy could not go together now that he called her tony she was his close comrade known the name was a caress and a promise breathing of her as the rose of sweetest earth he counted it to be a month ere his family would have wind of the altered position of his affairs possibly a year to the day of his making the dear woman his own in the eyes of the world she was dear past computation womanly yet quite unlike the womanish woman unlike the semimales courteously called dashing unlike the sentimental his present passion for her lineaments declared her surpassingly beautiful though his critical taste was rather for the white statue that gave no warmth she had brains and ardour she had grace and sweetness a playful petulancy enlivening our atmosphere and withal a refinement a distinction not to be classed and justly might she dislike the being classed her humour was a perennial refreshment a running well that caught all the colours of light her wit studded the heavens of the recollection of her in his heart he felt that it was a stepping down for the brilliant woman to give him her hand a condescension and an act of valour she who always led or prompted when they conversed had now in her generosity abandoned the lead and herself to him and she deserved his utmost honouring but where was she he looked at his watch looked at the clock they said the same ten minutes to the moment of the trains departure a man may still afford to dwell on the charms and merits of his hearts mistress while he has ten minutes to spare the dropping minutes however detract one by one from her individuality and threaten to sink her in her sex entirely it is the inexorable clock that says she is as other women dacier began to chafe he was unaccustomed to the part he was performingand if she failed him she would not she would be late though no she was in time his long legs crossed the platform to overtake a tall lady veiled and dressed in black he lifted his hat he heard an alarmed little cry and retired the clock said five minutes a secret chiromancy in addition indicating on its face the word fool an odd word to be cast at him it rocked the icy pillar of pride in the background of his nature certainly standing solos at the hour of eight pm he would stand for a fool hitherto he had never allowed a woman to chance to posture him in that character he strode out returned scanned every ladys shape and for a distraction watched the veiled lady whom he had accosted her figure suggested pleasant features either she was disappointed or she was an adept at the shutting of the gates she glided through not without a fearful look around and at him she disappeared dacier shrugged his novel assimilation to the ratrabble of amatory intriguers tapped him on the shoulder unpleasantly a luckless member of the fraternity too the bell the clock and the train gave him his title and i was ready to fling down everything for the woman the trial of a superb london gentlemans resources in the lovepassion could not have been much keener no sign of her he who stands ready to defy the world and is baffled by the absence of his fair assistant is the fool doubled so completely the fool that he heads the universal shout he does not spare himself the sole consolation he has is to revile the sex women women whom have they not made a fool of his uncle as much as anyand professing to know them him also the man proud of escaping their wiles for this woman he went on saying after he had lost sight of her in her sexs trickeries the nearest he could get to her was to conceive that the arrant coquette was now laughing at her utter subjugation and befooling of the man popularly supposed invincible if it were known of him the idea of his being a puppet fixed for derision was madly distempering he had only to ask the affirmative of constance asper tomorrow a vision of his determination to do it somewhat comforted him dacier walked up and down the platform passing his pile of luggage solitary and eloquent on the barrow never in his life having been made to look a fool he felt the red heat of the thing as a man who has not blessedly become acquainted with the swish in boyhood finds his untempered blood turn to poison at a blow he cannot healthily take a licking but then it had been so splendid an insanity when he urged diana to fly with him any one but a woman would have appreciated the sacrifice his luggage had to be removed he dropped his porter a lordly fee and drove home from that astonished solitude he strolled to his club curiosity mastering the wrath it was mixed with he left his club and crossed the park southward in the direction of dianas house abusing her for her inveterate attachment to the regions of westminster there she used to receive lord dannisburgh innocently no doubtassuredly quite innocently and her husband had quitted the district still it was rather childish for a woman tobe always haunting the seats of parliament her disposition to imagine that she was able to inspire statesmen came in for a share of ridicule for when we know ourselves to be ridiculous a retort in kind unjust upon consideration is balm the woman dragged him down to the level of common men that was the peculiar injury and it swept her undistinguished into the stream of women in appearance as he had proved to the fellows at his club he was perfectly selfpossessed mentally distracted and bitter hating himself for it snapping at the cause of it she had not merely disappointed she had slashed his high conceit of himself curbed him at the first animal dash forward and he champed the bit with the fury of a thwarted racer twice he passed her house of course no light was shown at her windows they were scanned malignly he held it due to her to call and inquire whether there was any truth in the report of mrs warwicks illness mrs warwick she meant to keep the name a maidservant came to the door with a candle in her hand revealing red eyelids she was not aware that her mistress was unwell her mistress had left home some time after six oclock with a gentleman she was unable to tell him the gentlemans name william the footman had opened the door to him her mistresss maid mrs danvers had gone to the playwith william she thought that mrs danvers might know who the gentleman was the girls eyelids blinked and she turned aside dacier consoled her with a piece of gold saying he would come and see mrs danvers in the morning his wrath was partially quieted by the new speculations offered up to it he could not conjure a suspicion of treachery in diana warwick and a treachery so foully cynical she had gone with a gentleman he guessed on all sides he struck at walls as in complete obscurity the mystery of her conduct troubling his wits for the many hours was explained by danvers with a sympathy that she was at pains to show she informed him that her mistress was not at all unwell and related of how mr redworth had arrived just when her mistress was on the point of starting for paris and the continent because poor lady dunstane was this very day to undergo an operation under the surgeons at copsley and she did not wish her mistress to be present but mr redworth thought her mistress ought to be there and he had gone down thinking she was there and then came back in hot haste to fetch her and was just in time as it happened by two or three minutes dacier rewarded the sympathetic woman for her intelligence which appeared to him to have shot so far as to require a bribe gratitude to the person soothing his unwontedly ruffled temper was the cause of the indiscretion in the amount he gave it appeared to him that he ought to proceed to copsley for tidings of lady dunstane thither he sped by the handy railway and a timely train he reached the parkgates at three in the afternoon telling his flyman to wait as he advanced by short cuts over the grass he studied the look of the rows of windows she was within and strangely to his clouded senses she was no longer tony no longer the deceptive woman he could in justice abuse he and she so close to union were divided a hand resembling the palpable interposition of fate had swept them asunder having the poorest rightnot anyto reproach her he was disarmed he felt himself a miserable intruder he summoned his passion to excuse him and gained some unsatisfied repose of mind by contemplating its devoted sincerity which roused an effort to feel for the suffererdiana warwicks friend with the pair of surgeons named the most eminent of their day in attendance the case must be serious to vindicate the breaker of her pledge his present plight likewise assured him of that and nearing the house he adopted instinctively the funeral step and mood just sensible of a novel smallness for the fortifying testimony of his passion had to be put aside he was obliged to disavow it for a simpler motive if he applied at the door he stressed the motive produced the sentiment and passed thus naturally into hypocrisy as lovers precipitated by their blood among the crises of human conditions are often forced to do he had come to inquire after lady dunstane he remembered that it had struck him as a duty on hearing of her dangerous illness the door opened before he touched the bell sir lukin knocked against him and stared ahwhoyou he said and took him by the arm and pressed him on along the gravel dacier are you redworths in there come on a step come its the time for us to pray good god theres mercy for sinners if ever there was a man but oh good god shes in their hands this minute my saint is under the knife dacier was hurried forward by a powerful hand they say it lasts about five minutes four and a halfor more my god when they turned me out of her room she smiled to keep me calm she said dear husband the veriest wretch and brutallest husband ever poor woman and a saint a saint on earth emmy tears burst from him he pulled forth his watch and asked dacier for the time a minutes gone in a minute its three minutes and a half come faster theyre at their work its life or death ive had death about me but for a woman and your wife and that brave soul she bears it so women are the bravest creatures afloat if they make her shriek itll be only if she thinks i m out of hearing no i see her she bears itthey maynt have begun yet it may all be over come into the wood i must pray i must go on my knees two or three steps in the wood at the mossed roots of a beech he fell kneeling muttering exclaiming the tempest of penitence closed with a blind look at his watch which he left dangling he had to talk to drug his thoughts and mind you said he when he had rejoined dacier and was pushing his arm again rounding beneath the trees to a view of the house for a man steeped in damnable iniquity she bears it all for me because i begged her for the chance of her living its my doingthis knife macpherson swears there is a chance thomson backs him but theyre at her cutting the pain must be awfulthe mere pain the gentlest creature ever drew breath and women fear bloodand her own and a head she ought to have married the best man alive not a i cant remember her once complaining of menot once a common donkey compared to her all i can do is to pray and she knows the beast i am and has forgiven me there isnt a blessed text of scripture that doesnt cry out in praise of her and they cut and hack he dropped his head the vehement big man heaved shuddering his lips worked fast she is not alone with them unsupported said dacier sir lukin moaned for relief he caught his watch swinging and stared at it what a good fellow you were to come now s the time to know your friends theres diana warwick true as steel redworth came on her tiptoe for the continent he had only to mention emmy wanted to spare her she would not have sentwanted to spare her the sight i offered to stand by chased me out diana warwicks there worth fifty of me dacier ive had my swordblade tried by indian horsemen and i know what true as steel means shes there and i know she shrinks from the sight of blood my oath on it she wont quiver a muscle next to my wife you may take my word for it dacier diana warwick is the pick of living women i could prove it they go together i could prove it over and over she s the loyallest woman anywhere her one error was that marriage of hers and how she ever pitched herself into it none of us can guess after a while he said look at your watch nearly twenty minutes gone are they afraid to send out word its that window he covered his eyes and muttered sighed he became abruptly composed in appearance the worst of a black sheep like me is im such an infernal sinner that providence but both surgeons gave me their word of honour that there was a chance a chance but its the end of me if emmy good god no the knifes enough dont let her be killed it would be murder here am i talking i ought to be praying i should have sent for the parson to help me i cant get the proper wordsbellow like a rascal trooper strung up for the cat it must be twentyfive minutes now whos alive now dacier thought of the persian queen crying for news of the slaughtered with her mind on her lord and husband who is not dead diana exalted poets and here was an example of the truth of one to nature and of the poor husbands depth of feeling they said not the same thing but it was the same cry de profundis he saw redworth coming at a quick pace redworth raised his hand sir lukin stopped hes waving its good said dacier speak are you sure i judge by the look redworth stepped unfalteringly its over all well he said he brushed his forehead and looked sharply cheerful my dear fellow my dear fellow sir lukin grasped his hand its more than i deserve over she has borne it she would have gone to heaven and left me is she safe doing well have you seen the surgeons mrs warwick what did she say a nod of the head you saw her she came to the stairs diana warwick never lies she wouldnt lie not with a nod theyve saved emmydo you think it looks well my girl has passed the worst of it thats over sir lukin gazed glassily the necessity of his agony was to lean to the belief at a beckoning that providence pardoned him in tenderness for what would have been his loss he realized it and experienced a sudden calm testifying to the positive pardon now look here you two fellows listen half a moment he addressed redworth and dacier ive been the biggest scoundrel of a husband unhung and married to a saint and if shes only saved to me ill swear to serve her faithfully or may a thunderbolt knock me to perdition and thank god for his justice prayers are answered mind you though a fellow may be as black as a sweep take a warning from me ive had my lesson dacier soon after talked of going the hope of seeing diana had abandoned him the desire was almost extinct sir lukin could not let him go he yearned to preach to him or any one from his personal text of the sinner honourably remorseful on account of and notwithstanding the forgiveness of providence and he implored dacier and redworth by turns to be careful when they married of how they behaved tothe sainted women their wives never to lend ear to the devil nor to believe as he had done that there is no such thing as a devil for he had been the victim of him and he knew the devil he loudly proclaimed has a multiplicity of lures and none more deadly than when he baits with a petticoat he had been hooked and had found the devil in person he begged them urgently to keep his example in memory by following this and that wildfire he had stuck himself in a boga common result with those who would not see the devil at work upon them and it required his dear suffering saint to be at deaths doors cut to pieces and gasping to open his eyes but thank heaven they were opened at last now he saw the beast he was a filthy beast unworthy of tying his wifes shoestring no confessions could expose to them the beast he was but let them not fancy there was no such thing as an active devil about the world redworth divined that the simply sensational man abased himself before providence and heaped his gratitude on the awful power in order to render it difficult for the promise of the safety of his wife to be withdrawn he said there is good hope and drew an admonition upon himself ah my dear good redworth sir lukin sighed from his elevation of outspoken penitence you will see as i do some day it is the devil think as you like of it when you have pulled down all the institutions of the country what do you expect but ruins that radicalism of yours has its day you have to go through a wrestle like mine to understand it you say the day is fine lets have our game old england pays for it then youll find how you love the old land of your birththe noblest ever called a nationwith your corn law repealseh dacier you ll own it was the devil tempted you i hear you apologizing pray god it maynt be too late he looked up at the windows she may be sinking have no fears redworth said mrs warwick would send for you she would diana warwick would be sure to send next to my wife diana warwicks shed send never fear i dread that room id rather go through a regiment of sabresthough it s over now and diana warwick stood it the worst is over you told me by heaven women are wonderful creatures but she hasnt a peer for courage i could trust hermost extraordinary thing that marriage of hersnot a soul has ever been able to explain ittrust her to the death redworth left them and sir lukin ejaculated on the merits of diana warwick to dacier he laughed scornfully and thats the woman the world attacks for want of virtue why a fellow hasnt a chance with her not a chance she comes out in blazing armour if you unmask a battery i dont know how it might be if she were in love with a fellow i doubt her thinking men worth the trouble i never met the man but if she were to take fire troy d be nothing to it i wonder whether we might go in i dread the house dacier spoke of departing no no wait sir lukin begged him i was talking about women they are the devilor he makes most use of them and you must learn to see the cloven foot under their petticoats if youre to escape them theres no protection in being in love with your wife i married for love i am i always have been in love with her and i went to the deuce the music struck up and away i waltzed a woman like diana warwick might keep a fellow straight because shes all round you shes man and woman in brains and legged like a deer and breasted like a swan and a regular sheaf of arrowsin her eyes dark womenah but she has a contempt for us you know thats the secret of her redworth s at the door bad is it bad i never was particularly fond of that househated it i love it now for emmys sake i couldnt live in anotherthough i should be haunted rather her ghost than nothing though im an infernal coward about the next world but if youre right with religion you neednt fear what i cant comprehend in redworth is his radicalism and getting richer and richer its not a vow of poverty said dacier hell find they dont coalesce or his children will once the masses are uppermost its a bad day dacier when we ve no more gentlemen in the land emmy backs him so i hold my tongue tomorrows a sunday i wish you were staying here i d take you to church with mewe shirk it when we havent a care it couldnt do you harm ive heard capital sermons ive always had the good habit of going to church dacier now s the time for remembering them ah my dear fellow i m not a parson it would have been better for me if i had been and for you too his look added plainly he longed to preach he was impelled to chatter redworth reported the patient perfectly quiet breathing calmly laudanum asked sir lukin now theres a poison weve got to bless and we set up in our wisdom for knowing what is good for us he had talked his hearers into a stupefied assent to anything he uttered mrs warwick would like to see you in two or three minutes she will come down redworth said to dacier that looks well eh that looks bravely sir lukin cried diana warwick wouldnt leave the room without a certainty i dread the look of those men i shall have to shake their hands and so i do with all my heart onlybut god bless them but we must go in if shes coming down they entered the house and sat in the drawingroom where sir lukin took up from the table one of his wifes latin books a persius bearing her marginal notes he dropped his head on it with sobs the voice of diana recalled him to the present she counselled him to control himself in that case he might for one moment go to the chamber door and assure himself by the silence that his wife was resting she brought permission from the surgeons and doctor on his promise to be still redworth supported sir lukin tottering out dacier had risen he was petrified by dianas face and thought of her as whirled from him in a storm bearing the marks of it her underlip hung for short breaths the big drops of her recent anguish still gathered on her brows her eyes were tearless lustreless she looked ancient in youth and distant by a century like a tall woman of the vaults issuing whiteringed not of our light she shut her mouth for strength to speak to him he said you are not ill you are strong i oh strong i will sit i cannot be absent longer than two minutes the trial of her strength is to come if it were courage we might be sure the day is fine a perfect august day i held her through it i am thankful to heaven it was no other hand than mine she wished to spare me she was glad of her tony when the time came i thought i was a cowardi could have changed with her to save her i am a strong woman fit to submit to that work i should not have borne it as she did she expected to sink under it all her dispositions were made for deathbequests to servants and to to friends every secret liking they had thought of diana clenched her hands i hope dacier said you shall hear regularly call at sir williams house tomorrow he sleeps here tonight the suspense must last for days it is a question of vital power to bear the shock she has a mind so like a flying spirit that just before the moment she made mr lanyan thomson smile by quoting some saying of her tonys try byandby to recollect it said dacier and you were with that poor man how did he pass the terrible time i pitied him he suffered he prayed it was the best he could do mr redworth was as he always is at the trial a pillar happy the friend who knows him for one he never thinks of himself in a crisis he is sheer strength to comfort and aid they will drive you to the station with mr thomson he returns to relieve sir william tomorrow i have learnt to admire the men of the knife no profession equals theirs in selfcommand and beneficence dr bridgenorth is permanent here i have a fly and go back immediately said dacier she shall hear of your coming adieu diana gave him her hand it was gently pressed a wonderment at the utter change of circumstances took dacier passingly at the sight of her vanishing figure he left the house feeling he dared have no personal wishes it had ceased to be the lovers hypocrisy with him the crisis of mortal peril in that house enveloped its inmates and so wrought in him as to enshroud the stripped outcrying husband of whom he had no clear recollection save of the mans agony the two women striving against death devoted in friendship were the sole living images he brought away they were a new vision of the world and our life he hoped with diana bled with her she rose above him high beyond his transient human claims he envied redworth the common friendly right to be near her in reflection long after her simplicity of speech washed pure of the bloodemotions for token of her great nature during those two minutes of their sitting together was dearer sweeter to the lover than if she had shown by touch or word that a faint allusion to their severance was in her mind and this despite a certain vacancy it created he received formal information of lady dunstanes progress to convalescence by degrees the simply official tone of dianas letters combined with the ceasing of them and the absence of her personal charm to make a gentleman not remarkable for violence in the passion so calmly reasonable as to think the dangerous presence best avoided for a time subject to fits of the passion he certainly was but his position in the world was a counselling spouse jealous of his good name he did not regret his proposal to take the leap he would not have regretted it if taken on
