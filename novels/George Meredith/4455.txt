note there is a short list of bookmarks or pointers at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the authors ideas before making an entire meal of them dw beauchamps career by george meredith book xix lord palmet and certain electors xx a day at itchincope xxi the question as to the examination of the whigs and the fine blow struck by mr everard romfrey xxii the drive into bevisham xxiii tourdestelle xxiv his holiday xxv the adventure of the boat chapter xix lord palmet and certain electors of bevisham meantime the candidates raised knockers rang bells bowed expounded their views praised their virtues begged for votes and greatly and strangely did the youngest of them enlarge his knowledge of his countrymen but he had an insatiable appetite and except in relation to mr cougham considerable tolerance with cougham he was like a young hound in the leash they had to run as twins but beauchamps conjunct would not run he would walk he imposed his experience on beauchamp with an assumption that it must necessarily be taken for the law of beauchamps reason in electoral and in political affairs and this was hard on beauchamp who had faith in his reason beauchamps early canvassing brought cougham down to bevisham earlier than usual in the days when he and seymour austin divided the borough and he inclined to administer correction to the radicallydisposed youngster yes i have gone all over that he said in speech sometimes in manner perpetually upon the intrusion of an idea by his junior cougham also cougham had passed through his radical phase as one does on the road to wisdom so the frog telleth tadpoles he too has wriggled most preposterous of tails and he has shoved a circular flat head into corners unadapted to its shape and that the undeveloped one should dutifully listen to experience and accept guidance is devoutly to be hoped alas beauchamp would not be taught that though they were yoked they stood at the opposite ends of the process of evolution the oddly coupled pair deplored among their respective friends the disastrous siamese twinship created by a haphazard improvident liberal camp look at us they saidbeauchamp is a young demagogue cougham is chrysalis tory such liberals are the ruin of liberalism but of such must it be composed when there is no new cry to loosen floods it was too late to think of an operation to divide them they held the heart of the cause between them were bound fast together and had to go on beauchamp with a furious tug of radicalism spoken or performed pulled cougham on his beamends cougham to right himself defined his liberalism sharply from the politics of the pit pointed to france and her revolutions washed his hands of excesses and entirely overset beauchamp seeing that he stood in the liberal interest the junior could not abandon the liberal flag so he seized it and bore it ahead of the time there where radicals trip their phantom dances like shadows on a fog and waved it as the very flag of our perfectible race so great was the impetus that cougham had no choice but to step out with him brisklyvoluntarily as a man propelled by a hand on his coatcollar a word saved him the word practical are we practical he inquired and shivered beauchamps galloping frame with a violent application of the stop abrupt for that question are we practical penetrates the bosom of an english audience and will surely elicit a response if not plaudits practical or not the good people affectingly wish to be thought practical it has been asked by them if were not practical what are webeauchamp talking to cougham apart would argue that the daring and the farsighted course was often the most practical cougham extended a deprecating hand yes i have gone over all that occasionally he was maddening the melancholy position of the senior and junior liberals was known abroad and matter of derision it happened that the gay and goodhumoured young lord palmet heir to the earldom of elsea walking up the high street of bevisham met beauchamp on tuesday morning as he sallied out of his hotel to canvass lord palmet was one of the numerous halffriends of cecil baskelett and it may be a revelation of his character to you that he owned to liking beauchamp because of his having always been a favourite with the women he began chattering with beauchamps hand in his ive hit on you have i my dear fellow miss halkett was talking of you last night i slept at mount laurels went on purpose to have a peep im bound for itchincope theyve some grand procession in view there lespel wrote for my team i suspect hes for starting some new october races he talks of halfadozen drags he must have lots of women there i say what a splendid creature cissy halkett has shot up she topped the season this year and will next youre for the darkies beauchamp so am i when i dont see a blonde just as a fellow admires a girl when theres no married woman or widow in sight and i say it cant be true youve gone in for that crazy radicalism theres nothing to be gained by it you know the women hate it a married blonde of fiveand twentys the venus of them all mind you i dont forget that mrs wardourdevereux is a thoroughpaced brunette but upon my honour id bet on cissy halkett at forty a dark eye in woman if you like but blue and auburn drive it into a corner lord palmet concluded by asking beauchamp what he was doing and whither going beauchamp proposed to him maliciously as one of our hereditary legislators to come and see something of canvassing lord palmet had no objection capital opportunity for a review of their women he remarked i map the places for pretty women in england some parts of norfolk and a spot or two in cumberland and wales and the island over there i know thoroughly those jutes have turned out some splendid fair women devonshires worth a tour my man davis is in charge of my team and he drives to itchincope from washwater station i am independent i ll have an hour with you do you think much of the women here beauchamp had not noticed them palmet observed that he should not have noticed anything else but you are qualifying for the upper house beauchamp said in the tone of an encomium palmet accepted the statement though i shall never care to figure before peeresses he said i cant tell you why theres a heavy sprinkling of the old bird among them it isnt that theres too much plumage i think it must be that a cloud of millinery shoots me off a mile from a woman in my opinion witches are the only ones for wearing jewels without chilling the feminine atmosphere about them fellows think differently lord palmet waved a hand expressive of purely amiable tolerance for this question upon the most important topic of human affairs was deep and no judgement should be hasty in settling it im peculiar he resumed a rose and a string of pearls a woman who goes beyond thats in danger of petrifying herself and her fellow man two women in paris last winter set us on fire with pale thin gold ornamentsneck wrists ears ruche skirts all in a flutter and so were you but you felt witchcraft the magical orient vivian ducie called the blonde and the dark beauty young endor her name said beauchamp a marquise i forget her name the other was countess rastaglione you must have heard of her a towering witch an empress helen of troy though ducie would have it the brunette was queen of paris for french taste if you like countess rastaglione was a lady enamelled on the scroll of fame did you see them together said beauchamp they werent together palmet looked at him and laughed youre yourself again are you go to paris in january and cut out the frenchmen answer me palmet they werent in couples i fancy not it was luck to meet them so they couldnt have been did you dance with either of them unable to state accurately that he had palmet cried oh for dancing the frenchwoman beat the italian did you see her oftenmore than once my dear fellow i went everywhere to see her balls theatres promenades rides churches and you say she dressed up to the italian to challenge her rival her only one night simple accident everybody noticed it for they stood for night and dayboth hung with gold the brunette etruscan and the blonde asiatic and every frenchman present was epigramizing up and down the rooms like mad her husband s legitimist he wouldnt be at the tuileries beauchamp spoke half to himself what then what palmet stared and chuckled her husband must have taken the tuileries bait if we mean the same woman my dear old beauchamp have i seen her then shes a darling the rastaglione was nothing to her when you do light on a grand smoky pearl the milky ones may go and decorate plaster thats what i say of the loveliest brunettes it must be the same there cant be a couple of dark beauties in paris without a noise about them marquise i shall recollect her name presently heres one of the houses i stop at said beauchamp and drop that subject a scared servantgirl brought out her wizened mistress to confront the candidate and to this representative of the sex he addressed his arts of persuasion requesting her to repeat his words to her husband the contrast between beauchamp palpably canvassing and the beauchamp who was the lover of the marquise of the forgotten name struck too powerfully on palmet for his gravity he retreated beauchamp found him sauntering on the pavement and would have dismissed him but for an agreeable diversion that occurred at that moment a suavely smiling unctuous old gentleman advanced to them bowing and presuming thus far he said under the supposition that he was accosting the junior liberal candidate for the borough he announced his name and his principles tomlinson progressive liberal a true distinction from some liberals i know said beauchamp mr tomlinson hoped so never he said did he leave it to the man of his choice at an election to knock at his door for the vote beauchamp looked as if he had swallowed a cordial votes falling into his lap are heavenly gifts to the candidate sick of the knocker and the bell mr tomlinson eulogized the manly candour of the junior liberal candidates address in which he professed to see ideas that distinguished it from the address of the sound but otherwise conventional liberal mr cougham he muttered of plumping for beauchamp dont plump beauchamp said and a candidate if he would be an honourable twin must say it cougham had cautioned him against the heresy of plumping they discoursed of the poor and their beverages of pothouses of the antiliquorites and of the duties of parsons and the value of a robust and rightminded body of the poor to the country palmet found himself following them into a tolerably spacious house that he took to be the old gentlemans until some of the apparatus of an institute for literary and scientific instruction revealed itself to him and he heard mr tomlinson exalt the memory of one wingham for the blessing bequeathed by him to the town of bevisham for said mr tomlinson it is open to both sexes to all respectable classes from ten in the morning up to ten at night such a place affords us i would venture to say the advantages without the seductions of a club i rank it nextat a far remove but nextthe church lord palmet brought his eyes down from the busts of certain worthies ranged along the top of the bookshelves to the cushioned chairs and murmured capital place for an appointment with a woman mr tomlinson gazed up at him mildly with a fallen countenance he turned sadly agape in silence to the busts the books and the range of scientific instruments and directed a gaze under his eyebrows at beauchamp does your friend canvass with you he inquired i want him to taste it beauchamp replied and immediately introduced the affable young lorda proceeding marked by some of the dexterity he had once been famous for as was shown by a subsequent observation of mr tomlinsons yes he said on the question of classes yes i fear we have classes in this country whose habitual levity sharp experience will have to correct i very much fear it but if you have classes that are not to face realities classes that look on them from the boxseats of a theatre said beauchamp how can you expect perfect seriousness or any good service whatever gently sir gently no we can i feel confident expand within the limits of our most excellent and approved constitution i could wish that socially that is all socially and politically mean one thing in the end said beauchamp if you have a nation politically corrupt you wont have a good state of morals in it and the laws that keep society together bear upon the politics of a country true yes mr tomlinson hesitated assent he dissociated beauchamp from lord palmet but felt keenly that the latters presence desecrated winghams institute and he informed the candidate that he thought he would no longer detain him from his labours just the sort of place wanted in every provincial town palmet remarked by way of a parting compliment mr tomlinson bowed a civil acknowledgement of his having again spoken no further mention was made of the miraculous vote which had risen responsive to the candidates address of its own inspired motion so beauchamp said i beg you to bear in mind that i request you not to plump you may be right captain beauchamp good day sir palmet strode after beauchamp into the street why did you set me bowing to that old boy he asked why did you talk about women was the rejoinder oh aha palmet sang to himself youre a romfrey beauchamp a blow for a blow but i only said what would strike every fellow first off it is the place the very place pastrycooks shops wont stand comparison with it dont tell me you re the man not to see how much a woman prefers to be under the wing of science and literature in a good sized wellwarmed room with a book instead of making believe with a red face over a tart he received a smart lecture from beauchamp and began to think he had enough of canvassing but he was not suffered to escape for his instruction for his positive and extreme good beauchamp determined that the heir to an earldom should have a days lesson we will hope there was no intention to punish him for having frozen the genial current of mr tomlinsons vote and interest and it may be that he clung to one who had as he imagined seen renee accompanied by a mr oggler a tradesman of the town on the liberal committee dressed in a peajacket and proudly nautical they applied for the vote and found it oftener than beauty palmet contrasted his repeated disappointments with the scoring of two three four and more in the candidates list and informed him that he would certainly get the election i think youre sure of it he said theres not a pretty woman to be seen not one one came up to them the sight of whom counselled lord palmet to reconsider his verdict she was addressed by beauchamp as miss denham and soon passed on palmet was guilty of staring at her and of lingering behind the others for a last look at her they were on the steps of a voters house calmly enduring a rebuff from him in person when palmet returned to them exclaiming effusively what luck you have beauchamp he stopped till the applicants descended the steps with the voice of the voter ringing contempt as well as refusal in their ears then continued you introduced me neck and heels to that undertakerly old tomlinson of winghams institute you might have given me a chance with that missmiss denham was it she has a bit of a style she has a head said beauchamp a girl like that may have what she likes i dont care what she has theres woman in her you might take her for a younger sister of mrs wardourdevereux who s the uncle she speaks of she ought not to be allowed to walk out by herself she can take care of herself said beauchamp palmet denied it no woman can upon my honour its a shame that she should be out alone what are her people ill runfrom you you know and see her safe home theres such an infernal lot of fellows about and a girl simply bewitching and unprotected i ought to be after her beauchamp held him firmly to the task of canvassing then will you tell me where she lives palmet stipulated he reproached beauchamp for a notorious grand turk exclusiveness and greediness in regard to women as well as a disposition to run hard races for them out of a spirit of pure rivalry its no use contradicting its universally known of you reiterated palmet i could name a dozen women and dozens of fellows you deliberately set yourself to cut out for the honour of it whats that story they tell of you in one of the american cities or wateringplaces north or south you would dance at a ball a dozen times with a girl engaged to a manwho drenched you with a tumbler at the hotel bar and off you all marched to the sands and exchanged shots from revolvers and both of you they say saw the body of a drowned sailor in the water in the moonlight heaving nearer and nearer and you stretched your man just as the body was flung up by a wave between you picturesque if you like dramatic certainly and i ran away with the bride next morning no roared palmet you didnt theres the cruelty of the whole affair beauchamp laughed an old messmate of mine lieutenant jack wilmore can give you a different version of the story i never have fought a duel and never will here we are at the shop of a tough voter mr oggler so it says in my notebook shall we put lord palmet to speak to him first if his lordship will put his heart into what he says mr oggler bowed are you for giving the people recreation on a sunday my lord trapbat and ball cricket dancing military bands puppetshows theatres merrygorounds bosky dellsanything to make them happy said palmet oh dear then i m afraid we cannot ask you to speak to this mr carpendike oggler shook his head does the fellow want the people to be miserable im afraid my lord he would rather see them miserable they introduced themselves to mr carpendike in his shop he was a flat chested sallow young shoemaker with a shelving forehead who seeing three gentlemen enter to him recognized at once with a practised resignation that they had not come to order shoeleather though he would fain have shod them being needy but it was not the design of providence that they should so come as he in his blindness would have had them admitting this he wished for nothing the battle with carpendike lasted threequarters of an hour during which he was chiefly and most effectively silent carpendike would not vote for a man that proposed to open museums on the sabbath day the striking simile of the thin end of the wedge was recurred to by him for a damning illustration captain beauchamp might be honest in putting his mind on most questions in his address when there was no demand upon him to do it but honesty was no antidote to impiety thus carpendike as to sunday museuming being an antidote to the pothouseno for the people knew the frequenting of the pothouse to be a vice it was a temptation of satan that often in overcoming them was the cause of their flying back to grace whereas museums and picture galleries were insidious attractions cloaked by the name of virtue whereby they were allured to abandon worship beauchamp flew at this young monster of unreason but the people are not worshipping they are idling and sotting and if you carry your despotism farther still and shut them out of every shop on sundays do you suppose you promote the spirit of worship if you dont revolt them you unman them and i warn you we cant afford to destroy what manhood remains to us in england look at the facts he flung the facts at carpendike with the natural exaggeration of them which eloquence produces rather as a rule to assure itself in passing of the overwhelming justice of the cause it pleads than to deceive the adversary brewers beer and publicans beer wifebeatings the homes and the blood of the people were matters reviewed to the confusion of sabbatarians carpendike listened with a bent head upraised eyes and brows wrinkling far on to his poll a picture of a mind entrenched beyond the potentialities of mortal assault he signified that he had spoken indeed beauchamps reply was vain to one whose argument was that he considered the people nearer to holiness in the indulging of an evil propensity than in satisfying a harmless curiosity and getting a recreation the sabbath claimed them if they were disobedient sin ultimately might scourge them back to the fold but never if they were permitted to regard themselves as innocent in their backsliding and rebelliousness such language was quite new to beauchamp the parsons he had spoken to were of one voice in objecting to the pothouse he appealed to carpendikes humanity carpendike smote him with a text from scripture devilish cold in this shop muttered palmet two not flourishing little children of the emaciated puritan burst into the shop followed by their mother carrying a child in her arms she had a sad look upon traces of a past fairness vaguely like a snow landscape in the thaw palmet stooped to toss shillings with her young ones that he might avoid the womans face it cramped his heart dont you see mr carpendike said fat mr oggler its the happiness of the people we want thats what captain beauchamp works fortheir happiness thats the aim of life for all of us look at me im as happy as the day i pray every night and i go to church every sunday and i never know what it is to be unhappy the lord has blessed me with a good digestion healthy pious children and a prosperous shop thats a competencya modest one but i make it satisfy me because i know its the lords gift well now and i hate sabbathbreakers i would punish them and im against the publichouses on a sunday but aboard my little yacht say on a sunday morning in the channel i dont forget i owe it to the lord that he has been good enough to put me in the way of keeping a yacht no i read prayers to my crew and a chapter in the biblegenesis deuteronomy kings acts paul just as it comes alls good thats there then were free for the day man boy and me we cook our victuals and we must look to the yacht do you see but weve made our peace with the almighty we know that he dont mind the working of the vessel so long as weve remembered him he put us in that situation exactly there latitude and longitude do you see and work the vessel we must and a glass of grog and a pipe after dinner cant be any offence and i tell you honestly and sincerely im sure my conscience is good and i really and truly dont know what it is not to know happiness then you dont know god said carpendike like a voice from a cave or nature or the state of the world said beauchamp singularly impressed to find himself between two men of whomeach perforce of his tenuity and the evident leaning of his appetitesone was for the barren black view of existence the other for the fantastically bright as to the men personally he chose carpendike for all his obstinacy and sourness ogglers genial piety made him shrink with nausea but lord palmet paid mr oggler a memorable compliment by assuring him that he was altogether of his way of thinking about happiness the frank young nobleman did not withhold a reference to the two or three things essential to his happiness otherwise mr oggler might have been pleased and flattered before quitting the shop beauchamp warned carpendike that he should come again vote or no vote youre worth the trial texts as many as you like ill make your faith active if its alive at all you speak of the lord loving his own you make out the lord to be your own and use your religion like a drug so it appears to me that sunday tyranny of yours has to be defended remember that for i for one shall combat it and expose it good day beauchamp continued in the street tyrannies like this fellows have made the english the dullest and wretchedest people in europe palmet animadverted on carpendike the dog looks like a deadly fungus that has poisoned the woman id trust him with a post of danger though said beauchamp before the candidate had opened his mouth to the next elector he was beamed on mgilliper baker a floured brick face leaned on folded arms across his counter and said in scotch my vote and he that asks me for my vote is the man who when he was midshipman saved the life of a relation of mine from death by drowning my wifes first cousin johnny brownsonand held him up four to five minutes in the water and never left him till he was out of danger there s my hand on it i will and a score of householders in bevisham the same he dictated precious names and addresses to beauchamp and was curtly thanked for his pains such treatment of a favourable voter seemed odd to palmet oh a vote given for reasons of sentiment beauchamp interjected palmet reflected and said well perhaps thats how it is women dont care uncommonly for the men who love them though they like precious well to be loved opposition does it you have discovered my likeness to women said beauchamp eyeing him critically and then thinking with a sudden warmth that he had seen renee look here palmet youre too late for itchincope today come and eat fish and meat with me at my hotel and come to a meeting after it you can run by rail to itchincope to breakfast in the morning and i may come with you youll hear one or two men speak well tonight i suppose i shall have to be at this business myself some day sighed palmet any women on the platform oh but political women and the tories get the pick of the women no i dont think i ll stay yes i will ill go through with it i like to be learning something you wouldnt think it of me beauchamp but i envy fellows at work you might make a speech for me palmet no man better my dear fellow if it were proposing a toast to the poor devils and asking them to drink it but a dry speech like leading them over the desert without a well to cheer themno oasis as we used to call a fivepound note and a holidayi havent the heart for that is your miss denham a radical beauchamp asserted that he had not yet met a woman at all inclining in the direction of radicalism i dont call furies radicals there may be women who think as well as feel i dont know them lots of them beauchamp take my word for it i do know women they havent a shift nor a trick i dont know theyre as clear to me as glass ill wager your miss denham goes to the meetings now doesnt she of course she does and there couldnt be a gallanter way of spending an evening so ill try it nothing to repent of next morning thats to be said for politics beauchamp and i confess im rather jealous of you a thoroughly goodlooking girl who takes to a fellow for what hes doing in the world must have ideas of him precious different from the adoration of six feet three and a fine seat in the saddle i see that theres baskelett in the blues and if i were he i should detest my cuirass and helmet for if hes half as successful as he boastsits the uniform two notorious radicals peter molyneux and samuel killick were called on the first saw beauchamp and refused him the second declined to see him he was amazed and staggered but said little among the remainder of the electors of bevisham roused that day to a sense of their independence by the summons of the candidates only one man made himself conspicuous by premising that he had two important questions to ask and he trusted commander beauchamp to answer them unreservedly they were first what is a french marquees arid second who was eurydicey beauchamp referred him to the tory camp whence the placard alluding to those ladies had issued both of them s ladies i guessed it said the elector did you guess that one of them is a mythological lady im not far wrong in guessing tothers not much better i reckon now sir may i ask you is there any tale concerning your morals no you may not ask you take a liberty then ill take the liberty to postpone talking about my vote look here mr commander if the upper classes want anything of me and come to me for it ill know what sort of an example theyre setting now thats me you pay attention to a stupid tory squib where theres smoke theres fire sir beauchamp glanced at his notebook for the name of this man who was a ragman and dustman my private character has nothing whatever to do with my politics he said and had barely said it when he remembered having spoken somewhat differently upon the abstract consideration of the case to mr tomlinson youre quite welcome to examine my character for yourself only i dont consent to be catechized understand that you quite understand that mr tripehallow said oggler bolder in taking up the strange name than beauchamp had been i understand that but you understand theres never been a word against the morals of mr cougham heres the point do we mean to be a moral country very well then so let our representatives be i say and if i hear nothing against your morals mr commander i dont say you shant have my vote i mean to deliberate you young nobs capering over our headsi nail you down to morals politics secondary adew as the dying spirit remarked to weeping friends au revoirwould have been kinder said palmet mr tripehallow smiled roguishly to betoken comprehension beauchamp asked mr oggler whether that fellow was to be taken for a humourist or a fivepoundnote man it may be both sir i know hes called morality joseph an all but acknowledged fivepoundnote man was the last they visited he cut short the preliminaries of the interview by saying that he was a fouroclock man ie the man who waited for the final bids to him upon the closing hour of the election day not one farthing said beauchamp having been warned beforehand of the signification of the phrase by his canvassing lieutenant then youre nowhere the honest fellow replied in the mystic tongue of prophecy palmet and beauchamp went to their fish and meat smoked a cigarette or two afterward conjured away the smell of tobacco from their persons as well as they could and betook themselves to the assemblyroom of the liberal party where the young lord had an opportunity of beholding mr cougham and of listening to him for an hour and forty minutes he heard mr timothy turbot likewise and miss denham was present lord palmet applauded when she smiled when she looked attentive he was deeply studious her expression of fatigue under the sonorous ring of statistics poured out from cougham was translated by palmet into yawns and sighs of a profoundly fraternal sympathy her face quickened on the rising of beauchamp to speak she kept eye on him all the while as palmet with the skill of an adept in disguising his petty larceny of the optics did on her twice or thrice she looked pained beauchamp was hesitating for the word once she looked startled and shut her eyes a hiss had sounded beauchamp sprang on it as if enlivened by hostility and dominated the factious note thereat she turned to a gentleman sitting beside her apparently they agreed that some incident had occurred characteristic of nevil beauchamp for whom however it was not a brilliant evening he was very well able to account for it and did so after he had walked a few steps with miss denham on her homeward way you heard cougham palmet hes my senior and im obliged to come second to him and how am i to have a chance when he has drenched the audience for close upon a couple of hours palmet mimicked the manner of cougham they cry for turbot naturally they want a relief beauchamp groaned palmet gave an imitation of timothy turbot he was an admirable mimic perfectly spontaneous without stressing any points and beauchamp was provoked to laugh his discontentment with the evening out of recollection but a grave matter troubled palmets head who was that fellow who walked off with miss denham a married man said beauchamp badly married more s the pity he has a wife in the madhouse his name is lydiard not her brother wheres her uncle she wont let him come to these meetings its her idea well intended but wrong i think shes afraid that dr shrapnel will alarm the moderate liberals and damage radical me palmet muttered between his teeth what queer things they let their women do he felt compelled to say odd for her to be walking home at night with a fellow like that it chimed too consonantly with a feeling of beauchamps to repress which he replied your ideas about women are simply barbarous palmet why shouldnt she her uncle places his confidence in the man and in her isnt that betterten times more likely to call out the sense of honour and loyalty than the distrust and the scandal going on in your class please to say yours too ive no class i say that the education for women is to teach them to rely on themselves ah well i dont object if im the man because you and your set are absolutely uncivilized in your views of women common sense beauchamp prey you eye them as prey and it comes of an idle aristocracy you have no faith in them and they repay you for your suspicion all the same beauchamp she ought not to be allowed to go about at night with that fellow rich and rare were the gems she wore but that was in erins isle and if we knew the whole history shed better have stopped at home shes marvellously pretty to my mind she looks a highbred wench odd it is beauchamp to see a ladysmaid now and then catch the style of my lady no by jove ive known one or twoyou couldnt tell the difference not till you were intimate i know one would walk a minuet with a duchess of courseall the worse for her if you see that uncle of miss denhamsupon my honour i should advise him i mean counsel him not to trust her with any fellow but you beauchamp asked lord palmet how old he was palmet gave his age correcting the figures from sixandtwenty to one year more and never did a stroke of work in my life he said speaking genially out of an acute guess at the sentiments of the man he walked with it seemed a farcical state of things there was a kind of contrition in palmets voice and to put him at his ease as well as to stamp something in his own mind beauchamp said its common enough chapter xx a day at itchincope an election in bevisham was always an exciting period at itchincope the large and influential old estate of the lespels which at one time with but a ceremonious drive through the town sent you two good whig men to parliament to sit at reform banquets two unswerving party men blest subscribers to the right review and personally proud of its trenchancy mr grancey lespel was the survivor of them and well could he remember the happier day of his grandfather his father and his own hot youth he could be carried so far by affectionate regrets as to think of the tories of that day benignlywhen his champion review of the orange and blue livery waved a wondrous sharp knife and stuck and bled them proving to his party by trenchancy alone that the whig was the cause of providence then politics presented you a table whereat two parties feasted with no fear of the intrusion of a third and your backs were turned on the noisy lower world your ears were deaf to it apply we now the knocker to the door of venerable quotation and call the aged creature forth that he half choked by his eheu a sound between a sigh and bray may pronounce the familiar but respectable words the burialservice of a time so happy mr grancey lespel would still have been sitting for bevisham or politely at this elective moment bowing to resume the seat had not those manchester jugglers caught up his cry appropriated his colours displaced and impersonated him acting beneficent whig on a scale approaching treason to the constitution leaning on the people in earnest instead of taking the popular shoulder for a temporary lift all in high party policy for the clever manoeuvre to oust the tory and sway the realm see the consequences for power for no other consideration those manufacturing rascals have raised radicalism from its primaeval mirefrom its petty backslum booksellers shop and publichouse back parlour effluvia of oratoryto issue dictates in england and we england formerly the oak are topsyturvy like onions our heels in the air the language of party is eloquent and famous for being grand at illustration but it is equally well known that much of it gives us humble ideas of the speaker probably because of the naughty temper party is prone to which while endowing it with vehemence lessens the stout circumferential view that should be taken at least historically indeed though we admit party to be the soundest method for conducting us party talk soon expends its attractiveness as would a summers afternoon given up to the contemplation of an encounter of rams heads let us be quit of mr grancey lespels lamentations the whig gentleman had some reason to complain he had been trained to expect no other attack than that of his hereditary adversaryram in front and a sham ramno honest animal but a ramming engine ratherhad attacked him in the rear like mr everard romfrey and other whigs he was profoundly chagrined by popular ingratitude not the same man his wife said of him it nipped him early he took to proverbs sure sign of the sere leaf in a mans mind his wife reproached the people for their behaviour to him bitterly the lady regarded politics as a business that helped huntingmen a stage above sportsmen for numbers of the politicians she was acquainted with were huntingmen yet something more by virtue of the variety they could introduce into a conversation ordinarily treating of sport and the qualities of wines her husband seemed to have lost in that parliamentary seat the talisman which gave him notions distinguishing him from country squires he had sunk and he no longer cared for the months in london nor for the speeches she read to him to reawaken his mind and make him look out of himself as he had done when he was a younger man and not a suspended whig her own favourite reading was of love adventures written in the french tongue she had once been in love and could be so sympathetic with that passion as to avow to cecilia halkett a tenderness for nevil beauchamp on account of his relations with the marquise de rouaillout and notwithstanding the demoniacal flamehalo of the radical encircling him the allusion to beauchamp occurred a few hours after cecilias arrival at itchincope cecilia begged for the french ladys name to be repeated she had not heard it before and she tasted the strange bitter relish of realization when it struck her ear to confirm a story that she believed indeed but had not quite sensibly felt and it is not over yet they say mrs grancey lespel added while softly flipping some spots of the colour proper to radicals in morals on the fame of the french lady she possessed fully the grave judicial spirit of her countrywomen and could sit in judgement on the personages of tales which had entranced her to condemn the heroines it was impolitic in her sex to pity females as for the menpoor weak things as for nevil beauchamp in particular his case this penetrating lady said was clear he ought to be married could you make a sacrifice she asked cecilia playfully nevil beauchamp and i are old friends but we have agreed that we are deadly political enemies miss halkett replied it is not so bad for a beginning said mrs lespel if one were disposed to martyrdom the older woman nodded without that my dear mrs lespel wait till you have heard him he is at war with everything we venerate and build on the wife you would give him should be a creature rooted in nothingin seawater simply two or three conversations with him have made me uncomfortable ever since i can see nothing durable i dream of surprises outbreaks dreadful events at least it is perfectly true that i do not look with the same eyes on my country he seems to delight in destroying ones peaceful contemplation of life the truth is that he blows a perpetual gale and is all agitation cecilia concluded affecting with a smile a slight shiver yes one tires of that said mrs lespel i was determined i would have him here if we could get him to come grancey objected we shall have to manage captain beauchamp and the rest as well he is sure to come late tomorrow and will leave early on thursday morning for his canvass our driving into bevisham is for friday or saturday i do not see that he need have any suspicions those verses you are so angry about cannot be traced to itchincope my dear they are a childish trifle when my husband stood first for bevisham the whole of his university life appeared in print what we have to do is to forewarn the gentlemen to be guarded and especially in what they say to my nephew lord palmet for that boy cannot keep a secret he is as open as a plate the smokingroom at night cecilia suggested remembering her fathers words about itchincopes tobaccohall they have captain beauchamps address hung up there i have heard said mrs lespel there may be other thingsanother address though it is not yet placarded come with me for fifteen years i have never once put my head into that room and now i ve a superstitious fear about it mrs lespel led the way to the deserted smokingroom where the stale reek of tobacco assailed the ladies as does that dire place of customs the stranger visiting savage or too natural potentates in silence they tore down from the wall beauchamps electoral address flanked all its length with satirical pen and pencil comments and sketches and they consigned to flames the vast sheet of animated verses relating to the french marquees a quartersize chalkdrawing of a slippered pantaloon having a duck on his shoulder labelled to say quackquack and offering our nauseated dame britannia or else it was the widow bevisham a globe of a pill to swallow crossed with the consolatory and reassuring name of shrapnel they disposed of likewise and then they fled chased forth either by the brilliancy of the politically allusive epigrams profusely inscribed around them on the walls or by the atmosphere mrs lespel gave her orders for the walls to be scraped and said to cecilia a strange air to breathe was it not the less men and women know of one another the happier for them i knew my superstition was correct as a guide to me i do so much wish to respect men and all my experience tells me the turks know best how to preserve it for us two men in this house would give their wives for pipes if it came to the choice we might all go for a cellar of old wine after forty men have married their habits and wives are only an item in the list and not the most important with the assistance of mr stukely culbrett mrs lespel prepared the house and those of the company who were in the secret of affairs for the arrival of beauchamp the ladies were curious to see him the gentlemen not anticipating extreme amusement were calm for it is an axiom in the world of buckskins and billiardcues that one man is very like another and so true is it with them that they can in time teach it to the fair sex friends of cecil baskelett predominated and the absence of so sprightly a fellow was regretted seriously but he was shooting with his uncle at holdesbury and they did not expect him before thursday on wednesday morning lord palmet presented himself at a remarkably well attended breakfasttable at itchincope he passed from mrs lespel to mrs wardourdevsreux and miss halkett bowed to other ladies shook hands with two or three men and nodded over the heads of halfadozen accounting rather mysteriously for his delay in coming it was thought until he sat down before a plate of yorkshire pie and said the fact is ive been canvassing hard with beauchamp astonishment and laughter surrounded him and palmet looked from face to face equally astonished and desirous to laugh too ernest how could you do that said mrs lespel and her husband cried in stupefaction with beauchamp oh its because of the radicalism palmet murmured to himself i didnt mind that what sort of a day did you have mr culbrett asked him and several gentlemen fell upon him for an account of the day palmet grimaced over a mouthful of his pie bad quoth mr lespel i knew it i know bevisham the only chance there is for five thousand pounds in a sack with a hole in it bad for beauchamp dear me no palmet corrected the error he is carrying all before him and he tells them palmet mimicked beauchamp they shall not have one penny not a farthing i gave a couple of young ones a shilling apiece and he rowed me for bribery somehow i did wrong lord palmet described the various unearthly characters he had inspected in their dens carpendike tripehallow and the radicals peter molyneux and samuel killick and the exmember for the borough cougham posing to suit signboards of liberal inns with a hand thrust in his waistcoat and his head well up the eyes running over the underlids after the traditional style of our aristocracy but perhaps more closely resembling an urchin on tiptoe peering above parkpalings coughams remark to beauchamp heard and repeated by palmet with the object of giving an example of the senior liberals phraseology i was necessitated to vacate my town mansion to my material discomfort and that of my wife whose equipage i have been compelled to take by your premature canvass of the borough captain beauchamp and now i hear on undeniable authority that no second opponent to us will be forthcomingthis produced the greatest effect on the company but do you tell me said mr lespel when the shouts of the gentlemen were subsiding do you tell me that young beauchamp is going ahead that he is they flock to him in the street he stands there then and jingles a moneybag palmet resumed his mimicry of beauchamp not a stiver purity of election is the first condition of instruction to the people principles then theyve got a capital orator turbot an irishman i went to a meeting last night and heard him never heard anything finer in my life you may laugh he whipped me off my legs fellow spun me like a top and while he was orationing a donkey calls turbot aint you a flat fish and he swings round not for a fools hook and out they hustled the villain for a tory i never saw anything like it that repartee wouldnt have done with a dutchman or a torbay trawler said stukely culbrett but let us hear more is it fair miss halkett murmured anxiously to mrs lespel who returned a flitting shrug charming women follow beauchamp you know palmet proceeded as he conceived to confirm and heighten the tale of success theres a miss denham niece of a doctor a dr shotshrapnel a wonderfully goodlooking cleverlooking girl comes across him in half adozen streets to ask how hes getting on and goes every night to his meetings with a man who s a writer and has a mad wife a man named lydiano thats a womanlydiard its rather a jumble but you should see her when beauchamps on his legs and speaking mr lydiard is in bevisham mrs wardourdevereux remarked i know the girl growled mr lespel she comes with that rascally doctor and a bobtail of teadrinking men and women and their brats to northeden heathmy ground there they stand and sing hymnsinquired mr culbrett i dont know what they sing and when it rains they take the liberty to step over my bank into my plantation some day i shall have them stepping into my house yes its mr lydiard im sure of the mans name palmet replied to mrs wardourdevereux we met him in spain the year before last she observed to cecilia the we reminded palmet that her husband was present ah devereux i didnt see you he nodded obliquely down the table by the way whats the grand procession i hear my man davis has come all right and i caught sight of the top of your coachbox in the stableyard as i came in what are we up to baskelett writes its to be for tomorrow morning at tenthe start mr wardourdevereux addressed the table generally he was a fair huge bushbearded man with a voice of unvarying bass a squire in his county and energetic in his pursuit of the pleasures of hunting driving travelling and tobacco old basks the captain of us very well but where do we drive the teams how many are we whats in hand cecilia threw a hurried glance at her hostess luckily some witling said foursinhand and so dryly that it passed for humour and gave mrs lespel time to interpose you are not to know till tomorrow ernest palmet had traced the authorship of the sally to mr algy borolick and crowned him with praise for it he asked why not know till tomorrow a word in a murmur from mr culbrett dont frighten the women satisfied him though why it should he could not have imagined mrs lespel quitted the breakfasttable before the setting in of the dangerous five minutes of conversation over its ruins and spoke to her husband who contested the necessity for secresy but yielded to her judgement when it was backed by stukely culbrett soon after lord palmet found himself encountered by evasions and witticisms in spite of the absence of the ladies upon every attempt he made to get some light regarding the destination of the fourinhands next day what are you going to do he said to mr devereux thinking him the likeliest one to grow confidential in private smoke resounded from the depths of that gentleman palmet recollected the ground of division between the beautiful brunette and her lordhis addiction to the pipe in perpetuity and deemed it sweeter to be with the lady she and miss halkett were walking in the garden miss halkett said to him how wrong of you to betray the secrets of your friend is he really making way beauchamp will head the poll to a certainty palmet replied still said miss halkett you should not forget that you are not in the house of a liberal did you canvass in the town or the suburbs everywhere i assure you miss halkett theres a feeling for beauchamptheyre in love with him he promises them everything i suppose not he and the odd thing is it isnt the radicals he catches he wont go against the game laws for them and he wont cut down army and navy so the radicals yell at him one confessed he had sold his vote for five pounds last election you shall have it for the same says he for youre all humbugs beauchamp took him by the throat and shook himmetaphorically you know but as for the tradesmen hes their hero bakers especially mr austin may be right then cecilia reflected aloud she went to mrs lespel to repeat what she had extracted from palmet after warning the latter not in common loyalty to converse about his canvass with beauchamp did you speak of mr lydiard as captain beauchamps friend mrs devereux inquired of him lydiard why he was the man who made off with that pretty miss denham said palmet i have the greatest trouble to remember them all but it was not a day wasted now i know politics shall we ride or walk you will let me have the happiness im so unlucky i rarely meet you you will bring captain beauchamp to me the moment he comes ill bring him bring him nevil beauchamp wont want bringing mrs devereux smiled with some pleasure grancey lespel followed at some distance by mr ferbrass the tory lawyer stepped quickly up to palmet and asked whether beauchamp had seen dollikins the brewer palmet could recollect the name of one tomlinson and also the calling at a brewery moreover beauchamp had uttered contempt of the brewers business and of the social rule to accept rich brewers for gentlemen the mans name might be dollikins and not tomlinson and if so it was dollikins who would not see beauchamp to preserve his political importance palmet said dollikins to be sure that was the man treats him as he does you mr lespel turned to ferbrass ive sent to dollikins to come to me this morning if hes not driving into the town ill have him before beauchamp sees him ive asked halfadozen of these country gentlementradesmen to lunch at my table today then sir observed ferbrass if they are men to be persuaded they had better not see me true theyre my old supporters and mightnt like your tory face mr lespel assented mr ferbrass congratulated him on the heartiness of his espousal of the tory cause mr lespel winced a little and told him not to put his trust in that turned tory said palmet mr lespel declined to answer palmet said to mrs devereux he thinks im not worth speaking to upon politics now ill give him some beauchamp i learned lots yesterday then let it be in captain beauchamps manner said she softly palmet obeyed her commands with the liveliest exhibition of his peculiar faculty cecilia rejoining them seemed to hear nevil himself in his emphatic political mood because the whigs are defunct they had no root in the people whig is the name of a tribe that was you have tory liberal and radical there is no place for whig he is played out who has been putting that nonsense into your head mr lespel retorted go shooting go shooting shots were heard in the woods palmet pricked up his ears but he was taken out riding to act cavalier to mrs devereux and miss halkett cecilia corrected his enthusiasm with the situation no flatteries today there are hours when women feel their insignificance and helplessness i begin to fear for mr austin and i find i can do nothing to aid him my hands are tied and yet i know i could win voters if only it were permissible for me to go and speak to them win them cried palmet imagining the alacrity of mens votes to be won by her he recommended a gallop for the chasing away of melancholy and as they were on the bevisham high road which was bordered by strips of turf and heath a few good stretches brought them on the firheights commanding views of the town and broad water no i cannot enjoy it cecilia said to mrs devereux i dont mind the grey light cloud and water and halftones of colour are homely english and pleasant and that opal where the sun should be has a suggestiveness richer than sunlight im quite northern enough to understand it but with me it must be either peace or strife and that election down there destroys my chance of peace i never could mix reverie with excitement the battle must be over first and the dead buried can you mrs devereux answered excitement i am not sure that i know what it is an election does not excite me theres nevil beauchamp himself palmet sang out and the ladies discerned beauchamp under a firtree down by the road not alone a man increasing in length like a telescope gradually reaching its end for observation and coming to the height of a landmark as if raised by ropes was rising from the ground beside him shall we trot on miss halkett cecilia said no now i see a third fellow said palmet its the other fellow the denhamshrapnelradical meeting lydiards his name writes books we may as well ride on mrs devereux remarked and her horse fretted singularly beauchamp perceived them and lifted his hat palmet made demonstrations for the ladies still neither party moved nearer after some waiting cecilia proposed to turn back mrs devereux looked into her eyes ill take the lead she said and started forward pursued by palmet cecilia followed at a sullen canter before they came up to beauchamp the longshanked man had stalked away townward lydiard held beauchamp by the hand some last words after the manner of instructions passed between them and then lydiard also turned away i say beauchamp mrs devereux wants to hear who that man is palmet said drawing up that man is dr shrapnel said beauchamp convinced that cecilia had checked her horse at the sight of the doctor dr shrapnel palmet informed mrs devereux she looked at him to seek his wits and returning beauchamps admiring salutation with a little bow and smile said i fancied it was a gentleman we met in spain he writes books observed palmet to jog a slow intelligence pamphlets you mean i think he is not a pamphleteer mrs devereux said mr lydiard then of course how silly i am how can you pardon me beauchamp was contrite he could not explain that a long guess he had made at miss halketts reluctance to come up to him when dr shrapnel was with him had preoccupied his mind he sent off palmet the bearer of a pretext for bringing lydiard back and then said to cecilia you recognized dr shrapnel i thought it might be dr shrapnel she was candid enough to reply i could not well recognize him not knowing him here comes mr lydiard and let me assure you if i may take the liberty of introducing him he is no true radical he is a philosopherone of the flirts the butterflies of politics as dr shrapnel calls them beauchamp hummed over some improvized trifles to lydiard then introduced him cursorily and all walked in the direction of itchincope it was really the mr lydiard mrs devereux had met in spain so they were left in the rear to discuss their travels much conversation did not go on in front cecilia was very reserved byandby she said i am glad you have come into the country early today he spoke rapturously of the fresh air and not too mildly of his pleasure in meeting her quite off her guard she began to hope he was getting to be one of them again until she heard him tell lord palmet that he had come early out of bevisham for the walk with dr shrapnel and to call on certain rich tradesmen living near itchincope he mentioned the name of dollikins dollikins palmet consulted a perturbed recollection among the entangled list of new names he had gathered recently from the study of politics dollikins rang in his head he shouted yes dollikins to be sure lespel has him to lunch todaycalls him a gentleman tradesman odd fish and told a fellow calledwhere is it nowa name like brass or copper copperstone brasspot told him hed do well to keep his tory cheek out of sight it s the names of those fellows bother one so all the rests easy you are evidently in a state of confusion lord palmet said cecilia the tone of rebuke and admonishment was unperceived not about the facts he rejoined i m for fair play all round no trickery i tell beauchamp all i know just as i told you this morning miss halkett what i dont like is lespel turning tory cecilia put a stop to his indiscretions by halting for mrs devereux and saying to beauchamp if your friend would return to bevisham by rail this is the nearest point to the station palmet bestnatured of men though generally prompted by some of his peculiar motives dismounted from his horse leaving him to beauchamp that he might conduct mr lydiard to the station and perhaps hear a word of miss denham at any rate be able to form a guess as to the secret of that art of his which had in the space of an hour restored a happy and luminous vivacity to the languid mrs wardourdevereux chapter xxi the question as to the examination of the whigs and the fine blow struck by mr everard romfrey itchincope was famous for its hospitality yet beauchamp when in the presence of his hostess could see that he was both unexpected and unwelcome mrs lespel was unable to conceal it she looked meaningly at cecilia talked of the house being very full and her husband engaged till late in the afternoon and captain baskelett had arrived on a sudden she said and the luncheontable in the diningroom could not possibly hold more we three will sit in the library anywhere said cecilia so they sat and lunched in the library where mrs devereux served unconsciously for an excellent ally to cecilia in chatting to beauchamp principally of the writings of mr lydiard had the blinds of the windows been drawn down and candles lighted beauchamp would have been well contented to remain with these two ladies and forget the outer world sweeter society could not have been offered him but glancing carelessly on to the lawn he exclaimed in some wonderment that the man he particularly wished to see was there it must be dollikins the brewer ive had him pointed out to me in bevisham and i never can light on him at his brewery no excuse for detaining the impetuous candidate struck cecilia she betook herself to mrs lespel to give and receive counsel in the emergency while beauchamp struck across the lawn to mr dollikins who had the squire of itchincope on the other side of him late in the afternoon a report reached the ladies of a furious contest going on over dollikins mr algy borolick was the first to give them intelligence of it and he declared that beauchamp had wrested dollikins from grancey lespel this was contradicted subsequently by mr stukely culbrett but theres heavy pulling between them he said it will do all the good in the world to grancey said mrs lespel she sat in her little blueroom with gentlemen congregating at the open window presently grancey lespel rounded a projection of the house where the drawingroom stood out the maddest folly ever talked he delivered himself in wrath the whigs dead you may as well say im dead it was beauchamp answering politically youre dead if you call yourself a whig you couldnt be a live one for the partys in pieces blown to the winds the country was once a chessboard for whig and tory but that games at an end theres no doubt on earth that the whigs are dead but if theres no doubt about it how is it i have a doubt about it you know youre a tory you tried to get that man dollikins from me in the tory interest i mean to keep him out of radical clutches now that s the truth they came up to the group by the open window still conversing hotly indifferent to listeners you wont keep him from me i have him said beauchamp you delude yourself i have his promise his pledged word said grancey lespel the man himself told you his opinion of renegade whigs renegade renegade whig is an actionable phrase mr culbrett observed he was unnoticed if you dont like renegade take dead said beauchamp dead whig resurgent in the tory you are dead its the stupid conceit of your party thinks that dead my dear mr lespel ill say for the whigs they would not be seen touting for tories if they were not ghosts of whigs you are dead there is no doubt of it but grancey lespel repeated if theres no doubt about it how is it i have a doubt about it the whigs preached finality in reform it was their own funeral sermon nonsensical talk i dont dispute your liberty of action to go over to the tories but you have no right to attempt to take an honest liberal with you and that ive stopped aha beauchamp the mans mine come youll own he swore he wouldnt vote for a shrapnelite dont you rememberthats how the tories used to fight you they stuck an epithet to you and hooted to set the mob an example you hit them off to the life said beauchamp brightening with the fine ire of strife and affecting a sadder indignation you traded on the ignorance of a man prejudiced by lying reports of one of the noblest of human creatures shrapnel there ive had enough grancey lespel bounced away with both hands outspread on the level of his ears dead beauchamp sent the ghastly accusation after him grancey faced round and said bo which was applauded for a smart retort and let none of us be so exalted above the wit of daily life as to sneer at it mrs lespel remarked to mr culbrett do you not see how much he is refreshed by the interest he takes in this election he is ten years younger beauchamp bent to her saying mockdolefully im sorry to tell you that if ever he was a sincere whig he has years of remorse before him promise me captain beauchamp she answered promise you will give us no more politics today if none provoke me none shall and as to bevisham said mr culbrett its the identical borough for a radical candidate for every voter there demands a division of his property and he should be the last to complain of an adoption of his principles clever rejoined beauchamp but i am under government and he swept a bow to mrs lespel as they were breaking up the group captain baskelett appeared ah nevil said he passed him saluted miss halkett through the window then cordially squeezed his cousins hand having a holiday out of bevisham the baron expects to meet you at mount laurels tomorrow he particularly wishes me to ask you whether you think all is fair in war i dont said nevil not the canvass goes on swimmingly ask palmet palmet gives you twothirds of the borough the poor old tory tortoise is nowhere theyve been writing about you nevil they have and if there s a man of honour in the party i shall hold him responsible for it i allude to an article in the bevisham liberal paper a magnificent eulogy upon my honour i give you my word i have rarely read an article so eloquent and what is the conservative misdemeanour which the man of honour in the party is to pay for ill talk to you about it byandby said nevil he seemed to cecilia too trusting too simple considering his cousins undisguised tone of banter yet she could not put him on his guard she would have had mr culbrett do so she walked on the terrace with him near upon sunset and said the position captain beauchamp is in here is most unfair to him theres nothing unfair in the lions den said stukely culbrett adding now observe miss halkett he talks for effect he discovers that lespel is a torified whig but that does not make him a bit more alert its to say smart things he speaks but wont act as if he were among enemies hes getting too fond of his bowwow here he is and he knows the den and he chooses to act the innocent you see how ridiculous that trick of the ingenu or peculiarly heavenly messenger who pretends that he ought never to have any harm done to him though he carries the lighted match is the way of young radicals otherwise beauchamp would be a dear boy we shall see how he takes his thrashing you feel sure he will be beaten he has too strong a dose of fools honesty to succeedstands for the game laws with radicals for example hes loaded with scruples and crotchets and thinks more of them than of his winds and his tides no public man is to be made out of that his idea of the whigs being dead shows a head that cant read the country he means himself for mankind and is preparing to be the benefactor of a country parish but as a naval officer excellent cecilia was convinced that mr culbrett underestimated beauchamp nevertheless the confidence expressed in beauchamps defeat reassured and pleased her at midnight she was dancing with him in the midst of great matronly country vessels that raised a wind when they launched on the waltz and exacted an anxious pilotage on the part of gentlemen careful of their partners and why i cannot say but contrasts produce quaint ideas in excited spirits and a dancing politician appeared to her so absurd that at one moment she had to bite her lips not to laugh it will hardly be credited that the waltz with nevil was delightful to cecilia all the while and dancing with others a penance he danced with none other he led her to a three oclock morning supper one of those triumphant subversions of the laws and customs of earth which have the charm of a form of present deification for all young people and she while noting how the poor mans advocate dealt with costly pasties and sparkling wines was overjoyed at his hearty comrades manner with the gentlemen and a leadership in fun that he seemed to have established cecil baskelett acknowledged it and complimented him on it i give you my word nevil i never heard you in finer trim heres to our drive into bevisham tomorrow do you drink it i beg i entreat oh certainly said nevil will you take a whip down there if youre all insured on my honour old nevil driving a fourinhand is easier than governing the country ill accept your authority for what you know best said nevil the toast of the drive into bevisham was drunk cecilia left the suppertable mortified and feeling disgraced by her participation in a secret that was being wantonly abused to humiliate nevil as she was made to think by her sensitiveness all the gentlemen were against him excepting perhaps that chattering pie lord palmet who did him more mischief than his enemies she could not sleep she walked out on the terrace with mrs wardourdevereux in a dream hearing that lady breathe remarks hardly less than sentimental and an unwearied succession of shouts from the smokingroom they are not going to bed tonight said mrs devereux they are mystifying captain beauchamp said cecilia my husband tells me they are going to drive him into the town to morrow cecilia flushed she could scarcely get her breath is that their plot she murmured sleep was rejected by her bed itself the drive into bevisham had been fixed for nine am she wrote two lines on notepaper in her room but found them overfervid and mysterious besides how were they to be conveyed to nevils chamber she walked in the passage for half an hour thinking it possible she might meet him not the most ladylike of proceedings but her head was bewildered an armchair in her room invited her to rest and thinkthe mask of a natural desire for sleep at eight in the morning she was awakened by her maid and at a touch exclaimed have they gone and her heart still throbbed after hearing that most of the gentlemen were in and about the stables cecilia was downstairs at a quarter to nine the breakfastroom was empty of all but lord palmet and mr wardour devereux one selecting a cigar to light out of doors the other debating between two pipes she beckoned to palmet and commissioned him to inform beauchamp that she wished him to drive her down to bevisham in her ponycarriage palmet brought back word from beauchamp that he had an appointment at ten oclock in the town i want to see him she said so palmet ran out with the order cecilia met beauchamp in the entrance hall you must not go she said bluntly i cant break an appointment said hefor the sake of my own pleasure was implied will you not listen to me nevil when i say you cannot go a coachmans trumpet blew i shall be late thats colonel millingtons team he starts first then wardourdevereux then cecil and i mount beside him palmets at our heels but cant you even imagine a purpose for their driving into bevisham so pompously well men with drags havent commonly much purpose he said but on this occasion at an election time surely nevil you can guess at a reason a second trumpet blew very martially footmen came in search of captain beauchamp the alternative of breaking her pledged word to her father or of letting nevil be burlesqued in the sight of the town could no longer be dallied with cecilia said well nevil then you shall hear it hereupon captain baskeletts groom informed captain beauchamp that he was off yes nevil said to cecilia tell me on board the yacht nevil you will be driving into the town with the second tory candidate of the borough which who nevil asked your cousin cecil tell captain baskelett that i dont drive down till an hour later nevil said to the groom cecilia youre my friend i wish you were more i wish we didnt differ i shall hope to change youmake you come halfway out of that citadel of yours this is my uncle everard i might have made sure thered be a blow from him and cecil of all men for a politician cecilia think of it cecil baskelett i beg seymour austins pardon for having suspected him now sounded captain baskeletts trumpet angry though he was beauchamp laughed isnt it exactly like the baron to spring a mine of this kind there was decidedly humour in the plot and it was a lusty quarterstaff blow into the bargain beauchamps head rang with it he could not conceal the stunning effect it had on him gratitude and tenderness toward cecilia for saving him at the cost of a partial breach of faith that he quite understood from the scandal of the public entry into bevisham on the tory coachbox alternated with his interjections regarding his uncle everard at eleven cecilia sat in her ponycarriage giving final directions to mrs devereux where to look out for the esperanza and the schooners boat then i drive down alone mrs devereux said the gentlemen were all off and every available maid with them on the coachboxes a brilliant sight that had been missed by nevil and cecilia why heres lydiard said nevil supposing that lydiard must be approaching him with tidings of the second tory candidate but lydiard knew nothing of it he was the bearer of a letter on foreign paper marked urgent in rosamunds handand similarly worded in the wellknown hand which had inscribed the original address of the letter to steynham beauchamp opened it and read chateau tourdestelle eure come i give you three daysno more renee the brevity was horrible did it spring from childish imperiousness or tragic peril beauchamp could imagine it to be this or that in moments of excited speculation we do not dwell on the possibility that there may be a mixture of motives i fear i must cross over to france this evening he said to cecilia she replied it is likely to be stormy tonight the steamboat may not run if theres a doubt of it i shall find a french lugger you are tired from not sleeping last night no she answered and nodded to mrs devereux beside whom mr lydiard stood you will not drive down alone you see for a young lady threatened with a tempest in her heart as disturbing to her as the one gathering in the west for ships at sea miss halkett bore herself well chapter xxii the drive into bevisham beauchamp was requested by cecilia to hold the reins his fair companion in the ponycarriage preferred to lean back musing and he had leisure to think over the blow dealt him by his uncle everard with so sure an aim so ringingly on the head and in the first place he made no attempt to disdain it because it was nothing but artful and heavyhanded after the mediaeval pattern of old he himself had delighted in artfulness as well as boldness and the unmistakeable hit highly to prize generalship was in his blood though latterly the very forces propelling him to his political warfare had forbidden the use of it to him he saw the patient veteran laying his gun for a long shotto give as good as he had received and in realizing everard romfreys perfectly placid bearing under provocation such as he certainly would have maintained while preparing his reply to it the raw fighting humour of the plot touched the sense of justice in beauchamp enough to make him own that he had been the first to offend he could reflect also on the likelihood that other offended men of his uncles age and position would have sulked or stormed threatening the parthian shot of the vindictive testator if there was godlessness in turning to politics for a weapon to strike a domestic blow manfulness in some degree signalized it beauchamp could fancy his uncle crying out who set the example and he was not at that instant inclined to dwell on the occult virtues of the example he had set to be honest this elevation of a political puppet like cecil baskelett and the starting him out of the same family which turbot the journalist had magnified into bevisham with such pomp and flourish in opposition to the serious young champion of popular rights and the puritan style was ludicrously effective conscienceless of course but that was the way of the old school beauchamp broke the silence by thanking cecilia once more for saving him from the absurd exhibition of the radical candidate on the tory coach box and laughing at the grimmish slyness of his uncle everards conspiracy a something in it that was halfsmile halfsneer not exactly malignant and by no means innocent something made up of the simplicity of a lighted match and its proximity to powder yet neither deadly in spite of a wicked twinkle nor at all pretending to be harmless in short a specimen of old english practical humour he laboured to express these or corresponding views of it with tolerably natural laughter and cecilia rallied her spirits at his pleasant manner of taking his blow i shall compliment the baron when i meet him tonight he said what can we compare him to she suggested the commander of the faithful the lord haroun who likewise had a turn for buffooneries to serve a purpose and could direct them loftily and sovereignty no everard romfreys a northerner from the feet up said beauchamp cecilia compliantly offered him a sketch of the scandinavian troll much nearer the mark he thought and exclaimed baron troll im afraid cecilia you have robbed him of the best part of his fun and you will owe it entirely to him if you should be represented in parliament by my cousin basketett promise me nevit that you will when you meet captain baskelett not forget i did you some service and that i wish i shall be so glad if you do not resent certain things very objectionable we all think he released her from the embarrassing petition oh now i know my man you may be sure i wont waste a word on him the fact is he would not understand a word and would require moreand that i dont do when i fancied mr austin was the responsible person i meant to speak to him cecilia smiled gratefully the sweetness of a lovespeech would not have been sweeter to her than this proof of civilized chivalry in nevil they came to the firheights overlooking bevisham here the breezy beginning of a southwestern autumnal gale tossed the ponies manes and made threads of cecilias shorter locks of beautiful auburn by the temples and the neck blustering the curls that streamed in a thick involution from the silken band gathering them off her uncovered clear swept ears beauchamp took an impression of her side face it seemed to offer him everything the world could offer of cultivated purity intelligent beauty and attractiveness and wilt thou said the winged minute peace a good repute in the mouths of men home and a trustworthy woman for mate an ideal english lady the rarest growth of our country and friends and fair esteem were offered last night he had waltzed with her and the manner of this tall graceful girl in submitting to the union of the measure and reserving her individual distinction had exquisitely flattered his taste giving him an auspicious image of her in partnership through the uses of life he looked ahead at the low deadblue cloud swinging from across channel what could be the riddle of renees letter it chained him completely at all events i shall not be away longer than three days he said paused eyed cecilias profile and added do we differ so much it may not be so much as we think said she but if we do then nevil there is a difference between us but if we keep our lips closed we should have to shut our eyes as well a lovely melting image of her stole over him all the warmer for her unwittingness in producing it and it awakened a tenderness toward the simple speaker cecilias delicate breeding saved her from running on figuratively she continued intellectual differences do not cause wounds except when very unintellectual sentiments are behind themmy conceit or your impatience nevil noi veggiam come quei che ha mala luce i can confess my sight to be imperfect but will you ever do so her musical voice in italian charmed his hearing what poet was that you quoted the wisest dante dr shrapnels favourite i must try to read him he reads dante cecilia threw a stress on the august name and it was manifest that she cared not for the answer contemptuous exclusiveness could not go farther he is a man of cultivation beauchamp said cursorily trying to avoid dissension but in vain i wish i were half as well instructed and the world half as charitable as heyou ask me if i shall admit my sight to be imperfect yes when you prove to me that priests and landlords are willing to do their duty by the people in preference to their churches and their property but will you ever shake off prejudice here was opposition sounding again cecilia mentally reproached dr shrapnel for it indeed nevil really must notmay i not ask you thismust not every one feel the evil spell of some associations and dante and dr shrapnel you dont know him cecilia i saw him yesterday you thought him too tall i thought of his character how angry i should be with you if you were not so beautiful i am immensely indebted to my unconscious advocate you are clad in steel you flash back you wont answer me out of the heart i m convinced it is pure wilfulness that makes you oppose me i fancy you must be convinced because you cannot imagine women to have any share of public spirit nevil a grain of truth in that remark set nevil reflecting i want them to have it he remarked and glanced at a tory placard probably the puppets freshprinted address to the electors on one of the wayside firtrees bevisham looks well from here we might make a northwestern venice of it if we liked papa told you it would be money sunk in mud did i mention it to himthoroughly conservativeso he would leave the mud as it is they insist on our not venturing anythingthose tories exactly as though we had gained the best of human conditions instead of counting crops of rogues malefactors egoists noxious and lumbersome creatures that deaden the country your town down there is one of the ugliest and dirtiest in the kingdom it might be the fairest i have often thought that of bevisham nevil he drew a visionary sketch of quays embankments bridged islands public buildings magical emanations of patriotic architecture with a practical air an absence of that enthusiasm which struck her with suspicion when it was not applied to landscape or the arts and she accepted it and warmed and even allowed herself to appear hesitating when he returned to the similarity of the state of mudbegirt bevisham and our great sluggish england was he not perhaps to be pitied in his bondage to the frenchwoman who could have no ideas in common with him the rare circumstance that she and nevil beauchamp had found a subject of agreement partially overcame the sentiment cecilia entertained for the foreign lady and having now one idea in common with him she conceived the possibility that there might be more there must be many for he loved england and she no less she clung however to the topic of bevisham preferring to dream of the many more rather than run risks undoubtedly the town was of an ignoble aspect and it was declining in prosperity and it was consequently overpopulated and undoubtedly so she was induced to coincide for the moment a government acting to any extent like a supervising head should aid and direct the energies of towns and ports and trades and not leave everything everywhere to chance schools for the people public morality should be the charge of government cecilia had surrendered the lead to him and was forced to subscribe to an equivalent of undoubtedly the tories just as little as the liberals had done these good offices party against party neither of them had a forethoughtful head for the land at large they waited for the press to spur a great imperial country to be but defensively armed and they accepted the socalled volunteers with a nominal onemonths drill per annum as a guarantee of defence beauchamp startled her actually kindled her mind to an activity of wonder and regret with the statement of how much government acting with some degree of farsightedness might have won to pay the public debt and remit taxation by originally retaining the lines of railway and fastening on the valuable land adjoining stations hundreds of millions of pounds she dropped a sigh at the prodigious amount but inquired who has calculated it for though perfectly aware that this kind of conversation was a special compliment paid to her by her friend nevil and dimly perceiving that it implied something beyond a complimentin fact that it was his manner of probing her for sympathy as other men would have conducted the process preliminary to deadly flattery or to wooing her wits fenced her heart about the exercise of shrewdness was an instinct of selfpreservation she had nothing but her poor wits daily growing fainter to resist him with and he seemed to know it and therefore assailed them never trying at the heart that vast army of figures might be but a phantom army conjured out of the radical mists might it not she hinted and besides we cannot surely require a government to speculate in the future can we possibly not as governments go beauchamp said but what think you of a government of landowners decreeing the enclosure of millions of acres of common land amongst themselves taking the property of the people to add to their own say is not that plunder public property observe decreed to them by their own lawmaking under the pretence that it was being reclaimed for cultivation when in reality it has been but an addition to their pleasuregrounds a flat robbery of pasture from the poor mans cow and goose and his right of cutting furze for firing consider that beauchamps eyes flashed democratic in reciting this injury to the objects of his warm solicitudethe man the cow and the goose but so must he have looked when fronting englands enemies and his aspect of fervour subdued cecilia she confessed her inability to form an estimate of such conduct are they doing it still she asked we owe it to dr shrapnel foremost that there is now a watch over them to stop them but for him grancey lespel would have enclosed half of northeden heath as it is he has filched bits here and there and he will have to put back his palings however now let cecilia understand that we english calling ourselves free are under morally lawless rule government is what we require and our means of getting it must be through universal suffrage at present we have no government only shifting party ministries which are the tools of divers interests wealthy factions to the sacrifice of the commonwealth she listened like rosamund culling overborne by dr shrapnel inwardly praying that she might discover a man to reply to him a despotism nevil he hoped not declined the despot was english enough to stand against the best of men in that character but he cast it on tory whig and liberal otherwise the constitutionalists if we were to come upon the despot they see we are close on universal suffrage theyve been bidding each in turn for the people and that has brought them to it and now theyre alarmed and accuse one another of treason to the constitution and they dont accept the situation and theres a fear that to carry on their present system they will be thwarting the people or corrupting them and in that case we shall have our despot in some shape or other and we shall suffer nevil said cecilia i am out of my depth ill support you i can swim for two said he you are very selfconfident but i find i am not fit for battle at least not in the front ranks nerve me then will you try to comprehend once for all what the battle is i am afraid i am too indifferent i am too luxurious that reminds me you want to meet your uncle everard and if you will sleep at mount laurels tonight the esperanza shall take you to france tomorrow morning and can wait to bring you back as she spoke she perceived a flush mounting over nevils face soon it was communicated to hers the strange secret of the blood electrified them both and revealed the burning undercurrent running between them from the hearts of each the light that showed how near they were to one another was kindled at the barrier dividing them it remained as good as a secret unchallenged until they had separated and after midnight cecilia looked through her chamber windows at the driving moon of a hurricane scud and read clearly his honourable reluctance to be wafted over to his french love by her assistance and beauchamp on board the tossing steamboat perceived in her sympathetic reddening that she had divined him this auroral light eclipsed the other events of the day he drove into a town royally decorated and still humming with the ravishment of the tory entrance he sailed in the schooner to mount laurels in the society of captain baskelett and his friends who finding him tamer than they expected bantered him in the cheerfullest fashion he waited for his uncle everard several hours at mount laurels perused the junior torys address to the electors throughout which there was not an ideasafest of addresses to canvass upon perused likewise at captain baskeletts request a broad sheet of an article introducing the new candidate to bevisham with the battleaxe romfreys to back him in high burlesque of timothy turbot upon beauchamp and cecil hoped his cousin would not object to his borrowing a romfrey or two for so pressing an occasion all very funny and no doubt the presence of mr everard romfrey would have heightened the fun from the fountainhead but he happened to be delayed and beauchamp had to leave directions behind him in the town besides the discussion of a whole plan of conduct with dr shrapnel so he was under the necessity of departing without seeing his uncle really to his regret he left word to that effect taking leave of cecilia he talked of his return home within three or four days as a certainty she said canvassing should not be neglected now her hostility was confused by what she had done to save him from annoyance while his behaviour to his cousin cecil increased her respect for him she detected a pathetic meaning in his mention of the word home she mused on his having called her beautiful whither was she hurrying forgetful of her horror of his revolutionary ideas forgetful of the elevation of her own she thrilled secretly on hearing it stated by the jubilant young tories at mount laurels as a characteristic of beauchamp that he was clever in parrying political thrusts and slipping from the theme he who with her gave out unguardedly the thoughts deepest in him and the thoughtswere they not of generous origin where so true a helpmate for him as the one to whom his mind appealed it could not be so with the frenchwoman cecilia divined a generous nature by generosity and set herself to believe that in honour he had not yet dared to speak to her from the heart not being at heart quite free she was at the same time in her remains of pride cool enough to examine and rebuke the weakness she succumbed to in now clinging to him by that which yesterday she hardly less than loathed still deeply disliked chapter xxiii tourdestelle on the part of beauchamp his conversation with cecilia during the drive into bevisham opened out for the first time in his life a prospect of home he had felt the word in speaking it and it signified an end to the distractions produced by the sex allegiance to one beloved respected woman and also a basis of operations against the world for she was evidently conquerable and once matched with him would be the very woman to nerve and sustain him did she not listen to him he liked her resistance that element of the barbarous which went largely to form his emotional nature was overjoyed in wresting such a woman from the enemy and subduing her personally she was a prize she was a splendid prize cut out from under the guns of the fort he rendered all that was due to his eminently good cause for its part in so signal a success but individual satisfaction is not diminished by the thought that the individuals discernment selected the cause thus beneficent to him beauchamps meditations were diverted by the sight of the coast of france dashed in rainlines across a weedstrewn sea the three days granted him by renee were over and it scarcely troubled him that he should be behind the time he detested mystery holding it to be a sign of pretentious feebleness often of imposture it might be frivolity punctilious obedience to the mysterious brevity of the summons and not to chafe at it appeared to him as much as could be expected of a struggling man this was the state of the case with him until he stood on french earth breathed french air and chanced to hear the tongue of france twittered by a lady on the quay the charm was instantaneous he reminded himself that renee unlike her countrywomen had no gift for writing letters they had never corresponded since the hour of her marriage they had met in sicily at syracuse in the presence of her father and her husband and so inanimate was she that the meeting seemed like the conclusion of their history her brother roland sent tidings of her by fits and sometimes a conventional message from tourdestelle latterly her husbands name had been cited as among the wildfires of parisian quays in journals more or less devoted to those unreclaimed spaces of the city well if she was unhappy was it not the fulfilment of his prophecy in venice renees brevity became luminous she needed him urgently and knowing him faithful to the death she because she knew him dispatched purely the words which said she needed him why those brief words were the poetry of noble confidence but what could her distress be the lover was able to read that come i give you three days addressed to him was not language of a woman free of her yoke excited to guess and guess beauchamp swept on to speculations of a madness that seized him bodily at last were you loved cecilia he thought little of politics in relation to renee or of home or of honour in the worlds eye or of labouring to pay the fee for his share of life this at least was one of the forms of love which precipitate men the sole thought in him was to be with her she was renee the girl of whom he had prophetically said that she must come to regrets and tears his vision of her was not at tourdestelle though he assumed her to be there awaiting him she was under the seashadowing alps looking up to the red and goldrosed heights of a realm of morning that was hers inviolably and under which renee was eternally his the interval between then and now was but the space of an unquiet sea traversed in the night sad in the passage of it but featurelessand it had proved him right it was to nevil beauchamp as if the spirit of his old passion woke up again to glorious hopeful morning when he stood in renees france tourdestelle enjoyed the aristocratic privilege of being twelve miles from the nearest railway station alighting here on an evening of clear sky beauchamp found an english groom ready to dismount for him and bring on his portmanteau the man said that his mistress had been twice to the station and was now at the neighbouring chateau dianet thither beauchamp betook himself on horseback he was informed at the gates that madame la marquise had left for tourdestelle in the saddle only ten minutes previously the lodgekeeper had been instructed to invite him to stay at chateau dianet in the event of his arriving late but it would be possible to overtake madame by a cut across the heights at a turn of the valley beauchamp pushed along the valley for this visible projection a towering mass of woodland in the midst of which a narrow roadway worn like the track of a torrent with heavy rain wound upward on his descent to the farther side he was to spy directly below in the flat for tourdestelle he crossed the wooded neck above the valley and began descending peering into gulfs of the twilight dusk some paces down he was aided by a brilliant halfmoon that divided the whole underlying country into sharp outlines of dark and fair and while endeavouring to distinguish the chateau of tourdestelle his eyes were attracted to an angle of the downward zigzag where a pair of horses emerged into broad light swiftly apparently the riders were disputing or one had overtaken the other in pursuit ridinghabit and plumed hat signalized the sex of one beauchamp sung out a gondoliers cry he fancied it was answered he was heard for the lady turned about and as he rode down still uncertain of her she came cantering up alone and there could be no uncertainty moonlight is friendless to eyes that would make sure of a face long unseen it was renee whose hand he clasped but the story of the years on her and whether she was in bloom or wan as the beams revealing her he could not see her tongue sounded to him as if it were loosened without a voice you have come that storm you are safe so phantomlike a sound of speech alarmed him i lost no time but you i am well nothing hangs over you nothing why give me just three days pure impatience have you forgotten me their horses walked on with them they unlocked their hands you knew it was i said he who else could it be i heard venice she replied her previous cavalier was on his feet all but on his knees it appeared searching for something that eluded him under the roadside bank he sprang at it and waved it leapt in the saddle and remarked as he drew up beside renee what one picks from the earth one may wear i presume especially when we can protest it is our property beauchamp saw him planting a white substance most carefully at the breast buttonhole of his coat it could hardly be a flower some drooping exotic of the conservatory perhaps resembled it renee pronounced his name m le comte henri dhenriel he bowed to beauchamp with an extreme sweep of the hat last night m beauchamp we put up vows for you to the marine god beseeching an exemption from that horrible mal de mer thanks to the storm i suppose i have won i must maintain madame that i won you wear your trophy said renee and her horse reared and darted ahead the gentleman on each side of her struck into a trot beauchamp glanced at m dhenriels breastdecoration renee pressed the pace and threading dense covers of foliage they reached the level of the valley where for a couple of miles she led them stretching away merrily now in shadow now in moonlight between high land and meadow land and a line of poplars in the meadows winding with the river that fed the vale and shot forth gleams of silvery disquiet by rustic bridge and mill the strangeness of being beside her not having yet scanned her face marvelling at her voicethat was like and unlike the renee of old full of her but in another key a mellow note maturermade the ride magical to beauchamp planting the past in the present like a perceptible ghost renee slackened speed saying tourdestelle spans a branch of our little river this is our gate had it been daylight i would have taken you by another way and you would have seen the black tower burnt in the revolution an imposing monument i am assured however you will think it pretty beside the stream do you come with us m le comte his answer was inaudible to beauchamp he did not quit them the lamp at the lodgegates presented the young mans face in full view and beauchamp thought him supremely handsome he perceived it to be a ladys glove that m dhenriel wore at his breast renee walked her horse up the parkdrive alongside the bright running water it seemed that she was aware of the method of provoking or reproving m dhenriel he endured some minutes of total speechlessness at this pace and abruptly said adieu and turned back renee bounded like a vessel free of her load but why should we hurry said she and checked her course to the walk again i hope you like our normandy and my valley you used to love france nevil and normandy they tell me is cousin to the opposite coast of england in climate soil people it may be in manners too a beauchamp never can feel that he is a foreigner in normandy we claim you half french you have grander parks they say we can give you sunlight and it was really only the wish to see me said beauchamp only and really one does not live for everon earth and it becomes a question whether friends should be shadows to one another before death i wrote to you because i wished to see you i was impatient because i am renee you relieve me evidently you have forgotten my character nevil not a feature of it ah she breathed involuntarily would you have me forget it when i think by myself quite alone yes i would otherwise how can one hope that ones friend is friendship supposing him to read us as we areminutely accurately and it is in absence that we desire our friends to be friendship itself and and i am utterly astray i have not dealt in this language since i last thought of writing a diary and stared at the first line if i mistake not you are fond of the picturesque if moonlight and water will satisfy you look yonder the moon launched her fairy silver fleets on a double sweep of the little river round an island of reeds and two tall poplars i have wondered whether i should ever see you looking at that scene said renee he looked from it to her and asked if roland was well and her father then alluded to her husband but the unlettering elusive moon bright only in the extension of her beams would not tell him what story this face once heaven to him wore imprinted on it her smile upon a parted mouth struck him as twoedged in replying i have good news to give you of them all roland is in garrison at rouen and will come when i telegraph my father is in touraine and greets you affectionately he hopes to come they are both perfectly happy my husband is travelling beauchamp was conscious of some bitter taste unaware of what it was though it led him to say undesigningly how very handsome that m dhenriel isif i have his name correctly renee answered he has the misfortune to be considered the handsomest young man in france he has an italian look his mother was provencale she put her horse in motion saying i agree with you that handsome men are rarities and by the way they do not set our world on fire quite as much as beautiful women do yours my friend acknowledge so much in our favour he assented indefinitely he could have wished himself away canvassing in bevisham he had only to imagine himself away from her to feel the flood of joy in being with her your husband is travelling it is his pleasure could she have intended to say that this was good news to give of him as well as of the happiness of her father and brother now look on tourdestelle said renee you will avow that for an active man to be condemned to seek repose in so dull a place after the fatigues of the season in paris it is considerably worse than for women so i am here to dispense the hospitalities the right wing of the chateau on your left is new the side abutting the river is inhabited by dame philiberte whom her husband imprisoned for attempting to take her pleasure in travel i hear upon authority that she dresses in white and wears a black crucifix she is many centuries old and still she lives to remind people that she married a rouaillout do you not think she should have come to me to welcome me she never has and possibly of ladies who are disembodied we may say that they know best for me i desire the interviewand i am a coward i need not state it she ceased presently continuing the other inhabitants are my sister agnes dauffray wife of a general officer serving in africmy sister by marriage and my friend the baronne dorbec a relation by marriage m dorbec her son a guest and a sportsman m livret an erudite no young ladies i can bear much but not their presence girls are odious to me i knew one in venice they came within the rays of the lamp hanging above the unpretending entrance to the chateau renees broad grey longueville hat curved low with its black plume on the side farthest from him he was favoured by the gallant lift of the brim on the near side but she had overshadowed her eyes he wears a glove at his breast said beauchamp you speak of m dhenriel he wears a glove at his breast yes it is mine said renee she slipped from her horse and stood against his shoulder as if waiting to be questioned before she rang the bell of the chateau beauchamp alighted burning with his unutterable questions concerning that glove lift your hat let me beg you let me see you he said this was not what she had expected with one heave of her bosom and murmuring i made a vow i would obey you absolutely if you came she raised the hat above her brows and lightning would not have surprised him more for there had not been a single vibration of her voice to tell him of tears running nay the absence of the usual french formalities in her manner of addressing him had seemed to him to indicate her intention to put him at once on an easy friendly footing such as would be natural to her and not painful to him now she said you perceive monsieur that i have my sentimental fits like others but in truth i am not insensible to the picturesque or to gratitude and i thank you sincerely for coming considering that i wrote like a sphinx to evade writing comme une folle she swept to the bell standing in the arch of the entrance she stretched her whip out to a black mass of prostrate timber saying it fell in the storm at two oclock after midnight and you on the sea chapter xxiv his holiday a single day was to be the term of his holiday at tourdestelle but it stood forth as one of those perfect days which are rounded by an evening before and a morning after giving him two nights under the same roof with renee something of a resemblance to three days of her anticipation and wonder filling the first she the next the adieu the last every hour filled and the first day was not over yet he forced himself to calmness that he might not fritter it and walked up and down the room he was dressing in examining its foreign decorations and peering through the window to quiet his nerves he was in her own france with her the country borrowed hues from renee and lent some this chivalrous france framed and interlaced her image aided in idealizing her and was in turn transfigured not half so well would his native land have pleaded for the forgiveness of a british damsel who had wrecked a young mans immoderate first love that glorified selflove requires the touch upon imagination of strangeness and an unaccustomed grace to subdue it and make it pardon an outrage to its temples and altars and its happy reading of the heavens the earth too earth foremost we ought perhaps to say it is an exacting heathen best understood by a glance at what will appease it beautiful however as everybody has proved and shall it be decried in a world where beauty is not overcommon though it would slaughter us for its angry satisfaction yet can be soothed by a tone of colour as it were by a novel inscription on a sweetmeat the peculiarity of beauchamp was that he knew the slenderness of the thread which was leading him and foresaw it twisting to a coil unless he should hold firm his work in life was much above the love of a woman in his estimation so he was not deluded by passion when he entered the chateau it is doubtful whether he would not hesitatingly have sacrificed one of the precious votes in bevisham for the pleasure of kissing her hand when they were on the steps she was his first love and only love married and long ago forgivenmarried that is to say she especially among women was interdicted to him by the lingering shadow of the reverential love gone by and if the anguish of the lovers worse than death survived in a shudder of memory at the thought of her not solely lost to him but possessed by another it did but quicken a hunger that was three parts curiosity to see how she who had suffered this bore the change how like or unlike she might be to the extinct renee what traces she kept of the face he had known her tears were startling but tears tell of a mood they do not tell the story of the years and it was that story he had such eagerness to read in one brief revelation an eagerness born only of the last few hours and broken by fears of a tarnished aspect these again being partly hopes of a coming disillusion that would restore him his independence and ask him only for pity the slavery of the love of a woman chained like renee was the most revolting of prospects to a man who cherished his freedom that he might work to the end of his time moreover it swung a thundercloud across his holiday he recurred to the idea of the holiday repeatedly and the more he did so the thinner it waned he was exhausting the very air and spirit of it with a mind that ran incessantly forward and back and when he and the lady of so much speculation were again together an incapacity of observation seemed to have come over him in reality it was the inability to reflect on his observations her presence resembled those dark sunsets throwing the spell of colour across the world when there is no question with us of morning or of night but of that sole splendour only owing to their arrival late at the chateau covers were laid for them in the boudoir of madame la marquise where he had his hostess to himself and certainly the opportunity of studying her an english navy list solitary on a shelf and laid within it an extract of a paper announcing the return of the ariadne to port explained the mystery of her knowing that he was in england as well as the correctness of the superscription of her letter to him you see i follow you she said beauchamp asked if she read english now a little but the paper was dispatched to me by m vivian ducie of your embassy in paris he is in the valley the name of ducie recalled lord palmets description of the dark beauty of the fluttering pale gold ornaments she was now dressed without one decoration of gold or jewel with scarcely a wave in the silk a modesty of style eloquent of the pride of her form could those eyes fronting him under the lamp have recently shed tears they were the living eyes of a brilliant unembarrassed lady shields flinging light rather than welldepths inviting it beauchamp tried to compare her with the renee of venice and found himself thinking of the glove she had surrendered to the handsomest young man in france the effort to recover the younger face gave him a dead creature with the eyelashes of renee the cast of her mouth and throat misty as a shape in a dream he could compare her with cecilia who never would have risked a glove never have betrayed a tear and was the statelier lady not without language but how much less vivid in feature and the gift of speech renees gift of speech counted unnumbered strings which she played on with a grace that clothed the skill and was her natural endowmentan art perfected by the education of the world who cannot talkbut who can discover the writers in a day when all are writing it is as rare an art as poetry and in the mouths of women as enrapturing richer than their voices in music this was the fascination beauchamp felt weaving round him would you that are separable from boys and mobs and the object malignly called the briton prefer the celestial singing of a woman to her excellently talking but not if it were given you to run in unison with her genius of the tongue following her verbal ingenuities and feminine silkflashes of meaning not if she led you to match her fine quick perceptions with more or less of the discreet concordance of the violoncello accompanying the viol it is not high flying which usually ends in heavy falling you quit the level of earth no more than two birds that chase from bush to bush to bill in air for mutual delight to make the concert heavenly language flowed from renee in affinity with the pleasuregiving laws that make the curves we recognize as beauty in sublimer arts accept companionship for the dearest of the good things we pray to have and what equalled her who could be her rival her girls crown of irradiated alps began to tremble over her dimly as from moment to moment their intimacy warmed and beauchamp saw the young face vanishing out of this flower of womanhood he did not see it appearing or present but vanishing like the faint ray in the rosier nay the blot of her faithlessness underwent a transformation it affected him somewhat as the patch cunningly laid on near a liquid dimple in fair cheeks at once allures and evades a susceptible attention unused in his french of late he stumbled at times and she supplied the needed phrase taking no note of a blunder now men of sweet blood cannot be secretly accusing or criticizing a gracious lady domestic men are charged with thinking instantly of dark death when an ordinary illness befalls them and it may be so or not but it is positive that the gallant man of the world if he is in the sensitive condition and not yet established as the lord of her feels paralyzed in his masculine sense of leadership the moment his lady assumes the initiative and directs him he gives up at once and thus have many nimblewitted dames from one clear start retained their advantage concerning that glove well the handsomest young man in france wore the glove of the loveliest woman the loveliest the very loveliest in the purity of her french stylethe woman to challenge england for a type of beauty to eclipse her it was possible to conceive her country wagering her against all women if renee had faults beauchamp thought of her as at sea breasting tempests while cecilia was a vessel lying safe in harbour untried however promising and if cecilia raised a steady light for him it was over the shores he had left behind while renee had really nothing to do with warning or rescuing or with imperilling she welcomed him simply to a holiday in her society he associated cecilia strangely with the political labours she would have had him relinquish and renee with a pleasant state of indolence that her lightest smile disturbed shun comparisons it is the tricksy heart which sets up that balance to jump into it on one side or the other comparisons come of a secret leaning that is sure to play rogue under its mien of honest dealer so beauchamp suffered himself to be unjust to graver england and lost the strength she would have given him to resist a bewitchment the case with him was that his apprenticeship was new he had been trotting in harness as a veritable cabhorse of politicshe by blood a racer and his nature craved for diversions against his will against his moral sense and born tenacity of spirit not a word further of the glove but at night in his bed the glove was a principal actor in events of extraordinary magnitude and inconsequence he was out in the grounds with the early morning light coffee and sweet french bread were brought out to him and he was informed of the hours of reunion at the chateau whose mistress continued invisible she might be sleeping he strolled about within view of the windows wondering at her subservience to sleep tourdestelle lay in one of those norman valleys where the river is the mother of rich pasture and runs hidden between double ranks of sallows aspens and poplars that mark its winding line in the arms of trenched meadows the high land on either side is an unwatered flat up to the horizon little varied by dusty appletrees planted in the stubble here and there and brown mud walls of hamlets a churchtop a copse an avenue of dwarf limes leading to the threeparts farm quarter residence of an enriched peasant striking new roots or decayed proprietor pinching not to be severed from ancient descending on the deep green valley in summer is like a change of climes the chateau stood square at a branch of the river tossing three light bridges of pretty woodwork to park and garden great bouquets of swelling blue and pink hydrangia nestled at his feet on shaven grass an open window showed a cloth of colour as in a reminiscence of italy beauchamp heard himself addressedyou are looking for my sisterin law m beauchamp the speaker was madame dauffray to whom he had been introduced overnighta lady of the aquiline french outline not ungentle renee had spoken affectionately of her he remembered there was nothing to make him be on his guard and he stated that he was looking for madame de rouaillout and did not conceal surprise at the information that she was out on horseback she is a tireless person madame dauffray remarked you will not miss her long we all meet at twelve as you know i grudge an hour for i go tomorrow said beauchamp the notification of so early a departure or else his bluntness astonished her she fell to praising renees goodness he kept her to it with lively interrogations in the manner of a guileless boy urging for eulogies of his dear absent friend was it duplicity in him or artlessness has she do you think increased in beauty madame dauffray inquired an insidious question to which he replied once i thought it would be impossible not so bad an answer for an englishman in a country where speaking is fencing the race being little famous for dialectical alertness but was it artful or simple they skirted the chateau and beauchamp had the history of dame philiberte recounted to him with a mixture of gallic irony innuendo openness touchingness ridicule and charity novel to his ears madame dauffray struck the note of intimacy earlier than is habitual she sounded him in this way once or twice carelessly perusing him and waiting for the interesting edition of the book of man to summarize its character by showing its pages or remaining shut it was done delicately like the tap of a fingernail on a vase he rang clear he had nothing to conceal and where he was reserved that is in speaking of the developed beauty and grace of renee he was transparent she read the sort of man he was she could also hazard a guess as to the mans present state she ventured to think him comparatively harmlessfor the hour for she was not the woman to be hoodwinked by mans dark nature because she inclined to think well of a particular man nor was she one to trust to any man subject to temptation the wisdom of the frenchwomans fortieth year forbade it a land where the war between the sexes is honestly acknowledged and is full of instruction abounds in precepts but it ill becomes the veteran to practise rigorously what she would prescribe to young women she may discriminate as thus trust no man still this man may be better than that man and it is bad policy to distrust a reasonably guileless member of the preying sex entirely and so to lose his good services hawks have their uses in destroying vermin and though we cannot rely upon the taming of hawks one tied by the leg in a garden preserves the fruit there is a necessity for your leaving us tomorrow m beauchamp i regret to say it is imperative madame my husband will congratulate me on the pleasure i have and have long desired of making your acquaintance and he will grieve that he has not been so fortunate he is on service in africa my brother i need not say will deplore the mischance which has prevented him from welcoming you i have telegraphed to him he is at one of the baths in germany and will come assuredly if there is a prospect of finding you here none supposing my telegram not to fall short of him i may count on his being here within four days beauchamp begged her to convey the proper expressions of his regret to m le marquis and m de croisnel and roland your old comrade and brotherinarms what will be their disappointment she said i intend to stop for an hour at rouen on my way back said beauchamp she asked if her bellesoeur was aware of the short limitation of his visit he had not mentioned it to madame la marquise perhaps you may be moved by the grief of a friend renee may persuade you to stay i came imagining i could be of some use to madame la marquise she writes as if she were telegraphing perfectly true of her for that matter i saw the letter your looks betray a very natural jealousy but seeing it or not it would have been the same she and i have no secrets she was i may tell you strictly unable to write more words in the letter which brings me to inquire what impression m dhenriel made on you yesterday evening he is particularly handsome we women think so did you take him to be eccentric beauchamp gave a french jerk of the shoulders it confessed the incident of the glove to one who knew it as well as he but it masked the weight he was beginning to attach to that incident and madame dauffray was misled truly the englishman may be just such an exlover uninflammable by virtue of his bloods native coldness endued with the frozen vanity called pride which does not seek to be revenged under wary espionage he might be a young womans friend though male friend of a halfabandoned wife should write himself down morally saint mentally sage medically incurable if he would win our confidence this lady of sharp intelligence was the guardian of renee during the foolish husbands flights about paris and over europe and for a proof of her consummate astuteness renee had no secrets and had absolute liberty and hitherto no man could build a boast on her reputation the liberty she would have had at any cost as madame dauffray knew and an attempt to restrict it would have created secrets near upon the breakfasthour renee was perceived by them going toward the chateau at a walking pace they crossed one of the garden bridges to intercept her she started out of some deep meditation and raised her whip hand to beauchamps greeting i had forgotten to tell you monsieur that i should be out for some hours in the morning are you aware said madame dauffray that m beauchamp leaves us tomorrow so soon it was uttered hardly with a tone of disappointment the marquise alighted crying hold to the stables caressed her horse and sent him off with a smack on the smoking flanks to meet the groom tomorrow that is very soon but m beauchamp is engaged in an election and what have we to induce him to stay would it not be better to tell m beauchamp why he was invited to come rejoined madame dauffray the sombre light in renees eyes quickened through shadowy spheres of surprise and pain to resolution she cried you have my full consent and left them madame dauffray smiled at beauchamp to excuse the childishness of the little story she was about to relate she gave it in the essence without a commencement or an ending she had in fact but two or three hurried minutes before the breakfastbell would ring and the fan she opened and shut and at times shaded her head with was nearly as explicit as her tongue he understood that renee had staked her glove on his coming within a certain number of hours to the briefest wording of invitation possible owing to his detention by the storm m dhenriel had won the bet and now insisted on wearing the glove he is the privileged young madman our women make of a handsome youth said madame dauffray where am i thought beauchampin what land he would have phrased it of whirlwinds catching the wits and whipping the passions calmer than they but unable to command them and guessing that renees errand of the morning by which he had lost hours of her pertained to the glove he said quiveringly madame la marquise objects we replied madame dauffray contend that the glove was not loyally won the wager was upon your coming to the invitation not upon your conquering the elements as to his flaunting the glove for a favour i would ask you whom does he advertize by that gloves do not wear white which fact compromises none but the wearer he picked it up from the ground and does not restore it that is all you see a boy who catches at anything to placard himself there is a compatriot of yours a m ducie who assured us you must be with an uncle in your county of sussex of course we ran the risk of the letter missing you but the chance was worth a glove can you believe it m beauchamp it was i old woman as i am i who provoked the silly wager i have long desired to meet you and we have little society here we are desperate with loneliness half mad with our whims i said that if you were what i had heard of you you would come to us at a word they dared madame la marquise to say the same i wished to see the friend of frenchmen as m roland calls you not merely to see himto know him whether he is this perfect friend whose absolute devotion has impressed my dear sister renees mind she respects you that is a sentiment scarcely complimentary to the ideas of young men she places you above human creatures possibly you may not dislike to be worshipped it is not to be rejected when ones influence is powerful for good but you leave us tomorrow i might stay beauchamp hesitated to name the number of hours he stood divided between a sense of the bubbling shallowness of the life about him and a thought grave as an eye dwelling on blood of sinister things below it i may stay another day or two he said if i can be of any earthly service madame dauffray bowed as to a friendly decision on his part saying it would be a thousand pities to disappoint m roland and it will be offering my brother an amicable chance i will send him word that you await him at least that you defer your departure as long as possible ah now you perceive m beauchamp now you have become aware of our purely infantile plan to bring you over to us how very ostensible a punishment it would be were you to remain so short a period having no designs he was neither dupe nor sceptic but he felt oddly entangled and the dream of his holiday had fled like mornings beams as a selfdeception will at a very gentle shaking chapter xxv the adventure of the boat madame dauffray passed renee whispering on her way to take her seat at the breakfasttable renee did not condescend to whisper roland will be glad she said aloud her low eyelids challenged beauchamp for a look of indifference there was more for her to unbosom than madame dauffray had revealed but the comparative innocence of her position in this new light prompted her to meet him defiantly if he chose to feel injured he was attracted by a happy contrast of colour between her dress and complexion together with a cavalierly charm in the sullen brows she lifted and seeing the reverse of a look of indifference on his face after what he had heard of her frivolousness she had a fear that it existed are we not to have m dhenriel today he amuses me the baronne dorbec remarked if he would learn that he was fashioned for that purpose exclaimed little m livret do not ask young men for too much head my friend he would cease to be amusing dhenriel should have been up in the fields at ten this morning said m dorbec as to his head i back him for a clever shot or a duellingsword said renee it is a quality count it for what we will your favourite madame la baronne is interdicted from presenting himself here so long as he persists in offending me she was requested to explain and with the fair ingenuousness which outshines innocence she touched on the story of the glove ah what a delicate what an exciting how subtle a question had m dhenriel the right to possess it and having that had he the right to wear it at his breast beauchamp was dragged into the discussion of the case renee waited curiously for his judgement pleading an apology for the stormy weather which had detained him and for his ignorance that so precious an article was at stake he held that by the terms of the wager the glove was lost the claim to wear it was a matter of taste matters of taste monsieur are not i think decided by weapons in your country said m dorbec we have no duelling said beauchamp the frenchman imagined the confession to be somewhat humbling and generously added but you have your volunteersa magnificent spectacle of patriotism and national readiness for defence a shrewd pang traversed beauchamps heart as he looked back on his country from the outside and the inside thinking what amount of patriotic readiness the character of the volunteering signified in the face of all that england has to maintain like a politic islander he allowed the patriotic spectacle to be imagined reflecting that it did a sort of service abroad and had only to be unmasked at home but you surrendered the glove marquise the baronne dorbec spoke judicially i flung it to the ground that made it neutral said renee hum he wears it with the dust on it certainly and for how long a time m livret wished to know does this amusing young man proclaim his intention of wearing the glove until he can see with us that his order of merit is utter kid said madame dauffray and as she had spoken more or less neatly satisfaction was left residing in the ear of the assembly and the glove was permitted to be swept away on a fresh tide of dialogue the admirable candour of renee in publicly alluding to m dhenriels foolishness restored a peep of his holiday to beauchamp madame dauffray took note of the effect it produced and quite excused her sisterinlaw for intending to produce is but that speaking out the halftruth that we may put on the mask of the whole is no new trick and believing as she did that renee was in danger with the handsome count henri the practice of such a kind of honesty on her part appeared alarming still it is imprudent to press for confidences when our friends heart is manifestly trifling with sincerity who knows but that some foregone reckless act or word may have superinduced the healthy shame which cannot speak which must disguise itself and is honesty in that form but roughly troubled would resolve to rank dishonesty so thought the patient lady wiser in that than in her perceptions renee made a boast of not persuading her guest to stay avowing that she would not willingly have him go praising him equably she listened to praise of him with animation she was dumb and statuelike when count henris name was mentioned did not this betray liking for one subjection to the other indeed there was an asiatic splendour of animal beauty about m dhenriel that would be serpent with most women madame dauffray conceived why not with the deserted renee who adored beauty of shape and colour and was compassionate toward a rashness of character that her own unnatural solitariness and quick spirit made her emulous of meanwhile beauchamps day of adieu succeeded that of his holiday and no adieu was uttered the hours at tourdestelle had a singular turn for slipping interlinked and all as one they swam by brought evening brought morning never varied they might have varied with such a division as when flame lights up the night or a tempest shades the day had renee chosen she had that power over him she had no wish to use it perhaps she apprehended what it would cause her to forfeit she wished him to respect her felt that she was under the shadow of the glove slight though it was while it was nothing but a tale of a lady and a glove and her desire like his was that they should meet daily and dream on without a variation he noticed how seldom she led him beyond the grounds of the chateau they were to make excursions when her brother came she said roland de croisnels colonel coin de grandchamp happened to be engaged in a duel which great business detained roland it supplied beauchamp with an excuse for staying that he was angry with himself for being pleased to have so he attacked the practice of duelling and next the shrug wherewith m livret and m dorbec sought at first to defend the foul custom or apologize for it or plead for it philosophically or altogether cast it off their shoulders for the literal interpretation of the shrug in argument is beyond human capacity it is the point of speech beyond our treasury of language he attacked the shrug as he thought very temperately but in controlling his native vehemence he grew perforce of repression and of incompetency to deliver himself copiously in french sarcastic in fine his contrast of the pretence of their noble country to head civilization and its encouragement of a custom so barbarous offended m dorbec and irritated m livret the latter delivered a brief essay on gallic blood the former maintained that frenchmen were the best judges of their own ways and deeds politeness reigned but politeness is compelled to throw off cloak and jacket when it steps into the arena to meet the encounter of a bull beauchamp drew on their word solidaire to assist him in declaring that no civilized nation could be thus independent imagining himself in the france of brave ideas he contrived to strike out sparks of legitimist ire around him and found himself breathing the atmosphere of the most primitive nursery of toryism again he encountered the shrug and he would have it a verbal matter m dorbec gravely recited the programme of the country party in france m livret carried the war across channel you english have retired from active life like the exhausted author to turn criticthe critic that sneers unless we copy you abjectly we are execrable and what is that sneer materially it is an acrid saliva withering where it drops in the way of fellowship it is a corpseemanation as to wit the sneer is the cloak of clumsiness it is the pharisees incense the hypocrites pity the post of exaltation of the fat citizen etc but said m livret the people using it should have a care that they keep powerful they make no friends he terminated with this warning to a nation not devoid of superior merit m dorbec said less and was less consoled by his outburst in the opinion of mr vivian ducie present at the discussion beauchamp provoked the lash for in the first place a beautiful womans apparent favourite should be particularly discreet in all that he says and next he should have known that the gallic shrug over matters political is volcanicit is the heaving of the mountain and like the proverbial russ leaps up tartarly at a scratch our newspapers also had been flea biting m livret and his countrymen of late and to conclude over in old england you may fly out against what you will and there is little beyond a motherly smile a nurses rebuke or a fools rudeness to answer you in quickblooded france you have whip for whip sneer sarcasm claw fang tussle in a trice and if you choose to comport yourself according to your insular notion of freedom you are bound to march out to the measured ground at an invitation to begin by saying that your principles are opposed to it naturally excites a malicious propensity to try your temper a further cause unknown to mr ducie of m livrets irritation was that beauchamp had vexed him on a subject peculiarly dear to him the celebrated chateau dianet was about to be visited by the guests at tourdestelle in common with some french philosophers and english matrons he cherished a sentimental sad enthusiasm for royal concubines and when dilating upon one among them the ruins of whose familys castle stood in the neighbourhoodagrees who was really a kindly soul though not virtuousm livret had been traversed by beauchamp with questions as to the condition of the people the peasantry that were sweated in taxes to support these lovely frailties they came oddly from a man in the fire of youth and a little old gentleman somewhat seduced by the melting image of his theme might well blink at him to ask of what flesh are you then his historic harem was insulted personally too the fair creature picturesquely soiled intrepid in her amorousness and ultimately absolved by repentance a shuddering narrative of her sins under showers of salt drops cried to him to champion her excited by the supposed cold critical mind in beauchamp m livret painted and painted this lady tricked her in casuistical niceties scenes of pomp and boudoir pathos with many shifting sidelights and a risky word or two until renee cried out spare us the esprit gaulois m livret there was much to make him angry with this englishman the esprit gaulois is the sparkle of crystal common sense madame and may we never abandon it for a puritanism that hides its face to conceal its filthiness like a stagnant pond replied m livret flashing it seems then that there are two ways of being objectionable said renee ah madame la marquise your wit is french he breathed low keep your heart so both m livret and m dorbec had forgotten that when count henri dhenriel was received at tourdestelle the arrival of the englishman was pleasantly anticipated by them as an eclipse of the handsome boy but a foreign interloper is quickly dispossessed of all means of pleasing save that one of taking his departure and they now talked of count henris disgrace and banishment in a very warm spirit of sympathy not at all seeing why it should be made to depend upon the movements of this m beauchamp as it appeared to be madame dauffray heard some of their dialogue and hurried with a mouth full of comedy to renee who did not reproach them for silly beings as would be done elsewhere on the contrary she appreciated a scene of such absolute comedy recognizing it instantly as a situation plucked out of human nature she compared them to republicans that regretted the sovereign they had deposed for a pretender to start up and govern them who hurries them round to the legitimate king again said madame dauffray renee cast her chin up how my dear your husband what of him he is returning what brings him you should ask who my renee i was sure he would not hear of m beauchamps being here without an effort to return and do the honours of the chateau renee looked hard at her saying how thoughtful of you you must have made use of the telegraph wires to inform him that m beauchamp was with us more i made use of them to inform him that m beauchamp was expected and that was enough to bring him he pays m beauchamp a wonderful compliment such as he would pay to no other man my renee virtually it is the highest of compliments to you i say that to m beauchamps credit for raoul has met him and whatever his personal feeling may be must know your friend is a man of honour my friend is yes i have no reason to think otherwise renee replied her husbands persistent and exclusive jealousy of beauchamp was the singular point in the character of one who appeared to have no sentiment of the kind as regarded men that were much less than men of honour so then my sister agnes she said you suggested the invitation of m beauchamp for the purpose of spurring my husband to return apparently he and i are surrounded by plotters am i so very guilty said madame dauffray if that mad boy half idiot half panther were by chance to insult m beauchamp you would feel so you have taken precautions to prevent their meeting and besides m beauchamp does not fight renee flushed crimson madame dauffray added i do not say that he is other than a perfectly brave and chivalrous gentleman oh cried renee do not say it if ever you should imagine it bid roland speak of him he is changed oppressed i did him a terrible wrong she checked herself but the chief thing to do is to keep m dhenriel away from him i suspect m dorbec of a design to make them clash and you my dear will explain why to flatter me believe me i thirst for flattery i have had none since m beauchamp came and you so acute must have seen the want of it in my face but you so skilful agnes will manage these men do you know agnes that the pride of a woman so incredibly clever as you have shown me you are should resent their intrigues and overthrow them as for me i thought i could command m dhenriel and i find he has neither reason in him nor obedience singular to say i knew him just as well a week back as i do now and then i liked him for his qualitiesor the absence of any but how shall we avoid him on the road to dianet he is aware that we are going take m beauchamp by boat said madame dauffray the river winds to within a five minutes walk of dianet we could go by boat renee said musingly i thought of the boat but does it not give the man a triumph that we should seem to try to elude him what matter still i do not like him to be the falcon and nevil beauchamp the little bird so it is because we began badly agnes was it my fault mine tell me the legitimate king returns when in two days or three and his rebel subjects are to address himhow madame dauffray smote the point of a finger softly on her cheek will they be pardoned said renee it is for him to kneel my dearest legitimacy kneeling for forgiveness is a painful picture agnes legitimacy jealous of a foreigner is an odd one however we are women born to our lot if we could rise en massebut we cannot embrace me madame dauffray embraced her without an idea that she assisted in performing the farewell of their confidential intimacy when renee trifled with count henri it was playing with fire and she knew it and once or twice she bemoaned to agnes dauffray her abandoned state which condemned her for the sake of the sensation of living to have recourse to perilous pastimes but she was revolted as at a piece of treachery that agnes should have suggested the invitation of nevil beauchamp with the secret design of winning home her husband to protect her this for one reason was because beauchamp gave her no notion of danger none therefore of requiring protection and the presence of her husband could not but be hateful to him an undeserved infliction to her it was intolerable that they should be brought into contact it seemed almost as hard that she should have to dismiss beauchamp to preclude their meeting she remembered nevertheless a certain desperation of mind scarce imaginable in the retrospect by which trembling feversmitten scorning herself she had been reduced to hope for nevil beauchamps coming as for a rescue the night of the storm had roused her heart since then his perfect friendliness had lulled his air of thoughtfulness had interested it and the fancy that he who neither reproached nor sentimentalized was to be infinitely compassionated stirred up remorse she could not tell her friend agnes of these feelings while her feelings were angered against her friend so she talked lightly of the legitimate king and they embraced a situation of comedy quite as true as that presented by the humble admirers of the brilliant chatelaine beauchamp had the pleasure of rowing madame la marquise to the short shaded walk separating the river from chateau dianet whither m dorbec went on horseback and madame dauffray and m livret were driven the portrait of diane of dianet was praised for the beauty of the dame a softfleshed acutely featured person a freshofthetoilette face of the configuration of head of the cat relieved by a delicately aquiline nose and it could only be the cat of fairy metamorphosis which should stand for that illustration brows and chin made an acceptable triangle and eyes and mouth could be what she pleased for mice or monarchs m livret did not gainsay the impeachment of her by a great french historian tender to women to frailties in particularyes she was cold perhaps grasping but dwell upon her in her character of woman conceive her existing to estimate the charm of her graciousness name the two countries which alone have produced the woman the ideal woman the woman of art whose beauty grace and wit offer her to our contemplation in an atmosphere above the ordinary conditions of the world these two countries are france and greece none other give you the perfect woman the woman who conquers time as she conquers men by virtue of the divinity in her blood and she as little as illustrious heroes is to be judged by the laws and standards of lesser creatures in fashioning her nature and art have worked together in her poetry walks the earth the question of good or bad is entirely to be put aside it is a rustics impertinencea bourgeois vulgarity she is preeminent voila tout has she grace and beauty then you are answered such possessions are an assurance that her influence in the aggregate must be for good thunder destructive to insects refreshes earth so she so sang the rhapsodist possibly a scholarly little french gentleman going down the grey slopes of sixty to second childishness recovers a second juvenility in these enthusiasms though what it is that inspires our matrons to take up with them is unimaginable m livrets ardour was a contrast to the young englishmans vacant gaze at diane and the symbols of her goddesship running along the walls the bed the cabinets everywhere that the chaste device could find frontage and a corner m dorbec remained outside the chateau inspecting the fishponds when they rejoined him he complimented beauchamp semiironically on his choice of the rivers quiet charms in preference to the dusty roads madame de rouaillout said come m dorbec what if you surrender your horse to m beauchamp and row me back he changed colour hesitated and declined he had an engagement to call on m dhenriel when did you see him said she he was confused it is not long since madame on the road coming alongthe road and our glove madame la marquise if i may trust my memory m dhenriel was not in official costume renee allowed herself to be reassured a ceremonious visit that m livret insisted on was paid to the chapel of diane where she had worshipped and laid her widowed ashes which said m livret the fiends of the revolution would not let rest he raised his voice to denounce them it was roland de croisnel that answered the revolution was our grandmother monsieur and i cannot hear her abused renee caught her brother by the hand he stepped out of the chapel with beauchamp to embrace him then kissed renee and remarking that she was pale fetched flooding colour to her cheeks he was hearty air to them after the sentimentalism they had been hearing beauchamp and he walked like loving comrades at school questioning answering chattering laughinga beautiful sight to renee and she looked at agrnes dauffray to ask her whether this englishman was not one of them in his frankness and freshness roland stopped to turn to renee i met dhenriel on my ride here he said with a sharp inquisitive expression of eye that passed immediately you rode here from tourdestelle then said renee has he been one of the company marquise did he ride by you without speaking roland thus roland described a spanish caballeros formallest salutation saying to beauchamp not the best sample of our young frenchmanwoman spoiled not that the better kind of article need be spoiled by them heaven forbid that friend nevil he spoke lower do you know you have something of the prophet in you i remember much has come true an old spoiler of women is worse than one spoiled by them ah well and madame culling and your sevenfeet high uncle and have you a fleet to satisfy nevil beauchamp yet you shall see a trial of our new fieldguns at rouen they were separated with difficulty renee wished her brother to come in the boat and he would have done so but for his objection to have his arab bestridden by a man unknown to him my love is a fourfoot and heres my love roland said going outside the gilt gaterails to the graceful little beast that acknowledged his ownership with an arch and swing of the neck round to him he mounted and called au revoir m le capitaine au revoir m le commandant cried beauchamp admiral and marshal each of us in good season said roland thanks to your promotion i had a letter from my sister advance a grade and i may get another beauchamp thought of the strange gulf now between him and the time when he pined to be a commodore and an admiral the gulf was bridged as he looked at renee petting rolands horse is there in the world so lovely a creature she said and appealed fondlingly to the beauty that brings out beauty and bidding it disdain rivalry rivalled it insomuch that in a moment of trance beauchamp with his bodily vision beheld her not there but on the lido of venice shining out of the years gone old love reviving may be love of a phantom after all we can if it must revive keep it to the limits of a ghostly love the ship in the arabian tale coming within the zone of the magnetic mountain flies all its bolts and bars and becomes sheer timbers but that is the carelessness of the ships captain and hitherto beauchamp could applaud himself for steering with prudence while renees attractions warned more than they beckoned she was magnetic to him as no other woman was then whither his course but homeward after they had taken leave of their host and hostess of chateau dianet walking across a meadow to a line of charmilles that led to the river side he said now i have seen roland i shall have to decide upon going wantonly won is deservedly lost said renee but do not disappoint my roland much because of his foolish sister is he not looking handsome and he is young to be a commandant for we have no interest at this court they kept him out of the last war my father expects to find you at tourdestelle and how account to him for your hurried flight save with the story of that which brought you to us the glove i shall beg for the fellow to it before i depart marquise you perceived my disposition to lightheadedness monsieur when i was a girl i said that ibut the past is dust shall i ever see you in england that country seems to frown on me but if i do not go there nor you come here except to imperious mysterious invitations which will not be repeated the future is dust as well as the past for me at least dust here dust thereif one could be like a silkworm and live lying on the leaf one feeds on it would be a sort of answer to the riddleliving out of the dust and in the present i find none in my religion no doubt madame de breze did why did you call diane so to m livret she looked at him smiling as they came out of the shadow of the clipped trees he was glancing about for the boat the boat is across the river renee said in a voice that made him seek her eyes for an explanation of the dead sound she was very pale you have perfect command of yourself for my sake she said he looked round standing up in the boat against the opposite bank and leaning with crossed legs on one of the sculls planted in the gravel of the river count henri dhenriels handsome figure presented itself to beauchamps gaze with a dryness that smacked of his uncle everard romfrey beauchamp said of the fantastical posture of the young man one can do that on fresh water renee did not comprehend the sailorsarcasm of the remark but she also commented on the statuesque appearance of count henri is the pose for photography or for sculpture neither of them showed a sign of surprise or of impatience m dhenriel could not maintain the attitude he uncrossed his legs deliberately drooped hat in hand and came paddling over apologized indolently and said i am not i believe trespassing on the grounds of tourdestelle madame la marquise you happen to be in my boat m le comte said renee permit me madame he had set one foot on shore with his back to beauchamp and reached a hand to assist her step into the boat beauchamp caught fast hold of the bows while renee laid a finger on count henris shoulder to steady herself the instant she had taken her seat count henri dashed the sculls blade at the bank to push off with her but the boat was fast his manoeuvre had been foreseen beauchamp swung on board like the last seaman of a launch and crouched as the boat rocked away to the stream and still count henri leaned on the scull not in a chosen attitude but for positive support he had thrown his force into the blow to push off triumphantly and leave his rival standing it occurred that the boats brief resistance and rocking away agitated his artificial equipoise and by the operation of inexorable laws the longer he leaned across an extending surface the more was he dependent so that when the measure of the water exceeded the length of his failing support on land there was no help for it he pitched in his grimace of chagrin at the sight of beauchamp securely established had scarcely yielded to the grimness of feature of the man who feels he must go as he took the plunge and these two emotions combined to make an extraordinary countenance he went like a gallant gentleman he threw up his heels to clear the boat dropping into about four feet of water and his first remark on rising was i trust madame i have not had the misfortune to splash you then he waded to the bank scrambled to his feet and drew out his moustachios to their curving ends renee nodded sharply to beauchamp to bid him row he with less of wisdom having seized the floating scull abandoned by count henri and got it ready for the stroke said a word of condolence to the dripping man count henris shoulders and neck expressed a kind of negative that like a wet dogs shake of the head ended in an involuntary whole length shudder doglike and deplorable to behold he must have been conscious of this miserable exhibition of himself he turned to beauchamp you are i am informed a sailor monsieur i compliment you on your naval tactics our next meeting will be on land au revoir monsieur madame la marquise i have the honour to salute you with these words he retreated row quickly i beg of you renee said to beauchamp her desire was to see roland and open her heart to her brother for now it had to be opened not a minute must be lost to prevent further mischief and who was guilty she her heart clamoured of her guilt to waken a cry of innocence a disdainful pity for the superb young savage just made ludicrous relieved him of blame implacable though he was he was nothing an accidenta fool but he might become a terrible instrument of punishment the thought of that possibility gave it an aspect of retribution under which her cry of innocence was insufferable in its feebleness it would have been different with her if beauchamp had taken advantage of her fever of anxiety suddenly appeased by the sight of him on the evening of his arrival at tourdestelle after the storm to attempt a renewal of their old broken lovebonds then she would have seen only a conflict between two men neither of whom could claim a more secret right than the other to be called her lover and of whom both were on a common footing and partly despicable but nevil beauchamp had behaved as her perfect true friend in the character she had hoped for when she summoned him the sense of her guilt lay in the recognition that he had saved her from what from the consequences of delirium rather than from lovesurely delirium founded on delusion love had not existed she had said to count henri you speak to me of love i was beloved when i was a girl before my marriage and for years i have not seen or corresponded with the man who loved me and i have only to lift my finger now and he will come to me and not once will he speak to me of love those were the words originating the wager of the glove but what of her if nevil beauchamp had not come her heart jumped and she blushed ungovernably in his faceas if he were seeing her withdraw her foot from the rocks edge and had that instant rescued her but how came it she had been so helpless she could ask she could not answer thinking talking to her heart was useless the deceiver simply feigned utter condemnation to make partial comfort acceptable she burned to do some act of extreme selfabasement that should bring an unwonted degree of wrath on her externally and so reentitle her to consideration in her own eyes she burned to be interrogated to have to weep to be scorned abused and forgiven that she might say she did not deserve pardon beauchamp was too english evidently too blind for the description of judgeaccuser she required one who would worry her without mercy until disgraced by the excess of torture inflictedhe should reinstate her by as much as he had overcharged his accusation and a little more reasonably enough instinctively in fact she shunned the hollow of an english ear a surprise was in reserve for her beauchamp gave up rowing as he rested on the sculls his head was bent and turned toward the bank renee perceived an overswollen monster gourd that had strayed from a garden adjoining the river and hung sliding heavily down the bank on one greenish yellow cheek in prolonged contemplation of its image in the mirror below apparently this obese narcissus enchained his attention she tapped her foot are you tired of rowing monsieur it was exactly here said he that you told me you expected your husbands return she glanced at the gourd bit her lip and colouring said at what point of the river did i request you to congratulate me on it she would not have said that if she had known the thoughts at work within him he set the boat swaying from side to side and at once the hugeous reflection of that conceivably selfenamoured bulk quavered and distended and was shattered in a thousand dancing fragments to reunite and recompose its maudlin air of imaged satisfaction she began to have a vague idea that he was indulging grotesque fancies very strangely the ridiculous thing in the shape of an overstretched likeness that she never would have seen had he indicated it directly became transfused from his mind to hers by his abstract halfamused observation of the great dancing gourdthat capering antiquity lumbering volatility wandering selfadored gross bald cupid elatest of nondescripts her senses imagined the impressions agitating beauchamps and exaggerated them beyond limit and when he amazed her with a straight look into her eyes and the words better let it be a youthand live than fall back to that she understood him immediately and together with her old fear of his impetuosity and downrightness came the vivid recollection like a bright finger pointing upon darkness of what foul destiny magnified by her present abhorrence of it he would have saved her from in the days of venice and touraine and unto what loathly example of the hideous grotesque she in spite of her lovers foresight on her behalf had become allied face to face as they sat she had no defence for her scarlet cheeks her eyes wavered we will land here the cottagers shall row the boat up she said somewhereanywhere said beauchamp but i must speak i will tell you now i do not think you to blamebarely not in my sight though no man living would have suffered as i should probably some days more and you would have been lost you looked for me trust your instinct now im with you as well as when im absent have you courage that s the question you have years to live can you live them in this placewith honour and alive really renees eyes grew wide she tried to frown and her brows merely twitched to speak and she was inarticulate his madness miraculous penetration and the supermasculine charity in him unknown to the world of young men in their treatment of women excited awed and melted her he had seen the whole truth of her relations with m dhenrielthe wickedness of them in one light the innocence in another and without prompting a confession he forgave her could she believe it this was love and manly love she yearned to be on her feet to feel the possibility of an escape from him she pointed to a landing he sprang to the bank it could end in nothing else he said unless you beat cold to me and now i have your hand renee its the hand of a living woman you have no need to tell me that but faithful to her comrade i can swear it for herfaithful to a true alliance you are not married you are simply chained and you are terrorized what a perversion of you it is it wrecks you but with me am i not your lover you and i are one life what have we suffered for but to find this out and act on it do i not know that a woman lives and is not the rooted piece of vegetation hypocrites and tyrants expect her to be act on it i say own me break the chains come to me say nevil beauchamp or death and death for you but you are poisoned and thwarteddying as you live now worse shaming the renee i knew ahvenice but now we are both of us wiser and stronger we have gone through fire who foretold it this day and this misery and perversion that we can turn to joy if we willif you will no heart to dare is no heart to loveanswer that shall i see you cower away from me again not this time he swept on in a flood uttered mad things foolish things and things of an insight electrifying to her through the cottagers garden across a field and within the park gates of tourdestelle it continued unceasingly and deeply was she won by the rebellious note in all that he said deeply too by his disregard of the vulgar arts of wooers she detected none he did not speak so much to win as to help her to see with her own orbs nor was it roughly or chidingly though it was absolutely that he stripped her of the veil a wavering woman will keep to herself from her hearts lord if she can they arrived long after the boat at tourdestelle and beauchamp might believe he had prevailed with her but for her forlorn repetition of the question he had put to her idly and as a new idea instead of significantly with a recollection and a doubt have i courage nevil the grain of common sense in cowardice caused her to repeat it when her reason was bedimmed and passion

quite sensibly felt the critic that sneers the language of party is eloquent the slavery of the love of a woman chained there may be women who think as well as feel i dont know them trust no man still
