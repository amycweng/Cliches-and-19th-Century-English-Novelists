one for ages and ages so its made quite a stir among us you can make stir enough when you are coming out of school said his sister lifting her eyes from her lessons and looking across the table who is the new boy she asked nobody knowsthats the fun said leonard with a short whistle dont you even know his name thats just like a girl duffy youre worse than usual said her brother setting his elbows on the table and nibbling the end of the penholder in a meditative fashion of course he was properly introduced to the class as mr horace howard howard is a nice name commented duffy whose real name was florence it was aunt lucys name before she was married you know no i dont know i may have heard it but the names nothing i dont suppose his father was hanged said her brother perhaps he is some distant relative of the duke of norfolk though auntie says she has nothing to do with those howards a mocking laugh greeted this suggestion go on duffy let us have some more of your wisdom i dont see what there is to laugh at len and i am sure i dont want to hear about the new boy said his sister indignantly and she turned to her lessons once more this brought a fusillade of paper pellets from the student sitting opposite she bore it patiently for a minute or two and then angrily demanded why he did not get on with his lessons and let her do the same and threatened to ring the bell dont be a bigger duffer than you are flo you cant help being a girl i know but im willing to help you all i can out of a girls foolishness only a girl would talk of ringing the bell and making a row because she cant have all her own way come now i want to talk to you about the new boy and we can finish the lesson afterwards but you say you dont know anything about him and so theres nothing to talk about said his sister yes thats just it why shouldnt the fellow tell us who his people are where he comes from and what hes going to do with himself byandby it was his sisters turn to laugh now what queer notions boys have she exclaimed i suppose you expect a new scholar to come and say my father is a doctor or a lawyer and we have three servants at our house as soon as the master has introduced him to the class a ball of paper was levelled at duffys head for this remark who said he was to do it the first day or the second day but when a fellow has been there nearly a fortnight you expect to hear something about who he is but suppose he dont choose to tell you what then yes thats it how are we going to make him what would you do duffy thats what i want to know oh im only a girl said duffy with a laugh i cant be expected to understand boys affairs like that yes you dothats just what girls do understand we cant have a good stand up fight which is the way we generally settle things why not if the new boy wont do as the rest tell him then fight it out if he wont give in leonard heaved a sigh of despair there never was anything half so stupid as a girl he exclaimed do you think if it was anything we could settle offhand like that i should ask you about it well tell me what it is and ill help you if i can what is the new boy like she asked oh like most other fellows i suppose or at least he was the first day i know for i took particular notice as he came into the class but the last day or two he has come in a jacket that ought to have gone to the ragbag three months ago and but his jacket cant hurt you interrupted his sister you dont have to wear it you stupid duffer dont he go to torringtons i tell you and havent we got to stand up for the honour of the school whothe boys or the head master asked duffy innocently why all of us to be sure and we mean to do it too why torringtons is as good as eton oh yes of course its a good school admitted duffy yes and we mean to keep it so we dont mean to have any cads among us is the new boy a cad then asked his sister he cant be anything else if the story bob taylor has heard is true he brought it to school yesterday and says he knows it is a fact that the new fellow is a scholarship boy from one of those low board schools in middleton and that he walks back to the town every day what is a scholarship boy asked duffy why a poor beggar who cant afford to pay his own schooling and so the county council pay it for him what a shame exclaimed the young lady indignantly mamma was saying only yesterday how much our schooling cost why dont the county council pay for us especially as father has something to do with it leonard shook his head he either did not know or did not choose to tell his sister the conditions upon which county scholarships were granted he merely remarked youre a dreadful duffer about some things flo but you could tell us what girls would do if their school was going to be dragged down but florence shook her head i dont know what we should do she said because i am not one of the elder girls and we juniors dont count for much but if the girl werent nice i should not speak to her or help her with her lessons or anything oh the beggar dont want any help with his lessons he has climbed to the top of the class and hooked taylor out of his place already and old mason actually had the cheek to tell us today that we should have to pay a good deal more attention to our home work or else howard would carry off all the prizes byandby i should like to see him do it he added no you wouldnt and so you had better get on with your lessons now said the young lady practically no no lets settle this first you havent told me what a girls way would be with a fellow like this howard why if he isnt nice dont speak to him of course you cant help it if he does his lessons better than you do or you must work at them a little more carefully i suppose if you mean to get ahead of him in the class and take some of the prizes oh prizes be bothered exclaimed leonard crossly for his sisters advice had not pleased him at all i tell you we want to get rid of the fellow if we can taylor says the head master ought to have refused to take a scholarship boy perhaps father could interfere said florence he has a good deal to do with the council if you breathe a word of what ive said to father ill never speak to you again said her brother vehemently the idea of such a thing tell father indeed what would the other fellows say do you think no no we can fight our own battle and defend the honour of the school in our own way a nice hash you would make of everything you are a worse duffer than i thought though i dont think you are a telltale of course i shall not tell father what we have been talking about if that is what you mean said duffy a little indignantly the tears were shining in her eyes for she was very fond of her brother and always ready to help him whenever she was allowed and so she felt this scornful rebuff the more keenly there you neednt cry over it i suppose you cant help being only a girl but mind if you say a word to father or mother of what i have told you i never will speak to you again and with this last threat leonard turned with a sigh to his lessons ive wasted a lot of time over you this evening he said after a short silence during which duffy had been muttering over a french verb im awfully disappointed about it he went on for i shall have to tell taylor and the rest that youre nothing but a duffer because i cant tell you how to manage with a boy that i dont know it isnt fair len and you say boys always are fair said his sister in a tone of protest as she turned to her lessons once more leonard tried to follow her example but he could not fix his attention upon problems in euclid with that greater problem unsolvedhow the honour of the school was to be saved and the new boy got rid of that was really what taylor and one or two leading spirits had decided must be done but how to do it was the puzzle leonards lessons were very imperfectly prepared that night and every moment he could snatch the next morning was given to looking over his books that he might not utterly fail when he was called upon to produce what he should have learned and he was conning over one task as he walked to school when he was overtaken by taylor and the rest oh i say dabbslens nickname among his friendswe saw that new fellow with another carrying a basket of toolslooked like a carpenters basket said one it was his brother too i knowlooked as though he was going woodchopping somewhere said another but taylor slipped his arm in lens and drew him aside look here what are we going to do about itwhat did your clever sister say she couldnt think of anything last night she was too busy oh thats all rot you know you said she would be sure to think of something clever and its come to thisthat we must do something at once or torringtons will go to the dogs with working fellows coming here and lording it over gentlemen the question is how are we to get rid of him yes thats it how are we it is easy to say get rid of him but the question ishow the only thing that we can do at present that i can see is to send him to coventry to send a boy to coventry required united action on the part of the whole school but leonard morrison and taylor with one or two of their friends did not despair of persuading their classmates to follow their example of course the boys in the lower classes might speak an occasional word and the seniors in the upper form might have occasion to do the same but the classes in this school were large and practically selfcontained so that they had little to do with those in the upper or junior classes it was therefore comparatively easy for the leading spirits to persuade or compel the rest to follow their lead whatever it might be so the day following the talk between the brother and sister horace howard found himself sent to coventry as his foes had decreed as he was a quiet studious lad he did not notice this at first but by degrees it impressed itself upon him that no one had asked him a question all day or even told him that he must not do this or that he felt vaguely uncomfortable before he set off on his long walk home and when he found that several of his schoolfellows who had previously talked to him as they walked part of the way together ran off as soon as the gate was passed his heart sank within him and he wondered what he could have done to bring this punishment upon himself but whatever he might feel he determined not to let his mother know anything about it and so he went into the little room where she sat at work whistling cheerily as usual stitch stitch stitch he said as his mother looked up from her work for the accustomed kiss youre earlier tonight dear said mrs howard as she laid aside her work and drew the teatray close to her i suppose i walked a bit faster and didnt gossip quite so much said the lad and he had to strangle a sigh as he spoke lest his mother should detect it are you hungry my boy said his mother as he hung up his cap not very answered horace for he knew by this time that it was inconvenient for him to have a large appetite and so he was learning to regulate it by the state of their finances you went in your old jacket again today horace she remarked as she set his dinner before him for he took his midday meal with him to school yes i wore my old jacket why not said horace you mended it up so nicely that it was a pity not to give it another turn and save the other jackets cant be picked up in the street you know and though we may sometimes pick wool off the hedges it isnt woven and made up into boys jackets horace talked on in this strain to prevent his mother from asking questions as to how he had got on at school during the day for mrs howard knew something of the ways of boys and was terribly afraid lest some of her sons schoolfellows should find out something of their circumstances and not treat horace as they would an equal nothing but the lads love of science and her desire to give him an education that would fit him to make use of this talent had made her willing to consent that he should compete for a scholarship that would enable him to do this it was the first time she knew that a boy from the board school had ever been admitted to this exclusive grammar school known as torringtons and she had watched anxiously each day to find out whether the lads were treating their poorer companion kindly and courteously and thus far she had been perfectly satisfied her elder son was as anxious as she was that horace should have all the advantages a good education could give but he was opposed to his brother going to torringtons i am only a carpenter he said and never want to be anything better but it wont suit those boys to hear that one of their schoolfellows has a brother who is a common working man you are not a common working man fred said his mother quickly not to you perhaps mother mine but i want you to look at things as the world does i do common workcarpenters work and am glad to get the chance of doing it and to help you and horace here we can only be common working peopleyou sewing for the shops and i working for a builder that is all the people know and all we want them to know and i wish horace could have been a carpenter too perhaps it would have been as well said his mother with a sigh i am sure it would we agreed to come here and leave the whole miserable past behind it is left behind interrupted his mother quickly ah yes we have done our best but who knows what questions may be asked now horace has gone to that school boys are often curious in their inquiries and it is not as though fred fred we must leave these things in the hand of god and be content to take one step at a time i could not in fairness to horace let him throw away this opportunity of getting a good education that will fit him to use the gifts which i believe god has given him this conversation had taken place at dinnertime that very day and mrs howard was thinking of it as she watched horace eat his dinner the boy knew that his mothers eyes were upon him and he was the more anxious to guard his secret and so he rattled on until his mother forgot her fears and thought fred was making himself anxious without the slightest shadow of cause chapter ii sending him to coventry horace howard sat longer over his lessons that night and was quite undisturbed by any talking with his mother and brother and when the time came for him to put the lessons aside and go to bed he knew he had only half mastered them for his thoughts had wandered continually from the subject of the lesson before him to the events of his day at school trying to discover what he had done to offend his schoolfellows that they should all at once send him to coventry in this fashion the study of mathematics french chemistry and physics did not help him to the solution of this problem but the school mystery greatly hindered the other subjects from becoming clear to his mind and when he took his place in class the next morning he knew it would be a bad day for him with his classwork it was worse even than he feared and as he lost place after place and went down at last even below the dunces of the form it hurt him more to see how gleeful the other boys were over his mistakes than to lose his place in the class at last when horace had blundered worse than usual over some lesson the master said what is the matter with you today howard are you ill have you got a headache no sir answered horace for he was a truthful lad and could not avail himself of the excuse the master had thus offered him you could not have prepared your lessons last night then you know the rule about this dont you said the master sternly yes sir i studied my lessons for more than two hours last night said horace reddening and growing more confused for he knew all the class were staring at him and as he fancied glorying in his discomfiture in this he was not far wrong but there were one or two who pitied him in his various dilemmas and would have broken that ban of silence that had been decreed against him but the leaders kept their eyes upon them and they would not venture to brave the displeasure of their elders altogether it was a cruelly hard day for horace and he felt strongly inclined to say when he went home that he would never go near the school again but become a carpenter like his brother one trade would be as good as another if he could not go on and learn more of the mysteries of chemistry and physics it was some consolation to him that his master had told him to prepare a special lesson in chemistry in readiness for some practical experiments that were to take place the following day in his eagerness over this horace forgot the vexations and trials of the day and had mastered it so quickly that he was able to look over again the lessons that had floored him in class these imperfect lessons would be like the damaged links of a chain and might bring him trouble again and again if he did not repair the mischief at once and so by the time he went to bed he had wellnigh mastered all the difficulties and worked himself into a state of selfcontent which was about the best preparation for the next days work for he went to sleep without a thought beyond his lessons and took his place in the class looking bright and cheery once more today was to be a sort of recapitulation of the previous fortnights work in chemistry and the stupid blunders made the previous day were more than atoned for and at last when the boy had worked out a brilliant result that greatly surprised the master he said why you must have been ill yesterday no sir i was well said horace seeing the master waited for an answer i was well enough but i was not quite happy well then let me advise you to make yourself happy in future under any circumstances and then he added in an undertone you are a scholarship lad and we expect more from you than from some of the others thank you sir ill try said horace and throughout that day he did not find it hard to try as the master had suggested the others had their eyes upon him and were puzzled to account for his success they had made up their minds the previous day that they would only have to carry on their present tactics for a short time and horace would leave the school in disgust or else he would be asked to leave by the head master and thus torringtons would be saved from going to the dogs through this scholarship boy but this days experience of what horace could do under the terrible ban of their displeasure puzzled them and they resolved to watch more closely to make sure none of those who were suspected of faltering in allegiance to the decree of their leaders did not speak to him on their way home but horace himself did not expect this now the first bitterness of the trial had worn off and as soon as he was beyond the school gate he set off home at a sharp trot softly whistling to himself as he pondered over what would be the probable effect if a certain acid they had been using was mixed with another substance entirely different from anything they had used in that days experiments he whistled and thought and turned the matter over and over in his mind and finally ended by wishing that his mother could afford to give him pocketmoney like most boys had to spend this cost him a sigh as he thought he might as well wish for a slice of the moon at once as for pocketmoney and by the time he got home he was whistling to himself again as happily as ever when he got in his mother noticed his eager animated looks why what has happened to make you so merry she said as he threw up his cap in sheer exuberance of spirits nothing much mother only i have got an idea keep it then ladkeep it said his brother laughing all right said horace thinking he should be under no temptation to part with it since his schoolfellows would not speak to him its a good idea i know if i can only find out the way to carry it out added horace at which his brother laughed and his mother remarked that a good many people had ideas but the difficulty was to carry them into effect so that they were of practical use oh it will want a good deal of thinking about i know but it has made me quite decide not to be a carpenter i thought you had made up your mind about that long ago said fred ah but i was thinking the other day it would be a great deal easier to be a carpenter and earn money i wasnt sure that i ought not to do something to help mother soon no my boy interrupted mrs howard it would not be your duty to give up all opportunity of using the talents god has given you when the way has been made clear for you to receive the education that will fit you to use them byandby fred always liked cutting wood and making boats and stools just as you are fond of making chemical experiments and watching what the result will be i wouldnt be anything but a carpenter but i shall study mathematics more that i may do better at my trade byandby said fred every man to his trade i suppose but theres nothing like making things i think he added so the brothers agreed to differ but it was a very happy evening to horace and he thought he had overcome all his difficulties and could be very happy in spite of the ban that his schoolfellows had placed upon him he learned his lessons that night without difficulty and the next morning began to recover his place in the class but the hour of recess tried him sorely a few of the boys who lived in the neighbourhood went home to dinner from one to two oclock but many who came from a distance brought luncheon with them or had dinner provided for them at the school there was a luncheon room provided for those who brought their meals with them but horace had preferred eating his slice of bread and butter or bread and dripping walking about the playground there were others who did the same thing but they walked in groups and chatted and frolicked or played games and when he first came horace had been invited to join these and had been initiated into the mysteries of one game peculiar to the school which was therefore very popular among the boys now however this was altered horace was left severely alone and though a boy might go shouting round for another to make up the game no one ever asked horace to take the vacant place he was left to walk up and down the side of the playground until the bell rang for afternoon school and then the boys who might be near as they were passing in took care to hold as far aloof from him as possible horace wondered how long this was going to last he had made several attempts to break through this silent persecution but each boy to whom he had spoken had walked away as though he was stone deaf and so at last horace gave up the attempt and tried to be happy in spite of this i say morrison how much longer is that beggar going to hold out said taylor one day speaking to leonard as though he ought to know all about it taylor had lost his place in the class and so had leonard and neither felt very amiable ask him if you want to know im nearly sick of it i can tell you its lasted a month now and i think we may as well give it up i daresay you do my brother who has just come home from oxford says it is your people who have brought him into the school my people shouted leonard crimson with wrath at the insinuation who do you mean by my people and why should you think so now dont get mad len said taylor in a quieter tone but you know your father is on the county council and they say it was he who recommended that howard should be sent to torringtons i dont believe it blazed leonard morrison and then with fine inconsistency he added if he did it was because the fellow got a scholarship and he had to go somewhere anywhere but at torringtons would have done for him grumbled taylor and i think the master or the council ought to turn him out now they know the rest of the fellows dont like it but do they know we have sent him to coventry asked leonard are they batsdo they go about with their eyes shuthavent you noticed that howard has been up in the chemistry lab yesterday and today all the lunch time i saw skeats speaking to him yesterday just after we came into the playground and the two walked away together it was the same again today only howard was looking out for him and went to meet him as soon as he appeared now what are we going to do if the masters try to beat us at this game i say it isnt fair answered morrison fair i call it the meanest thing i ever heard of and shows that torringtons is going to the dogs masters and all i wish youd speak to your pater about it morrison i think you might now skeats has taken to interfering with us like this leonard shrugged his shoulders i think it would be better for somebody else to come and see my father if they think he had anything to do with sending that boy here you dont know the pater hed just turn me inside out and then laugh at me but he couldnt serve any other fellow that way but taylor shook his head it was true that he did not know dr morrison but he had heard that this gentleman had said it would be for the advantage of torringtons to receive a few scholarship boys for they were sure to be sharp studious lads and it would waken the other boys up and put them on their mettle so he declined to go and see mr morrison but declared that leonard ought to undertake the mission on behalf of the school look here curtis he called to another lad who like himself was one of the elders of the class and consequently domineered a good deal over the rest morrison wont do his duty in upholding the honour of the school you come and talk to him whats the row asked curtis loftily sauntering up with his hands in his pockets and looking down upon leonard morrison as a big overgrown lad likes to look at one of his smaller schoolfellows as if to intimidate him with his superior height and bulk now then little morrison speak up what is it he said in a sleepy tone but trying to look fierce why its just this curtis that beggar we have sent to coventry dont seem inclined to take himself out of the school and so somebody must be made to move him of course said curtis who did not mind who the somebody might be so long as he was not called upon to exert himself beyond a little bullying you hear little morrison just you do as youre told he commanded this is what i want him to do explained taylor i have heard that it is all through his father that we have got the beggar here and so its mr morrison and that precious council that must move him of course assented curtis you hear morrison i tell you it must be some of the other fellows that must go and explain to the pater that the school dont like scholarship boys you dont know my pater he went on a little plaintively he would very likely report us to the head master for sending the fellow to coventry and then where should we be where we are now but that fellow wouldnt i tell you curtis you dont know the pater he would ask what he had done that the school had sent him to coventry and you know well enough that we havent acted on the square with him oh thats it is it you are going to take his part now and peach on us raved taylor curtis yawned youd better give in and do as taylor orders you well then i should peach and no mistake if i told my father we had sent the fellow to coventry for the last month what for he would say in his quiet way while he looked into your very soul so that you knew you must make a clean breast of everything no thank you i dont mind going with you and taylor and two or three other fellows as a sort of deputation from deputation be bothered interrupted taylor viciously why should we go cap in hand to ask your father to take the fellow away it ought to be enough for you to tell him that the school dont like it and that we are determined to uphold the honour of torringtons yes thats it we dont mean to let the school go to the dogs to please anybody said curtis lazily yes and what are we to do next for the beggar dont seem to care now whether we send him to coventry or not and skeats is giving the game away by letting him go to the chemistry lab every dinner hour lets send skeats to coventry said curtis leonard laughed at the suggestion but taylor grew more angry its no good fooling over this now he said i have been talking to some of the fellows in the sixth and they have made up their minds not to have the beggar among them all right let them get rid of him then said curtis i dont see why we should do their dirty work whens he going up he swats as though he expected to go next term complained leonard morrison who had lost his place in the class that morning through horace swats its shameful the pace that fellow goes with his lessons and the masters think we ought to do the same foamed taylor ah theyve tried to force it upon all of us observed curtis but i wont let it disturb me i can tell you you dont mind being the dunce of the school said leonard with a short laugh i dont care what the fellows call me so long as they let me alone said the young giant still with his hands in his pockets he was getting tired of the discussion and taylor saw that it was of little use trying to threaten leonard and so he walked sulkily away to try and think out some other means of getting rid of the obnoxious scholarship boy chapter iii the cock of the walk i say duffy theres an awful row among the fellows at school taylor and curtis are like raging bulls over this new fellow and they say its all the paters fault the brother and sister were sitting at their lessons in the little room known as the study as they sat when this story opened several weeks however had elapsed since that time and florence having her own cares and interests to think of had wellnigh forgotten how she had been appealed to in the matter of the new boy what are you talking about len she asked after a pause during which she had been muttering over a french verb with her hand covering the page by way of testing whether she knew her lesson thats like a girl answered her brother tartly i have told you more than once or twice about that new boy at torringtons and now you ask me what i am talking about oh well i didnt know he was so interesting as all that you told me a week or two ago that you had sent him to coventry and settled him and so of course i thought it was all over said the young lady propping her chin in her hands and looking across at her brother but if a fellow wont be settled what are you to do i want you to tell me that duffy the young lady shook her head tell us all about it len im not very busy tonight well we sent that fellow to coventry as i told younot that hes a bad sort of chap only he came from one of those beastly board schools in the town and we didnt know who he was or what he was and he kept his mouth shut about his people and so the fellows took up the notion that torringtons would soon go to the dogs if we let that sort of cattle stay there and so we said he must go well we thought the coventry game had done the trick for us just at first for you never saw such an awful ass as he made of himself one morning at all the classes howard are you ill said skeats at last in his sharp way and we thought the beggar would get off for the rest of the lessons but if youll believe it he was game enough to say no sir im quite well which was as good as telling skeats he was a fool for asking such a question florence nodded i like plucky boys she said approvingly well it was a plucky thing to do i daresay but it didnt help him much with skeats that day for he never spared him a bit as he did not take the excuse that had been offered him and he blundered and floundered worse than ever so that curtis the biggest dunce in the class answered for him and took his place in the class what a shame said florence pityingly well i felt sorry for the poor little beggar at last for we knew he had swatted well over the lesson and yet he seemed to have lost his wits thats done the trick taylor whispered to me when skeats frowned at him once for being such an ass we shant see that scholarship swatter here any more swatter repeated florence but i thought you said he didnt know his lessons ah that once but it wasnt for the want of swatting for it was just that that put the fellows backs up he comes into the school looking as meek as a rabbit ive been to the board school he says to taylor when he put him through the usual mill not a word did he say about french and latin and so taylor thought he would have him for a fag as he was a junior but we soon found out that we should have to swat over our lessons and no mistake if we were to keep out of rows with the masters he set the pace dont you see till taylor got as mad as a hatter when he lost his place at the top of the class and then he said this new boy would have to go because he learned his lessons better than the rest exclaimed his sister well not that exactlyof course not replied her brother but you see he was only a board school boy and his mother couldnt be a lady and his brother is only a common carpenter they say and so for a fellow like that to come to torringtons would just ruin the school thats why we want to get rid of him dont you see no i dont said florence indignantly and taylor and the rest are a set of mean cads the expression was not very elegant or ladylike but she had learned it from her brother and knew he would feel the reproach conveyed by this word more surely than by anything else she could say it stung him into a fierce passion of wrath what do girls know about boys schools and boys ways he demanded i know what you have told me about taylor and the rest and i say they are not gentlemen but a set of mean cads she was careful not to include leonard in this scathing denunciation for she added i should not like to think my brother would act like that oh well duffy you see you are a girl and cant be expected to know everything but i did tell taylor today that i thought we might leave the beggar alone and let him out of coventry now if i was the new boy i would send you there and see how you liked it what are you going to do she asked thats just itjust what i wanted to talk to you about the fellows say it is all the paters doings that howard has been sent to torringtons and florence clapped her hands dear old daddy she said he knew what torringtons wanted now go on she added its no good when you interrupt like that i wanted to tell you what the fellows are saying and now if i do youll just go and peach about the whole thing now len did i ever peach about anything you told me havent we always been fair and square to each other expostulated his sister who felt herself insulted by such a charge yes you always have been pretty fair for a girl admitted her brother and i hope youll remember that mum must be the word still and mind if you hear about this you dont know anything but just tell the pater to ask me about it i dont want you to go and give your opinion about the school and the fellows though curtis and one or two more may be a poor lot the thing is they feel themselves insulted by having this scholarship boy sent to torringtons and they want me to speak to the pater about it oh dodo and let me be there when you tell him said florence her eyes dancing with glee at the prospect dont be a duffer do you think i dont know my own daddy well enough to know that it would be no good going to him with the fellows complaints i told taylor he had better come and see the pater himself about it of course nodded florence that would be the proper way and i should like to see them do it and again the girl laughed this seemed to annoy her brother its all very well for you to laugh he said you dont know what it is to be mixed up with such an affair and i want to know what i am to do what do they want you to do havent i told you they say i must get the pater to remove howard from the school at once and one of the fellows told me as i came home that he overheard taylor and curtis say that if it wasnt pretty soon done theyd send me to coventry and find out some other way to get rid of howard i wouldnt care if i was you wouldnt you if you was a boy youd know what it was to be sent to coventry perhaps and let me tell you you wouldnt want a second dose its none so pleasant i can tell you to have this fellow turn his back and begin to whistle if you attempt to speak to him why they make it so strict at torringtons that if the master sends a message to a fellow in coventry they fetch a junior to deliver it oh i know enough to make me hate the thought of it and so would you girls are not so nasty as that said florence but i tell you what you could do if they send you to coventrychum up with the new boy i should think he was a nice fellow but leonard turned up his nose at the suggestion he isnt much at games he said i dont think he ever saw a fives court until he came to torringtons and i do like a good game at fives id play by myself then said his sister ah and see every other fellow pick up his ball and walk out of the court as soon as you appeared youd feel like playing then wouldnt you he added his sister sighed she was very fond of leonard although he was not very brave she feared still big lads like taylor and curtis could make things very uncomfortable for the younger and weaker lads like leonard now just see if you cant help me out of this hole flo said the boy after another pause i told the fellows id do something tonight and i must you know do something repeated his sister what do you want to do i dont want to do anything the poor beggar might stay at torringtons for ever if he liked but you see the others have set their faces against it and they say i must either make the pater remove him or else think of another plan to get rid of him dont you see duffy i must do one or the other no i dont see and you shant call me duffy either if you mean to help these wretched cads at torringtons and ill never own you for a brother again his sister spoke calmly but with the utmost scorn and contempt in her tones and then laid her head on the table and burst into tears im ashamed of you i am she sobbed through her tears leonard stared at her in silent amazement for a minute or two and then said slowly you dont know this scholarship boy do you she shook her head of course i dont she said as soon as she could speak then what are you crying for id be ashamed to cry for a fellow id never seen and you a girl too florence started to her feet as her brother uttered this taunt and dashing away her tears with blazing eyes she exclaimed it is not for this strange boy i am crying but for youthat you are as much a cad as taylor and the rest then gathering up her books she marched out of the room with the air of an offended duchess ah youre only a girl exclaimed leonard as she departed and he broke into a whistle but it soon ended in a sigh when the door closed and he was left to himself i wonder what girls are made of he said as he slowly opened his lesson books to think of duffy flying at me like that she called me a cad too nasty little thing i wont speak to her for a week when we come in here to lessons ill give her a taste of coventry and see how she likes it and leonard set himself to master a latin verb but before he had conned it three minutes his thoughts had wandered to his sister and from her to taylor and the lads at school who expected him to solve the problem that they had made into a bogeyhow to get rid of the scholarship boy since all their efforts thus far had failed before he got to school the next morning he met half a dozen of his schoolfellows well whats the news morrison asked two or three in a breath you know of course taylor expects you to bring a message from your father about that fellow today blessed are they that expect nothing for they shall never be disappointed said leonard in a tantalising tone well you can cheek us of course little morrison but it wont do for taylor let me tell you he dont mean to stand any nonsense that fellows got to go we dont mean to have any board school boys here torringtons was founded for gentlemen and we dont mean to have cads here weve made up our minds about it and the sooner your father and that precious council understand this the better did taylor tell you to say all that said morrison sneeringly how long have you been his fag he asked of the lad who had spoken oh well fag or no fag youll know it when taylor comes and as if in verification of his words taylor called to them the next minute to wait for him were late now shouted leonard back and then he started off at a sharp pace towards the school for he had not quite made up his mind yet what he should tell taylor by way of excuse for not speaking to his father and so he did not want to meet him just now he could not help noticing as he ran that none of the rest attempted to join him but waited at the corner of the road they had been crossing for taylor to come up so morrison has skulked off he said as soon as he joined them i believe he wanted to get out of your way said one i shouldnt wonder said the bigger lad but he need not think hes going to do it i tell you that ive been ferreting out things a bit and i know now that it was dr morrison that persuaded the county council to send that fellow to torringtons and so he must and shall take him away and that pretty soon too and i mean to tell morrison that how are you going to do it asked one oh through morrison junior of course there isnt much spunk about him and hell soon cry peccavi when we put the screw on what will you dohow will you do it asked one send him to coventry as we did the other was the prompt reply oh that be bothered we cant be worried with two there at once you must think of something else bless you the threat of it will be enough for little morrison hell give in when he hears the mystic word coventry youll give him another chance it he hasnt brought the message well i shall hear what hes got to say first now look alive theres the last bell and we shall all get an imposition instead of a pleasant talk with little morrison if we dont get inside that gate as he spoke the heavy clang of the school gate was heard and the boys looked at each other as taylor ejaculated dash it all they havent rung that last bell two minutes and thats the regulation time they propped their backs against the wall and rested after their run for the gate would not be opened again until prayers were over in school and then their names would be taken as they went in and an extra lesson would be exacted from them in the dinner hour dont let little morrison get off without seeing me in the afternoon said taylor i shant be able to nail him in the dinner hour but it will give me a bit more time to think of some other plan its a beastly shame they ever sent that scholarship boy to torringtons said another lad as though he did not like the task of hunting him out oh well hes here and we must get him out said taylor as though he rather liked the hunt just then the gate opened and the lads filed in nearly a dozen were late from the whole school and each as he passed was asked if he had brought a note to excuse this breach of the rule and then they passed on to their different classrooms instead of going to the hall for prayers the being late and consequent imposition of an extra lesson did not improve taylors temper and when he met leonard at the close of afternoon school he was in a towering rage now then morrison out with it what message has your father sent to the school for his abominable behaviourwhat has he to say for himself leonard looked a little scared at the abruptness and tone of this question and he answered very quietly my father was busy last night and i could not speak to him about it busy was he well it wont be good for you if hes busy tonight let me tell you for the school dont mean to wait any longer and if that fellow isnt soon removed you shall both go do you hear little morrison we mean to clear the school of all vermin at once why didnt you tell him to take himself off said one when taylor had walked away this is getting a bit too much you stand up for yourself and your father if he comes any more of that bullying what right has he to say who shall come to torringtons if he had spoken of my father like that he should have had a black eye if he killed me for it afterwards added his friend leonard sighed you dont know taylor as well as i do he said he isnt a bad sort of fellow if you let him have his own way but its such a beastly way that i wouldnt put up with it said the other he may be the cock of the walk but he need not think we are all going to cackle to him like a set of hens i mean to take that fellow out of coventry after this come on let us both walk home with him a bit and see how the cock likes that theres howard just ahead lets catch him but instead of quickening his pace leonard looked timorously back and there was taylor with a group of lads round him vigorously declaiming against the county council for sending one of their scholarship boys to torringtons so leonard felt afraid to join this unpopular scholar and set himself in defiance of the present wave of anger that was passing over his friends and he turned down a byroad and walked home by himself chapter iv dr morrison leonard morrison found himself sent to coventry not by his schoolfellows but by his sister it was just the punishment he had decided she deserved for daring to have an opinion of her own that differed from his and so to find himself hoist with his own petard made him very angry where is flo going to do her lessons tonight he asked his mother when he went to the study and found it in darkness his sister usually lighted the lamp ready for him but his mother had come with him to do it tonight she has gone to her own roomshe wants to be quiet she says you should not talk so much lenny dear added the lady nasty little thing she has been telling tales i suppose she did not say what you had been talking about if that is what you mean said mrs morrison but your father heard a great deal of chatter he says so flo has taken herself off said leonard as he took his seat and opened his school satchel a nice time i shall have if taylor keeps his word and sends me to coventry at school i shall lose the use of my tongue in about a week if nobody will speak to me its a lively lookout any way and what have i done to deserve it i should like to know leonard considered himself a very illused individual just then and he was specially angry with his sister because she had so neatly turned the tables upon him in leaving him to do his lessons alone he missed her sadly as the time went on and there was no one to grumble at or ask advice from what to do about speaking to his father he did not know and at last he decided to say something to his mother about the matter not that he meant to tell her all but he would just ask her if she thought taylor was right in his statement so when mrs morrison came into the room with his slice of cake for his supper he said do you know whether father had anything to do with sending that scholarship boy to torringtons whyisnt he a good boy said the lady that isnt it mother he may be goodi dare say he isbut did father send him there the county council sent him your father would not have the power i suppose not said leonard in a satisfied tone but why did you ask my boy said the lady oh it doesnt matter said leonard lightly as long as daddy didnt send him its all right but what has happened what sort of a boy is he oh hes all right i dare say boys cant peach you know mother and leonards light words sent his mother out with an aching heart more trouble i fear she said softly to herself as she closed the door and went back to the diningroom poor dick poor dear dick what misery he has brought to us all and yet he was never wickedonly weak the lady buried her face in her handkerchief for a few minutes but roused herself when she heard the street door open and close and went and rung the bell for supper to be served you are late tonight dear she said when her husband entered the room yes i have had a busy day and am as hungry as a hunter chicks gone to bed i suppose he added as he looked round the room before going to wash his hands and change his coat for a comfortable hour by his own fireside a tasty hot supper was on the table when he came back but he noticed as he ate that his wife scarcely touched hers but he did not ask what was troubling her until the meal was over and the table cleared then he said leaning back in his chair now little woman i have done my duty to your nice supper which i know is all you have been waiting for now tell me what is amiss has flo cut her finger or len got into mischief he asked no dear the children are all right said mrs morrison with a sigh but i have been wondering whether you were wise to get that little board school boy sent to torringtons you did have a good deal to do with it i know added the lady to be sure i did the lad had fairly earned the thompson scholarship and from all we heard of the lad and his relatives we thought he would be an acquisition to the school rather than otherwise his mother was a patient of mine about a year ago and from all i saw then i concluded that they were people who had come down in the world for it was easy to see that they were superior to their surroundings and i thought then that if ever it was in my power to help them i would do so the father is abroad travelling i understand but he seems to have left his family badly provided for what have you heard about the boy oh nothing promptly replied mrs morrison only from a word lenny dropped i fancy he is not popular at the school and you know what queer notions people take sometimes and if it was said that dr morrison sent a board school boy to the school they are all so proud of we might have all our old troubles over again the doctor laughed you think half my patients must be offended as well as the boys at torringtons i have heard a whisper that some of them dont like the new scholar but he will live it down i daresay and i am not going to notice it but my dear if you should lose your patients if this boy should disgrace himself people will be sure to say that you had no business to send him to such a school and the worst of the trouble is sure to come upon us ah i see you have been saddling the horse ready to go and meet it how many times am i to tell you little woman to wait until the trouble comes to you and then to look it squarely in the face and fight it if fighting is likely to do any good and if it is not then bear it with all the patience and courage that god will give you if you only do your share in the matter now what has master len been saying about this lad he asked if it was true that you were the means of sending that scholarship boy to torringtons the boys had said you did it the doctor laughed murder will out you see maria i told him the county council sent him and of course they did quite true but i had the casting vote in the matter and i voted that the lad should go to torringtons both for the sake of the school and the boy and also that i might hear incidentally from len what sort of a lad he was what does he say nothing definite he wanted to know whether it was true that you had sent him and when i asked why he said boys were not allowed to tell tales or words to that effect the doctor smiled then its nothing very bad he said and if this lad can only hold his own among some of those big louting lads he will do our school a world of good how is he to do that asked the lady why this boy has formed the habit of steady application to the task before him whatever it may be if he had not he could not have passed the examination necessary to gain this scholarship now torringtons sadly needs a few lads like this for it is beginning to suffer from the dry rot that a great name often brings to a school after some years the sons of wealthy men are sent there who have no need to toil with either hands or brains and they take care not to do it themselves and to hinder others from doing it if they can for len and lads like him this example is bad and so to introduce a studious lad who will think less of games than of lessons has become a necessity if torringtons is to be saved from going to the dogs and i should be very sorry to see the school go down i went there when i was a lad and have always been proud of torringtons and that is why i am anxious to save it from collapse i believe lenny is just as proud of it as you are said his wife i should hope so i dont think much of a lad who is not proud and fond of his school and ready to fight for its honour against all antagonists i think all torringtons lads feel the same about their school said mrs morrison but suppose some of them should think a poor boy who is dependent upon a scholarship for his schooling beneath the rest of the scholars i cannot forget the old trouble she added then they must learn to know better learn to consider that there is something more in the world than money worth consideration this is what i am afraid is spoiling some of the torrington boys just now and it is high time it was checked we talked this aspect of the matter over at the council meetingfor there are several old boys among us who are proud of our schooland we agreed that a little new blood among these purseproud young gentlemen would do them a world of good and i hope this boy may be what is needed among them as for the old trouble went on dr morrison that is left behind i hope but you must remember that it arose from a very different cause your brother dick behaved very badly to more than one of my patients and so disgraced us poor dear dick said the lady with a sigh i am sure he never intended to do us any harm i never thought he did no one who knew dick would think that of him but the misery came to us all the same and dick was responsible for it this allusion to her brother brought the tears to mrs morrisons eyes he had been such a bright winning lad when he was the age of leonard he had only one fault that she would admit even now and that was that he was too easily led he could not say no though not to say it and abide by it under the circumstances was wrong this ended at last in what was little less than a crime for which they had to pay the penalty in a long struggle against adverse circumstances and eventually to leave liverpool and return to mr morrisons native town and begin the world afresh this ending to what might have been a bright and honourable career for her brother and a no less prosperous one for her husband was a very bitter trial to the lady and though dr morrisons practice was now steadily increasing anything that rendered him less popular might bring back the old trouble she feared in thinking thus she of course exaggerated the circumstances in every way for in point of fact not even mrs howard knew that it was through the doctors influence that horace was sent to the same school with his own son and as the name of morrison was not mentioned by horace she did not know that he was there for some time her son was industrious and fond of scientific study and had fairly won the scholarship she was assured by the schoolmaster he was very proud to add that horace was the first scholarship boy who had been sent by the county council to torringtons but that her doctor had had anything to do with the selection of a school for horace she knew nothing she heard afterwards that it was the best school in the county but she thought more of whether horace would be able to do the lessons required of him without overworking himself and also whether she would be able to keep him suitably clothed so that he did not look particular among the other lads the school was nearly two miles from their home so that he would wear out his boots very fast she reflected when considering ways and means there was a small allowance made for this after the school fees were paid out of the scholarship money and it was the consideration of this that made horace resume wearing the old jacket when his mother wished him to keep on with his best one which he had worn for the first week or two in fact he had worn the best jacket until he was so mysteriously sent to coventry and though he carefully kept this fact to himself it was the underlying meaning of what he told her when he said it would make no difference to him at school whether he wore a new or an old jacket of the bitterness underlying the words that were said that she should not spend too much on his clothes she knew nothing indeed after the first week or two horace was very reticent about what passed at school rarely mentioned a schoolfellow by name and seemed absorbed in his lessons all the evening he talked sometimes to fred about his mysterious idea which she knew was connected with chemistry but beyond this she knew very little of her boys life at this time sometimes he looked worried as he sat poring over his books as though they were a little beyond his power she thought and then she would say now horace if you are getting tired give it up you know going to this school is quite an experiment for you and if you fail to keep up with the rest it will be no disgrace to own it you have been looking pale the last day or two i feel quite well mother and as to keeping up with the rest well you should see the young giant who is always at the bottom of the class and horace laughed as he mentally recalled the perpetually yawning figure of curtis with his back propped against the wall i believe he would go to sleep outright if it wasnt for the master saying now curtis keep your ears and eyes open poor fellow perhaps he does not feel able to do the work said mrs howard pityingly well he doesnt let lessons trouble him much he and the cock of the walk thats another big chap who doesnt care much about books they take it pretty easy except when they get an impot and that takes all their dinner time and what do you do at dinner time asked his brother at this point eat my dinner to be sure answered horace well you dont look much the better for it mother im going to be paid an extra shilling a week and i vote it goes in dinners for the boy with an idea said fred no no i can do very well and i enjoy my dinner hours now for i often go up to the lab and have a nice time to myself mr skeats told me i might go if i did not take any of the other boys with me you see some of them might get up to larks and why dont you get up to larks interrupted his brother horace laughed oh you know that isnt much in my way and theres room for everybody in a big school like torringtons i wish the youngster did not look so serious said fred after his brother had gone to bed that night he always was quiet remarked his mother quiet yes but now he looks up from his book sometimes as though he had a world of care upon his mind perhaps he is thinking over his idea you know he could talk of nothing else for a day or two said mrs howard well he doesnt talk much now at any rate and i am wondering whether he is quite happy at that school but surely he would tell us if he was not i have asked him again and again i think he would tell us if there was anything wrong now mother dont vex yourself or i shall be sorry i have spoken just let that extra shilling a week i am to have go for the youngsters midday meal get him something better than bread and butter to take with himsandwiches or a little meatpie they say people who work with their brains want as much to eat as those who work with their hands and i am sure two slices of bread and butter wouldnt satisfy me at twelve oclock chapter v the champion mother i think i shall be obliged to wear that other jacket to go to school said horace one evening as he ate his dinner he had come home from school looking almost radiant and his mother had heard incidentally that one of the other boys had walked most of the way with him but i thought you said no one lived this way said mrs howard oh i think warren came out of his way a bit that we might finish our talk he likes history awfully and so do i a bit and we got talking about those old battles and almost forgot the time now mother dont you think i had better take my best jacket for school the sleeves of this are getting so short his mother laughed why i told you the same thing a month ago she said but you insisted that it did not matter well you know i dont want to cost you more than i am obliged for clothes and i thought i might wear the old jacket a bit longer as i should wear out so many boots but now and there horace stopped lest he should say something that might betray how his schoolfellows had treated him lately you must be careful to wear the linen apron and sleeves while you do your chemistry work remarked his mother for you are beginning to make the old one a variegated colour all right ill be careful but i thought warren looked at my hands poking too far through the sleeves of that old one and warren is a nice fellow i should not like to hurt his feelings said horace ah you find that some lads are more particular about their clothes than you are yes wear the best jacket by all means and i have no doubt i shall be able to buy you a new one when you want it so the matter was settled and the next morning he met his new friend as they had arranged and the two boys had a pleasant chat on all sorts of subjects as they walked along the road just before the school was reached and when they came within sight of other groups of boys horace stopped short and said now you had better go on it dont matter if i am late i have plenty of time in the dinner hour to do the imposition what do you meanwhat do you take me for said warren thrusting his arm through his companions well you know the school have sent me to coventry lately and if you know what for its more than i do so that it isnt likely to alter its opinion in a hurry said horace oh the school be bothered said warren of course a fellow has to do the same as the rest when he is at school but the cock of the walk is going a bit too far this time and i mean to let the whole lot see that i wont follow the lead when i dont think its fair and square if they had any good reason for sending you to coventry id see you hanged before id try to take your part but i like fair play and it is not a fair game they are playing against you now but suppose they send you to coventry as well said horace oh they will you bet taylor and curtis and that crowd are sure to do it and i dare say they will rage like a bull in a china shop come on here they see we are going in arminarm a storm of hisses greeted their appearance at the school gate and horace changed colour and his arm shook but warren gripped him the tighter so that he could not get away is it worth while sticking to me if the rest dont like it whispered horace is anything worth fighting for as those old englishmen fought in the civil warhampden and that lot warrens face was flaming and he held his head high as he led horace through the hooting crowd of boys while he asked this question loud enough for any of them to hear horace did not answer he almost wished warren would leave him alone but this was not that gentlemans way i tell you what it is howard he said when they had reached the comparative shelter of the playground where the hooting had to cease for fear the master should insist upon knowing what it was about i have been thinking a lot of what we were talking about last night and its my opinion that there would not be so many tyrants in the world if they did not find easy victims you knuckled under to the cock of the walk at the first touch when you ought to have said now what do you mean by sending me to coventry what rule of the school have i broken ah but you know we are not rich people i am only a scholarship boy and come from a board school as if i didnt know that as if my pater has not told me a dozen times lately that he wishes he had sent me to a board school when i was young bless you we are not rich my father is only a doctor like morrisons and there are swarms and swarms of children in the nursery so you may know we havent got money to roll in like curtis no old fellow we are two poor boys and so well just stand shoulder to shoulder and fight the lot if they want to fight us now mind youve got to fight for me and ill fight for you and well let em see what two can do if nobody else joins us little morrison will though i think taylor has led him a dogs life lately and so i should think he would be glad enough to cut that shop and join howard and co horace laughed as he had not done since he had been at torringtons he was ready enough to fight for his new friend and when one or two tried to hustle them apart as they were going to school he did not hesitate to push one of them off when he was crowding down upon warren the boy turned and scowled at horace who are you he demanded angrily the scholarship boy and this is my friend he said still holding on to warren and dealing some sharp thrusts at those who were trying to push between them there could be no great demonstration here in the lobby of the school or the masters would want to know what the quarrel was about at dinner time there was little opportunity for the new friends to meet for the science master if he did not know shrewdly guessed the attitude taken by the rest of the class towards the scholarship boy and so had contrived to find something for him to do in the chemistry laboratory during the recess and horace was only too glad of the change to do a little extra practical work towards the elucidation of his idea which grew all the more interesting as he saw it would need great care and industry to arrive at the result but when afternoon school was over warren waited about until horace appeared and then he said just go on a little way while i speak to morrison i want him to come with us for i know that cock of the walk is bullying him and if hell just join us we shall be three to the other lot little morrison isnt a bad sort of fellow when you can get him to make up his mind and the curtis lot are getting a deal too cocky so horace walked on to the corner of the road and warren waited for leonard but the moment taylor saw him speak to the lad he pounced down upon him now look here morrison he said if you go talking to warren now hes joined that fellow in coventry youll be sent there yourself by the rest of the school ill give you a week to think over what we were talking about at dinner time and taylor as he spoke slipped his arm into leonards and walked him off leaving warren to try and persuade another boy to join him in his walk home with horace but the taylor and curtis party were too strong just now for another to rebel against their rule and so the two lads walked home by themselves amid the derisive cheers of taylor and a few others this state of things continued for a few daysthe two friends learning to know and like each other better each time they met and cared less for the company of others then a quarrel broke out in the ranks of the popular party and warren heard that taylor was so hectoring the others as to what they should do that at last out of sheer perversity two or three came to walk home with them and held a discussion concerning taylor and his ways that ought to have made that young gentlemans ears tingle were all in coventry now of course said one boy and i vote that we make ourselves jolly over it i say howard i want you to tell me how you get your lessons done for youre always ready with an answer and ive been so floored lately that ive had a private message if i dont do better i shall have to go down among the juniors and that would make my people wild horace laughed at the idea of there being any royal road to the acquisition of lessons but the one of careful steady thoughtful study then you do swat awfully as the fellows say and thats what they are so mad about taylor says torringtons will be nothing better than a swatting shop and no place for gentlemen if it isnt stopped horace opened his eyes i thought we went to school that we might learn all we could he said oh torringtons has got so fashionable that fellows have come to think of it as an easygoing place where they need not work if they dont like it just what my pater says exclaimed warren and he told me that if i didnt turn over a new leaf he should send me somewhere else now i propose we make ourselves into a swatting club i believe mr mason would be glad if we did im sure skeats would said another well there are six of us here suppose we agree that well stick to our work of an evening till weve got our lessons perfect for the next day wont taylor be mad when he finds it out said another but as taylor had offended them the suggestion added piquancy to the notion and so before they separated each pledged himself to join the new swatting club it was not an elegant name for a party of students to call themselves but the object of the combination was good and was warmly commended by the parents who were taken into the confidence of their sons if the little party of students thought they were going to have an easy time of it at school they were mistaken for taylor and the more popular party soon found out by the answers given in the classes what the new combination meant and he was more angry than ever a parcel of beggars who set themselves up to be gentlemen have no business at torringtons and the sooner they take themselves off the better he exclaimed angrily when discussing this new departure with a few of his chosen friends warren overheard what he said and was not averse to a duel of words with the cock of the walk who do you call gentlemen he demandedthose who live in glass houses and the son of a man who used to keep taylor did not wait to hear more before the objectionable word could be spoken warren received a blow that felled him to the ground it came so unexpectedly and was struck so unfairly that there was an instant cry of coward coward fight it fair and square all right let him come on said taylor but warren was in no fit condition to stand up to his antagonist just now for he had struck his head as he had fallen and lay for a minute or two quite unconscious some of the boys grew alarmed and all were glad to see the boy open his eyes and the colour slowly return to his face they were outside the school premises when the incident occurred and they all took care to walk away as quickly as they could lest the masters attention should be called to the quarrel and they be compelled to give an account of it which would not have been at all to their taste as they preferred to manage their own affairs in their own way with as little interference from the masters as possible in what they regarded as their own private business taylor was one of the first to walk off when he saw warren was getting better and the rest who had hoped to enjoy the spectacle of a fight were disappointed there were plenty to urge warren to take it out of taylor another day and plenty more to side with the bigger lad and urge him to have it out with warren for his cheek in daring to dispute the authority of the majority of the class and speak to the scholarship boy when he had been sent to coventry leonard morrison was one of the foremost in urging taylor to fight it out the school expects it of you urged leonard he said your father was shut up will you snarled taylor turning his angry gaze upon leonard if he has taken that fellow out of coventry it was a plucky thing to do in the face of the whole class and i like pluck he added though i may get the kicks it was plain that the cock of the walk was seriously hurt or alarmed by what warren had said for he ceased to crow as loudly as usual and walked home without noticing what his satellites said his eyes bent on the ground and evidently lost in thought over something that disturbed him more than the prospect of a fight with warren of course as this was the latest phase of the scholarship boy question it occupied more of the thought and attention than the earlier question and so horace walked into school the next morning chatting with one or two others and no protesting hisses were raised it was noticed that warren was not with him and he looked round anxiously from time to time in search of his friend but the day passed and he did not appear and the boys spirits were damped a little in consequence for they remembered now that they had heard that a blow on the head might prove dangerous to warren but to the relief of everybody the two friends were seen coming along the road together the next morning and when taylor appeared round a bend in the road warren walked up and joined him look here taylor i had no business to say what i did the other day for i cant fight you it seems my father has forbidden it because then you wont repeat what you said the other day interrupted taylor eagerly what do you take me for i should be a cad if i did besides i can see now that i have no business to blame you for whatno im not going to say anything he whispered in answer to taylors frown let every tub stand on its own bottom i say all right old fellow well let the matter drop then and mind mum is the word between us right you are said warren and then he ran off to join horace for he had drawn taylor aside to say this as neither of them wished their talk to be overheard whatever it might be that warren had heard concerning the antecedents of taylors family he could not be more sensitive upon the point than warren was over his inability to fight without danger to his life for a schoolboy to be told that he cannot stand up in a fair square fight without bringing the danger to his antagonist of being charged with manslaughter had brought such a shock to the boy that it was this rather than the effects of the fall that made his father forbid him going to school the previous day the lad had wondered how he was to get out of finishing the fight already begun and it demanded a greater amount of courage on his part to walk up to taylor and ask him to let the matter end where it was than to stand up before him for a turn at fisticuffs even with the almost dead certainty of getting the worst of it he had told his secret to horace as he came along glad of a confidant who would understand his difficulty and horace had counselled that he should make up his quarrel with taylor even though it involved throwing him over if taylor should make the demand warren shook his head i shant do that he said i think we shall find another way and you can tell the fellows we have agreed to cry quits but dont tell them i cant stand up and fight for fear the other fellow should get sent to prison afterwards thats the dreadful part about it and thats what my father says would be pretty sure to follow what an awful muff i must be sighed the boy worse than any girl but look here youve just done something that took a lot more courage of another sort said horace who was ready to make a hero of his new friend for managing the affair with taylor without throwing him over you did a plucky thing too speaking to me in the face of all the class oh that was just part of the fight that is in me i believe i was born a fighter and now for the sake of other people i must be mum and go through the world like a girl i dont know anything about girls i never had a sister so i cant tell what they are like but i know you will have plenty of the other sort of courage when it is wanted so you need not mind much if you cant fight with your fists they had reached the crowd of boys near the gate now and two or three pressed eagerly forward to know when and where the fight was to come off weve settled it now answered warren bosh dont believe it boys they are just going off to have it out by themselves youre not going to let warren off are you taylor shouted another lad as taylor appeared shut up and mind your own business and leave warren and me to settle our own affairs in our own way and having said this he pushed his way through the crowd and marched straight into school chapter vi for the honour of the school how is your friend warren today len asked mr morrison on the day when the boys thought the adjourned fight ought to have come off warrens no friend of mine now hes an awful sneak said leonard angrily he was greatly mystified over the fight not taking place for he intended to support taylor and at least do part of the cheering on his side and the collapse of the whole affair annoyed him and he chose to consider it was warrens fault he just funked it you know dad he said when he explained the matter to his father i dont know so much about that said mr morrison i met his father yesterday and he told me he had forbidden his son to engage in a fight either now or at any future time and i asked him if he thought his son would obey him yes i do he said and seemed quite confident that his boy would respect his wishes and i wondered whether he was right so warren junior refused to fight did he said mr morrison it was a plucky thing to do and i like a boy who can say no and stick to it the fellows are saying it was beastly mean of him and he funked it because taylor is a bigger fellow ah boys often jump to wrong conclusions it isnt the only plucky thing warren has done have you joined the swatting club yet my boy what did you say father asked leonard with widely opened eyes the formation of a swatting club is the last new move i hear at torringtons to swat is to study i understandis that right oh yes the word is right enough but who told you about it is it a secret then didnt you know about ithavent you been asked to join it no they wouldnt ask me it isnt likely for all the school know that i am trying to keep up the honour of torringtonskeep it from going to the dogs in fact said the boy loftily but with an angry tone in his voice i am glad to hear it len i was a torrington boy in my time and i love the old school still then father what did you send that beastly scholarship boy there for burst out leonard scarcely knowing what he said in his anger leonard leonard chided his mother i beg your pardon mother but it is what the fellows are always saying and i forgot but why should the boys be vexed that the county council chose to send one of the most promising of their scholars to that school has he done anything to offend you we dont give him the chance and we want you father to take him away at once dont you see the honour of the school is at stake and the fellows like curtis and taylor the doctor held up his hand to stop the boys angry flow of words we wont discuss those gentlemen if you please he said but they are always discussing it exclaimed leonard very foolish of them interrupted mr morrison but now tell me what you mean by the honour of the school and why this lad has endangered it he comes from a board school which of course is intended for poor common people answered the boy but poor common people must be taught you know and now if they possess the brains they have the right to learn to use them as well as those who are better off from dr masons report to the council this lad has given every satisfaction while he has been at the school and i had hoped that you would have made his acquaintance by this time and that i might have learned a little more about him from your point of view leonard shook his head you must go to warren for that he has chosen to take him up in defiance of the whole school andand he stopped dimly conscious that in his anger he had already said too much mr morrison was called away from the table at this point and leonard felt relieved that no further questions could be asked later he went to the little room where lessons were learned and found his sister sitting in her usual place mother wished me to come len she said in explanation of her presence all right duffynot that you are such a duffer he added and i shall try to find another name for you oh duffy will do dont waste your time thinking about another name for me whats in a name after all its what you are not what name you are called by i say what is this swatting club father has heard about you never told me about it never heard of it myself before wont taylor be mad when i tell him for if there is one thing he hates it is swat he says its low and vulgar and not fit for a school like torringtons but you know father doesnt think that and i am sure you ought to know that father is wiser than taylor if he is the biggest boy in the school as if that made any difference youre just as much of a duffer as ever to think such a thing he added well what is it about taylor that makes you call him the cock of the walk i met him at a party last week and i did not think much of him i can tell you ah thats because you are a girl and dont know anything taylor is a jolly fellow well im glad hes not my brother for he is not very kind to his sister and he was quite rude to his mother he is no gentleman and so he has no right to find fault with father because he sent a board school boy to sit with him at torringtons leonard only laughed at his sisters denunciation of his hero but he was curious to learn what had been said about this swatting clubwhether she had heard it spoken of before today i should like to know how long they have been at it and who are in it he said father said warren and the scholarship boy he was telling mother about it when you came in oh that scholarship boy is at the bottom of the whole mischief of course said leonard but i should like to know how many more are in it its no good going to taylor with half a tale wont he be mad when he hears of this last move warren is forbidden to fight too i wonder why that is something wrong with his head i shouldnt wonder added leonard after a minutes thought why what makes you think that asked florence because when taylor knocked him down the other day he lay still as though he were dead for a minute or two and never turned up at school all the next day what larks if he cant fight ill put taylor on to that and see what he can make of it len how can you like to do such mean things i wish father had not told you about it but of course he never thought you were going to peach to the rest of the school about it and especially to that vulgar thing taylor now duffy that vulgar thing is your brothers chosen friend so of course you dont like him for ive noticed lately that if i like anything or anybody you take a dislike to them directly yes because the things and the people you like are never nice mother was saying the other day she hoped you would not grow up like somebody she knew i did not hear his name but she sighed as she said it and father did not smile or say anything when he heard her say it look here duffy you need not talk about those sort of things i shall grow up all right never fear what i want to know is who are in the swatting lot besides warren and the scholarship boy find that out for me will you no indeed i will not unless you promise to join them and i dont believe you mean to do that although you know father would like it i wonder whether he joined a swatting club when he went to torringtons rejoined leonard i will ask him when he comes home replied his sister now i must begin my lessons i have done them better lately my governess says and if i only work steadily on i shall get a prize at christmas her brother whistled halfacrown book for six months work that game dont pay except for duffers he said in a tone of contempt i would rather be a duffer than some people who think themselves so clever now dont hinder me but get on with your own lessons and let me learn mine said his sister swat swat swat with fingers and brain and pen sung her brother while florence propped her head on her hands and stared at her book then the door opened and mrs morrison appeared lenny i want to have a little talk with you playing again my boy i knew some one else who chose to play a great deal of his time away at school but he has bitterly repented it since perhaps you had better take your books up to your own room dear she said turning to florence i thought you might help each other if you did them together again but when i heard lenny singing i knew it was no good mrs morrison said that while florence was gathering up her books and when she had gone upstairs she took her seat facing leonard and had a long talk with him she told him what his father had heard concerning one portion of the school that it was becoming almost lawless in its determination not to learn more than the masters could force upon them he told you too that he heard today of a few boys who had separated themselves from this party and were determined to profit by the instruction given and learn the home lessons to the best of their ability mrs morrison saw leonards lip curl as she spoke in admiration of these lads theyre just a set of cads he muttered under his breath no they are not and it is your fathers wish and mine too that you should join this section of the school and learn your home lessons as well as you possibly can we do all we can to help you and florence is quite willing to come back and do her lessons here if you do not hinder her now will you promise me lenny to turn over a new leaf and set your mind steadily to the tasks that may be set for you instead of wasting your time in play as you have done lately i dont mind doing my lessons grunted leonard ungraciously but i dont see why father should want me to join that scholarship lot at school he wishes it because they are a steady set of lads and you are easily led into mischief by your companions what mischief have i done angrily demanded the boy well i dont know that there has been any particular mischief admitted his mother but your father is not very satisfied with the way things have been going on at school lately you know the last report was far from satisfactory and your father said you were just wasting your time instead of learning all you could now promise me dear that you will make a new beginning leonard stared at his book and drummed on the table in silence and mrs morrison feeling that she had said enough for once rose and left the room she hoped that leonard would think over what she had said and act upon it although he had not given the promise that she asked she went back to the drawingroom and sat down to think and her thoughts wandered to that brother whom her son so strangely resembled and she prayed that god would save her boy from wrecking his life and bringing misery to his friends as this beloved brother had done now leonard chose to be half offended over what his mother had said to him mother wants me to be like a duffing girl he whispered to himself as she left the room i wonder who it is she was telling me about somebody who has got himself into a nice scrape and been obliged to leave england it was a nice thing to be told i was like this scapegrace he muttered but in spite of his anger he did manage to learn something of his lessons that night before he went to bed and he might have got on fairly well in class if he had not met taylor early in his walk to school taylor was brimming over with the importance of a piece of news he had heard what do you think morrison there are a lot of sneaks in the school who have set up a swatting club without saying a word to us about it yes i know my pater has heard of it and wants me to join it youll never do it morrison exclaimed the elder lad not if i know it what do you take me for isnt it enough to be worried by the masters no thank you im going to stick to my friends yes and you must fight with them too unless you want to see torringtons ruined as a school for gentlemen thats what my pater says and i guess he knows as much as most he has made his pile means i shall be a gentleman and that is all he cares for lessons be blowed theyre all very well for scholarship boys and such cads your father ought to be ashamed of himself ever to have sent that board school boy among gentlemen and the beggar will have to go leonard did not reply for he did not like to hear any action of his father blamed and so he walked along in silence while taylor poured out further angry denunciations until the school was reached during the course of the class lessons that morning it became very evident that there was a dividing line between those who had carefully studied their subjects and the rest of the class warren howard and seven or eight other lads held the top part of the class in all subjects and taylor morrison and the rest of that part kept steadily at the bottom ive had enough of this said taylor when they came into the playground after dinner that scholarship boy is at the bottom of the whole thing and we must get rid of him youve said that before grumbled curtis yes i know i have and i hoped morrison would persuade his pater to do the job for us as he brought him in but it dont seem as though he was going to move in the matter and so i shall and little morrison must help me but what are you going to do asked leonard thats my business all youve got to do is what i tell you and to ask no questions curtis lifted his sleepy eyes and looked at taylor with a little more interest what is it to be he asked well i mean to stink him out it will all be done up in the stinkery the stinkeryor stinkroom to give it its proper titlewas a small sliproom divided from the laboratory by a close wooden partition with several ventilating shafts under which noisomesmelling chemicals could be used without causing any annoyance to the students working in the general laboratory that scholarship boy shall have enough of his precious slops ill let skeats know whether he shall favour a fellow because the rest of us have sent him to coventry why what has skeats done asked one of the lads for the science master was a favourite among most of the boys cant you see what hes doing every day that sneak from the board school pretends to have an idea whatever that may be and goes talking to old skeats about it and so he lets him go up to the lab every dinnertime to work at it dont you see the little game we cant make him feel he is in coventry if he is taken out of our way but i am going to upset this family party and i mean little morrison shall help me its only fair as his father brought the fellow here that he should be used to get rid of him what do you want me to do asked leonard turning pale and heartily wishing himself out of the way why you shall get the stuff we want your father is a doctor and so it will be easy enough but the pater does not keep a store of chemicals said leonard who said he did i said he was a doctor and i suppose you cant deny that can you leonard looked offended and was turning away but taylor soon fetched him back look here little morrison its no good funking you can do this job better than anybody else and youve got to do it i dont want you to steal your fathers stuff but you must get two of his bottles and go to get what i shall tell you and if the people at the drug store ask you whether it is for your father why of course you must say yes now mind mum must be the word for im not going to tell all the crowd what im going to do curtis is going to find half the money and ill find the other half heres half a sovereign i dont know what the things will cost any more than the man in the moon but i shall want the things i have put down in this paper and tell them to fasten them down tight so that they dont leak out for youll have to keep em in your bag till i can use em tomorrow must i get them tonight asked leonard wishing he could tell taylor he would not do it yes you must answered the cock of the walk in a masterful tone now mind you dont lose the money and be sure you bring the right chemicals chapter vii news for mrs morrison oh dear how late you are for luncheon it always happens so if i want you to come home early cant help it my dear said dr morrison as he began to take off his coat but his wife was too impatient to let him do it this time come in here while they put luncheon on the table she said and she drew him into the little room i have had a letter guess who it is from but dr morrison shook his head i am too hungry to guess anything he said is it from the man in the moon almost as wonderful said the lady it is from dick dear old dick i feel ready to jump for joy the doctor stood still and looked at his wife in blank amazement from dick your brother dick he said at last oh dear dont speak like that as though the poor fellow had ever done anything wicked i have heard you say many times that he was only weak not wicked yes yes i know he is only weak only too ready to say yes and be led into mischief when he ought to say no and stand to it think what his easygoing ways have cost us no no i cant think of that now interrupted the lady i can only remember that he is my only brother and i want you to take me to him at once i have not seen him for five years she added and he begs that you will go to him at once because he has a friend with him who needs your attention at once he says he met with him out in the wilds of australia and he has been the best friend he ever hadthat this mr howard has saved him body and soul but he has fallen ill through disappointment at not receiving a letter from his wife as soon as he landed that he has not heard from her for years because he had to leave england in a hurry a great many years ago why that might be written of dick himself said the doctor with a smile birds of a feather you know the old proverb oh but dick must have altered i am sure for he says that he and mr howard have both worked very hard and made a moderate fortune or they would not have come home to england again that is not like the old dick is it no my dear for he generally let other people do the hard work while he dreamed of what he would like to do but now let me see this letter luncheon is served maam said the housemaid tapping at the door at this moment the doctor and his wife were to have the meal alone today and so the servants service was dispensed with that they might discuss this wonderful letter for wonderful it was even the doctor had to confess when he had read it there was far more about his friend whose wife and family he was anxious to find than there was about the writer himself but the most interesting piece of information was in the postscript my friend has just heard that his wife went to live in the neighbourhood of your town can you make inquiries she has two sons frederick and horace the latter would be about thirteen i think the doctor dropped the letter and gazed at his wife i wonder whether it is the father of that scholarship boy he almost gasped what scholarship boy asked mrs morrison impatiently why the one that was sent from the board school to torringtons his father was entered as a traveller i believe and he was said to be abroad my dear put your things on and we will drive round and see this mrs howard she lives at that oldfashioned cottage just outside the town oh but i want to go and see dick said the lady and we will go if possible but i shall have to see warren first and we must do as dick wishes and inquire for his friends wife before we go dr morrison was not a man to let the grass grow under his feet and so the carriage was ordered at once and in half an hour they were on their way to the cottage a very few words convinced the doctor that he had found the lady he was seeking and when she had read all that was said about her husband she readily agreed to go with the doctor and mrs morrison to london while the doctor went to his friend warren she wrote a letter explaining something of what had happened and that she was going with dr morrison to london this she sent by a messenger to fred at his work asking him to tell horace something of what had occurred and also to meet his brother when he came home to tea fred was not a little puzzled when he received this letter but he asked to be allowed to leave a little earlier and so managed to reach home just as horace appeared at the bend of the lane i tried to get here before you but you were too quick for me he said when his brother rushed in at the garden gate wheres mother asked horace when he saw fred take the streetdoor key from his pocket come indoors and ill tell you all i know let me light the fire first he added fred had learned to be very handy about the house and he soon had the fire blazing under the kettle and while it boiled he told horace that a letter had been sent to him early in the afternoon from his mother saying that she had just received news of his father who was ill in london dr morrison came and told her all about it and he has gone to london with her dr morrison repeated horace why morrison is in my class at school and the doctor is his father i know what sort of a fellow is young morrison asked fred he was handing cups and saucers to horace who was setting them ready for tea oh morrison is all right said horace who was clattering the cups and saucers for he did not want to discuss his school troubles with his brother i dont see much of him because he likes to go with the bigger boys i say fred do you remember our father said horace hes been gone away such a long time we used to have a nice house and servants when he stayed at home with us didnt we then you remember him horry said fred but horace shook his head no i dont remember a bit about him only that we had a nice house a long time ago well i only remember a little said fred but i know he was a tall gentleman and i think he was a doctor he went away to travel i have heard mother say and she thought he must be dead until dr morrison came this afternoon i have brought home some sausages announced fred who wanted to change the conversation he knew so little and remembered so little about his father and those former days but as he had grown older he had grown angry that his father should leave his mother as he had without causeso far as fred knewand without explanation he had heard and simply gone abroad to travel leaving them to battle with poverty as they could as time went on he had spoken less and less of his father but he had become certain that there must have been some cause for his fathers disappearance though his mother might not know it but in his own mind there was a lurking fear that some disgrace might lie hidden below the long silence and so as soon as tea was over he said i am going out to get some things for breakfast so horace was left to the comfort of his books and the study of his lessons when leonard reached home that same afternoon florence met him with the information that father and mother had both gone out and mary the housemaid did not know what time they would be home where have they gone asked leonard for it was a rare occurrence for both to be away at the same time florence shook her head mary says that james was sent with a letter to mr warren and so i should think father had asked him to look after some of his patients very likely answered her brother and then he took his satchel to the little room where lessons were studied and sat down to think he did not know whether he was glad or sorry to hear that his father had gone out as he came along he had made up his mind that it would be impossible to get bottles from his fathers dispensingroom for he was never allowed to go there and it was just possible that his father had locked the door before going out in which case he could tell taylor that it was impossible to get the chemicals for him and there would be an end of it but although he said this he knew there would not be an end of it and if he refused at last to get what was wanted he would be sent to coventry at least by those whose society he desired so after washing his hands before going to tea he went to the dispensingroom to find out whether the door could be opened and found that it yielded at once he went in and closed the door lest one of the servants should come that way and see him when they would be sure to remind him that he was not allowed to go there after closing the door he looked round to see what he could find and there by the sink was a row of glassstoppered bottles evidently filled with water for washing them he selected two that he thought would hold about half a pint each and pouring out the water he took them to the study and hid them in a corner out of sight in case florence should decide to do her lessons with him this evening but it seemed as though everything was to favour him in what he knew was wrongdoing his sister told him at teatime that she must do her lessons in her own room for she had an extra piece of history to study as she was working for the history prize to be given at christmas oh all right said leonard with his mouth full of bread and jam its all a girl can do i suppose get a prize now and then you cant do that if you are a boy retorted florence and then there was a little more sparring and wrangling until the housemaid appeared to clear the table florence went upstairs to her lesson then and leonard sauntered off to the little study and lighted the gas for it was getting dusk when the gas was lighted he went to look at his bottles and then saw in the corner near where he had hidden them an old leather bag of his fathers he remembered now that he had been told he might have it for his books when the satchel was worn out and he decided to take it at once this is good fortune indeed taylor says hell take care nobody finds out if i only get the stuff there taylor is a smart fellow and so is his father or he could not have made a big fortune in a year or two as taylor says he did my dad wont make one in a lifetime im afraid and i shall just have to go plodding on at hard work unless i can learn a thing or two from taylor byandby while he had been speaking to himself he had been wrapping each bottle up separately in a piece of old newspaper and putting them into the bag then he took the written paper given him by taylor and the halfsovereign and decided to go at once and get his bottles filled he must tell the chemist to seal the stoppers down securely or there would be such a smell from the bag that it would betray them before it could be got into the stinkery at school he put a book in the bag as well as the bottles so that if his sister should discover that he had been out he could say he had been to borrow a book from one of his schoolfellows he went out by the back gate for he did not want anyone to know he was going if he could help it and florence might hear him shut the front door he knew where to go and as he brought his fathers private bottles and halfasovereign to pay for what he had the chemist served him without demur he wondered a little what the doctor could want the chemicals for but reflected that as leonard was old enough to sign his poisonbook in the regular way and as mr morrison was a wellknown practitioner in the town there could be no harm done in letting him have what he wanted so leonard walked home in triumph with the bottles securely wrapped up in the bag on his way back he met taylor walking arminarm with curtis and both smoking cigarettes hullo little morrison he said in a patronising tone as leonard stopped them for they would have passed without noticing him this is a piece of luck exclaimed the boy you can take the bag now taylor the bottles and stuff are in it safe enough what bottles what stuff he said stepping back a pace as if the proffered bag would bite him you know what it is said leonard in a tone of surprise oh no i dont i know nothing until you bring me the stuff i told you about tata little morrison dont forget the bag in the morning and the cock of the walk and his friend went on their way laughing leaving the boy transfixed with anger and amazement his first thought was that he would go and throw the bottles in the canal just as they were give taylor the change out of the halfsovereign and tell him where he would find the bottles if he wanted them he went so far as to walk down the canal road but his courage evaporated before he had gone any distance and although he was still very angry over the treatment he had received from his chosen friend he turned his steps homeward still carrying the bottles but half decided that he would not take them to taylor in the morning as he was going in at the back gate one of the servants met him dear me mr leonard how you made me jump theres a telegram come for you and miss florence has been hunting all over the house to find you for the boy said he was to wait for an answer the importance of having a telegram sent to him soothed leonards ruffled feelings and he hurried in to find his sister and learn what the message could be mother and i cannot come home tonightcoming tomorrow this was what the mysterious yellow envelope contained by way of a message and leonard read it with florence looking over his shoulder theres no answer to go back said leonard when he saw mary looking at him go and tell the boy father has just sent to say that he is not coming home tonight and then he went and carried the bag to the little room leaving florence to read the telegram over for her own satisfactionas if that would give her any more information she followed her brother to the study and said where do you think they have gone len how can i tell i never heard of a rich uncle did you his sister shook her head daddy was an only son i know she said but i think mother had a brother was he a millionaire asked leonard he was a doctor which is quite as good i am sure for that is flo youre a duffer interrupted her brother theres nothing like millionaires in these days and so i hope this uncle whoever he may be has made his pile and will leave it all to us but you dont know it is an uncle they have gone to see father had friends in london and this telegram came from westminster and i know that is in london well we shall hear all about it when they come i dare say now run away little girl for i want to get on with my lessons now i have got the book i wanted oh that was what you wanted you boys are so careless it is a good job you can borrow of each other and florence went away leaving leonard to do his lessons or reflect upon the strange events of the evening after a few angry thoughts concerning taylor and his behaviour towards him that evening he began wondering once more whether it was an uncle his parents had gone to see and then whether he was rich and would make them wealthy too he had never thought so much of money and what it could do for its possessor until lately but taylor and curtis both belonged to wealthy families and he thought of what they could do he called to mind the halfsovereign and the cigarettes he had seen them smoking and he had no doubt they were going to a famous billiardroom in the town billiards cigars and halfsovereigns made up an entrancing picture to the boy and he sat and dreamed of these things and wished he had plenty of money until half the evening was gone and although he declined to go to bed at the usual hour he only half knew his lessons when he did go the next morning he started for school in good time for fear he should miss taylor and be compelled to have those bottles on his mind all the morning but taylor was looking out for him at the corner of the road where they usually met he was in a different mood this morning and flattered and praised the lad for having got the chemicals without anyone finding out what he had done you carry the bag to the gate and ill take it of you there and no one will ever see those bottles again i can promise you but how are you going to manage asked leonard oh i have made my plans i have to work in the stinkery this morning so the thing will be easy enough when i have once got your bottles up in the lab and theyll go in my pockets for me to take them up there oh never fear we shall get rid of that board school beggar this time for skeats is awfully particular about his stuff and hell never forgive him for using chemicals like these away from the stinkery i know where to put them till i want them so you can give them to me in a minute and i will put them into the pockets of this dustcoat i am carrying i brought it with me on purpose leonard breathed a sigh of relief when the bottles were safely transferred from the bag to the inside pockets of the fashionable coat if the stopper should come out of that bottle of sulphuric acid your coat wont be worth much he said as taylor swung the coat over his arm the stoppers are all right i can see he said but still he carried the coat carefully and went at once to hang it up when he got to the school the laboratory had been built at a later date than the main body of the school and was reached by a flight of steps from the playground the room below it was used for coats and hats and other impedimenta the boys might bring with them each boy having his own peg and place on the shelf for bag or lunch basket they passed through this room on their way to the laboratory and so it would be easy for taylor to take down his coat and carry it up with him when he went for his practical chemistry lesson and he did this without any notice being aroused among the other boys at twelve oclock when school was over the science master went to the playground to look for howard who was eating his sandwiches as he walked up and down you wont be long before you go up to the laboratory i suppose howard he said when he saw the lad no sir im going in a minute said the boy i have left three boys there finishing their work just see they leave their things all right when you go in horace frequently performed such small services for the science master and readily promised to do this but just as mr skeats turned away warren came up and the two stood talking for two or three minutes before howard went to the laboratory he ran up the steps and was surprised to find the door closed but not locked as boys usually locked it when they were left to do some work after school hours when he opened the door he was struck by the peculiar smell of almonds that pervaded the place he closed the door but did not lock it i say what have you fellows been using he said as he went to the further end of the room there lay one boy stretched out on the floor near a bench and close to another lay a second he tried to rouse the one nearest to him and then seized him by the legs and dragged him across the room out on to the landing there he shouted help help and ran back to pull out the others for he knew the deadly nature of that almondlike smell he managed to get another to the door where he would get fresh air and then returned for the third he found him lying near the stinkery and thought he would open that door for the better ventilation of the outer room but as he passed his own bench which stood near he was overpowered by the fumes pouring out of a flask standing there from which acid also was boiling over on to the bench and floor he reeled and before he could reach the door fell insensible to the ground one hand falling helplessly into the pool of burning liquid there but by this time the fresh air had revived the first boy he had dragged out and he called to a lad in the playground whats the row said warrenfor it happened to be that young gentleman oh what a stink he said the next minute and putting his head in he saw howard and the other lad lying on the floor at the further end of the room he knew that the fumes were dangerous and stuffing his pockethandkerchief into his mouth and up his nostrils he dashed in and tried to drag both boys at once to the door but had to drop one just as mr skeats rushed up he picked up horace and carried him down and then sent for the head master and other lads to carry out those who although somewhat revived were still lying on the landing at the top of the steps you must have a doctor sir said warren pushing his way through the crowd of boys who had gathered round to know what was the matter yes yes said the master and warren rushed off to the gate and ran hastily down the road he knew his father was often in the neighbourhood about that time of the day and to his great joy he saw him driving in his gig the boy ran and shouted and speedily attracted the doctors attention when his son shouted something wrong in the lab he ran into the playground and there halfadozen voices called they have carried them all to the masters house here he found two of the boys wellnigh recovered but the third one was still unconscious and horace seemed even worse his hand and arms were badly burned with the acid and there were splashes of it on his face the masters were doing what they could to get the deadly poison out of his lungs but it seemed as though horace and the third lad had inhaled so much of the gas that all their efforts were in vain the doctor looked grave when mr skeats told him the boys had been breathing hydrocyanic acid gas the application of artificial respiration was redoubled but it was not until nearly four oclock that horace began to revive and what leonard felt during those awful hours of suspense could be better imagined than described the laboratory had been locked up as soon as it was known what had happened so that the affair might be inquired into no boy was allowed to go home either although taylor had complained of being very ill and had wanted to leave early not until it was known that horace was out of all immediate danger was there a word spoken and then dr mason said i am ready to hear any explanation that you may wish to give me as to the cause of what has happened i have heard all about the attendant circumstances and the rescue of these lads what i want to know is who caused the disaster not a sound broke the silence of the school when the doctor had said this leonard was ready to tell of his share in the affair but as he glanced at taylor he received such a look of warning as made him cower in his seat and the school broke up wondering what would happen next chapter viii righteous retribution warren volunteered the information that howards mother had gone away from home and only his elder brother could take care of him if he was sent there so that it was decided that he should remain in the masters house for the present and warren went to let fred know that his brother would not be home all night why what is the matter asked the young carpenter anxiously there was something wrong in the lab this dinnertime nobody knows just how it happened but therell be a jolly row about it tomorrow i know i hope horace had nothing to do with it said fred oh didnt he though three boys would soon have been dead if he hadnt gone in thats how he got hurt you can go and see him my father says only you mustnt talk much fred was not long getting his tea he was too anxious to go and hear more of what had happened to his brother but he took care to wash himself and change his working clothes before presenting himself at the masters house he found horace in bed with both hands bandaged and looking very pale he was able to tell him what had happened but begged him not to say a word about it to his mother as he felt sure he should be quite well in the morning fred hardly knew what to do but at length agreed not to say a word about it when he wrote to his mother when he had nearly reached his own home he saw a boy waiting near the gate and he said are you howards brother yes who are you asked fred my name is morrison and i want to know if you think he will get well again i hope so but why are you so anxious about it do you know how it happened leonard nodded i know a bit said the boy sheepishly and i wondered whether id better tell my father yes yestell him by all means said fred eagerly come in a minute and if you like i will go home with you and break the ice ive always been in the habit of telling my mother when i got into a scrape but it made it a bit easier if horace told her something about it first so i know how you feel about telling your father we didnt mean to hurt the fellows you know said leonard eagerly as he went into the little sittingroom we didnt mean to hurt anybody only make a jolly stink in the lab and get somebody into a row he did not say who the somebody was and fred did not ask him they went away together and walked almost in silence for fred did not like to press the boy to tell him any more it was a long walk round to leonards home but fred did not mind and if the doctor had got back he might hear of his mother and something of what had happened since she had been gone for he had not had a letter from her as he had expected when they got to the doctors house and fred asked to see him the servant said he had only just come home and she was not sure that he could see anybody i think he will see me if you tell him that my name is howard said fred i have come to see him about my brother who was hurt at school today the doctor was certainly mystified as to the meaning of the last part of the message but he was glad to see fred for he had promised his mother he would see him as soon as possible the doctor rose from his seat and took freds hands as he entered the room i am very glad to see you i have some wonderful news for you i left your father a few hours ago your mother wished me to tell you do you remember your father yes sir a little answered fred quite forgetting what he actually had come for you do remember him repeated the doctor i know he was a gentleman said fred a little proudly yes he has proved himself a steadfast godfearing humble christian a true gentleman in these later years said mr morrison and i have promised him and your mother too that you shall hear something of what those years have been but i should like to know first why he went away and left us all alone said fred with reddening brow it was not fair to my mother or to any of us and i am not sure that i shall ever want to see him again and then the tears filled freds eyes sit down my lad said the doctor your father knew that you must feel angry at what has happened and to use his own words he does not deserve anything else at your hands but i was to tell his story in as few words as possible and leave the rest to you some time before he went away he had a patient named taylor he seems to have been a very fascinating sort of man and your father was not a very strong one through this man he neglected his practice a great dealhe was a doctor you knowhis friend always seemed to have plenty of money and they went about the country a good deal together enjoying themselves doing no great harm beyond your father neglecting his work and you at home this lasted for some time and then one day his friend begged him as a great favour to sign his name to a bill of course by doing this your father became responsible for the whole amount of the debt if his friend should fail to repay it within the time named but he had such confidence in mr taylor and believed all he said about the wealth coming to him that he signed it after a little persuasion although it was for a very large amount of money he never told your mother of this transaction because he knew she disliked and mistrusted this taylor a few days before this bill became due your father found to his dismay that his friend had disappeared from his london house and no one knew where he had gone still your father said no word to your mother of what had happened but when he was served with the notice that he must now pay the debt he was seized with panic at the thought of the ruin he had brought upon himself and family and instead of bravely staying to do what he could to help those who were dependent upon him he went out one morning and took a passage to australia by a vessel that was just leaving the docks it must be said in excuse for him that just at the time there was a great talk of the rapid fortunes that were being made in the goldfields and he had heard that taylor had gone there to make his fortune i need hardly tell you that he did not see his false friend again although he heard of him more than once during his wanderings in the wilds of australia he wrote one short letter telling your mother he would come home as soon as he had made his fortune and he resolved in his own mind not to do so until he had accomplished this for only in this way he thought he could atone for the past and prove that he was worthy of her confidence for the future but he found the task much harder than he had supposed and instead of making his fortune at the goldfields he was robbed of the little he possessed and was glad to get any sort of work that would provide him with a crust of bread then he met with mrs morrisons brother who was not unlike himself in many respectseasily led weak to resist temptationbut in the hard school of affliction to which they had condemned themselves god met them and showed them the folly and sin of which they had been guilty and they sought and found pardon through the lord jesus christ then through the help of gods holy spirit they began to struggle against the temptations by which they were beset and in the struggle grew strong strong enough to resist even the making of illegal gains and so the fortune that was to restore them to home and country was a long time in the making and meanwhile they clung to each other and to god but my father might have written to us said fred still a little hardly they both wrote to their nearest friends in england but you must remember that your mother had left london and i had left liverpool where i was living when my brotherinlaw went away so both letters were returned and the wanderers could only work on in faith and hope that one day god would bring them to their dear ones again fred had listened with the greatest intentness to the doctors story and now he roused himself remembering that the errand he had come upon had not yet been mentioned thank you dr morrison he said for telling me this but i cannot help thinking still that my father has been very cruel to us although he may not have intended it but i came to see you about something else you have a son who goes to school with my brother horace has been hurt somehow and is in bed at the masters house your son wishes me to tell you that he knows something of what happened he did not mean to hurt anybody but three boys might have died through what was done ah that is just it boys never intend wilfully to hurt each other i believe and it is only rarely that men do so but they do it through their weakness and thoughtlessness and bring untold misery upon friends and all who love them your fathers spoiled life and my brotherinlaws almost wasted one should teach all you lads a lesson ask god to make you strong to resist the first temptationstrong in the strength of the lord jesus christ for this alone can help you in the hour of trial and remember that this time of trial must come to you sooner or later and the sooner it comes in life the better if only you go to the strong for strength to sustain you then the doctor rang the bell and told the servant to send leonard to him fred rose to go but the doctor told him to sit down again well get this business over while you are here he said and when leonard appeared he said my friend mr fred howard says you have something to tell me yes he is my friend and i trust that you will make him yours also if he will accept the friendship of a boy like you said the doctor answering the look of perplexity on leonards face this lads father has saved your uncles life more than once it seems while you have nearly killed his brother is that true leonard hung his head and the tears slowly gathered in his eyes did mr warren tell you that father he said with a gasp i have not seen warren yet said dr morrison what is it you have to tell me do not be afraid i want to hear all the truth from you now what is it you have to tell me len said the doctor in a more tender tone i hear you have got into some scrape at school and somebody has got hurt yes father the scholarship boy and i was afraid he might die well what was your share of the mischief did you really wish your schoolfellow to die father we didnt mean to hurt him really we only wanted to drive him away from the school and then bit by bit mr morrison heard the whole story of what had been going on at torringtons for the last few months fred was as much astonished as mr morrison my brother never said a word about it at home he said your brother has the brave gallant spirit of a gentleman said the doctor but what am i to say of my son and his cowardly companions go to your room sir he said addressing leonard for he was very angry but mr morrison that he should wish to come and tell you of it before it is known at the school who has done it should not be forgotten said fred pleadingly certainly certainly it is something as you say answered mr morrison but in truth he felt overwhelmed just now as fred was leaving a servant from dr masons arrived with a note asking that mr morrison would bring his son and be at the school by nine oclock mason has found out all about it i expect he said as he read the note he gave orders for his carriage to be ready by halfpast eight the following day for he had a great deal to do before he started for london in the evening he went to see leonard in his own room before he went to bed and then told him something of his uncles life and why it was that he wished to befriend horace howard his fathers talk made a deep impression on the boys mind mamma told me something of this once but she did not say the somebody was my uncle my boy she loved this brother as florrie loves you and how could she tell you all the miserable tale oh papa i am so sorry what can i do to make you believe that i do mean to try and do right always for the future i wish i could do something for that poor horace his hands are awfully bad and he wont be able to use them for ever so long theres nobody to take care of him at home either dont you think he might come here papa dr morrison looked at leonard and breathed a sigh of relief my boy could i trust you to be good to him if i fetched him here tomorrow yes yes papa indeed i will try to make it up to him if you will let him come i am so sorry i did not know it was going to be so bad until i heard mr skeats say he wondered they were not dead that was why i wanted to see howards brother i knew he was the worst and i wanted them to know that i did not mean really to hurt him i can quite believe and sincerely hope that this will be a lesson you will never forget through your whole life but if i forgive you it is more than you can expect dr mason to do i almost wonder he has not put it into the hands of the police and had you all arrested the punishment will be severe i have no doubt it ought to be to make an impression upon the school and remember whatever it may be i shall expect you to bear it patiently and bravely i forgive you but i shall not seek to lessen the punishment your schoolmaster may inflict now go to sleep as soon as you can and i will take you to school in the carriage with me in the morning dr morrison was compelled to pay a visit to a patient on his way to the school the next day so that when they arrived they found all the school assembled in the hall prayers were just over and when leonard entered with his father he was directed to take his place beside taylor and curtis who were standing in front of the platform where dr mason and the other masters were sitting his father was asked to take a seat there beside two other gentlemen whom he afterwards heard were mr curtis and mr taylor who had come to hear what their sons were charged with it might have been manslaughter said dr mason severely when one of the gentlemen asked this question rather angrily last night before we separated i asked if anyone wanted to make a statement about this matter said the master addressing the school no one answered then now it is too late and i can tell you myself all that happened when the chemistry class left the laboratory yesterday morning mr skeats left three boys to finish what they were doing believing that they were the only lads there just after he had gone they heard the stinkchamber door opened and taylor put something down on howards bench which is close to that door they took no notice of this at first until the peculiar odour arrested their attention then one of them went round to see what it was but coming in closer contact with the fumes was overcome by them and fell down unconscious soon a second fell at his bench and the third fell just as howard opened the laboratory door and called to them none were able to answer but he pulled two out on to the landing and then went back for the third but fell unconscious himself close to his own bench and near the lad he was trying to save fortunately his cry for help was heard and both lives were saved i am thankful to say although howard has been burned a great deal with the acid of the poison there was a dead silence throughout the school while the master was speaking after a pause he said i do not suppose that either taylor curtis or morrison knew what their act would be likely to cause i am sure they were ignorant of the danger they caused to three or four of their schoolfellows but i do know that for some time past these boys have been persecuting one of their companions and this sort of thing shall never be allowed at this school therefore to save this school from future disgrace and trouble i am compelled to expel from the school those who have been the ringleaders in this persecution taylor curtis your names will be removed from the school roll and never again will you be admitted as scholars of torringtons school morrison has been greatly to blame in the part he has taken in this business but taking into consideration that he made a full confession to his father last night of all he had done added to the fact that he is a younger and weaker boy than the others i shall suspend him from attending this school for six months and if at the end of that time he can bring a certificate of good conduct from any other school he may possibly be reinstated at torringtons the honour of the school demands that these punishments should be strictly adhered to the master sat down and before a boy could leave his place dr morrison sprang to his feet dr mason i am an old torrington boy he said and i thank you with all my heart for defending the honour of the dear old school my son is one of the culprits and i thank you in his name for giving him another chance to retrieve his character i shall send him for the six months to one of the board schools in the town where i hope and trust he may earn the right to come among you once more and bring no further disgrace upon torringtons school the other two gentlemen did not say a word they were exceedingly angry with the culprits but could not complain that the master had been unduly severe with them before they left dr mason said that he must charge them with the cost of a new suit of clothes for horace those he was wearing yesterday are burned into holes so that the poor lad has nothing to wear when he is able to get up said dr mason i will see to that said dr morrison i understand you are going to charge yourself with the care of the lad until he is well said the master i like justice all round and it is only fair these gentlemen should buy the boy a new suit will you leave me to order it he said addressing the two yes yes of course and we will pay the bill both answered in a breath now morrison you can go and tell the lad that he will soon have some new clothes for i understand that is the chief trouble with him this morningthat he has spoiled his best jacket and burned holes in his trousers mrs mason will give you something to take him home in and i think it will do both lads good to know more of each other the wisest thing you could do is what you have decided upon for leonard and i hope i shall see him back at torringtons at the end of six months mr morrison found fred was with his brother but he readily agreed to his being taken home by the doctor horace himself did not know what to make of it fred had just told him what he had heard from dr morrison about his father and now the doctor assured him that leonard was very anxious to make up to him for all the unkindness he had been guilty of in the past for our fathers sake you ought to give him this chance said fred for he knew he could not give his brother the care he needed thank you doctor i will go with you said horace just as he was being wrapped up mr warren came in to see his patient and was glad to learn that he was going home with dr morrison you will let warren come and see me wont you said horace yes yes send him by all means and i shall be glad if you can look in upon him yourself tomorrow for i am obliged to go to london this evening so that he must be left to the tender mercies of len and the servants for a day or two horace was carried to the carriage where leonard was seated shedding a few quiet tears over the folly that had gained for him this suspension for the honour of the school still he was thankful that he was allowed a chance of return and resolved to do all he couldeven in a board schoolto earn the right to go back at the end of six months he was glad enough to have horace seated beside him and the first words he said were i hope you will forgive me for being such a fool we must be friends you know and i hope to come back to torringtons with you byand by yes yes we will be good friends if you like said horace with the tears shining in his eyes only i dont know what my mother will say when she comes home oh that will be all right answered leonard your mother has gone to london with my mother i dare say we shall know all about it presently but father is too busy now for he is going to london again this evening and so i shall have to take care of you until he comes back well ask warren to come and see us as well because i know you like warren this last proposal cost leonard the most for he wanted horace to like him now but it was a proof to mr morrison that his son had learned to conquer himself and he had more hope for him now than he had since he first heard of this school scandal the doctor had taken care to say as little as possible to the two boys about the fortune mr howard had made while he was away and it had made so little impression upon horace that when mr morrison came back from london the next day and told him that his mother wanted him to go to the seaside as soon as he was able to go horace looked at him in mute wonder could his mother afford to send him to the seaside he wondered and he resolved to ask fred what he thought about it when he came his brother came to sit with him for an hour every evening and as soon as they were left to themselves that night horace said have you heard that mother wants us to go to the seasideleonard and you and i what does it mean fred has mother got money enough now to spend it like that i suppose she has said fred with something like a sigh but i am not sure that it is going to make us any happier horry he added well i suppose that will depend upon what we do with it wont it said horace simply well then i dont know that i shall let them spend any of it on me said fred in an angry tone then you wont let mother be happy though she may have more money and not have to work for it now now horace you know it is on mothers account that i feel as i do it was unkind and cruel of father to go away and leave her as he did for years and years though he was making a fortune for us i tell you that money has been bought too dearly and for mothers sake i dont feel as though i could touch a penny of it oh fred think how unhappy she will be if you say that to her i have said it replied fred bitterly i wrote and told her that i hoped she would leave me to be a carpenter and live on in the little cottage where she had worked so hard oh how could youwhat did she say cried horace with the tears shining in his eyes fred covered his face for a moment she begged me to forgive my father for her sake as though it was not for her sake i feel as i do yes yes i know said horace but you will have to do as she says or else we shall all be so unhappy oh fred for mothers sake for my sake forgive father for why should i lose my brother because my father has come home i cannot help myself i must let him help me and if he did stay and work for this money just to prove that he was sorry for what he had done so long ago i think we ought to forgive him as mother has he is ill too through the hardships he had to endure oh horry if only he hadnt gone away like that to have to forgive your father instead of looking up to him as len morrison does is so bitter and it might all have been so different if only he had kept on doing his duty and asking god to help him when things were a bit harder than usual oh fred ask god to help you now to help you forgive him for mothers sake and for jesus christs sake cried horace in a passion of tears i have dear i have and i think i shall be able to do it soon but i think god wanted me to see that making a fortune cant make up for not doing the right thing at the right time no not even to the people you may make the fortune for i shall have to let my father know this before i can fully forgive him it was a bitter lesson for the returned prodigals to learn for leonard morrison took the same view concerning his uncle having memories of days when his mother was too ill and too sad to be glad with them and he heard now from his father that this was generally caused by some memory of the dearly loved brother who had fled from them under a cloud of disgrace at length however fred wrote and assured his mother that for her sake and for his brothers he would do as they wished and join them at the seaside when horace went for a holiday before returning to school his hands were better thanks to the kind attention he received from everyone at dr morrisons indeed he was such good friends now with leonard that he begged to be allowed to go to the seaside with him in order to make the acquaintance of his mother and his father as well as of his own uncle who was still staying with them to help the invalid fred wrote this letter and mrs howard was greatly relieved to receive it to her it had been easy enough to receive and pardon her husband for his long neglect and she failed to understand why her elder son who had always been so good to her should assume such a hard unforgiving demeanour towards his father but when they met some weeks later she learned to understand the lad better and when she told her husband he said it is better he is young and has all his life before him and he is right in thinking that no fortune can make up for wasted opportunities and neglected duties
