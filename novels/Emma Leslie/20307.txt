conclusion illustrations william in the shop frontispiece miss eldons visit kates ordeal chapter i the message do you think katie haydon is prettyi dont and the speaker glanced at her own bright curls as she spoke well i dont know whether she is exactly pretty but she always looks nice and then she is so pleasant and merry and and so vain and stuckup put in the first speaker again oh how can you say so said another a plain quietlooking girl who had not spoken before mother says she would make such a nice nursemaid so quiet and bright as she is children would be sure to take to her well i dont know so much about that mary but i know she has asked teacher about a situationher mother wants her to go into the nursery my mother wants me to do the same said quiet mary green but although i have spoken to teacher i do not expect to hear of anything until katie is suited for she asked first and people are sure to choose her in preference to me this was said without the least touch of envy or jealousy before anyone could reply to it katie herself joined the group are we not late she said breathless with her run to catch them before they reached the school i have some news for you what do you thinki am going to london she panted fanning herself with her pockethandkerchief and casting a triumphant glance at esther odell the girl who had called her proud and stuckup esther was always talking about going to london and saying disparaging things of going to serviceservants were vulgar and despised and she never would be a servant though her mother and father both said she ought to get a situation this was how esther had talked and it gave kate haydon no small pleasure to be able to come and tell her schoolfellow that she was going to the wonderful city first is it settled katie asked mary have you got a situationare you going to service katie shook her head i am going to serve in a shop my cousin has got a nice place at a bakers and confectioners and they want somebody to help her and she has written to me about it what a lucky girl you are exclaimed esther in a tone of envy it does seem hard too for that is just the kind of situation i want and i daresay you would have been as well pleased if it had been in the nursery my mother would have liked it better i do believe laughed katie for she seems half afraid to let me go to london and serve in a shop too here comes teacher said mary green and the conversation was dropped as the girls hurried forward to meet the lady they went into school together and in the bustle of getting their seats miss eldon whispered to kate will you ask your mother to come and see me tomorrow morning kate yes maam answered the girl wondering not a little what her teacher could want to see her mother aboutquite forgetting the request she had made to the lady a few weeks before the lesson for that sunday afternoon was about the honour and dignity of work and service for the lady knew that some of her class had adopted the foolish notions of esther odell and did not fail to bring forward this subject whenever she had the opportunity pointing out how god had made it necessary for all to work and serve their fellowmen then she went on to speak of the word angel and how in its original sense it meant servants and how many a household servant was a veritable angel in the family she served and with what honour and love she was regarded by every member of it listening to her teacher it suddenly occurred to katie that it was about the business of her becoming a household servant that her teacher desired to see her mother and her thoughts instantly reverted to esther odell and the pleasant prospect held out by her cousins letter her mother would be only too glad to hear of a situation nearer home for her she knew but katie had made up her mind to go to london if she possibly could and so the more she thought of it the more vexed she felt that her teacher should want to see her mother just now but how to prevent it she did not know the girls chatted about the lesson and about the relative advantage of going to service or learning dressmaking and machinework but kate took little part in the discussion today and when they reached the corner where she must leave them she felt glad to get away to think out the problem she had been puzzling over all the afternoon she had not told any of her schoolfellows of the message she had been charged to deliver to her mother so no troublesome questions or surmises had been propounded by them and if she could only contrive to banish the whole subject from her mindforget it entirely her future would be settled before the next sunday came round for her cousins letter must be answered the next day and the offer accepted or declined and she knew there were many reasons why her mother could not well decline it unless she had something else in view for her mrs haydon was a widow often ailing and never strong enough to earn her own living by hard work but through the kindness of her brotherhimself not a wealthy mana little business had been secured for her enough to keep her in comfort and he had urged that kate being young and strong ought to get a situation but nothing had come in their way likely to suit kate until these letters from london offering her a situation with her cousin her uncle had written as well as her cousin urging that if she had nothing else in view she had better accept this as she might not have such a chance againa view of the matter that kate fully endorsed she was most anxious to go to london and to serve in a shop and be called a young lady was so much better than going to service she thought but her mother shook her head rather gravely when she ventured to say something of this to her i am not so sure about that my dear i was a servant myself for years before i married your poor father and was much more comfortable and happy i know than half the girls are that set up to be young ladies now so that i hope you will never despise service kate her mother had said kate recalled these words and many others that her mother had spoken lately upon the same subject but now that it seemed as though the choice lay in her own hands they had little weight with her these notions were oldfashioned she whispered to herself nobody ever went to service now if they could possibly obtain any other employment even esther odell was going to learn dressmaking although there was a large family to keep and her fathers wages barely sufficed to supply all their wants and thinking of esther made katie decide to say nothing to her mother about her teacher desiring to see her for she never could meet her schoolfellows taunts and jeers about being a servant when she had the chance of being something better as kate went into the little back room behind the shop where her mother was sitting she noticed the traces of tears on her face and asked rather anxiously if she was ill no my dear i have only been thinking this matter over again and i cannot help feeling troubled about it but why should you mother and kate stooped and kissed the pale anxious face and was about to whisper you may have your wish after all for teacher wants to see you tomorrow morning but a footstep was heard on the stairs and she said here comes aunt ellen and the next minute the door opened and mrs haydons sister entered the room oh you have come in kate i came down to see if your mother was fretting still its very foolish of her i think of course we never can have things just as we wish and if you cant get a nice respectable situation in a family you ought to take your uncles offer yes yes she shall ive made up my mind about it now ellen said the widow hastily while kate turned to the window to hide her telltale face well im glad the matter is decided so far for you were just making yourself ill with the worry i dont see why mother should worry so much about it said kate petulantly her aunt looked at her for a minute in silence and then said well she cannot expect to keep you tied to her apronstring all your life of course if you could get a quiet place near home it would be better for aunt ellen at that moment was asking herself the same question that esther odell had asked her schoolfellows an hour or two before is katie a pretty girl and all at once a doubt had crept into her mind about the wisdom of sending her into the midst of unknown temptations but she put it down at once seeing that her sister had at last decided the matter of course kate will be careful and steady and not make any chance acquaintances she said answering her own thoughts yes yes it is not that i am afraid of her said the widow hastily and aunt ellen will always be here to take care of you said kate i would not think of going so far away if you had to be left alone yes yes my dear i was not thinking of myself at all in the matter although i shall miss you terribly butbut there suppose you get your mother a cup of tea as quickly as you can kate that is what she wants interrupted aunt ellen and kate feeling very uncomfortable went to take her things off and get tea ready mrs haydon was better after tea and could talk more cheerfully of kate leaving home she knew very little of london herself except what she had heard from her brother and very little of her brothers family he had several grownup sons and daughters and his wife had been dead some years beyond these bare facts she knew very little about them so that kate would be going among comparative strangers and it was this that had troubled the widow most you shall write to your cousin tomorrow morning katie and i will write to your uncle it will be better to settle this at once i suppose yes mother i am sure it willnot that i want to leave you mother i shall miss you dreadfully i know but then i may never have such a chance as this again true kate but still i cannot help wishing it was to some nice nursery you were going instead of a shop but then it is only a bakers shop mother said kate yes yes but its so far away from home if you could come to me for the sundays kate or if i knew anything of your cousin marion it would be differenti should feel more easy about you oh mother why need you feel uneasy surely you do not think i should do anything wicked exclaimed kate no no my child i hope that which you have learned at sunday school will not be so easily forgotten kate you must find out a bibleclass as soon as you get there even if your cousins do not go to sunday school but i should think they did mother marion is only a year or two older than me and isabel younger so that i should think they would go i dont know my dear i never heard that they went to a sunday school but i hope they do for your sake katie dear you must ask that god will take care of you every moment and pray as you never did before lead me not into temptation yes mother murmured kate hanging down her head and almost wishing now that she had delivered her teachers message for how could she ask god to keep her out of temptation when she was taking the matter into her own hands determined to have her own way at all costs chapter ii did she forget katie haydon is going to london maam did she tell you on sunday the speaker was esther odell who could think of nothing else but her schoolfellows good fortune and meeting her teacher later in the week hastened to impart the important news to her miss eldon looked surprised and a little disappointed for she had heard of an excellent opening for kate in the nursery of a lady not far off who needed a bright clever girl able to assist the nurse sometimes with the one child and also learn to wait upon the young ladies who were growing up such a nice place as this was not often to be met with and miss eldon had waited at home all day on monday expecting mrs haydon to call about it she was on her way there now thinking she must be ill or something had happened she could hardly think kate had forgotten her message for she was so anxious to obtain a situation only a short time before but esther odells news made her think it was very possible kate had forgotten all about it did kate tell you about this on sunday she said yes maam she ran to catch us before we got into school on purpose to tell us she is going to her cousin to serve in a shop i wish i had her chance added esther with a sigh and you think it is all settled esther said the lady oh yes maam i know it is i met kate yesterday and she had been to post the letters to her cousin and uncle telling them she would go the lady stood for a moment in silence debating whether she should go on and see kate and ascertain whether the matter was finally settled or call upon mary green and send her to see the lady about this situation looking at her watch the time decided her for it was a long walk to mrs haydons and she would not have time to call upon mary if she went there thank you esther for telling me this did you say you wanted a situation yes maam if i could hear of one like katies to serve in a shop and be a young lady i couldnt be a common servant she added quickly a common servant esther what do you mean said miss eldon rather severely do you know that to be a household servant you must have a character that will bear the strictest inquiry and therefore those who are servants are known at once as respectable honourable people and those who employ them know their value and esteem them accordingly have you so soon forgotten what i told you on sunday esther hung her head feeling very much ashamed for a minute or two but at last she managed to say i thought servants were always looked down upon maam no one whose respect was worth having would look down upon a servant because she was a servant we always looked up to our dear old nurse margaret and loved her almost as a mother said miss eldon now esther think over what i have said and put these foolish notions away i know your mother wishes you to go to service come and tell me next sunday that i may look out for a situation for you i must go and see mary green now and the lady bade her scholar goodbye and walked on esther stood a minute looking after her i wish i was a lady and could have a fine silk dress like hers she said half aloud i knew she wanted some of us to take a place and if it wasnt for that proud kate haydon i think i would try it but i couldnt bear to think of her serving in a grand shop in london while i was mewed up in a nursery or kitchen here mother must grumble a little longer i daresay i shall hear of a place in a shop before long and who knows but i may go to london too and esther went on her way her mind full of the unknown glories of london and vain wishes to be in kates place mary green ran in to see kate a day or two afterwards and tell her the news that she had got a situation at lady hazeldeans as undernurse and to wait on the young ladies my dear i am very glad to hear it said mrs haydon i only wish it had been offered to kate instead of her going to london butbut i thought began mary mary do come now before it gets dark i want to show you my new dress interrupted kate hastily jumping up from her seat and running out of the room mary followed but more slowly wondering not a little at what she had heard for she thought kate had refused this place dont say any more about this situation at lady hazeldeans whispered kate when they were safely shut in the bedroom but what can it matter you do not want it kate miss eldon told my mother she had spoken to you about it on sunday but your mother did not think it worth while calling to see her about it how could she when we had to write those letters to london directly there mary isnt that a pretty print i am to wear print dresses and holland aprons in the morning but marion says we may wear what we like in the afternoon and so i am going to have a new dress for best and what i have been wearing on sunday i shall wear every day there yes answered mary but it was in rather an absentminded manner for she felt puzzled about kate and her strange anxiety lest she should talk about this situation she had obtained on sunday when the girls met as usual on their way to school the prospects of their two companions were again discussed and although a few like esther wished they could go to london as kate was going it was agreed that mary was very fortunate in getting such a good situation although as it was remarked miss eldon always did get her girls excellent places kate felt rather vexed at having to hear all the excellencies of this despised situation enumerated and was not sorry to reach school but her teachers first words vexed her still more and put her into a fright too i was coming to see your mother last tuesday kate i hope she has not been ill oh no maam shes quite well thank you answered kate then it was not illness prevented her from coming to see me on monday kate coloured and hung her head as she answered no maam did you forget to deliver my message i think i told you i wanted to see her about a situation for you you said you wanted to see her maam butbut i forgot it said kate under her breath well never mind it does not matter much kate for i hear you have a situation in london now said miss eldon thinking kate was vexed and angry with herself for having forgotten her message but the fact was kate who was neither an untruthful nor deceitful girl shrank from telling a direct lie she had yielded to the temptation last sunday because as she had persuaded herself then she was not required to tell an untruth but merely to hold her tongue about the message but now she found that to hide that wrongdoing a direct lie must be told and although it made her uncomfortable and unhappy it was done but she protested again and again to her own conscience that she would never do it again before she left school however she had another fright when do you go to london kate asked her teacher as the girls were leaving tomorrow week maam said kate well i will try and see you one day in the week for i want to hear all about your new situation and what your mother thinks of it said miss eldon quite unconscious of the panic her words had put kate into it made her last days at home the most miserable she had ever spent for miss eldon did not come until saturday afternoon but kate had been in suspense every hour during the whole week and yet the foolish girl could not summon up the courage necessary to tell her mother the truth about the matter the dreadful moment arrived at last when there came a knock at the door and miss eldon entering was soon seated in their little back room and kates mother with her i was so much surprised to hear that kate was going to london began the lady removing her gloves for an easy chat yes maam it was a surprise to me and something of a shock too i may say for i had rather she had got a nice comfortable place nearer home yes it is a pity i did not hear of this vacancy at lady hazeldeans a day or two sooner for i can quite understand how anxious you must feel at a young girl like kate leaving home yes maam and if it had been anybody but my own brother that offered it she should not have gone but he has been a good friend to me and i cannot afford to offend him if i could only have written and told him i had a place in view for her it would have been different i suppose maam if you had heard of this nurserymaids place a week earlier you would have recommended kate for it as she spoke to you i think before mary green yes she did and i recommended her to lady hazeldean when i called there and heard of it for i thought it would be just the place for kate and i must say i felt a little vexed as well as disappointed that you did not come to see me last monday week about it the widow stared at her visitor i never knew that i was expected she said has not kate told you since that she forgot to deliver my message when she came home on sunday i told her to ask you to call and see me on monday morning for i could not conveniently leave home on that day and i had promised lady hazeldean she should see you and kate as soon as possible and kate knew that and never told me gasped the widow no no perhaps if i had explained it all to her she would not have forgotten it but i could not do that in school and so i merely told her i wished to see you on monday morning said miss eldon quickly kate how could you have forgotten such a message said her mother sharply but kate stood with downcast face and said not a word you must not be angry mrs haydon it was excusable i am sure if you had just received these london letters said the lady gently i dont see how she could have forgotten such a message said the widow in the same vexed tone did you know what i was wanted for kate she demanded turning once more to her daughter but miss eldon answered for her oh no she could not have known it and so i am the only one to blame in this business she said kate felt very grateful to her teacher for thus helping her out of the difficulty and vowed in her own mind that she would never act so deceitfully again no never again would she follow such a crooked path and deceive her mother for it was deceit now she saw it quite plainly but still she was afraid to confess the whole truth about the matter after miss eldon had gone she had an opportunity of doing this for her mother said now kate tell me the whole truth about this affair the truth mother repeated kate teacher told you the whole truth but how could you forget such an important message as this when you knew it was just what i was wishing for you to geta nice quiet place near home but teacher did not say a word about the place that sunday afternoon said kate in an injured tone but you might have knownmight have guessedwhat it was likely to be about it is not as though miss eldon was in the habit of sending for me she never did such a thing before but still how was i to know she had heard of a place at last i have been waiting months and months and nothing has come i know that but still how you could forget that sunday afternoon when you came home and found me in such trouble about your going to london is more than i can understand illustration miss eldons visit but the foolish girl persisted in declaring that she had forgotten all about the message in spite of her mothers frequently expressed doubts soothing her conscience by assuring herself that this should be a warning to her never to do so again kate felt quite sure about this let the temptation be what it might she never would yield to it again as she had done in this instance for it had made her miserable but i am not sure that kate felt sorry enough for her fault yet to wish it undone when she went up to bed that night instead of kneeling down and confessing her sin to god and asking his forgiveness and his grace to keep her in the future she peeped into the box that stood ready packed and thought with a feeling of triumph that she was going to london after all and her mother would forget all this fuss that had been made about her teachers message when she heard how well she was getting on there and so full was kates heart of these thoughts that she jumped into bed without kneeling at her bedside but still feeling quite confident that she would never act again as she had done now that she had got her own way and was sure of going to london chapter iii in london it was night when kate reached london but her uncle was waiting for her at the railway station and she and her luggage were soon stowed away in a cab and they were rattling through the brilliantlylighted streets to kates unaccustomed eyes it was like fairyland for a few minutes and she thought she had indeed been fortunate to obtain a place in one of these grand shops but she soon found there were streets in london almost as dimly lighted as their own village streets at home and shops much less grand and imposing than those she had first seen at last the cab stopped and kate saw to her disappointment that it was not a broad fashionable thoroughfare and the shop with its piles of buns and loaves of bread was by no means imposing but rather oldfashioned in its appearance and the whole street was the same although there were a great number of people about and everybody seemed in such a hurry that kate made up her mind there must be a fire or some accident must have happened near at hand all this passed through her mind as her box was being lifted from the roof of the cab as she stood on the pavement looking up and down the busy oldfashioned street that was so unlike what she had fancied her new home would be her cousin marion was behind the counter in the shop and there seemed to be a constant stream of customers coming and going this is the best bun house in london whispered her uncle as he took her hand and led her in the old lady who was likewise serving left her post when she saw kate and her uncle and led the way into the cosy parlour behind the shop she seemed pleased with kates appearance and manner and asked her a great many questions about her home and her mother we are very quiet oldfashioned people ourselves she said although we live in london and i am very particular about the young people i have to help me in the shop and never allow them to make friends among the customers be civil to all but nothing more than that to anyone my dear that is my rule and you must remember to obey it marion knows i am more strict about this than anything else and so i hope you will remember it too yes maam i will said kate and then the old lady asked the servant to bring up some supper and went back to the shop that marion might come in and speak to her father and cousin i am to give you some supper and then take you to bed said marion after their greetings were over you will have some supper with us fathermrs maple told me to ask you no thank you my dear i want to get home and you girls dont need me now i have told kate she is always to spend the sunday with us the same as you do oh yes of course she will said marion you see that is one advantage of being in an oldfashioned shop like this we have no sunday work she said turning to her cousin mother will be glad to know that said kate yes you must tell her when you write said her uncle bidding her goodbye when he was gone the girls sat down to supper and kate tried to eat but everything was so strange and she had such an intense longing to see her mother that she said yes and no to her cousins questions scarcely understanding what they were the next morning however she felt a good deal better and by the end of the week began to feel quite at home for mrs maple was not a hard mistress and so kate was able to give a good account of her home when she wrote to her mother what shall we do tomorrowwhere shall we go said marion on saturday afternoon where do you generally go said kate rather timidly i have been going to ask you two or three times how you spend sunday oh i go home and if its fine bella and i go for a walk or a little way into the country but you will want to see london of course yes said kate rather slowly i should like to see some of the grand places i have heard about butbut dont you think we might manage to see them another time dont you go to sunday school she asked in a still lower tone her cousin stared at her in blank amazement for a minute or two and then burst into a merry laugh go to sunday schoola young woman like me she said well not to sunday school exactly i did not mean that but to church and bibleclass said kate oh yes we go to church sometimes for a change when its wet and its a good place to see the fashions too but i never went to sunday school in my life mother said it wasnt genteel mother liked me to go to sunday school and i promised her i would find out a bibleclass as soon as i could said kate well so you can i daresay after a little while but you must look round a bit first now where shall we go on sunday you see the fine weather wont last long and theres such lots of things for you to see of course you would like to see buckingham palace and the houses of parliament and the albert memorial and kensington gardens but we cant see everything in one sunday so we had better make up our mind to go and see the parks and the memorial next sunday kate did not answer but marion chose to consider the matter settled later in the day when they had time for a few minutes chat to themselves marion said you will soon forget your oldfashioned countrified notions about sunday schools and bibleclasses they were all very well i daresay for the country people could go out and get a breath of fresh air any day in the week but you cant here and so we are obliged to manage our sundays the best way we can yesbutbut i should like to go to church next sunday mother asked me in her letter this morning to tell her whether i had found a nice bibleclass and where i went to church oh well well go to church for once just to satisfy your mother kate only she cant expect us to go every sunday kate thought she had better be content with the small victory she had gained and perhaps byandby she might be able to persuade marion to go to bibleclass with her and thus put an end to these sunday excursions in the meantime she must go with her cousins for a walk or a pleasure trip on a sunday afternoon or else marion would refuse to accompany her to school it seemed strange to kate at first to be walking about in the noisy streets or gazing at the fashionable gailydressed people in the park but she soon began to enjoy discussing this ones dress and that ones bonnet almost as much as her cousins did and her younger cousin said you will soon wear off all your country rust kate how could you have lived in that pokey place so long oh it wasnt pokey a bit said kate warmly i had lots of friends there and that is what we are not allowed to have here dont you find that rule of mrs maples rather hard to keep sometimes marion she added what rule said marion about saying as few words as possible to the customers in the shop mrs maple told me she was most strict about it well i suppose she is said marion carelessly at least just at first but they were joined at this moment by two young men whom kate instantly recognised as being frequent visitors at the shop she cast an inquiring glance at marion as one of them said this is the cousin you told me was coming to help you in the shop i suppose i have been there all the week and seen you several times i think said kate quickly at which they all burst into a loud laugh a few minutes afterwards they were joined by some more friends who were likewise customers at the shop as kates eyes instantly told her and she wondered whether her cousin did keep the rule about friends and customers as strictly as mrs maple supposed before the next week was over she found that these friends of marions came in for buns or pastry when mrs maple was sure to be out of the way and a good deal of laughing and chatting went on between them of course i dont keep such a stupid rule as that kate how can i said her cousin afterwards when they were talking about this it would not do to laugh and chat with the old lady in the way but where is the harm i should like to know kate shook her head of course i dont understand business she said but i thought it was a strange rule myself a strange rule it is the most stupid and absurd one that could be thought of some people come into the shop every day and to think i am only to say yes and no to them is ridiculous but all those young men you met on sundaysurely you knew some of them in a different way than just coming into the shop said kate no i dont replied her cousin i never saw them until i came here she added laughing kate looked a little disappointed ii thought you knew them so well they seemed so friendlythat they must be friends of your brothersthat your father knew their friends and all about them stammered kate you little goose what difference can it make to us whether my father and grandfather knew theirs or whether we met last week for the first time said marion laughing but kate was not satisfied i wish i could talk to mother about it she said half aloud for patience sake dont look so solemn and talk so seriously about a little thing like that and as to telling your mother everything why no sensible girl of any spirit would think of such nonsense for she would know that her mother could not understand about things she had never seen or heard of now dont be silly kate and make your mother uncomfortable about you we went to church last sunday on purpose that you might tell her we had been and after that she will be satisfied unless you tell her something on purpose to make her anxious about you and marion went to serve another customer feeling sure that kate would not say anything about these acquaintances now kate certainly did not want to say anything that would make her mother anxious only this morning she had received a letter from her mother saying she had lost almost all her fears concerning her welfare now for kates letters had given such a faithful account of mrs maples strict ways and the stringent rule about chance acquaintances and her resolution to induce her cousins to go with her to a bibleclass very soon that mrs haydon grew almost as hopeful as kate about the future and kate was quite sincere in her desire to induce her cousins to spend their sundays differently and she thought if she went with them to see the various sights of london just once or twice they would be willing to go with her afterwards the following sunday morning when they were dressing to go out marion said where do you think we are going today kate you said you would take me to westminster abbey or to st pauls said kate ah yes so i did but a wet sunday will do for those places and they want us to go to richmond or greenwich park which shall it be kate said her cousin brushing her hair more vigorously who wants us to go asked kate oh you knowthe friends who met us in the park last sunday the young men who came into the shop on friday wouldnt they go with us to the abbey or to st pauls instead said kate marion laughed i shouldnt like to ask them she said and pray dont say anything about sunday school before them i am not ashamed of it i can tell you said kate in a halfoffended tone no no of course not but then you see you are not in the country now said marion and things are different in london i dont see why they should be there are sunday schools in london i know and i mean to find out a bibleclass and then you and bella shall come and see how nice it is well theres plenty of time for that when the fine weather is all over said marion a little impatiently now kate be quick and decide where we shall go for i expect they will meet us as we go home and we must tell them where to meet us this afternoon well i would rather not go at all said kate slowly for she knew her conscience would not let her enjoy the most pleasant trip that could be arranged oh nonsense but you must come i have promised for you they particularly want you to go said marion kate could not help feeling pleased and flattered by her cousins words but she made another feeble protest i would much rather go to st pauls she said and if i go with you today you must promise to go to bibleclass with me very soon oh i promise laughed marion and now kate once more where shall we go for i promised you should decide this i am a great mind to be jealous of you my little country cousin she added bella would be i know i dont see what you have got to be jealous about said kate yet still feeling pleased and elated in spite of her better sense now let me give you a few finishing touches before we go said marion a few minutes afterwards and i will lend you my green brooch and a veil you must let me alter your bonnet a little one night next week there now you dont look quite so dowdy said marion as she pushed her cousin before the lookingglass after the few touches had been given to her bonnet and neck ribbon come kate will you take this parasol of mine said her cousin oh yes and i must take some money i suppose said kate going to her box and unlocking it she did not like her cousin to see what a small store of money she had and so she put the purse into her pocket as it was but not intending to spend more than a shilling for the little sum her mother had given her was to last three months for her extra expenses chapter iv the lost purse sunday outings in the holidaymaking sense were not much to kates fancy but she had exhausted all her excuses and objections and found herself forced to yield to marions proposal so the two girls went off and found their friends waiting for them a short distance from the shop the bells of various churches were ringing for morning service and kate ventured to whisper to her cousin that she would like to go but marion shook her head so decidedly that she gave up the point at once but she did not take much interest in the discussion that was going on about the rival attractions of greenwich and richmond saying she knew nothing about either at last it was decided that they should spend the afternoon at greenwich going and returning by water the young men walked with them almost as far as marions home but left them at the corner of the street and nothing was said to her father about these companions of their walk when isabel heard where they were going she declared she must have her bonnet altered and marion sat down to do this while her sister got the dinner ready as they were going out after dinner marion said perhaps we shall stop out to tea father i want to go and see a friend today and she is sure to ask us to stay to tea very well my dear i can manage to get tea for myself and the boys said her father carelessly marion always had been allowed to do very much as she pleased and since her mothers death and she had got a situation she had taken the reins quite into her own hands and seldom asked advice and still more rarely accepted it when it was offered kate felt rather uncomfortable at first when she thought of this steamboat excursion but she soon forgot this in the pleasure and novelty of the scene around her and she stifled the voice of conscience by whispering that this would not happen againshe had only come this once that her cousin might go with her to the bibleclass when the fine weather was over the steamboat was crowded and there was a good deal of pushing and squeezing when they reached greenwich pier where most of the passengers were landed all tickets ready all tickets ready called the man at the end of the landingboard while another took each passengers scrap of paper as they passed out kate had put her ticket in her purse for safety and now put her hand into her pocket to get it but to her dismay she found her pocket empty oh stop a minute wait for me marion i must have dropped my purse and kate began to elbow her way through the crowd back to where she had been sitting the place was vacant now and she hunted all round but no purse could be seen oh what shall i do what shall i do she exclaimed bursting into tears what is it why dont you come said marion who had now come back for her my purse my purse ive lost it sobbed poor kate lost your purse exclaimed marion did you drop it kate shook her head i dont know i thought i put it into my pocket she said the two were looking under the seats and all round as they talked but now they heard bella and their companions calling to them from the pier to make haste as the steamboat was about to leave so they had to give up the search and run ashore tickets miss tickets said the man as they were hastening past to join their friends marion gave up hers but kate could only repeat what shall i do what shall i do have you had a purse given to you that was found on board the boat asked marion the man laughed at the question i suppose you have lost one he said yes and my steamboat ticket was in it did anyone give it to you asked kate anxiously oh no my dear ive seen no purse you must pay again thats all i can say but how can i pay all my money was in my purse sobbed kate what is it whats the row asked one of the young men who had come back for them this young ladys lost her purse thats all said the man are you one of her friends he suddenly added yes i am said the young man ah well then the matter can soon be settled you see her ticket was in the purse and we cant be expected to lose that precious mean of you then grumbled the friend putting his hand into his pocket and counting out kates fare there was a momentary sense of relief in kates mind and marion whispered there now its all right come along and forget all about it but that was just what kate could not do and the longer she thought about it the more miserable she grew they went for a walk in the grand old park which kate would have enjoyed immensely at any other time but conscience was reproving her for this misspent sabbath and then the loss of her money almost distracted her for she was to receive her salary from mrs maple by the quarter and so it would be nearly three months before she had another penny she could call her own oh dear i wish i had never come sighed kate its no use crying over spilt milk said marion so cheer up for a little while and let us be jolly and she took her cousin and led her on to the rest of the party for kate had preferred to drop behind and indulge her gloomy thoughts alone here william she said try and cheer her up a bit she feels dull about losing her purse the young man tried to cheer her as he had been directed but it was not any easy task he was not the sort of companion kate had been used to and could talk of little but musichalls and theatres and the last popular song and singersthings which kate knew nothing about and could not interest her just now so that the afternoon passed slowly away they were leaving the park now and bella was declaring that she must have some tea before she went home well then ill sit down on this seat said kate and you can come for me when you are ready to go home and kate went over to the seat but was closely followed by the rest come come we cant allow this you know said her selfconstituted guardian william you are under my charge and you must come and have some tea oh do please leave me alone i shall feel better here pleaded kate nonsense kate a cup of tea will do you good said bella impatiently but you forget i have lost my purse and have no money to pay for it replied kate a little bitterly but i told you that did not matter interposed the young man again my purse is at your service i will give it you if you likeif you will only laugh and chat as you did on board the steamer kate smiled and thanked him but declined to accept either purse or tea from him you are almost a stranger to me and i feel vexed that you should have had to pay for my steamboat ticket she said oh kate how rude you are said marion crossly there come along to tea and i will pay for it if you will not accept williams kindness i cannot said kate and i would much rather stay here than go to a tea i cannot pay for well you shall pay me back if you likeif that will satisfy you said marion impatiently and kate reluctantly rose from her seat and followed the rest who had already turned in the direction of the park gates marion and the rest seemed to enjoy their tea and laughed and chatted and tried to rouse kate into something like merriment too but kate felt too anxious and unhappy to laugh at anythingeven the poor jokes and witticisms of william although they were made for her special benefit and which afforded her so much amusement when they first started really kate it is too bad of you to let your loss spoil the fun for everybody said marion reproachfully as they turned towards the steamboat pier once more i dont want to spoil your fun i only want you to leave me alone said kate crossly and marion did leave her alone for the rest of the evening but her selfappointed friend would not he paid her steamboat fare back and talked to her assiduously as he had done during the afternoon but with little better success and kate was thankful when the miserable day came to an end and she was once more in the little bedroom she shared with marion and do you really mean to say kate that you took out all the money you possessed said her cousin as she began to undress yes i know it was very foolish sighed kate how much was there altogether asked her cousin nearly six shillings oh well that wasnt much said marion rather contemptuously and i daresay you will be able to manage until your mother sends you some more i shall not ask motherill wait until mrs maple pays me my wages say salary my dear that is more genteel said marion but how are you going to manage for your letters and youll want new neckribbons and that bonnet will never last you three months it must and i shall have to do without neckribbons there dont bother me tonight concluded kate i dont want to bother you and you are a goose to bother and worry yourself as you do about trifles most girls would have forgotten the loss of a paltry purse when they had a nicelooking young man like william so kind to them you must make it up to him you know he will expect it said marion kate lifted her head and looked at her cousin but marion turned her head aside make it up to him what do you mean marion of course i shall pay the shilling i owe him for my steamboat fare i told him so when i said goodnight you did how can you be so rude or so stupid which is it dont you know they like to pay for us if they can get the chance i let them do it sometimes it pleases them and dont hurt me what when you have the money in your pocket and can pay for yourself exclaimed kate in astonishment yes why shouldnt they spend their money if they like it and besides i make it up to them added marion how do you do that asked kate but marion did not answer she began to feel half sorry she had told her cousin as much as she had how do you make it up to them repeated kate oh dont bother me tonight im tired keep your eyes open and youll see for yourself concluded marion as she got into bed kate kneeled down as she always did for the habit of prayer was too strong to be broken all at once she felt ashamed and unhappy as she kneeled down and she wished she could pray as her mother and teacher had often told herpouring out her whole heart before god poor foolish kate she had read often enough those words be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication let your requests be made known unto god and yet she was afraid to bring this trouble to him her thoughts were also running on her cousins last words and after she got into bed she said again i wish you would tell me how i can make it up to williamabout that shilling i mean it will be such a long time for him to wait before i can pay it i should think it would if you mean to wait until you take your salary said marion impatiently well then tell me what i can do besides how do you make it up when they pay shillings for you keep your eyes open and youll see for yourself some day but youd better shut them now and go to sleep or you wont be able to keep them open at the right time concluded marion as she turned round to put an end to the talk but after a minute or two kate said you might tell me when it is the right time to keep them open marion oh dont bother go to sleep havent you heard theres tricks in every trade i dont know perhaps i have well then keep a sharp lookout and youll soon learn the tricks of ours and marion was soon fast asleep but it was a long time before kate could close her eyes for conscience was at work again urging her to tell her mother of her loss and all that led to it but kate was afraid she could not bear to forfeit her mothers good opinion and make her anxious she might even send for her to come home and kate did not like the idea of that at all she was very comfortable in this oldfashioned place as everybody called it and not at all inclined to go back to a quiet country life chapter v disclosure can you oblige me by putting this bill in the window miss asked a pleasantlooking young woman who often came into the shop for a loaf or a few buns i daresay we can said kate taking the bill and reading it it was the announcement of a teameeting at a sunday school in the neighbourhood and kate forthwith determined to speak to this young woman when she came in again and ask her if there was a bibleclass there for elder girls and young women look here marion she said holding up the bill to her cousin i suppose i can put this into the window i suppose you can but i shouldnt i should throw it under the counter said marion in a tone of contempt but why asked kate well we cant put in all the bills that are brought and so i never put that sundayschool rubbish anywhere but under the counter well i shall put it in the window said kate decidedly and as she had charge of the one where the piles of loaves where placed she put it in the most conspicuous corner i did not know there was a sundayschool so near she went on i shall ask that young person when she comes in again if they have got a nice bibleclass there perhaps she goes to it herself and would take me with her for the first time you seem to forget mrs maples rule about making friends of the customers said marion quickly so do you i should think retorted kate i am not a new hand i have been here some months and know the ways of london better than a country girl replied marion well i dont believe mrs maple would mind me speaking to this young woman about a bibleclass you dont know anything about it and i must ask someone she would not mind it so much as our talking to those young men as we do well ask her and see said marion scornfully ive a great mind to said kate do go now kate you are the greatest simpleton that ever came to london i think i do believe you would go and ask this as though you were afraid your tongue was not your own talk to her if you like only dont grumble any more about me talking to my friends as you do sometimes if kate had only known it mrs maple would readily have granted a breaking of her rule in favour of this customer for she knew her to be a good industrious young woman who would influence her aright for although not a christian herself she had a great respect for those who were and knew they were the most trustworthy and reliable in business but kate was laughed out of her intention of speaking to mrs maple about this and as she happened to be in the shop each time this customer came in during the next week she had no opportunity of asking her what she wished and so another sunday came round without any effort being made to discover the bibleclass she had told her mother she would find during this week marions friends came in nearly every day and kate noticed that they ate a good deal of pastry as they stood laughing and chatting with them for kate was easily drawn into the talk now but marion always took the money for what they had so that she did not know what money really was paid one day she ventured to say i suppose william has a very high salary as he can afford to spend so much in buns and cakes and go out for sunday excursions and pay for people who are so foolish as to lose their purses you should add laughed marion but it was no laughing matter to kate already she had been obliged to borrow a postagestamp from her cousin to send her customary letter to her mother and she had a keen suspicion that it had been taken from mrs maples desk of which marion kept the key the following sunday it was arranged that they should go to greenwich again and though kate protested at first that she would not go she was at last persuaded to join the party marion offering to pay for her or to lend her the money to pay for herself this time kate enjoyed herself almost as much as any of them she had succeeded in quieting her conscience so that it did not trouble her as much as it did at first how she succeeded in keeping her mother quiet and hopeful too she alone knew but she did not write home quite so frequently now and made excuses for shorter letters by saying she had so little time to write marion contrived that she should not have an opportunity of saying much to the young woman who brought the sunday school bill for she always went forward to serve her if they were by themselves in the shop once kate got so far as to ask her if they had a bibleclass at the sunday school but marion came up and interposed at once what is the use of your asking questions about a bibleclass here we are not here on sunday and it would be too far for you to walk backwards and forwards three or four times a day yes i suppose it would assented kate slowly we have a very nice class and the lady who teaches would be glad to see you if you would come ventured the customer but she cant it is impossible said marion and this ended the conversation for the young woman did not like to press it further and truth to tell kate was beginning to enjoy the sunday walks and excursions and therefore was not so anxious to join a bibleclass as she had been at first so the pleasant days and weeks of autumn slipped away and when kate sometimes asked her cousin what she had meant by saying she must make it up to william for paying for her steamboat fare she laughed and said she would find out some day if she only kept her eyes open kate had kept her eyes open as she thought but marion had not allowed her to see too much for she did not quite feel sure how far kate might be trusted with their secret yet but her friends were not aware of this and one day marion having gone out on business for mrs maple kate was alone in the shop when william and a companion came in marion has gone out said kate has she something unusual isnt it said the young man carelessly yes very unusual said kate it is not often we get sent out the old lady is out of the way i suppose said william confidentially as he helped himself to a spongecake from a plate on the counter yes or else i dare not talk to you said kate laughing well we came in to ask if you couldnt both manage to go to the theatre one night said william helping himself to something else from the counter and handing the plate to his friend me go to a theatre exclaimed kate i have never been in my life just the reason why you should go now then said william with his mouth full of lemon cheesecake tell marion what i say and i know she will agree with me tell her i have a chance of some orders this winter and you two shall have the first i can get hold of you are very kind said kate i am sure marion will be pleased if she can only manage to go and wont you be pleased too said the young man looking round for another untasted dainty ii dont know i dont think i shall be able to go i dont see how we can both get out together oh marion will manage that i daresay you must go kate if i can get the orders after a little more talk and a little more persuasion william said he would take two pennyworth of buns and gave kate twopence as he spoke kate handed him two buns and glanced over the impoverished plates on the counter trying to reckon how many had been taken while he in equal astonishment looked at the small bag she handed to him miss kate i am a wholesale customer you know he said at last wholesale repeated kate i dont understand of course i know we supply a few shops at a different rateat wholesale as you call it but you dont mean to say marion has never let you into the secret of our wholesale trade whispered william i dont know what you mean im sure well never mind it dont matter ive got two buns and ive paid for them and william was turning away from the counter but kate said quickly stop a minute there are those other things youve had off the plates oh its all right ill settle with marion for them good afternoon and the next minute he was gone leaving kate in a state of bewildered astonishment not easily described she knew that marion often helped herself to stamps envelopes and paper out of her mistresss desk but she could not think that she would rob her to such an extent as williams words would imply for it was robbery nothing less to give away their employers property for favours bestowed on themselves this then was how such favours were to be made up to them kate longed for and yet dreaded her cousins return that she might talk to her about this yet wondering at the same time how she should begin how she should tell her what she thought of it but as it often happens marion herself helped her out of the difficulty for as she came into the shop she said in a hurried whisper anyone been in kate kate nodded go and get your things off and i will tell you all about it she said oh i can guess your news i think he can get us some orders for the theatre isnt that it yes that and something else said kate rather gravely oh never mind the something else thats enough kate it will be splendid he always gets orders for the best seats in the firstrate theatres you must go i dont know whether i shall i must talk to you about things first how are these orders to be paid for paid for thats nothing to do with you or me either kate orders are always presents yes but we are expected to make it up and to rob mrs maple to do it rob her what do you mean kate if you were not my own cousin id make you prove your words said marion angrily what do you mean i say if you are a thief begging me to give you her postagestamps i am not i can buy postagestamps for myself i did not ask you for mrs maples stamps said kate indignantly i asked you to lend me your own until i could pay you for them lend you my own why you knew i had not got any exclaimed marion where was i to get them but out of the desk well ive kept account of how many stamps i have had and you shall put them back but it was not the stamps i was thinking of marion oh no of course not we never see ourselves as other people see us i told you william came in this afternoon well he ate a good deal of pastry off the plates and then gave me twopence for some buns expecting half a dozen i suppose for he was very much surprised that i only gave him two and said he was always served at the wholesale price and then went away without paying for anything he had eaten well suppose he did said marion coolly didnt he tell you he was keeping an account with me he told me to tell you he would settle with you about that well what more do you want how dare you charge me with being a thief the idea of your coming here and saying such things of me who was here long before you were it only shows what a bad wicked girl you must be and what you would do yourself if you only had the chance i have a great mind to go to mrs maple this minute and tell her what a dangerous person she has in her house and how we have all been deceived in you marion had almost talked herself out of breath and kate out of her suspicions as her cousin went upstairs to take off her things kate began to feel like a culprit in the matter as though she ought to beg her cousins pardon for judging her unjustly and yet when she was left alone again calmly to think over all that had happened that afternoon and many previous afternoons she could not but think that her suspicions were correct she rather dreaded marion coming down again but to her surprise marion seemed to have forgotten her anger by the time she appeared and came into the shop smiling and pleasant as though nothing had happened i have not told mrs maple anything about our quarrel kate she said quite coolly i am sure you do not mean what you said just now and it would vex her i know if she knew we had begun quarrelling i almost wish you had told her said kate well my dear i am not so fond of making other people uncomfortable as you are and so i think we had better keep the affair to ourselves i dont mind telling you this much i do sometimes give william a bun over what he pays for at the retail pricelet him have them at the wholesale rate as he is a pretty good customer but now let me try and remember what william had for i went to the drawers and filled up the plates again that was right never let your plates be half empty if you can fill them now you had better tell me what william had and marion took a notebook from her pocket and appeared to set done the items as kate could recall them i dont think he had anything else said kate when nearly a shillings worth had been called over well well forgive him if he has said marion replacing the book in her pocket with a smile dont look so grave kate im not going to rob mrs maple as you accused me of doing a little while ago everybody in business lets their own friends have things at a wholesale rate mrs maple sells to the shops on those terms and why shouldnt i let william have them at the same price it makes no difference to her oh yes it doesit must and besides the things are not ours but hers and we ought to sell them at the regular price and no other you are too strict but you will find out that such strict notions wont do in business i tell you everybody does itshow their friends a little favour in buying and selling and we must do the same or we might as well be in a convent chapter vi at the theatre marion so far overcame her cousins scruples that she said no more about the young mens nonpayment and when william or one of his companions asked for buns and gave her twopence which was the sum usually paid whatever they might have she did not hesitate to give them four or five or even half a dozen if he said as he sometimes did make it half a dozen this time kate but marion was not quite so pleasant with these friends as time went on for the promised orders for the theatre did not come and marion was disappointed and impatient its no good being so cross with a fellow i tell you ill get the orders next week if i possibly can said william one afternoon when marion was more than usually snappish it was drawing near to christmas now and the days were short and dark and cold so that pleasure trips and excursions down the river were out of the question it was often impossible for them even to go for a walk in the parks on sunday youve told me the same thing before and here i have been moped up for a month waiting for them i tell you ill go somewhere by myself i cant bear this dull life much longer concluded marion well ill get the orders tomorrow if i can said william and this time he was as good as his word he came in the next afternoon and with a triumphant flourish handed marion the coveted orders for herself and kate oh my theyve come at last and for tomorrow night too exclaimed marion examining the papers critically but we cant both go said kate peeping over her shoulder at the magic papers that had worked such a wonderful change in her cousins temper for marion had been very cross lately and scarcely spoken a civil word to kate who says we cant both go demanded marion it would serve you right not to let you goto leave you here in the shop while i am enjoying myself in fairyland no no that wont be fair said william kate must go or the party will be spoiled who else are going asked marion oh a lot of young fellows some you do know and some you dont we shall be a jolly party and will take good care of you girls have they all got orders asked kate no it isnt likely most of them will pay for themselves they can afford to do it better than you or i can but they will be none the less glad to have our company but i dont see how i am to go said kate again oh leave that to me ill manage it said marion we must both get out somehow but it wont do to tell mrs maple where we are going the old lady would have a fit i suppose said william speaking with his mouth full of cake oh ten fits all at once laughed marion we must take care she doesnt find out where we have been while william was amusing himself by eating sponge cakes and tarts marion sat down at the desk and began writing a letter you must wait for this she said i want you to take it to the postoffice close to our home and post it there you see i am writing it to myself asking myself and kate to go home for a few hours to keep fathers birthday tomorrow evening i shall show it to mrs maple of course and shell grumble a bit at first i daresay but shell let us go i know all right she isnt half a bad sort is she said the young man no that she isnt and i hate to deceive her said kate warmly well shell be none the worse for it you goose said marion laughing ii dont think ill go said kate there take the letter ill manage her said marion impatiently as william was about to expostulate shell come fast enough i tell you all right ill come in tomorrow to arrange about meeting for we must go together mind you must go kate added the young man as he slipped the letter into his pocket now kate dont let us have any fuss with you about this said her cousin as the shop door closed and they were left to themselves i dont want any fuss but i dont want to go to the theatre well stay at home then im not going to persuade you said marion crossly and then some more customers came in and there was no opportunity of renewing the discussion for some time and marion did not refer to the matter again that evening the letter marion had written reached them by the last post that night and after she had gone through the form of reading it she took it at once to mrs maple will you read this maam they want us to go home for the evening tomorrow if you can spare us what both of you said mrs maple taking the letter and putting on her spectacles as she spoke your sister writes very much like you marion remarked the old lady as she looked at the envelope again not that she doubted marion or suspected she would even attempt to deceive herit was done almost without a second thought but marion had provided against such a scrutiny the postmarks were quite correct and marion answered quickly yes maam our handwriting is very much alike we went to school together well i dont know what to say to this said mrs maple rather crossly as she handed back the letter it is very inconsiderate of your father i think wanting you both at once you see they are going to have a few friends and we dont often have company now said marion twisting the corner of her apron as she spoke well well theres something in that to be sure but still its very inconvenient for me i must send and see if my niece can come and mind the shop for an hour or two tomorrow night will you want to stay out all night or can you get home so as to be ready for the morning oh we will come home at night maam father will bring us home if you wont mind us being late for once oh i can put up with that its the shop im thinking of if my niece cannot come well then we cannot go you cannot both go certainly if she cannot come to help me i will send mary with a note the first thing tomorrow morning marion went back and told kate the result of her managing we shall go never fear she said confidently i dont seem to care about it a bit now i wish you had not asked for me said kate now dont be a simpleton or you will make me cross dont want to go indeed what next i wonder after all the talk there has been about it really kate i have no patience with you well i wouldnt mind if it wasnt deceiving mrs maple and then somehow i seem to have such a dread of it fiddlesticks what next i wonder said marion contemptuously they saw mary go out with the note next morning and a wild wish seemed to seize kate to run after her and tell her not to go i do hope she cant come she said half aloud but her cousin would not notice the speech mary who knew the errand she had been sent upon told them in a whisper as she came through the shop that it was all right and very soon mrs maple came out and said they could go home for the eveningcould go to tea if they liked thank you maam but after tea will do from four to six is always a busy time at both counters and so we will not leave until that is over william came in before the busy time and arranged to meet the girls in time to take them to the theatre kate felt it would be useless to resist further and agreed to go with them without further demur putting her vague fears out of mind as far as she could and determined to enjoy herself as much as possible just as william had left the shop mrs maple came in and filled two bags with pastry and buns there you had better take these home with you she said when she had filled the last and speaking to marion thank you maam i am much obliged father will be pleased said marion but kate felt thankful she was on the other side of the shop and could hide her telltale face for she knew she blushed with shame at the way they were deceiving their kind mistress when they went up to put their things on after tea she said oh marion i feel like a thief taking these things for your father and we know he will never see them there make haste and pack away one lot in your bag and hold your tongue said marion impatiently what shall we do with all these asked kate mrs maple has given us such a lot why eat them to be sure william and the rest will help us there you put as many as you can in your bag and well save them to eat when we come out and they must take the rest between them said marion kate filled her leather bag and marion took those that were soon to be disposed of and with a parting word from mrs maple not to be very late the girls set off their friends were waiting for them at the corner of the street and when they reached the doors of the theatre they were joined by several other smartlydressed young men who paid for their seats and to whom money seemed of very little account they condescended to laugh and chat with the two girls and eat some of the pastry and marion felt immensely flattered by their attentions kate was in a state of bewilderment the whole evening she had never seen a theatre before and the whole scene was so strange and new and the performances on the stage were so real to her that she paid little attention to other things and was scarcely aware that some of the party changed their seats once or twice during the evening the performance came to an end at last all too soon for enraptured kate who found it hard to reconcile herself to her surroundings all at once come kate dont go to sleep said marion laughing at her dazed look round at the crowd all the people were leaving their seats now and our party got up too open your bag kate i should like a bun now said marion and she took one herself and handed some to the rest of the party who were pushing and elbowing their way through the crowd what a dreadful crush there is said marion kate you havent brought another purse to lose have you she whispered kate shook her head for she was eating now from the bag as she carried it open in her hand the next minute some one cried out i have been robbedmy watch has gone and the crowd surged back and kate was almost pushed off her feet there were cries of police police stop thief stop thief and during the confusion that ensued kate and marion who managed to keep together were pushed into a corner and separated from all their friends shut up your bag kate or it may be snatched out of your hand gaping open like that said marion oh what is it when shall we get out exclaimed kate turning very pale there dont be frightened said marion the crowd will move on directly and the others will wait for us outside its nothing but a few pickpockets you need not look so frightened oh i wish we hadnt come said kate fairly trembling with undefined terror she shut her bag for neither she nor marion could eat anything now and even marion began to get frightened at last for only murmured words among the crowd could tell them what was going on but there was a bustle and expectancy and a swaying to and fro of the multitude that convinced marion something unusual must be taking place for they did not move a step forward for all the pushing and squeezing oh dear how late we shall be said kate after a few minutes waiting cant we get out marion no that we cant until the crowd moves there dont be frightened mrs maple wont expect us yet said marion it was some time before there was any perceptible movement in the crowd but at last the two girls were released from their corner and pushed their way on with the rest once outside they began to look about for their former companions but could see nothing of them the crowd had almost dispersed now for they were nearly the last to leave the theatre and so there was no difficulty in looking round but neither william nor his grand friends could be seen well that is mean of him to walk off and leave us like this said marion crossly never mind let us make haste home by ourselves said kate who was frightened at the lateness of the hour for they had heard a clock strike eleven several minutes before but marion would stop and look round once more i wonder where they have gone she said oh do come said kate perhaps they thought we had gone on as we were so long getting out perhaps they are waiting for us at the corner said marion who was unwilling to give up the hope of seeing these grand newfound friends again she hurried on by kates side and at the corner of the street stopped again and looked all round oh dont wait marion they are home by this time said kate hurrying on marion was obliged to hurry after her but she was cross and out of humour i will give it to mr william when he comes in tomorrow she grumbled i never saw such bad behaviour in my life leaving us to go home by ourselves at this time of night there do stop a minute kate how fast you are walking i thought i saw one of them then and marion stopped and looked round but no one was to be seen indeed the street seemed to be deserted for no one was about but themselves and their footsteps ringing sharp and clear on the hard frosty ground seemed to fill kate with terror again oh pray do make haste marion she cried in a halfsuppressed tone as though she was afraid of the sound of her own voice oh all right you need not be in such a fright i suppose you were never out late at night before said marion not so late as this and by myself too said kate oh well we shant be long and marion hurried on now and in a few minutes they had reached the wellremembered streetquiet now for a wonder as it seemed to kate and she began to breathe more freely the shop was shut up of course but mrs maple came to let them in almost as soon as they had rung the bell has your father gone she said in some surprise at seeing the girls by themselves yes maam he has gone to take a friend home said marion quickly they went straight up to bed and kate put her bag into her box where she usually kept it without thinking of the buns that were left im so glad it is over and we are safe at home again said kate with a sigh of relief i hope we shall soon have another treat just like it said marion thinking of her new friends chapter vii conclusion the two girls were in the shop next morning when a man came in and asked to see mrs maple i can serve you said marion who thought he looked at the window as though he wanted to give an order thank you i dont doubt your ability young woman but i want to see your mistress marion tossed her head rather disdainfully as she went into the little back parlour for she did not like being called young woman by this stranger mrs maple came out into the shop and marion returned to her work of dusting while the stranger said a few words in an undertone to the old lady what did you say she gasped looking as though she had been shot come in here and tell me for im sure this is a mistake no mistake at all maam for i kept my eye on them all the way from the theatre he said he had followed mrs maple into the back parlour and the old lady had sat down for she seemed unable to stand after the shock the mans words had caused her now tell me all about it she said and i will call them in and ask them no need to do that maam at least not just yet they were both out until nearly twelve oclock last night you admit and i tell you i watched them home from the theatre where they had spent the evening among a gang of smart young thieves three or four of them were taken but there are several watches and other valuables still missing and i have a warrant to search for these and arrest your two shopwomen what take them to prison but i tell you it must be a mistake the youngest is a young girl only a few months from the country and the other her cousin is a thoroughly respectable young woman who has been with me nearly a twelvemonth now that may be maam but still they were there and with a party of thieves too will you call them in and let me question them well i will call the younger one first kate said mrs maple opening the door yes maam answered kate readily come in and tell me where you went last night said mrs maple kate turned crimson as she looked from the stranger to her mistress now tell the whole truth about it kate i dont believe what this person saysthat you were in bad company but where did you go to the theatre faltered kate you did exclaimed her mistress and who did you go with she added withwith some friends said kate and who were they pray said mrs maple sternly but kate shook her head most of them i did not know william minn took us he brought us the orders the man noted her answers down in a book and then said i must search her boxes very well said mrs maple kate you ought to know that this is a policeman and he must search your things for some property that was stolen at the theatre last night mine gasped kate but there was no time to say more for mrs maple led the way to her room and she slowly followed behind the detective which is your box young woman asked the man kate pointed to it and handed him the key i had that bag with me last night she said as he took it out the man instantly opened it and took out some halfeaten buns and cakes from your shop maam he said grimly i gave them to her before she went out said mrs maple stiffly for she did not believe the policemans story though kate had admitted having been to the theatre but the next minute she and kate both felt as if they had been struck for he drew out two gold watches with the broken links of the chains still attached where did you get these asked the man coolly but poor kate could only shake her head and stare in blank astonishment at the sight mrs maple had dropped into a chair exclaiming oh dear oh dear i never could have believed it no maam i daresay not of course you have been cruelly deceived in these two young women said the detective turning over the contents of kates box in search of other stolen property but there was nothing more to reward his search and in a few minutes he said now maam if youll call the other young woman up i will soon finish yes yes to be sure marion must come said mrs maple and in a minute or two marion came in wondering not a little why she had been called and what could be the matter you were at the theatre last night marion and this is a policeman come to search for some stolen property said mrs maple marion saw it would be useless to deny the charge now and did not attempt it i know we were at the theatre last night she said but i have nothing but what is my own and she handed her keys at once to the policeman all right young woman but whether i find anything or not you must come with me to answer a few questions with the other prisoners when they are brought before the magistrate tomorrow morning the other prisoners gasped marion now turning as pale as her mistress and kate ah the fine friends you were with last night one or two of them are wellknown gaol birds and the rest are not much better marion looked at kate and then at her mistress as the policeman proceeded to turn out her box but kate had not spoken since she saw the watches taken out of her bag and sat staring in a sort of dazed stupor at what was going on kate why dont you speak and tell them we were not with thieves said marion indignantly but kate shook her head i dont know where they came from she said but you know william minn is a very respectable young man said marion reproachfully but kate did not seem to hear and when the policeman told her to put on her bonnet and shawl she did not attempt to move but she let marion put them on for her and then went downstairs with the rest but said not a word in explanation of how the watches came into her bag marion was crying bitterly now and vehemently declaring her own and her cousins innocence but kate did not cry or say a word and the policeman looked at her in some alarm as he went to the door to send a colleague who was in waiting to fetch a cab to remove his prisoners crying he was used to but he did not understand this silence and knew not what to think of it he told mrs maple while he was waiting for the cab where he was going to take the girls and that marions father would be permitted to see them if he came to the prison in the course of the day they would be examined before the magistrate the next morning with the other prisoners who had been taken at the theatre and perhaps by that time kate would confess who had given her the watches but alas before the next morning kate had to be removed to the prison infirmary and her mother was sent for by marions father who was so overwhelmed with trouble at what had befallen his daughter and niece that he hardly knew what to do kate was soon seriously ill for the shock had brought on an attack of brain fever and during her wild ramblings and half incoherent talk her nurses heard a good deal of how mrs maple had been deceived and robbed by her trusted shopwoman but no word about the watches found in her possession did kate ever utter by the time mrs haydon reached london the first examination of the prisoners was over and kate was so far exculpated from the charge brought against her for one of the principal thieves voluntarily stated that the girls had nothing to do with the robberythe watches had been dropped into the open bag without kates knowledge when the alarm was first raised and this fact was so far borne out by the policeman who stated how readily kate had handed him the bag saying she had it with her at the theatre mrs maple was also present to give the girls a good character but this was somewhat modified by the confession of william minn who being pressed by the magistrate gave a full account of his acquaintance with the girls and how he and his friends had been supplied with pastry at mrs maples expense by the two foolish girls marion denied nothing now her only anxiety seemed to be to screen kate as much as she could and she declared that kate had been led into doing what she did by her direction but it was small comfort to mrs haydon to hear that her daughter had been led to do wrong through the influence of her cousin the shame and disgrace of her darling daughter having been in prison so bowed her with woe that added to the bitter pain of not being able to nurse her in her illness almost laid her on a bed of sickness marion was released and returned home some days before kate could be removed from the infirmary and a more unhappy household than that can scarcely be imagined marion had of course lost her situation and her character too and was so crushed in spirit that she did not need the reproaches of her brothers and sisters to make her feel the shame of her position more keenly bitter as her aunt had felt against her for leading kate astray as she had done she could not but pity the poor girl and reflect too that kate was after all more to blame than marion for she had been more carefully taught than her cousin at last kate was able to be removed from the infirmary to her uncles house but she felt little joy or hope at the thought of getting better i dont deserve to get better mother she whispered when her mother was trying to coax her to take a little beeftea i know where i have been all this time and why you could not come to be with me always oh mother mother and kate covered her face with her hands and sobbed so violently that her mother grew quite alarmed hush hush kate you must be quiet or you will make yourself worse and if you are not fit to live how can you be fit to die said her mother firmly kate shuddered but checked her sobs oh mother i was so afraid i should and im notim not fit to die i have been such a wicked girl mother i did not steal the watches but i have done things quite as badive deceived everybody mother and yourself too said mrs haydon how could i do that mother i knew all the time that i was doing wrong of course you did my dear but you had begun to deceive yourself long before you came to london and that was when the mischief began i think i have been to blame too perhaps for i was proud of my truthful upright girl and may have let you hear me say more than was good for you to hear and you grew proud and selfrighteous as a pharisee and now now i am the worst girl living sobbed kate oh mother ive thought of it all the while i was in prison i a sunday scholar in prison she repeated with a shudder i have been a shame and disgrace to my class and teacher as well as you mother but ive sinned against god worst of all oh mother will he ever forgive me do you think yes kate he will forgive anything you have done or can do for the sake of his dear son and if you are sparedas i hope and trust you may beyou must live a very different life in future you thought you were strong enough and good enough before and did not need his grace you never felt that you were a sinner needing the blood of christ to cleanse and pardon you but now oh mother mother my sins are too great broke in kate how could the lord jesus forgive such a wicked girl as i am because he loved youloved you so much as to die for you kate my dear you have thought so much of your own goodness that it is hard for you to believe now that god can forgive you without your deserving it but was it as hard for you to believe that i would forgive you kate shook her head i knew you would forgive though i never could deserve it because you always loved me so much she said slowly my dear god loves you more than i do with a wiser purer better love than even mine and he wants you to believe it now kate and hope in him i know you have been so weak and foolish that you cannot have any hope of yourself but hope in god my darling confess all your sins to him tell him the weakness and folly you have been guilty of and ask his pardon for the past and strength and grace to live a new life in christ for the future i have prayed that he would pardon me but oh mother how can i hope how can i believe he is so great so holy by taking him at his word if i told you anything kate do you think it would be honouring me to say you are so good mother i cant believe half you say yet this is the way you are speaking of god he says him that cometh unto me i will in no wise cast out and jesus christ came into the world to save sinners mind kate it was jesus christ not the sinners repentance the tears he shed the grief he felt but jesus christ who died the just for the unjust after this talk with her mother kate grew more calm and less unhappy the prospect of going home however so different from what kate had anticipated that return would be was anything but pleasant now oh mother how can i meet miss eldon again she whispered one day it will be hard for you i know but you must bear it kate as part at least of the punishment of your sins sorrow and shame must follow sin and though god forgives us he does notcannot take away the consequences of them they are bitter enough to you and poor marion too for situations and character are both lost and it is not easy work to regain a good character when once it has been lost kates future was of course a great anxiety to her mother especially after they got home and kate grew stronger news of her disgrace had somehow got wind in the village and many of her former schoolfellows shunned her especially esther who said she had her own character to take care of gentle brave mary green now the trusted servant of lady hazeldean however contrived to see her old schoolfellow as often as she could and miss eldon convinced of her repentance offered at last to receive her as kitchenmaid in her own housea situation kate would have despised before but which she was very grateful to get now she also asked the lady to help her cousin if she could and at her request a friend took marion into her service where for the first time she had the opportunity of learning those truths kate had been taught before she went to london marion profited by what she was taught and she and kate both became useful and honoured women loved and respected by all who knew them and few remembered now that they had once been in prison or passed through such a shameful and bitter experience as kates ordeal
