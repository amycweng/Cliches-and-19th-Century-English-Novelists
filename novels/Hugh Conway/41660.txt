a fortnight of folly by maurice thompson author of alice of old vincennes a banker of bankersville etc illustration new york and london street smith publishers copyright by the alden publishing company copyright by street smith a fortnight of folly contents a fortnight of folly the tale of a sculptor by hugh conway carriston's gift a fortnight of folly i the hotel helicon stood on a great rock promontory that jutted far out into a sea of air whose currents and eddies filled a wide wild valley in the midst of our southern mountain region it was a new hotel built by a cincinnati man who founded his fortune in natural gas speculations and who had conceived the bright thought of making the house famous at the start by a stroke of rare liberality viewing the large building from any favorable point in the valley it looked like a huge white bird sitting with outstretched wings on the gray rock far up against the tender blue sky all around it the forests were thick and green the ravines deep and gloomy and the rocks tumbled into fantastic heaps when you reached it which was after a whole day of hard zig zag climbing you found it a rather plain three story house whose broad verandas were worried with a mass of jig saw fancies and whose windows glared at you between wide open green venetian shutters everything look new almost raw from the stumps of fresh cut trees on the lawn and the rope swings and long benches upon which the paint was scarcely dry to the resonant floor of the spacious halls and the cedar fragrant hand rail of the stairway there were springs among the rocks here the water trickled out with a red gleam of iron oxide there it sparkled with an excess of carbonic acid and yonder it bubbled up all the more limpid and clear on account of the offensive sulphuretted hydrogen it was bringing forth masses of fern great cushions of cool moss and tangles of blooming shrubs and vines fringed the sides of the little ravines down which the spring streams sang their way to the silver thread of a river in the valley it was altogether a dizzy perch a strange inconvenient out of the way spot for a summer hotel you reached it all out of breath confused as to the points of the compass and disappointed in every sense of the word with what at first glance struck you as a colossal pretense empty raw vulgar loud a great trap into which you had been inveigled by an eloquent hand bill hotel helicon as a name for the place was considered a happy one it had come to the proprietor as if in a dream one day as he sat smoking he slapped his thigh with his hand and sprang to his feet the word that went so smoothly with hotel as he fancied had no special meaning in his mind for the gas man had never been guilty of classical lore study but it furnished a taking alliteration hotel helicon hotel helicon he repeated that's just a dandy name hotel helicon on mount boab open for the season if that doesn't get 'em i'll back down his plans matured themselves very rapidly in his mind one brilliant idea followed another in swift succession until at last he fell upon the scheme of making hotel helicon free for the initial season to a select company of authors chosen from among the most brilliant and famous in our country zounds he exclaimed all to himself but won't that be a darling old advertisement i'll have a few sprightly newspaper people along with 'em too to do the interviewing and puffing by jacks it's just the wrinkle to a dot mr gaslucky was of the opinion that like napoleon he was in the hands of irresistible destiny which would ensure the success of whatever he might undertake still he was also a realist and depended largely upon tricks for his results he had felt the great value of what he liked to term legitimate advertising and he was fond of saying to himself that any scheme would succeed if properly set before the world he regarded it a maxim that anything which can be clearly described is a fact his realism was the gospel of success he declared and needed but to be stated to be adopted by all the world from the first he saw how his hotel was to be an intellectual focus moreover he designed to have it radiate its own glory like a star set upon mt boab the difficulties inherent in this project were from the first quite apparent to mr gaslucky but he was full of expedients and cunning he had come out of the lowest stratum of life fighting his way up to success and his knowledge of human nature was accurate if not very broad early in the summer about the first days of june in fact certain well known and somewhat distinguished american authors received by due course of mail an autograph letter from mr gaslucky which was substantially as follows cincinnati o may my dear sir the hotel helicon situated on the lencadian promontory far up the height of mt boab and overlooking the glorious valley of the big mash river amid the grandest scenery of the cumberland mountains where at their southern extremity they break into awful peaks chasms and escarpments is now thrown open to a few favored guests for the summer the proprietor in a spirit of liberality and for the purpose of making this charming hotel known to a select public is issuing a few special invitations to distinguished people to come and spend the summer free of charge you are cordially and urgently invited the hotel helicon is a place to delight the artist and the litterateur it is high airy cool surrounded by wild scenes good shooting and fishing at hand incomparable mineral springs baths grottos dark ravines and indeed everything engaging to the imagination the proprietor will exhaust effort to make his chosen guests happy the rooms are new sweet beautifully furnished and altogether comfortable and the table will have every delicacy of the season served in the best style there will be no uninvited guests all will be chosen from the most exalted class come and for one season taste the sweets of the dews of helicon without money and without price if you accept this earnest and cordial invitation notify me at once hotel helicon is at your command truly yours isaiah r gaslucky it is needless to say that this letter was the product of a professional advertising agent employed for the occasion by the proprietor of hotel helicon the reader will observe the earmarks of the creation and readily recognize the source of course when the letter was addressed to a woman there was a change not only in the gender of the terms but in the tone which took on a more persuasive color the attractions of the place were described in more poetic phrasing and a cunningly half hidden thread of romance about picturesque mountaineers and retired and reformed bandits was woven in naturally enough each individual who received this rather uncommon letter read it askance at first suspecting a trick but the newspapers soon cleared the matter up by announcing that mr isaiah gaslucky of cincinnati had conceived the happy idea of making his new and picturesque hotel helicon free this season to a small and select company of distinguished guests the hotel will not be open to the public until next year and thus it came to pass that in midsummer such a company as never before was assembled met on mt boab and made the halls of hotel helicon gay with their colors and noisy with their mirth the woods the dizzy cliffs the bubbling springs the cool hollows the windy peaks and the mossy nooks were filled with song laughter murmuring under tones of sentiment or something a little sweeter and warmer and there were literary conversations and critical talks and jolly satire bandied about with some scraps of adventure and some bits of rather ludicrous mishap thrown in for variety over all hung a summer sky for the most part cloudless and the days were as sweet as the nights were delicious ii in the afternoon of a breezy day at the time when the shadows were taking full possession of the valley the coach arrived at hotel helicon from the little railway station at the foot of mt boab a man the only passenger alighted from his perch beside the driver and for a moment stood as if a little dazed by what he saw he was very short rather round and stout and bore himself quietly almost demurely his head was large his feet and hands were small and his face wore the expression of an habitual good humor amounting nearly to jolliness albeit two vertical wrinkles between his brows hinted of a sturdy will seated behind a heavy napoleonic forehead the stubby tufts of grizzled hair that formed his mustaches shaded a mouth and chin at once strong and pleasing he impressed the group of people on the hotel veranda most favorably and at once a little buzz of inquiry circulated no one knew him that this was an important arrival could not be doubted it was felt at once and profoundly great men carry an air of individuality about with them each like a planet has his own peculiar atmosphere by which his light is modified there was no mistaking the light in this instance it indicated a luminary of the first magnitude unfortunately the guests at hotel helicon were not required to record their names in a register therefore the new comer could bide his own time to make himself known miss alice moyne of virginia the beautiful young author of two or three picturesque short stories lately published in a popular magazine was in conversation with hartley crane the rising poet from kentucky just at the moment when this new arrival caused a flutter on the veranda oh i do wonder if he can be edgar de vere she exclaimed no said hartley crane i have seen de vere he is as large and as fascinating as his romances that little pudgy individual could never make a great romantic fiction like solway moss by de vere but that is a superb head whispered miss moyne the head of a master a genius oh there are heads and heads genius and genius replied crane i guess the new comer off as a newspaper man from chicago or new york it requires first class genius to be a good reporter the stranger under discussion was now giving some directions to a porter regarding his luggage this he did with that peculiar readiness or sleight so to call it which belongs to none but the veteran traveler a moment later he came up the wooden steps of the hotel cast a comprehensive but apparently indifferent glance over the group of guests and passed into the hall where they heard him say to the boy in waiting my room is that is the reserved room remarked two or three persons at once great expectations hung about room much guessing had been indulged in considering who was to be the happy and exalted person chosen to occupy it now he had arrived an utter stranger to them all everybody looked inquiry who can he be it must be mark twain suggested little mrs philpot of memphis oh no mark twain is tall and very handsome i know mark said crane how strange ejaculated miss moyne and when everybody laughed she colored a little and added hastily i didn't mean that it was strange that mr crane should know mr twain but they drowned her voice with their laughter and hand clapping they were not always in this very light mood at hotel helicon but just now they all felt in a trivial vein it was as if the new guest had brought a breath of frivolous humor along with him and had blown it over them as he passed by room was the choice one of hotel helicon every guest wanted it on account of its convenience its size and the superb view its windows afforded but from the first it had been reserved for this favored individual whose arrival added greater mystery to the matter as the sun disappeared behind the western mountains and the great gulf of the valley became a sea of purplish gloom conversation clung in half whispers to the subject who meantime was arraying himself in evening dress for dinner posing before the large mirror in room and smiling humorously at himself as one who criticising his own foibles still holds to them with a fortitude almost christian he parted his hair in the middle but the line of division was very slight and he left a pretty half curled short wisp hanging over the centre of his forehead the wide collar that hid his short neck creased his heavy well turned jaws giving to his chin the appearance of being propped up although he was quite stout his head was so broad and his feet so small that he appeared to taper from top to toe in a way that emphasized very forcibly his expression of blended dignity and jollity youth and middle age sincerity and levity when he had finished his toilet he sat down by the best window in the best room of hotel helicon and gazed out over the dusky valley to where a line of quivering silver light played fantastically along the line of peaks that notched the delicate blue of the evening sky the breeze came in cool and sweet with a sort of champagne sparkle in its freshness and purity it whetted his appetite and blew the dust of travel out of his mind he was glad when the dinner hour arrived the long table was nearly full when he went down and he was given a seat between miss moyne and little mrs philpot by that secret cerebral trick we all know but which none of us can explain he was aware that the company had just been discussing him in fact someone had ventured to wonder if he were mr howells whereupon mr crane had promptly said that he knew mr howells quite well and that although in a general way the new comer was not unlike the famous realist he was far from identical with him laurens peck the bushy bearded new england critic whispered in someone's ear that it appeared as if crane knew everybody but that the poet's lively imagination had aided him more than his eyes in all probability fact is said he a kentuckian soon gets so that he thinks he has been everywhere and seen everybody whether he has or not out of this remark grew a serious affair which it will be my duty to record at the proper place little mrs philpot who wore gold eye glasses and had elongated dimples in her cheeks and chin dexterously managed to have a word or two with the stranger who smiled upon her graciously without attempting to enter into a conversation miss moyne fared a little better for she had the charm of grace and beauty to aid her attended by one of those puffs of good luck which come to none but the young and the beautiful mr b hobbs lucas a large and awkward historian from new york knocked over a bottle of claret with his elbow and the liquor shot with an enthusiastic sparkle diagonally across the table in order to fall on miss moyne's lap with that celerity which in very short and stout persons appears to be spontaneous a sort of elastic quality the gentleman from room interposed his suddenly outspread napkin the historian flung himself across the board after the bottle clawing rather wildly and upsetting things generally it was but a momentary scene such as children at school and guests at a summer hotel make more or less merry over still it drew forth from the genial man of room a remark which slipped into miss moyne's ear with the familiarity of well trained humor a deluge of wine in a free hotel he exclaimed just above a whisper such generosity is nearly shocking i am sorry you mention it said miss moyne with her brightest and calmest smile i have been idealizing the place a gush of grape juice on helicon is a picturesque thing to contemplate but a lap full of claret on mt boab is not so fine eh what a farce poetry is what a humbug is romance the historian had sunk back in his chair and was scowling at the purple stain which kept slowly spreading through the fiber of the cloth i always do something he sighed and his sincerity was obvious and always with aplomb remarked little mrs philpot it would be a genius who could knock over a claret bottle with grace added peck now a jug of ale i was present at table once with mr emerson began the kentucky poet but nobody heard the rest a waiter came with a heavy napkin to cover the stain and as he bent over the table he forced the man from room to incline very close to miss moyne to think of making an instance of emerson he murmured emerson who died before he discovered that men and women have to eat or that wine will stain a new dress but then he discovered so many things she began please mention one of them he glibly interrupted what did emerson ever discover did he ever pen a single truth aloft in secret veins of air blows the sweet breath of song she replied he trod the very headlands of truth but you are not serious she checked herself recollecting that she was speaking to a stranger not serious but emphatically in earnest he went on in the same genial tone with which he had begun there isn't a thing but cunning phrase form in anything the man ever wrote he didn't know how to represent life oh i see miss moyne ventured you are a realist it is impossible to convey any adequate idea of the peculiar shade of contempt she conveyed through the words she lifted her head a little higher and her beauty rose apace it was as if she had stamped her little foot and exclaimed of all things i detest realism of all men i hate realists but i kept the wine off your dress he urged as though he had heard her thought there's nothing good but what is real romance is lie tissue reality is truth tissue permit me to thank you for your good intentions she said with a flash of irony you held the napkin just in the right position but the wine never fell from the table still your kindness lost nothing in quality because the danger was imaginary when dinner was over miss moyne sought out hartley crane the kentucky poet who knew everybody and suggested that perhaps the stranger was mr arthur selby the analytical novelist whose name was on everybody's tongue but arthur selby is thin and bald and has a receding chin i met him often at the i forget the club in new york said crane it's more likely that he's some reporter he's a snob anyway dear me no not a snob mr crane he is the most american man i ever met replied miss moyne but americans are the worst of all snobs he insisted especially literary americans they adore everything that's foreign and pity everything that's home made as he said this he was remembering how tennyson's and browning's poems were overshadowing his own even in kentucky from the ring of his voice miss moyne suspected something of this sort and adroitly changed the subject iii it might be imagined that a hotel full of authors would be sure to generate some flashes of disagreement but for a time at least everything went on charmingly at hotel helicon true enough the name of the occupant of room remained a vexatious secret which kept growing more and more absorbing as certain very cunningly devised schemes for its exposure were easily thwarted but even this gave the gentleman a most excellent excuse for nagging the ladies in regard to feminine curiosity and lack of generalship under the circumstances it was not to be expected that everybody should be strictly guarded in the phrasing of speech still so genial and good humored was the nameless man and so engaging was his way of evading or turning aside every thrust that he steadily won favor little mrs philpot whose seven year old daughter a bright and sweet little child had become the pet of hotel helicon was enthusiastic in her pursuit of the stranger's name and at last she hit upon a plan that promised immediate success she giggled all to herself like a high school girl instead of like a widow of thirty as she contemplated certain victory now do you think you can remember dear she said to may the child after having explained over and over again what she wished her to do yeth said may who lisped charmingly in the sweetest of child voices well what must you say i muth thay pleathe write your your autograph yeth your au to graph in my album that's right autograph autograph don't forget now let me hear you say it pleathe write your autograph in my book mrs philpot caught the child to her breast and kissed it vigorously and not long afterward little may went forth to try the experiment she was armed with her mother's autograph album when she approached her victim he thought he never had seen so lovely a child the mother had not spared pains to give most effect to the little thing's delicate and appealing beauty by an artistic arrangement of the shining gold hair and by the simplest but cunningest tricks of color and drapery with that bird like shyness so winning in a really beautiful little girl may walked up to the stranger and made a funny hesitating courtesy he looked at her askance his smiling face shooting forth a ray of tenderness along with a gleam of shrewd suspicion as he made out the album in her dimpled little hand good morning little one he said cheerily have you come to make a call he held out both hands and looked so kindly and good that she smiled until dimples just like her mother's played over her cheeks and chin half sidewise she crept into his arms and held up the book pleathe write your photograph in my book she murmured he took her very gently on his knee chuckling vigorously his heavy jaws shaking and coloring who told you to come he inquired with a guilty cunning twinkle in his gray eyes mama told me was the prompt answer again the man chuckled and between the shame he felt for having betrayed the child and delight at the success of his perfidy he grew quite red in the face he took the autograph album and turned its stiff ragged edged leaves glancing at the names ah this is your mama's book is it he went on yeth it is said may and i must write my name in it no your your well what i don't 'member he took from his pocket a stylographic pen and dashed a picturesque sign manual across a page while the ink was drying he tenderly kissed the child's forehead and then rested his chin on her bright hair he could hear the clack of balls and mallets and the creak of a lazy swing down below on the so called lawn and a hum of voices arose from the veranda he looked through the open window and saw as in a dream blue peaks set against a shining rim of sky with a wisp of vultures slowly wheeling about in a filmy sheeny space mama said i muthn't stay apologized the child slipping down from his knee which she had found uncomfortably short he pulled himself together from a diffused state of revery and beamed upon her again with his cheerful smile she turned near the door and dropped another comical little courtesy bobbing her curly head till her hair twinkled like a tangle of starbeams on a brook ripple then she darted away book in hand little mrs philpot snatched the album from may as she ran to her and greedily rustled the leaves in search of the new record finding which she gazed at it while her face irradiated every shade of expression between sudden delight and utter perplexity in fact she could not decipher the autograph although the handwriting surely was not bad loath as she naturally was to sharing her secret with her friends curiosity at length prevailed and she sought help everybody in turn tried to make out the two short words all in vain till crane by the poet's subtle vision cleared up the mystery at least to his own satisfaction gaspard dufour is the name he asserted with considerable show of conscious superiority a canadian i think in fact i imperfectly recall meeting him once at a dinner given by the governor general to lord rosenthal at quebec he writes plays another romance out of the whole cloth by the bourbon aesthete whispered the critic there's no such a canadian as gaspard dufour and besides the man's a westerner rather over bostonized i can tell by his voice and his mixed manners but mrs hope would know him suggested the person addressed she meets all the hub literati you know literati snarled the critic putting an end to further discussion a few minutes later mr gaspard dufour came down and passed out of the hotel taking his way into the nearest ravine he wore a very short coat and a slouch hat in his hand he carried a bundle of fishing rod joints a man of his build looks far from dignified in such dress at best but nothing could have accentuated more sharply his absurd grotesqueness of appearance than the peculiar waddling gait he assumed as he descended the steep place and passed out of sight a fish basket bobbing beside him and a red kerchief shining around his throat everybody looked at his neighbor and smiled inquisitively now that they had discovered his name the question arose what had gaspard dufour ever done that he should be accorded the place of honor in hotel helicon no one save crane in a shadowy way had ever heard of him before no doubt they all felt a little twinge of resentment but dufour disappearing down the ravine had in some unaccountable way deepened his significance iv everybody knows that a mountain hotel has no local color no sympathy with its environment no gift of making its guests feel that they are anywhere in particular it is all very delightful to be held aloft on the shoulder of a giant almost within reach of the sky but the charm of the thing is not referable to any definite visible cause such as one readily bases one's love of the sea side on or such as accounts for our delight in the life of a great city no matter how fine the effect of clouds and peaks and sky and gorge no matter how pure and exhilarating the air or how blue the filmy deeps of distance or how mossy the rocks or how sweet the water or how cool the wooded vales the hotel stands there in an indefinite way with no raison d'etre visible in its make up but with an obvious impudence gleaming from its windows one cannot deport one's self at such a place as if born there the situation demands nay exacts behavior somewhat special and peculiar no lonely island in the sea is quite as isolated and out of the world as the top of any mountain nor can any amount of man's effort soften in the least the savage individuality of mountain scenery so as to render those high places familiar or homelike or genuinely habitable delightful enough and fascinating enough all mountain hotels surely are but the sensation that living in one of them induces is the romantic consciousness of being in a degree out of space out of time no doubt this feeling was heightened and intensified in the case of the guests at hotel helicon who were enjoying the added novelty of entire freedom from the petty economies that usually dog the footsteps and haunt the very dreams of the average summer sojourner at all events they were mostly a light hearted set given over to a freedom of speech and action which would have horrified them on any lower plane scarcely had gaspard dufour passed beyond sight down the ravine in search of a trout brook than he became the subject of free discussion nothing strictly impolite was said about him but everybody in some way expressed amazement at everybody's ignorance of a man whose importance was apparent and whose name vaguely and tauntingly suggested to each one of them a half recollection of having seen it in connection with some notable literary sensation is there a member of the french institute by the name of dufour inquired r hobbs lucas the historian thoughtfully knitting his heavy brows i am sure not said hartley crane for i met most of the members when i was last at paris and i do not recall the name there goes that bourbon again muttered laurens peck the critic if one should mention xenophon that fellow would claim a personal acquaintance with him it was plain enough that peck did not value crane very highly and crane certainly treated peck very coolly miss moyne however was blissfully unaware that she was the cause of this trouble and for that matter the men themselves would have denied with indignant fervor any thing of the kind both of them were stalwart and rather handsome the kentuckian dark and passionate looking the new yorker fair cool and willful in appearance miss moyne had been pleased with them both without a special thought of either whilst they were going rapidly into the worry and rapture of love with no care for anybody but her she was beautiful and good sweet voiced gentle more inclined to listen than to talk and so she captivated everybody from the first i think it would be quite interesting she said if it should turn out that mr dufour is a genuine foreign author like tolstoi or daudet or realists and nobody but realists interposed mrs philpot why don't you say zola and have done with it well zola then if it must be miss moyne responded for barring my american breeding and my southern conservatism i am nearly in sympathy with no not that exactly but we are so timid i should like to feel a change in the literary air oh you talk just as arthur selby writes in his critical papers he's all the time trying to prove that fiction is truth and that truth is fiction he lauds zola's and dostoieffsky's filthy novels to the skies but in his own novels he's as prudish and puritanish as if he had been born on plymouth rock instead of on an illinois prairie i wonder why he is not a guest here some one remarked i should have thought that our landlord would have had him at all hazards just now selby is monopolizing the field of american fiction in fact i think he claims the earth it is so easy to assume said guilford ferris whose romances always commanded eulogy from the press but invariably fell dead on the market but i am told that selby makes almost nothing from the sales of his books but the magazines pay him handsomely said miss moyne yes they do replied ferris pulling his long brown mustache reflectively and i can't see why he really is not popular there is no enthusiasm for his fiction it's a mere vogue begotten by the critics said hartley crane criticism is at a very low ebb in america our critics are all either ignorant or given over to putting on english and french airs ferris opened his eyes in a quiet way and glanced at peck who however did not appear to notice the remark there's a set of them in boston and new york crane went on who watch the revue de deux mondes and the london atheneum ready to take the cue from them even american books must stand or fall by the turn of the foreign thumb that is a very ancient grumble said ferris in a tone indicative of impartial indifference take these crude loose awkward almost obscene russian novels continued crane and see what a furor the critics of new york and boston have fermented in their behalf all because it chanced that a coterie of parisian literary roues fancied the filthy imaginings of dostoieffsky and the raw vulgarity of tolstoi what would they say of you ferris if you should write so low and dirty a story as crime and its punishment by dostoieffsky oh i don't know and begging your grace i don't care a straw ferris replied the publishers would steal all my profits in any event do you really believe that inquired peck believe it i know it said ferris when did you ever know of a publisher advertising a book as in its fiftieth thousand so long as the author had any royalty on the sales the only book of mine that ever had a run was one i sold outright in the manuscript to george dunkirk co who publish all my works that puerile effort is now in its ninetieth thousand while the best of the other six has not yet shown up two thousand do you catch the point but what difference can printing a statement of the books sold make anyway innocently inquired miss moyne ferris laughed all the difference in the world he said the publisher would have to account to the author for all those thousands don't you see but they have to account anyhow replied miss moyne with a perplexed smile account exclaimed ferris contemptuously account yes they have to account but they account to me miss moyne gently insisted who are your publishers he demanded george dunkirk co was the answer well said he i'll wager you anything i can come within twenty of guessing the sales up to date of your book it has sold just eleven hundred and forty copies she laughed merrily and betrayed the dangerous closeness of his guess by coloring a little oh its invariably just eleven hundred and forty copies no matter what kind of a book it is or what publisher has it he continued i've investigated and have settled the matter the historian was suddenly thoughtful little mrs philpot appeared to be making some abstruse calculation crane was silently gazing at the ground and peck with grim humor in his small eyes remarked that eleven hundred and forty was a pretty high average upon the whole just at this point a figure appeared in the little roadway where it made its last turn lapsing from the wood toward the hotel a rather tall slender and angular young woman bearing a red leather bag in one hand and a blue silk umbrella in the other strode forward with the pace of a tragedienne she wore a bright silk dress leaf green in color and a black bonnet of nearly the salvation army pattern was set far back on her head giving full play to a mass of short fine loosely tumbled yellow hair she was very much out of breath from her walk up the mountain but there was a plucky smile on her rather sallow face and an enterprising gleam in her light eyes she walked right into the hotel as if she had always lived there and they heard her talking volubly to the servant as she was following him to a room everybody felt a waft of free western air and knew that hotel helicon had received another interesting guest original if not typical with qualities that soon must make themselves respected in a degree walked from the station mrs philpot ventured in querulous though kindly interrogation up the mountain miss moyne added with a deprecatory inflection and carried that bag exclaimed all the rest v gaspard dufour whose accumulations of adipose tissue appeared to serve him a good turn as he descended the steep rocky ravine hummed a droll tune which was broken at intervals by sundry missteps and down sittings and side wise bumps against the jutting crags he perspired freely mopping his brow meantime with a vast silk kerchief that hung loosely about his short neck the wood grew denser as he descended and a damp mouldy odor pervaded the spaces underneath the commingling boughs of the oaks pines cedars and sassafras here and there a lizard scampered around a tree hole or darted under the fallen leaves overhead certain shadowy flittings betrayed the presence of an occasional small bird demurely going about its business of food getting the main elements of the surroundings however were gloom and silence the breeze currents astir in the valley and rippling over the gray peaks of mt boab could not enter the leafy chambers of this wooded gorge heat of a peculiarly sultry sort seemed to be stored here for as dufour proceeded he began at length to gasp for breath and it was with such relief as none but the suffocating can fully appreciate that he emerged into an open space surrounded almost with butting limestone cliffs but cut across by a noisy little stream that went bubbling down into the valley through a cleft bedecked with ferns and sprinkled with perennial dew from a succession of gentle cascades the ideal trout brook was this so far as appearances could go at the foot of each tiny water fall was a swirling pool semi opaque giving forth emerald flashes and silver glints and bearing little cones of creamy foam round and round on its bosom a thousand noises every one a water note rising all along the line of the brook's broken current clashed together with an effect like that of hearing a far off multitude applauding or some distant army rushing on a charge so much out of breath and so deluged with perspiration was dufour that he flung himself upon the ground beside the brook and lay there panting and mopping his face overhead the bit of sky was like turquoise below a slender glimpse of the valley shone between the rock walls like a sketch subdued almost to monochrome of crepuscular purple a fitful breath of cool air fell into the place fanning the man's almost purple cheeks and forehead while a wood thrush whose liquid voice might have been regarded as part of the water tumult sang in a thorn tree hard by in a half reclining attitude dufour gave himself over to the delicious effect of all this indulging at the same time in the impolite and ridiculous but quite shakespearian habit of soliloquizing jingo he remarked jingo but isn't this a daisy prospect for trout if those pools aren't full of the beauties then there's nothing in waltonian lore and life isn't worth living ha jingo there went one clean above the water a ten ouncer at least he sprang at his rod as if to break it to pieces and the facility with which he fitted the joints and the reel and run the line and tied the cast was really a wonder i knew they were here he muttered just as soon as i laid my eyes on the water who ever did see such another brook at the third cast of the fly a brown hackle by the way up came a trout with a somersault and a misty gleam of royal purple and silver attended by a spray of water and a short bubbling sound dufour struck deftly hooking the beautiful fish very insecurely through the edge of the lower lip immediately the reel began to sing and the rod to quiver while dufour's eyes glared almost savagely and his lips pursed with comical intensity round and round flew the trout now rushing to the bottom of the pool now whisking under a projecting ledge and anon flinging itself clean above the water and shaking itself convulsively the angler was led hither and thither by his active prey the exercise bedewing his face again with perspiration whilst his feet felt the cool bath of water and the soothing embrace of tangled water grass the mere switch of a bamboo rod bent almost into a loop shook like a rush in a wind dufour was ill prepared to formulate a polite response when at the height of his sport a gentle but curiously earnest voice exclaimed snatch 'im out snatch 'im out dog gone yer clumsy hide snatch 'im out er i'll do it for ye the trout must have heard for as the angler turned to get a hasty glance at the stranger up it leaped and by a desperate shake broke the snell confound you cried dufour his face redder than ever confound your meddlesome tongue why didn't you keep still till i landed him there was a tableau set against the gray lichen bossed rocks two men glaring at each other the new comer was a tall athletic brown faced mountaineer bearing a gun and wearing two heavy revolvers he towered above dufour and gazed down upon him as if about to execute him the latter did not quail but grew angrier instead you ought to have better sense than to interfere with my sport in such a way who are you anyway he cried in a hot fierce tone the mountaineer stood silent for a moment as if collecting words enough for what he felt like saying then see yer he drawled rather musically ef i take ye by the scruff o' yer neck an' the heel o' yer stockin' an' jest chuck ye inter thet puddle ye'll begin to surmise who i air ye saucy little duck legged minny catcher you dufour remembering his long training years ago at the gentlemen's glove club squared himself with fists in position having flung aside his tackle in his righteous rage he forgot that his adversary was not only his superior in stature but also heavily armed well thet' ther' do beat me said the mountaineer with an incredulous ring in his voice the very idee w'y ye little aggervatin' banty rooster a puttin' up yer props at me w'y i'll jest eternally and everlastin'ly wring yer neck an' swob the face o' nature wi' ye what followed was about as indescribable as a whirlwind in dry grass the two men appeared to coalesce for a single wild whirling resounding instant and then the mountaineer went over headlong into the middle of the pool with a great plash and disappeared dufour in a truly gladiatorial attitude gazed fiercely at the large dimple in which his antagonist was buried for the instant but out of which he presently projected himself with great promptness then as a new thought came to him he seized the fallen gun of the mountaineer cocked it and leveled it upon its owner there was a peculiar meaning in his words as he stormed out lie down down with you or i blow a hole clean through you instantly promptly enough the mountaineer lay down until the water rippled around his chin and floated his flaxen beard some moments of peculiar silence followed broken only by the lapsing gurgle and murmur of the brook dufour with arms as steady as iron bars kept the heavy gun bearing on the gasping face of the unwilling bather whilst at the same time he was dangerously fingering the trigger the stout short figure really had a muscular and doughty air and the heavy face certainly looked warlike stranger a seein' 'at ye've got the drap onto me 'spose we swear off an' make up friends the man in the water said this at length in the tone of one presenting a suggestion of doubtful propriety don't hardly think you've cooled off sufficiently do you responded dufour this here's spring warter ye must 'member offered the mountaineer the gun was beginning to tire dufour's arms well do you knock under he inquired still carelessly fumbling the trigger great mind ter say yes was the shivering response oh take your time to consider i'm in no hurry said dufour if the man in the water could have known how the supple but of late untrained arms of the man on shore were aching the outcome might have been different but the bath was horribly cold and the gun's muzzle kept its bearing right on the bather's eye i give in ye've got me stranger he at last exclaimed dufour was mightily relieved as he put down the gun and watched his dripping and shivering antagonist wade out of the cold pool the men looked at each other curiously ye're the dog gone'dest man 'at ever i see remarked the mountaineer who air ye anyhow oh i'm a pretty good fellow if you take me on the right tack said dufour the other hesitated a moment and then inquired air ye one o' them people up at the tavern on the mounting yes a boardin' there yes for all summer possibly again there was a silence during which the water trickled off the mountaineer's clothes and ran over the little stones at his feet goin' ter make fun o' me when ye git up thar the catechism was at length resumed dufour laughed i could tell a pretty good thing on you he answered taking a sweeping observation of the stalwart fellow's appearance as he stood there with his loose jeans trousers and blue cotton shirt clinging to his shivering limbs see yer now said the latter in a wheedling tone and wringing his light thin beard with one sinewy dark hand see yer now i'd like for ye not ter do thet strenger why well said the mountaineer after some picturesque hesitation and faltering 'cause i hev a 'quaintance o' mine up ther' at thet tavern indeed have you who is it mebbe ye mought be erquainted with miss sarah anna crabb no well she's up ther' she stayed all night at our house las' night an' went on up ther' this mornin' she's a literary woman an' purty an' smart an' a mighty much of a talker ugh jest tell her 'at ye met me down yer an' 'at i'm tol'ble well but don't say nothin' 'bout this 'ere duckin' 'at ye gi' me will ye oh of course that's all right dufour hastened to say feeling an indescribable thrill of sympathy for the man yer's my hand strenger an' w'en wesley tolliver gives a feller his hand hit means all there air ter mean exclaimed the latter as warmly as his condition would permit an' w'en ye need er friend in these parts jest come ter me he shouldered his gun thereupon and remarking that he might as well be going strode away over a spur of the mountain his clothes still dripping and sticking close to his muscular limbs dufour found his rod broken and his reel injured by having felt the weight of wesley tolliver's foot and so he too turned to retrace his steps such an adventure could not fail to gain in spectacular grotesqueness as it took its place in the memory and imagination of dufour he had been in the habit of seeing such things on the stage and of condemning them out of hand as the baldest melodramatic nonsense so that now he could not fairly realize the matter as something that had taken place in his life he was very tired and hungry when he reached hotel helicon vi oh yes i walked all the way up the mountain from the railroad depot explained the young woman whose arrival we chronicled in another chapter but i stopped over night at a cabin on the way and discovered some just delightful characters the tollivers regular craddock sort of people an old lady and her son by some method known only to herself she had put herself upon a speaking plane with dufour who as she approached him was standing in an angle of the wide wooden veranda waiting for the moon to rise over the distant peaks of the eastern mountains i saw mr tolliver to day while whipping a brook down here said he turning to look her squarely in the face oh did you isn't he a virile villainous noble and altogether melodramatic looking man i wish there was some one here who could sketch him for me but say mr dufour what do you mean please when you speak of whipping a brook she took from her pocket a little red note book and a pencil as he promptly responded whipping a brook oh that's angler's nonsense it means casting the line into the water you know that's funny she remarked making a note she was taller than dufour and so slender and angular that in comparison with his excessive plumpness she looked gaunt and bony in speaking her lips made all sorts of wild contortions showing her uneven teeth to great effect and the extreme rapidity of her utterance gave an explosive emphasis to her voice over her forehead which projected a fluffy mass of pale yellow hair sprang almost fiercely as if to attack her scared and receding chin you are from michigan i believe miss crabb remarked dufour oh dear no she answered growing red in the face no indeed i am from indiana from ringville associate editor of the star pardon i meant indiana of course i knew you were not from michigan thanks with a little laugh and a shrug i am glad you see the point i usually do a little late he remarked complacently you are from boston then i infer she glibly responded not precisely he said with an approving laugh but i admit that i have some bostonian qualities at this point in the conversation she was drooping over him so to say and he was sturdily looking up into her bright insistent face what a group said crane to mrs bridges a new york fashion editor i'd give the best farm in kentucky so far as my title goes for a photograph of it doesn't she appear to be just about to peck out his eyes your lofty imagination plays you fantastic tricks said mrs bridges is she the famous western lady reporter the same of the ringville star i met her at the cincinnati convention it was there that bascom of the bugle called her a bag of gimlets because she bored him so oh this exclamation was not in response to what crane had said but it was an involuntary tribute to the moon flower just flaring into bloom between twin peaks lying dusky and heavy against the mist of silver and gold that veiled the sweet sky beyond a semi circle of pale straw colored fire gleamed in the lowest angle of the notch and sent up long wavering lines of light almost to the zenith paling the strongest stars and intensifying the shadows in the mountain gorges and valleys grim as angry gods the pines stood along the slopes as if gloomily contemplating some dark scheme of vengeance a real sapphic said crane dropping into a poetical tone as an elocutionist does when he is hungry for an opportunity to recite a favorite sketch why a sapphic inquired the matter of fact fashion editor oh don't you remember that fragment that glorious picture sappho's divine genius has made for us he quoted some greek about as divine as choctaw or kickapoo she said i understand the moon shine better in fact i have a sincere contempt for all this transparent clap trap you poets and critics indulge in when you got upon your greek hobby divine sappho indeed a lot of bald bits of jargon made famous by the comments of fogies let's look at the moon please and be sincere sincere yes you know very well that if you had written the sapphic fragments the critics would the critics what of them they are a set of disappointed poetasters themselves blind with rage at their own failures they snap right and left without rhyme or reason now there's peck a regular well sir a regular what very coolly demanded the critic who had stepped forth from a shadowy angle and now stood facing crane a regular star gazer said mrs bridges tell us why the planets yonder all look so ghastly through the shimmering moonlight peck without reply turned and walked away is he offended she asked no he gives offence but can not take it mrs bridges grew silent we were speaking of sappho observed crane again gliding into an elocutionary mood i have translated the fragment that i repeated a while ago let me give it to you when on the dusky violet sky the full flower of the moon blooms high the stars turn pale and die just then miss moyne dressed all in white floated by on peck's arm uttering a silvery gust of laughter in response to a cynical observation of the critic what a lovely girl she is said mrs bridges mr peck shows fine critical acumen in being very fond of her crane was desperately silent he's a handsome man too and i suspect it's a genuine love affair mrs bridges went on fanning herself complacently back and forth walking slowly and conversing in a soft minor key save when now and then miss moyne laughed melodiously the promenaders passed and repassed peck never deigning to glance toward crane who had forgotten both sappho and the moon miss moyne did however once or twice turn her eyes upon the silent poet oh went on miss crabb filling dufour's ears with the hurried din of her words oh i'm going to write a novel about this place i never saw a better chance for local color real transcripts from life original scenes and genuine romance all tumbled together don't you think i might do it it does appear tempting said dufour there's tolliver for instance a genuine chilhowee moonshiner he appeared to laugh inwardly as he spoke indeed he heard the plash of water and the dripping shivering mountaineer stood forth in his memory down there in the gorge a moonshiner gasped miss crabb fluttering the leaves of her note book and writing by moonlight with a celerity that amazed dufour potentially at least he replied evasively he looks like one and he don't like water if he does turn out to be a real moonshiner miss crabb proceeded reflectively to say it will be just too delicious for anything i don't mind telling you confidentially mr dufour that i am to write some letters while here to the chicago daily lightning express so i'd take it as a great favor if you'd give me all the points you get that's interesting he said with a keen scrutiny of her face for a second i shall be glad to be of assistance to you he made a movement to go but lingered to say pray give me all the points too will you oh are you a journalist too she inquired breathlessly hanging over him what paper i'm not much of anything he hurriedly interposed but i like to know what is going on that's all he walked away without further excuse and went up to his room i've got to watch him soliloquized miss crabb or he'll get the scoop of all the news give him points indeed maybe so but not till after i've sent them to the lightning express i'll keep even with him or know the reason why it was a grand panorama that the climbing moon lighted up all around mount boab a vast billowy sea of gloom and sheen here were shining cliffs there dusky gulches yonder the pines glittered like steel armed sentinels on the hill tops whilst lower down they appeared to skulk like cloaked assassins shadows came and went now broad winged and wavering again slender and swift as the arrows of death the hotel was bright within and without some one was at the grand piano in the hall making rich music a fragment from beethoven and a great horned owl down the ravine was booming an effective counterpoint crane stood leaning on the railing of the veranda and scowling savagely as peck and miss moyne continued to promenade and converse he was without doubt considering sinister things mrs bridges finding him entirely unsympathetic went to join miss crabb who was alone where she had been left by dufour meantime up in his room with his chair tilted far back and his feet thrust out over the sill of an open window dufour was smoking a fragrant cuban cigar fifty cents at retail and alternating smiles with frowns as he contemplated his surroundings authors he thought are the silliest the vainest and the most impractical lot of human geese that ever were plucked for their valuable feathers and newspaper people humph he chuckled till his chin shook upon his immaculate collar just the idea now of that young woman asking me to furnish her with points there was something almost jocund blent with his air of solid self possession and he smoked the precious cigars one after another with prodigal indifference and yet with the perfect grace of him to the manner born hotel helicon on mt boab he repeated and then betook himself to bed vii some people are born to find things out to overhear to reach a place just at the moment in which an event comes to pass there born indeed with the news gatherer's instinct perfectly developed miss crabb was one of these how she chanced to over hear some low spoken but deadly sounding words that passed between peck and crane it would be hard to say still she overheard them and her heart jumped almost into her mouth it was a thrillingly dramatic passage there under the heavy topped oak by the west veranda in the gloom villain exclaimed crane in the hissing voice of a young tragedy player at rehearsal villain you shall not escape me defend yourself nonsense said peck you talk like a fool i don't want to fight what's that you've got in your hand a sword you cowardly craven you call me a coward if i had a good club i should soon show you what i could do you sneaking assassin more words and just as bitter followed till at last a fight was agreed upon to take place immediately at a certain point on the verge of a cliff not far away there were to be no seconds and the meeting was to end in the death of one or both of the combatants to miss crabb all this had a sound and an appearance as weird as anything in the wildest romance she ever had read it was near mid night the hotel was quite soundless and the moon on high made the shadows short and black meet me promptly at the eagle's nest in ten minutes said crane i'll fetch my other sword and give you choice all right sir responded peck but a club would do the peculiar hollowness of their voices affected the listener as if the sounds had come from a tomb she felt clammy doubtless there is a considerable element of humorous almost ludicrous bravado in such a scene when coolly viewed but miss crabb could not take a calm critical attitude just then at first she was impelled almost irresistibly toward interfering and preventing a bloody encounter but her professional ambition swept the feeling aside still being a woman she was dreadfully nervous ugh she shuddered it will be just awful but i can't afford to miss getting the full particulars for the lightning express a sure enough duel it will make my fortune oh if i were a man now just only for a few hours what a comfort it would be but all the same i must follow them i must see the encounter describe it as an eye witness and send it by wire early in the morning it occurred to her mind just then that the nearest telegraph station was twelve miles down the mountain but she did not flinch or waver the thought that she was required to do what a man might well have shrunk from gave an element of heroism to her pluck she was conscious of this and went about her task with an elasticity and facility truly admirable eagle's nest was the name of a small area on the top of a beetling cliff whose almost perpendicular wall was dotted with clumps of sturdy little cedar trees growing out of the chinks it was a dizzy place at all times but by night the effect of its airy height was very trying on any but the best nerves crane and peck both were men of fine physique and were possessed of stubborn courage and great combativeness they met on the spot and after choosing swords coolly and promptly proceeded to the fight on one hand close to the cliff's edge was a thick mass of small oak bushes on the other hand lay a broken wall of fragmentary stones the footing space was fairly good though a few angular blocks of stone lay here and there and some brushes of stiff wood grass were scattered around crane led with more caution than one would have expected of an irate kentuckian and peck responded with the brilliant aplomb of an enthusiastic duelist the swords were neither rapiers nor broad swords being the ordinary dress weapons worn by confederate infantry officers in the war time weapons with a history since they had been at the thigh of father and son the bravest of kentucky cranes through many a stormy battle peck's back was toward the precipice brink at the commencement of the engagement but neither had much the advantage as the moon was almost directly overhead as their weapons began to flash and clink the slender keen echoes fell over into the yawning chasm and went rattling down the steep ragged face of the precipice they were vigorous and rather good fencers and it would have been evident to an onlooker of experience that the fight was to be a long one notwithstanding the great weight of the swords they were using they soon began to fight fiercely and grew more vehemently aggressive each second their blows and thrusts and parries and counter cuts following each other faster and faster until the sounds ran together and the sparks leaped and shone even in the bright moonlight they mingled broad sword exercise with legitimate rapier fencing and leaped about each other like boxers their weapons whirling darting rising falling whilst their breathing became loud and heavy it was a scene to have stirred the blood of men and women four hundred years ago when love was worth fighting for and when men were quite able and willing to fight for it the combatants strained every point of their strength and skill and not a drop of blood could either draw slash thrust whack clink clank clack click cling round and round they labored the fury of their efforts flaming out of their eyes and concentrating in the deep lines of their mouths as if to listen the breeze lay still in the trees and the great owl quit hooting in the ravine faster and faster fell the blows swifter and keener leaped the thrusts quicker and surer the parries were interposed the swords were hacked and notched like hand saws the blades shook and hummed like lyre cords now close to the cliff's edge now over by the heap of broken stones and then close beside the clump of oak bushes the men panting and sweating their muscles knotted their sinews leaping like bow strings their eyes standing out as if starting from their sockets pursued each other without a second's rest or wavering at last with an irresistible spurt of fury crane drove peck right into the bushes with a great crash and would not let him out the critic was not vanquished however for despite the foliage and twigs he continued to parry and thrust with dangerous accuracy and force just at this point a strange thing happened right behind peck there was a tearing crashing sound and a cry loud keen despairing terrible followed immediately by the noise of a body descending among the cedars growing along the face of the awful precipice it was a woman's voice shrieking in deadly horror that then came up out of the dizzy depth of space below the men let fall their swords and leaped to the edge of the cliff with the common thought that it was miss moyne who had fallen over they reeled back giddy and sick staggering as if drunken far down they had seen something white fluttering and gleaming amid a tuft of cedars and a quavering voice had cried help help oh help and so the duel was at an end viii hotel helicon was shaken out of its sleep by the startling rumor to the effect that miss moyne had fallen down the precipice at eagle's nest of all the rudely awakened and mightily frightened inmates perhaps miss moyne herself was most excited by this waft of bad news she had been sleeping very soundly in dreamless security and did not at first feel the absurdity of being told that she had just tumbled down the escarpment which in fact she never yet had summoned the courage to approach even when sustained by a strong masculine arm o dear how did it happen she demanded of her aunt mrs coleman rhodes who had rushed upon her dainty couch with the frightful announcement of her accident oh alice you are here you are not hurt at all oh mrs rhodes went on and what can it all mean everybody rushed out of course as soon as hurried dressing would permit and fell into the confusion that filled the halls and main veranda crane was talking in a loud but well modulated strain explaining the accident mr peck and i he went on to say were enjoying a friendly turn at sword play up here at eagle's nest couldn't sleep needed exercise and went up there so as not to disturb any one while we were fencing she came rushing past through those bushes and leaped right over with a great shriek she don't stop to talk cried mr e hobbs lucas with a directness and clearness quite unusual in a historian don't stop to talk let's go do something yes come on quavered poor peck his face whiter than the moon and his beard quivering in sympathy with his voice oh it's dreadful awful moaned little mrs philpot poor dear miss moyne to think that she is gone and she leaned heavily on miss moyne's shoulder as she spoke it was a strange scene too confused for the best dramatic effect but spectacular in the extreme servants swarmed out with lights that wavered fantastically in the moonshine while the huddled guests swayed to and fro in a body every face was pinched with intense excitement and looked haggard under its crown of disheveled hair even the hotel windows stared in stupid horror and the kindly countenances of the negro waiters took on a bewildered and meaningless grin set in a black scowl of superstition and terror when dufour came upon the scene he did not appear in the least flurried and the first thing he did was to lay his hand on miss moyne's shoulder and exclaim in a clear tenor strain why here it's all a mistake what are you talking about here's miss moyne here she stands mercy where enquired little mrs philpot who was still leaning on her friend and shedding bitter tears dufour with a quiet please don't take offence put a hand on either side of miss moyne and lifted her so that she stood in a chair looking very sweetly down over the crowd of people few indeed are they who can look beautiful under such circumstances but miss moyne certainly did especially in the eyes of crane and peck as they gazed up at her forthwith the tragedy became a farce that kentuckian must romance i suppose grumbled r hobbs lucas wonder what he'll tell next i don't see how i could be so mistaken said peck after quiet had been somewhat restored i would have willingly been sworn to he was interrupted by a dozen voices hurling ironical phrases at him it is every word truth exclaimed crane testily do you suppose i would trifle with so oh don't you absolutely know that we suppose just that very thing said lucas with the return of self consciousness the company began to scatter the ladies especially scampering to their rooms with rustling celerity the men grumbled not a little as if being deprived of a shocking accident touched them with a sting the grotesque idea ejaculated dufour such a practical joke impractical joke i might better say could originate only between a poet and a critic everybody went back to bed feeling more or less injured by crane and peck who shared in their own breasts the common impression that they had made great fools of themselves if these crest fallen knights so lately militant and self confident had any cause of quarrel now it was based upon a question as to which should feel the meaner and which should more deeply dread to meet miss moyne on the morrow as for miss moyne herself she was indignant although she tried to quiet her aunt who was ready to shake the dust of mt boab from her feet at once next morning however when it was discovered that miss crabb was missing and that after all something tragic probably had happened everybody felt relieved ix mr wesley tolliver might well have served the turn of romancer or realist as he stood in the shadow of a cedar clump with the mysterious stillness of midnight all around him he was a very real and substantial looking personage and yet his gun his pistols his fantastic mountain garb and the wild setting in which he was framed gave him the appearance of a strong sketch meant to illustrate a story by craddock above him towered the cliff at eagle's nest and near by was the mountain pocket in which nestled the little distillery whose lurking place had long been the elusive dream of utopian revenue officers in a space of brilliant moonlight tolliver's dog a gaunt brindle cur sat in statuesque worthlessness remembering no doubt the hares he never had caught and the meatless bones he had vainly buried during a long ignoble life the hotel and its inmates had rendered the distillery and its furtive operatives very uneasy of late and now as tolliver in his due turn stood guard by night he considered the probability of having to look for some better situation for his obscure manufactory with a species of sadness which it would be impossible to describe he thought with deep bitterness of all the annoyance he had suffered at the hands of meddling government agents and from the outside world in general and he tried to understand how any person could pretend to see justice in such persecution what had he done to merit being hunted like a wild beast nothing but buy his neighbor's apples at the fair price of twenty cents a bushel and distil them into apple brandy could this possibly be any injury to any government official or to anybody else he paid for his still he paid for the apples he paid fair wages to the men who worked for him what more could be justly demanded of him it was while he was wholly absorbed in trying to solve this knotty problem that far above a strange clink and clatter began which sounded to him as if it were falling from among the stars nothing within his knowledge or experience suggested an explanation of such a phenomenon he felt a thrill of superstitious terror creep through his iron nerves as the aerial racket increased and seemed to whisk itself from place to place with lightning celerity an eccentric echo due to the angles and projections of the cliff added weird effect to the sounds the dog uttered a low plaintive whine and crept close to his master and even wedged himself with tremulous desperation between the knees of that wondering and startled sentinel the clinking and clanging soon became loud and continuous falling in a cataract down the escarpment accompanied now and again by small fragments of stone and soil at last tolliver got control of himself sufficiently and looked out from his shadowy station and up towards the dizzy crown of eagle's nest just at that moment there was a crash and a scream he saw a wide winged ghostly object come over the edge and swoop down another scream another and another a tearing sound a crushing of cedar boughs a shower of small stones and lumps of soil tolliver frightened as he never before had been turned and fled followed by his ecstatic dog a voice keen clear high beseeching pursued him and reached his ears help help oh help surely this was the harnt that walks mt boab this syren of the mountains had lured many a hunter to his doom oh me oh my oh mercy on me help help tolliver ran all the faster as the voice seemed to follow him turn as he would he bruised his shins on angular rocks he ran against trees he fell over logs and at last found himself hopelessly entangled in a net of wild grape vines with his enthusiastic dog still faithfully wriggling between his knees the plaintive voice of the syren now greatly modified by distance assailed his ears with piteous persistence as he vainly struggled to free himself the spot was dark as erebus being in the bottom of a ravine and the more he exerted himself the worse off he became it was his turn to call for help but if any of his friends heard they did not heed his supplications thinking them but baleful echoes of the harnt's deceitful voice it was at the gray of dawn when at last tolliver got clear of the vines and made his way out of the ravine by this time he had entirely overcome his fright and with that stubbornness characteristic of all mountain men he betook himself back to the exact spot whence he had so precipitately retreated his dog forlornly nonchalant trotted behind him to the place and resumed the seat from which the harnt had driven him a few hours ago in this attitude the animal drooped his nose and indifferently sniffed a curious object lying near what's thet ther' thing mose inquired tolliver addressing the dog well i'll ber dorg goned he added as he picked up a woman's bonnet if this here don't beat the worl' an' all camp meetin' hit air well i'll ber dorged hit air i'm er ghost if hit aint miss sara' anna crabb's bonnet by ned he held it up by one silk string and gazed at it with a ludicrously puzzled stare the dog whined and wagged his tail in humble sympathy with his master's bewilderment hit's kinder interestin' haint it mose tolliver went on dryly we'll hev ter look inter this here thing won't we mose as for mose he was looking into it with all his eyes indeed he was beginning to show extreme interest and his tail was pounding the ground with great rapidity suddenly a thought leaped into tolliver's brain and with a start he glanced up the escarpment his mouth open and his brown cheeks betraying strong emotion mose followed his master's movements with kindling eyes and whined dolefully his wolfish nose lifted almost vertically is that you mr tolliver fell a voice out of a cedar clump a little way up the side of the cliff hit air me he responded as he saw miss crabb perched among the thick branches she had her little red note book open and was writing vigorously her yellow hair was disheveled so that it appeared to surround her face with a flickering light which to tolliver's mind gave it a most beautiful and altogether lovely expression well i'll ber he checked himself and stood in picturesque suspense now mr tolliver won't you please help me down from here she demanded closing her note book and placing her pencil behind her ear i'm awfully cramped sitting in this position so long the chivalrous mountaineer did not wait to be appealed to a second time but laying down his gun to which he had clung throughout the night he clambered up the steep face of the rock from projection to projection until he reached the tree in which miss crabb sat meantime she watched him with admiring eyes and just as he was about to take her in his arms and descend with her she exclaimed wait a moment i might lose the thought i'll just jot it down she took her note book and pencil again and hurriedly made the following entry sinewy virile lithe hirsute fearless plucky bronzed vigorous lank greek eyed roman nosed prompt large eared typical american good hero for dramatic short winning dialect story the magazines never refuse dialect stories now if you please mr tolliver i will go with you it was an herculean labor but tolliver was a true hero with one arm wound around her after the fashion of the serpent in the group of the laocooen and with her long yellow hair streaming in crinkled jets over his shoulder he slowly made his way down to the ground meantime mose the dog with true canine sympathy and helpfulness had torn the bonnet into pathetic shreds and was now lying half asleep under a tree with a bit of ribbon in his teeth well i'll jest ber beg parding miss crabb but thet ther dog hev et up yer head gear said tolliver as he viewed with dilating eyes the scattered fragments she comprehended her calamity with one swift glance but she had caught a new dialect phrase at the same time head gear you call it i believe she inquired again producing book and pencil beg parding all over miss crabb i meant bonnet he hurried to say oh it's all right i assure you she replied writing rapidly it's a delightfully fresh and artistic bit of special coloring miss crabb's clothes were badly torn and she looked as if she had spent the night wretchedly but with the exception of a few slight scratches and bruises she was unhurt well jes' look a there will ye exclaimed tolliver as he spied mose there was more of admiration than anger in his voice ef thet ther 'fernal dog haint got yer chin ribbon in his ole mouth i'm er rooster chin ribbon repeated miss crabb making a note i'm er rooster and she smiled with intense satisfaction you don't know mr tolliver how much i am indebted to you not a tall miss crabb not a tall don't mention of it he humbly said hit taint wo'th talkin' erbout the morning was in full blow now and the cat birds were singing sweetly down the ravine overhead a patch of blue sky gleamed and burned with the true empyrean glow far away down in the valley by the little river a breakfast horn was blown with many a mellow flourish and a cool gentle breeze with dew on its wings fanned miss crabb's sallow cheeks and rustled tolliver's tawny beard at the sound of the horn mose sprang to his feet and loped away with the bit of ribbon fluttering from his mouth x it was late in the forenoon before it was discovered at hotel helicon that miss crabb was missing and even then there arose so many doubts about the tragic side of the event that before any organized search for her had been begun she returned appearing upon the scene mounted behind wesley tolliver on a small thin wiry mountain mule crane and peck each drew a deep swift sigh of relief upon seeing her for the sense of guilt in their breasts had been horrible they had by tacit conspiracy prevented any examination of eagle's nest for they dreaded what might be disclosed of course they did not mean to hide the awful fate of the poor girl nor would they willingly have shifted the weight of their dreadful responsibility but it was all so much like a vivid dream so utterly strange and theatrical as it arose in their memories that they could not fully believe in it miss crabb looked quite ludicrous perched behind the tall mountaineer on such a dwarfish mule especially comical was the effect of the sun bonnet she wore she had accepted this article of apparel from tolliver's mother and it appeared to clutch her head in its stiff folds and to elongate her face by sheer compression everybody laughed involuntarily as much for joy at her safe return as in response to the demand of her melodramatic appearance i've brung back yer runerway said tolliver cheerily as he helped the young woman to dismount she clim down the mounting by one pertic'ler trail an' i jes' fotch her up by t'other miss crabb spoke not a word but ran into the hotel and up to her room without glancing to the right or to the left in her great haste the stiff old sun bonnet fell from her head and tumbled upon the ground wush ye'd jes' be erbligin' enough ter han' thet there head gear up ter me mister said tolliver addressing crane who was standing near my mammy'd raise er rumpage ef i'd go back 'thout thet ther bonnet with evident reluctance and disgust crane gingerly took up the fallen article and gave it to tolliver who thanked him so politely that all the onlooking company felt a glow of admiration for the uncouth and yet rather handsome cavalier thet gal he observed glancing in the direction that miss crabb had gone she hev the winnin'est ways of any gal i ever seed in my life ye orter seen 'er up inter thet there bush a writin' in 'er book she'd jes' tumbled kerwhummox down the clift an' hed lodged ther' in them cedars but as she wer' a writin' when she started ter fall w'y she struck a writin' an' jes' kep' on at it same's if nothin' had happened she's game thet ole gal air i tell ye she don't propose for any little thing like fallin' off'n a clift ter interfere with w'at she's a doin' at thet time le' me say ter ye lord but she wer' hongry though settin' up ther a writin' all night an' it'd a done ye good to a seen 'er eat thet chicken and them cake biscuits my mammy cooked for breakfast she air a mos' alarmin' fine gal for a fac' at this point dufour came out of the hotel and when tolliver saw him there was an instantaneous change in the expression of the mountaineer's face well i'll ber dorged he exclaimed with a smile of delight ef ther' haint the same leetle john the baptis' what bapsonsed me down yer inter the branch give us yer baby spanker ole feller how air ye dufour cordially shook hands with him laughing in a jolly way fust an' only man at ever ducked me i'm here ter say ter ye tolliver went on in a cheery half bantering tone and sitting sidewise on the mule ye mus' hev' a sight o' muscle onto them duck legs and bantam arms o' your'n he had the last word still in his mouth when the little beast suddenly put down its head and flung high its hind feet woirp they heard him cry as he whirled over in the air and fell sprawling on the ground dufour leaped forward to see if the man was hurt but tolliver was upright in an instant and grinning sheepishly thet's right bonus he said to the mule which stood quite still in its place thet's right ole fel try ter ac' smart in comp'ny yer a beauty now ain't ye he replaced his hat which had fallen from his head patted the mule caressingly on the neck then lightly vaulting to the old saddle tree he waved his hand to the company and turning dashed at a gallop down the mountain road his spurs jingling merrily as he went what a delicious character what precious dialect how typically american a veritable hero everybody at hotel helicon appeared to have been captivated by this droll fellow how like tolstoi's lovely russians he is observed miss fidelia arkwright of boston a near sighted maiden who did translations and who doted on virile literature when i was in russia i visited tolstoi at his shoe shop began crane but nobody appeared to hear him so busy were all in making notes for a dialect story tolstoi is the greatest fraud of the nineteenth century said peck that shoe making pretence of his is about on a par with his genius in genuineness and sincerity his novels are great chunks of raw filth rank garlic garnished and hideous we touch them only because the french critics have called them savory if the revue de deux mondes should praise a turkish novel we could not wait to read it before we joined in tolstoi is remarkable for two things his coarseness and his vulgar disregard of decency and truth his life and his writings are alike crammed with absurdities and contradictory puerilities which would be laughable but for their evil tendencies but my dear sir how then do you account for the many editions of tolstoi's books inquired the historian r hobbs lucas just as i account for the editions of cowper and montgomery and wordsworth and even shakespeare responded peck you put a ten per cent author's royalty on all those dear classics and see how soon the publishers will quit uttering them if tolstoi's russian raw meat stories were put upon the market in a fair competition with american novels the latter would beat them all hollow in selling oh we ought to have international copyright plaintively exclaimed a dozen voices and so the conversation ended strangely enough each one of the company in growing silent did so in order to weigh certain suggestions arising out of peck's assertions it was as if a score of semi annual statements of copyright accounts were fluttering in the breeze and it was as if a score of wistful voices had whispered how in the world do publishers grow rich when the books they publish never sell perhaps gaspard dufour should be mentioned as appearing to have little sympathy with peck's theory or with the inward mutterings it had engendered in the case of the rest of the company if there was any change in dufour's face it was expressed in a smile of intense self satisfaction xi it was of course not long that the newspapers of our wide awake country were kept from giving their readers very picturesque glimpses of what was going on among the dwellers on mt boab the humorists of the press those charming fellows whose work is so enjoyable when performed upon one's neighbor and so excruciating when turned against oneself saw the vulnerable points of the situation and let go a broadside of ridicule that reverberated from the atlantic to the pacific it became a matter of daily amusement among the inmates of hotel helicon to come together in little groups and discuss these humorous missiles fired upon them from california texas arkansas and wisconsin from brooklyn pittsburgh atlanta and oil city detroit and but from everywhere indeed when it came to miss crabb's adventure every humorist excelled himself in descriptive smartness and in cunning turns of ironical phrasing the head line experts did telling work in the same connection all this was perfectly understood and enjoyed at home but foreigners especially the english stubbornly insisted upon viewing it as the high water mark of american refinement and culture when that genial periodical the smartsburgh bulldozer announced with due gravity that miss crabb a western journalist had leaped from the top of mt boab to the valley below and had been caught in the arms of a stalwart moonshiner where she safely reposed etc the london times copied the paragraph and made it a text for a heavy editorial upon the barbaric influences of republican institutions to which the american minister felt bound to advert in a characteristic after dinner speech at a london club so humorous however were his remarks that he was understood to be vigorously in earnest and the result was perfect confirmation of the old world's opinion as to the rudimentary character of our national culture meantime hotel helicon continued to be the scene of varied if not startling incidents in their search for local color and picturesque material the litterateurs invaded every nook and corner of the region upon and round about mt boab sketching making notes recording suggestions studying dialect and filling their minds with the uncouth peculiarities of the mountain folk it has come to this grumbled peck that american literature its fiction i mean is founded on dialect drivel and vulgar yawp look at our magazines four fifths of their short stories are full of negro talk or cracker lingo or mountain jibberish or new england farm yawp or hoosier dialect it is horribly humiliating it actually makes foreigners think that we are a nation of green horns why a day or two ago i had occasion to consult the article on american literature in the encyclopaedia britannica and therein i was told in one breath how great a writer and how truly american mr lowell is and in the next breath i was informed that a poem beginning with the verse 'under the yaller pines i house' is one of his master pieces do you see do you catch the drift of the englishman's argument to be truly great as an american one must be surpassingly vulgar even in poetry this off hand shower of critical observation had as little effect upon the minds of peck's hearers as a summer rain has on the backs of a flock of ducks they even grew more vehement in their pursuit of local color when i was spending a month at rockledge castle with lord knownaught said crane his lordship frequently suggested that i should make a poem on the life of jesse james well why didn't you do it inquired miss crabb with a ring of impatience in her voice if you had you might have made a hit you might have attracted some attention dufour laughed heartily as if he had caught some occult humor from the young woman's words i did write it said crane retrospectively and sent it to george dunkirk co well sighed miss crabb with intense interest well replied crane they rejected the ms without reading it again dufour laughed as if at a good joke george dunkirk co cried guilford ferris the romancer george dunkirk co they are thieves they have been making false reports on copyright to me for five years or more dufour chuckled as if his jaws would fall off and finally with a red face and gleaming humorous eyes got up from the chair he was filling on the veranda and went up to his room the rest of the company looked at one another inquiringly who is he anyhow demanded peck that's just my query said ferris nobody in the house knows anything definite about him remarked r hobbs lucas and yet he evidently is a distinguished person and his name haunts me so it does me said miss moyne i tell you he's a newspaper reporter his cheek proves that remarked peck miss crabb made a note her own cheek flaming i presume you call that humor she observed it's about like new york's best efforts in the west reporters are respectable people i beg pardon peck said hastily i did not mean to insinuate that anybody is not respectable everybody is eminently respectable if i speak of them i never trouble myself with the other kind well i don't believe that mr dufour is a reporter at all replied miss crabb with emphasis for he's not inquisitive he don't make notes and he don't appear to be writing any in my opinion he's a realist a genuine analytical motive dissecting commonplace recording international novelist in disguise said ferris oh ah dear me but who it may be arthur selby himself incog who knows humph growled crane with a lofty scrowl i should think i ought to know selby i drank wine with him at his remark was cut short by the arrival of the mail and the general scramble that followed upon this occasion the number of newspapers that fell to the hand of each guest was much greater than usual and it was soon discovered that miss crabb's latest letter had been forwarded to a syndicate and was appearing simultaneously in ninety odd different journals no piece of composition ever was more stunningly realistic or more impartially nay abjectly truthful than was that letter it gave a minute account of the quarrel between peck and crane over their attentions to miss moyne the fight miss crabb's fall the subsequent adventures and all the hotel gossip of every sort it was personal to the last degree but it was not in the slightest libelous no person could say that any untruth had been told or even that any tinge of false coloring had been laid upon the facts as recorded and yet how merciless of course miss crabb's name did not appear with the article save as one of its subjects and she saw at once that she had better guard her secret that was a breeze which rustled through hotel helicon everybody was supremely indignant but there was no clue to the traitor who had thus betrayed everybody's secrets it would be absurd to suppose that miss crabb was not suspected at once on account of her constant and superfluous show of note making still there were others who might be guilty crane and peck were indignant the former especially ready to resent to the death any allusion to the details of the duel miss moyne with the quick insight of a clever and gifted young woman comprehended the situation in its general terms and was vexed as much as amused the whole thing had to her mind the appearance of a melodramatic broadly sensational sketch in which she had played the part of the innocent unconscious but all powerful heroine indeed the newspaper account placed her in this unpleasant attitude before a million readers a lucky affair for you miss moyne said dufour to her a few days later you cannot over reckon the boom it will give to your latest book you may expect a pretty round sum with your next copyright statement he spoke with the voice and air of one who knew how to read the signs of the day but the ridiculous idea of having all this stuff about me going the rounds of the newspapers she responded her beautiful patrician face showing just a hint of color don't care for it a moment said dufour it will not hurt you the thought of having that hideous picture in all the patent inside pages of the cheap press with my name under it en toutes lettres and why it is horrible she went on with trembling lips dufour smiled upon her as if indulgently a curious tender gleam in his eyes wait he said and don't allow it to trouble you the world discriminates pretty well after all it will not hurt you it's a mighty boom for you she looked at him with a sudden flash in her cheeks and eyes and exclaimed almost vehemently i will not permit it they shall not do it i cannot bear to be treated as if as if i were a theatrical person a variety actress my dear miss moyne he hurriedly said his own face showing a tinge of embarrassment you are taking a wrong point of view indeed you are wait till you see the out come his tone was humble and apologetic as he continued my opinion is that this very thing will quadruple the sales of your book i don't want them quadrupled she cried just look at that front hair and that nose she held up a newspaper for him to inspect a picture of herself a miserable distorted thing it is absolutely disgraceful my dresses never fit like that and who ever saw me with a man's collar on tears were in her beautiful eyes dufour consoled her as best he could though he could not resist the temptation to suggest that even a caricature of her face was sure to have in it the fascination of genuine loveliness a suggestion which was phrased with consummate art and received with an appearance of innocence that was beyond all art xii summer on mt boab was much like summer on any other mountain and life at hotel helicon was very like life at any other mountain hotel save that a certain specialization due to the influence of literature and art was apparent in the present instance giving to the house the landscape and the intercourse of the guests a peculiar tinge so to say of self consciousness and artificiality not that these authors thus drawn together by the grace of a man grown suddenly rich were very different from men and women of other lines in life the real peculiarity sprang out of the obligation by which every one felt bound to make the most in a professional way of the situation and the environment perhaps there was not a soul under the broad roof of hotel helicon servants excepted that did not secrete in its substance the material for a novel a poem or an essay which was to brim with the local life and flash with the local color of the region of mt boab yes there appeared to be one exception dufour constantly expressed a contempt for the mountaineers and their country to be sure he conceded to be sure there is a demand for dialect stories and i suppose that they must be written but for my part i cannot see why we americans must stultify ourselves in the eyes of all the world by flooding our magazines newspapers and books with yawp instead of with a truly characteristic american literature of a high order there is some excuse for a quasi negro literature and even the creoles might have a niche set apart for them but dialect on the whole is growing to be a literary bore but don't you think said miss crabb drawing her chin under and projecting her upper teeth to such a degree that anything like realistic description would appear brutal don't you think mr dufour that mr tolliver would make a great character in a mountain romance no there is nothing great in a clown as such he promptly answered if tolliver is great he would be great without his jargon yes she admitted but the picturesqueness the color the contrast you know would be gone now craddock craddock is excellent so long as there is but one craddock but when there are some dozens of him it is different said dufour and it is the process of multiplication that i object to there's cable who is no longer a genius of one species the writers of creole stories are swarming by the score and poor old uncle remus everybody writes negro dialect now literary claim jumpers are utterly conscienceless the book market will soon be utterly ruined miss crabb puffed out her lean sallow cheeks and sighed heavily i had hoped she said to get my novel on the market before this but i have not yet found a publisher to suit me she winced inwardly at this way of expressing the fact that every publisher high and low far and near had declined her ms out of hand but she could not say the awful truth in its simpliest terms while speaking to one so prosperous as dufour she felt that she must at all hazards preserve a reasonable show of literary independence crane came to her aid one publisher is just as good as another he said almost savagely they are all thieves they report every book a failure save those they own outright and yet they all get rich i shall publish for myself my next volume dufour smiled grimly and turned away it was rather monotonous this iteration and reiteration of so grave a charge against the moral character of publishers and this threat of crane's to become his own publisher was a bit of unconscious and therefore irresistible humor it's too pathetic to be laughed at dufour thought as he strolled along to where miss moyne sat under a tree but that kentuckian actually thinks himself a poet with all his good nature and kind heartedness dufour could be prejudiced and he drew the line at what he called the prevailing tendency toward boastful prevarication among kentucky gentlemen as he walked away he heard crane saying george dunkirk co have stolen at least twenty thousand dollars in royalties from me during the past three years it was the voice of ferris that made interrogative response is dunkirk your publisher yes or rather my robber glad of it misery loves company dufour half turned about and cast a quick glance at the speakers he did not say anything however but resumed his progress toward miss moyne who had just been joined by mrs nancy jones black a stoutish and oldish woman very famous on account of having assumed much and done little mrs nancy jones black was from boston she was president of the woman's antiquarian club of the ladies' greek association of the sappho patriotic club of the newport fashionable near sighted club for the study of esoteric transcendentalism and it may not be catalogued how many more societies and clubs she was a great poet who had never written any great poem a great essayist whom publishers and editors avoided whom critics regarded as below mediocrity but of whom everybody stood in breathless awe and she was an authority in many literary and philosophical fields of which she really knew absolutely nothing she was a reformer and a person of influence who had made a large number of her kinsfolk famous as poets and novelists without any apparent relevancy between the fame and the literary work done if your name were jones and you could trace out your relationship to mrs nancy jones black and could get mrs nancy jones black interested in your behalf you could write four novels a year with great profit ever afterward as dufour approached he heard miss moyne say i publish my poor little works with george dunkirk co and the firm has been very kind to me i feel great encouragement but i don't see how i can bear this horrible newspaper familiarity and vulgarity my dear child said mrs nancy jones black placing her plump motherly hand on the young woman's arm you must not appear to notice it do as did my daughter lois when they assailed her first little novel with sugar plum praise why when it began to leak out that lois was the author of a sea side symphony the poor girl was almost smothered with praise of course i had to take the matter in hand and under my advice lois went abroad for six months when she returned she found herself famous talking shop inquired dufour accepting the offer of a place on the bench beside mrs black yes said she with a comprehensive wave of her hand i am taking miss moyne under my wing so to say and am offering her the comfort of my experience she is a genius whom it doesn't spoil to praise she's going to be the next sensation in the east i suggested as much to her said dufour she is already on a strong wave but she must try and avoid being refractory you know he said this in a straightforward business way but his voice was touched with a certain sort of admirable tenderness miss moyne was looking out over the deep hazy valley her cheeks still warm with the thought of that newspaper portrait with its shabby clothes and towsled bangs what was fame bought at such a price she bridled a little but did not turn her head as she said i am not refractory i am indignant and i have a right to be they cannot justify the liberty they have taken besides i will not accept notoriety i there now dear that is what lois said and milton john jones my nephew was at first bound that he wouldn't let tom my brother advertise him but he soon saw his way clear i assure you and now he publishes four serials at once be prudent dear be prudent but the idea of picturing me with great barbaric rings in my ears and with a corkscrew curl on each side and dufour interrupted her with a laugh almost hearty enough to be called a guffaw and mrs black smiled indulgently as if at a clever child which must be led not driven being conscious that you really are stylish and beautiful you needn't care for the picture said dufour in a tone of sturdy sincerity there is nothing so effective as a foil added mrs black miss moyne arose and with her pretty chin slightly elevated walked away how beautiful she is exclaimed dufour gazing after her and i am delighted to know that you are taking an interest in her mrs black smiled complacently and with a bland sidewise glance at him remarked she grows upon one yes said he with self satisfied obtuseness yes she is magnetic she is a genuine genius precisely she stirs one's heart strangely replied mrs black yes i have noted that it's very remarkable you should speak of it to her at the first opportunity dufour started a little flushed and finally laughed as one does who discovers a bit of clever and harmless treachery if i only dared he presently said with something very like fervor in his tone if i only dared mrs black looked at him a moment as if measuring in her mind his degree of worthiness then with a wave of her hand she said never do you dare to dare mr crane stands right in your path dufour leaped to his feet with the nimbleness and dangerous celerity of a tiger crane he exclaimed with a world of contempt in his voice if he but he stopped short and laughed at himself mrs black looked at him with a patronizing expression in her eyes leave it to me she said in her most insinuating tone xiii crane tried not to show the bitterness he felt as he saw his hope of winning the favor of miss moyne fading rapidly out but now and again a cloud of irresistible melancholy fell upon him at such times it was his habit to lean upon the new fence that circumscribed hotel helicon and dreamily smoke a cigar he felt a blind desire to assassinate somebody if he could only know who of course not peck for peck too was disconsolate but somebody anybody who would claim the place of a successful rival one morning while he stood thus regaling himself with his tobacco and his misery tolliver rode up on a handsome horse this time and lifting his broad hat bowed picturesquely and said good mornin' kyernel how're ye this mornin' good morning growled crane tolliver looked off over the valley and up at the sky which was flecked with tags of fleece cloud hit look like hit mought rain in er day er two he remarked yes i don't know quite likely said crane gazing evasively in another direction ever'body's well i s'pose up ther' at the tavern inquired tolliver i believe so was the cold answer tolliver leaned over the pommel of his saddle tree and combed his horse's mane with his sinewy fingers meantime the expression in his face was one of exceeding embarrassment blent with cunning kyernel c'u'd ye do a feller a leetle yerrent what's of importance he asked with peculiar faltering do what inquired crane lifting his eye brows and turning the cigar in his mouth jest a leetle frien'ly job o' kindness said tolliver jest ter please ask thet young leddy thet miss crabb 'at i fotch up yer on er mule tother day ye know well jest ax her for me ef i moughtn't come in an' see 'er on pertic'lar an' pressin' business ef ye please sir by this time the mountaineer's embarrassment had become painfully apparent any good judge of human nature could have seen at once that he was almost overcome with the burden and worry of the matter in hand his cheeks were pale and his eyes appeared to be fading into utter vacancy of expression crane told him that there was no need to be particularly formal that if he would go in and ask for miss crabb she would see him in the parlor but kyernel hit's er private sort er confidential confab 'at i must hev wi' 'er an' oh well that's all right you'll not be interrupted in the parlor air ye pine blank shore of it kyernel certainly dead shore quite i assure you crane had become interested in tolliver's affair whatever it might be he could not keep from sharing the man's evident intensity of mood and all the time he was wondering what the matter could be certainly no common place subject could so affect a man of iron like tolliver the poet's lively imagination was all aglow over the mystery but it could not formulate any reasonable theory of explanation miss crabb appeared in the parlor promptly and met tolliver with a cordiality that instead of reassuring him threw him into another fit of embarrassment from which he at first made no effort to recover his wide brimmed hat as he twirled it on his knees quivered convulsively in accord with the ague of excitement with which his whole frame was shaking he made certain soundless movements with his lips as if muttering to himself miss crabb at first did not notice his confusion and went on talking rapidly reiterating thanks for the kindness he had shown her in her recent mishap and managing to put into her voice some tones that to him sounded very tender and sweet you don't know you can't imagine mr tolliver what i suffered during that awful night she said turning her head to one side and drawing her chin under until it almost disappeared in the lace at her throat it was horrible tolliver looked at her helplessly his mouth open his eyes dull and sunken how did you happen to discover me up there anyway mr tolliver she demanded leaning toward him and laughing a little the dog he treed ye an' then i seed ye settin' up ther' er writin' away he managed to say a wave of relief passing over his face at the sound of his own voice it was perfectly ridiculous perfectly preposterous she exclaimed but i'm mighty thankful that i was not hurt yes well ye mought be miss crabb he stammered out wonder ye wasn't scrunched inter pieces an' scattered all eround ther' she slipped out her book took a pencil from over her ear and made a note tolliver eyed her dolefully how do you spell scrunched mr tolliver in your dialect she paused to inquire his jaw fell a little lower for a moment then he made an effort s q r u he paused and shook his head s q k no thet's not hit s k q r dorg ef i ken spell thet word begging yer parding hit air 'tirely too hard for me he settled so low in his chair that his knees appeared almost as high as his head all right she cheerily exclaimed i can get it phonetically it's a new word i don't think either craddock or johnson uses it it's valuable there was a silence during which miss crabb thoughtfully drummed on her projecting front teeth with the end of her pencil tolliver nerved himself and said miss crabb i i well ye know i that is begging yer parding but i hev something' i want er say ter ye ef ye please he glanced furtively around as if suspecting that some person lay secreted among the curtains of a bay window hard by and indeed dufour was there lightly indulging in a morning nap while the mountain breeze flowed over him he was in a deep bamboo chair behind those very curtains oh certainly certainly mr tolliver go on i shall be delighted charmed indeed to hear what you have to say miss crabb responded turning a fresh leaf of her note book and putting on a hopeful look i hope ye'll stick ter thet after i've done said it ter ye he proceeded to say but dorg on me ef i know how ter begin sayin' it oh just go right on it's all right i assure you mr tolliver i am very anxious to hear mebbe ye air i don't dispute yer word but i feel mighty onery all the same onery is a western word mused miss crabb making a note proceed mr tolliver she continued after a pause proceed i am listening with great interest what i'm ergwine ter state ter ye mought mek ye mad but hit can't be holp i jest hev ter say it i air jest erbleeged ter say it his voice was husky and he was assuming a tragic air miss crabb felt a strange thrill creep throughout her frame as a sudden suspicion seemed to leap back and forth between her heart and her brain no i assure you that i could not be angry with you mr tolliver under any circumstances she murmured you have been so very kind to me hit air awful confusin' an' hit mek a feller feel smaller 'n a mouse ter speak it right out but then hit air no foolishness hit air pine blank business of course said miss crabb pensively of course you feel some embarrassment he hitched himself up in his chair and crossed his legs ef ye don't like w'at i say w'y i won't blame ye a bit i feel jest as if i wer a doin' somethin' 'at i hadn't orter do but my mammy she say i must an' that do everlastin'ly settle it yes your mother's advice is always safe safe i shed say so hit's mighty onsafe fer me not ter foller it i kin tell ye she'd thump my old gourd fer me in ermazin' style ef i didn't thump my old gourd repeated miss crabb making a note go on mr tolliver please s'pose i mought as well seein' 'at it has ter be said he paused faltered and then proceeded well beggin' yer parding miss crabb but ever sence ye wer' down ther' ter we all's cabin hit's been a worryin' my mammy and me an' we hev' talked it all over an' over yes sighed miss crabb hit's not the cost of them beads miss crabb they air not wo'th much but they was guv ter mammy by her aunt mandy ann bobus an' she feel like she jest can't give 'em up miss crabb looked puzzled ef ye'll jest erblige me an' hand them beads over ter me i'll never say er wo'd ter nobody ner nothin mr tolliver what in the world do you mean cried miss crabb rising and standing before him with a face that flamed with sudden anger ye mought er tuck 'em kinder accidentally ye know he suggested in a conciliatory tone rising also mr tolliver she almost screamed ther' now be still er ye'll let ever'body know all erbout it he half whispered hit'd be disgraceful mr tolliver sh h h they'll hear ye get right out of this room you just then dufour who had been slowly aroused from his nap and who while yet half asleep had overheard much of what had been said stepped forth from behind the curtains and stood looking from one to the other of the excited actors in the little drama what's up he demanded bluntly he's accusing me of stealing beads cried miss crabb he's insulting me what exclaimed dufour glaring at tolliver i feel mighty onery a doin' it said tolliver but hit air pine blank mighty suspicious kyernel hit air for a fac' dufour looked as if he hardly knew which he should do laugh boisterously or fling tolliver out of the window but he quickly pulled himself together and said calmly you are wrong sir and you must apologize certingly certingly said tolliver thet air jest what i air a doin' i beg parding er thousan' times fer sayin' what i hev but kyernel hit air a lor' a mighty's truth all the same le' me tell ye them beads was ther' w'en she come an' they was gone w'en she was gone an' stop that take back those words or i'll throw you dufour took a step towards tolliver but stopped suddenly when the latter drew a huge revolver with one hand and a long crooked bowie knife with the other and said no yer don't kyernel not by er good deal jest ye open yer bread trap ergain an' i'll jest clean up this ole shanty in erbout two minutes it may not be inferred how this bit of dramatic experience would have ended had not a lean wizzen faced mountain lad rushed in just then with a three cornered piece of paper in his hand upon which was scrawled the following message i hev fown them beeds they wus in mi terbacker bag tolliver read this and wilted the boy was panting and almost exhausted he had run all the way up the mountain from the tolliver cabin yer mammy say kum home he gasped hit air jest as i 'spected said tolliver mammy hev made a pine blank eejit of me again he handed the message to dufour as he spoke his pistol and knife had disappeared a full explanation followed and at the end of a half hour tolliver went away crest fallen but happy as for miss crabb she had made a number of valuable dialect notes dufour promised not to let the rest of the guests know what had just happened in the parlor xiv literature making has not yet taken the rank of a profession but of late the world has modified its opinion as to the ability of literary people to drive a close bargain or to manage financial affairs with success many women and some men have shown that it is possible for a vivid imagination and a brilliant style in writing to go close along with a practical judgment and a fair share of selfish shrewdness in matters of bargain and sale still after all it remains true that a strong majority of literary people are of the micawber genus with great faith in what is to turn up always nicely balancing themselves on the extreme verge of expectancy and gazing over into the promise land of fame and fortune with pathetically hopeful yet awfully hollow eyes indeed there is no species of gambling more uncertain in its results or more irresistibly fascinating to its victims than literary gambling day after day month after month year after year the deluded enthusiastic ever defeated but never discouraged writer plies his pen besieges the publishers and editors receives their rebuffs rough or smooth takes back his declined manuscripts tries it over and over sweats fumes execrates coaxes bullies raves re writes takes a new nom de plume and new courage goes on and on to the end here or there rumor goes that some fortunate literator has turned the right card and has drawn a great prize this rumor never quite authentic is enough to re invigorate all the fainting scribblers and to entice new victims into the gilded casino of the cadmean vice the man who manipulates the literary machine is the publisher that invisible person who usually grows rich upon the profits of unsuccessful books he it is who inveigles the infatuated young novelist essayist or poet into the beautiful bunco den of the book business and there fastens him and holds him as long as he will not squeal but at the first note of remonstrance he kicks him out and fills his place with a fresh victim the literary micawber however does not despair he may be a little silly from the effect of the summersault to which the publisher's boot has treated him but after a distraught look about him he gets up brushes the dust off his seedy clothes and goes directly back into the den again with another manuscript under his arm and with a feverish faith burning in his deep set eyes what serene and beautiful courage by the way have the literary women of course the monster who presides at the publisher's desk cannot be as brutal to her as he is to men but he manipulates her copyright statements all the same so that her book never passes the line of fifteen hundred copies sold how can we ever account for a woman who has written forty three novels under such circumstances and has died finally a devout christian and a staunch friend of her publisher poor thing up to the hour of her demise white haired wrinkled over worked nervous and semi paralytic she nursed the rosy hope that to morrow or at the very latest the day after to morrow the reward of all her self devotion would come to her in the form of a liberal copyright statement from her long suffering and charitable publisher out in the west they have a disease called milk sickness an awful malady of which everybody stands in deadly terror but which nobody has ever seen if you set out to find a case of milk sickness it is like following a will o' the wisp it is always just a little way farther on over in the next settlement you never find it the really successful author in america is like the milk sickness never visible except on the remote horizon you hear much of him but you never have the pleasure of shaking his cunning right hand the fact is he is a myth on the other hand however the american cities are full of successful publishers who have become millionaires upon the profits of books which have starved their authors of course this appears to be a paradox but i suppose that it can be explained by the rule of profit and loss the author's loss is the publisher's profit the foregoing is in substance the opening part of an address delivered by ferris before the assembled guests of hotel helicon mrs nancy jones black presided at the meeting indeed she always presided at meetings on this occasion which was informal and impromptu ferris was in excellent mood for speaking as he just had been notified by a letter from dunkirk co that he was expected to pay in advance for the plates of his new romance a mysterious missive and that a personal check would not be accepted a draft on new york must be sent forthwith although ferris was a thoroughly good fellow who cared nothing for money as money this demand for a sum the half of which he could not command if his life were at stake hit him like a bullet stroke a chance to talk off the soreness of the wound was accepted with avidity he felt guilty of a meanness it is true in thus stirring up old troubles and opening afresh ancient hurts in the breasts of his listening friends but the relief to him was so great that he could not forego it the american publisher he went on proclaims himself a fraud by demanding of the author a contract which places the author's business wholly in the control of the publisher i take it that publishers are just as honest and just as dishonest as any other class of respectable men you know and i know that as a rule the man who trusts his business entirely to others will in the long run be robbed administrators of estates rob the heirs in two thirds of the instances as every probate lawyer well knows every merchant has to treat his clerks and salesmen as if they were thieves or if he do not they will become thieves the government has to appoint bank examiners to watch the bankers and yet they steal the indian agents steal from the government senators steal aldermen steal wall street men steal from one another and from everybody else canada is overflowing with men who have betrayed and robbed those who trusted their business with them even clergymen that poorly paid and much abused class now and again fall before the temptation offered by the demon of manipulated returns of trust funds the fact is one may feel perfectly safe in saying that in regard to all the professions trades and occupations there is absolutely no safety in trusting one's affairs wholly in the hands of another great applause even your milkman waters the milk and the dairyman sells you butter that never was in a churn if you neglect to keep a pass book your grocer runs up the bill to a great rustle and some excited whispering up to something enormous of course it is not everybody that is dishonest but experience shows that if a man has the temptation to defraud his customers constantly before him with absolutely no need to fear detection he will soon reason himself into believing it his right to have the lion's share of all that goes into his hands now isn't it strange in view of the premises that nobody ever heard of such a thing as a publisher being convicted of making false returns is it possible that the business of book publishing is so pure and good of itself that it attracts to it none but perfect men great applause publishers do fail financially once in a while but their books of accounts invariably show that just eleven hundred and forty copies of each copyrighted book on their lists have been sold to date no more no less suppressed applause nobody ever saw cleaner or better balanced books of accounts than those kept by the publishers they foot up correctly to a cent indeed it would be a very strange thing if a man couldn't make books balance under such circumstances prolonged hand clapping i am rather poor at double entry but i fancy i could make a credit of eleven hundred and forty copies sold so as to have it show up all right cheers i must not lose my head in speaking on this subject for i cannot permit you to misunderstand my motive so long as authors submit to the per centum method of publication so long they will be the prey of the publishers the only method by which justice can be assured to both author and publisher is the cash sale method if every author in america would refuse to let his manuscript go out of hand before he had received the cash value for it the trade would soon adjust itself properly in that case the author's reputation would be his own property so soon as he had made an audience his manuscripts would command a certain price if one publisher would not pay enough for it another would as the method now is it makes little difference whether the author have a reputation or not indeed most publishers prefer to publish the novels for example of clever tyros because these fledglings are so proud of seeing themselves in print that they never think of questioning copyright statements eleven hundred and forty copies usually will delight them almost beyond endurance laughter and applause go look at the book lists of the publishers and you will feel the truth of what i have said now let me ask you if you can give or if any publisher can give one solitary honest reason why the publishing business should not be put upon a cash basis a manuscript for so much money the publisher controls his own business he knows every nook and corner every leaf and every line of it and he should be able to say just as the corn merchant does i will give you so much to which the author would say i will take it or i will not take it but what is the good of standing here and arguing you believe every word i speak but you don't expect to profit by it you will go on gambling at the publisher's faro table just as long as he will smile and deal the cards some of these days you will win you think poor deluded wretches go on and die in the faith no sooner had ferris ended than lucas the historian arose and expressed grave doubts as to the propriety of the address he was decidedly of the opinion that authors could not afford to express themselves so freely and if he must say it recklessly how could mr ferris substantiate by proof any of the damaging allegations he had made against publishers of high standing what mr ferris had said might be strictly true but the facts were certainly very hard to come at he thought he hoped that mr ferris's address would not be reported to the press here he glanced appealingly at miss crabb at least not as the sense of the meeting such a thing would in his opinion be liable to work a great harm to all present he felt sure that the publishers would resent the whole thing as malicious and libellous throughout the audience there was a nervous stirring a looking at one another askance it was as if a cold wave had flowed over them nobody had anything further to say and it was a great relief when dufour moved an adjournment sine die which was carried by a vote that suggested a reserve of power every face in the audience with the exception of dufour's wore a half guilty look and everybody crept silently out of the room xv it caused quite a commotion on mt boab when bartley hubbard and miss henrietta stackpole newspaper people from boston arrived at hotel helicon miss stackpole had just returned from europe and bartley hubbard had run down from boston for a week to get some points for his paper she had met mr henry james on the continent and hubbard had dined with mr howells just before leaving boston no two persons in all the world would have been less welcome among the guests at the hotel just then than were these professional reporters of course everybody tried to give them a cordial greeting but they were classed along with miss crabb as dangerous characters whom it would be folly to snub miss moyne was in downright terror of them associating the thought of them with those ineffable pictures of herself which were still appearing at second and third hand in the patent insides of the country journals but she was very good to them and miss stackpole at once attached herself to her unshakably hubbard did likewise with little mrs philpot who amused him mightily with her strictures upon analytical realism in fiction i do think that mr howells treated you most shamefully she said to him he had no right to represent you as a disagreeable person who was cruel to his wife and who had no moral stamina hubbard laughed as one who hears an absurd joke oh howells and i have an understanding we are really great friends he said i sat to him for my portrait and i really think he flattered me i managed to keep him from seeing some of my ugliest lines now you are not quite sincere said mrs philpot glancing over him from head to foot you are not so bad as he made you out to be it's one of mr howells's hobbies to represent men as rather flabby nonentities and women as invalids or dolls he's got the men down fine replied hubbard but i guess he is rather light on women you will admit however that he dissects feminine meanness and inconsequence with a deft turn he makes fun of women said mrs philpot a little testily he caricatures them wreaks his humor on them but you know very well that he misrepresents them even in his most serious and quasi truthful moods hubbard laughed and there was something essentially vulgar in the notes of the laugh mrs philpot admitted this mentally and she found herself shrinking from his steadfast but almost conscienceless eyes i imagine i shouldn't be as bad a husband as he did me into but mrs philpot interrupted him with a start and a little cry dear me and aren't you married she asked in exclamatory deprecation of what his words had implied he laughed again very coarsely and looked at her with eyes that almost lured married he exclaimed do i look like a marrying man a newspaper man can't afford to marry how strange reflected mrs philpot how funny and mr howells calls himself a realist realist laughed hubbard why he does not know enough about the actual world to be competent to purchase a family horse he's a capital fellow good and true and kind hearted but what does he know about affairs he doesn't even know how to flatter women how absurd exclaimed little mrs philpot but hubbard could not be sure for the life of him just what she meant the expression to characterize and you like mr howells she inquired like him everybody likes him he cordially said well you are quite different from miss crabb she hates maurice thompson for putting her into a story oh well said hubbard indifferently women are not like men they take life more seriously if thompson had had more experience he would not have tampered with a newspaper woman he's got the whole crew down on him miss stackpole hates him almost as fiercely as she hates henry james i don't blame her exclaimed mrs philpot it's mean and contemptible for men to caricature women oh i don't know yawned hubbard it all goes in a lifetime at this opportune moment miss crabb and miss stackpole joined them coming arm in arm miss crabb looking all the more sallow and slender in comparison with the plump well fed appearance of her companion may i introduce you to miss crabb of the ringville star mr hubbard miss stackpole asked in a high but by no means rich voice as she fastened her steady button like eyes on mrs philpot hubbard arose lazily and went through the process of introduction perfunctorily giving miss crabb a sweeping but indifferent glance there's an impromptu pedestrian excursion on hand said miss stackpole and i feel bound to go one of the gentlemen has discovered a hermit's cabin down a ravine near here and he offers to personally conduct a party to it you will go mr hubbard go i should remark that i will you don't get a scoop of that item i assure you miss stackpole was a plump and rather pretty young woman fairly well dressed in drab drapery she stood firmly on her feet and had an air of self reliance and self control in strong contrast with the fussy nervous manner of miss crabb mrs philpot surveyed the two young women with that comprehensive critical glance which takes in everything that is visible and quickly enough she made up her comparison and estimate of them she decided that miss crabb had no style no savoir faire no repose but then miss stackpole was forward almost impudent in appearance and her greater ease of manner was really the ease that comes of a long training in intrusiveness and of rubbing against an older civilization she felt quite distinctly the decided dash of vulgarity in the three newspaper representatives before her and she could not help suspecting that it would not be safe to judge the press reporters by these examples the question arose in her mind whether after all howells and henry james and maurice thompson had acted fairly in taking these as representative newspaper people she had met a great many newspaper people and had learned to like them as a class she had many good and helpful friends among them unconsciously she was showing to all present that she was dissecting the three reporters her unfavorable opinion of them slowly took expression in her tell tale face not that she wholly disliked or distrusted them she really pitied them how could they be content to live such a life dependent upon what they could make by meddling so to speak then too she felt a vague shame a chagrin a regret that real people must be put into works of fiction with all the seamy side of their natures turned out to the world's eye we're in for it exclaimed hubbard mrs philpot is making a study of us as a group see the dreaming look in her eyes oh no she never studies anybody or anything said miss crabb poor little woman real life is a constant puzzle to her and she makes not the slightest effort to understand it hubbard and miss stackpole glanced curiously at each other and then at miss crabb evidently their thought was a common one xvi the pedestrian excursion spoken of by miss stackpole promised to be an enjoyable affair to those of the helicon guests who could venture upon it a writer of oddly entertaining and preposterously impossible short stories john b cattleton had been mousing among the ravines of mt boab and had stumbled upon what he described as a very obscure little cabin jammed under a cliff in an angle of the canyon and right over a bright stream of cold pure spring water it's a miserably picturesque and forlornly prepossessing place he went on in his droll way where all sorts of engaging ghosts and entertaining ogres might be supposed to congregate at midnight i didn't go quite down to it but i was near enough to it to make out its main features and i saw the queerest being imaginable poking around the premises a veritable hermit i should call him as old as the rocks themselves his dress was absurdly old fashioned a caricature of the uniform of our soldier sires of revolutionary renown a long spike tailed blue coat with notable brass buttons a triangular hat somewhat bell crowned and tow or cotton trousers shirt vest yes if i remember well they were of copperas homespun his hair and beard were white fine and thin hanging in tags and wisps as fluffy as lint i sat upon a rock in the shadow of a cedar tree and watched his queer manoeuvres for a good while all his movements were furtive and peculiar like those of a shy wild beast it's the prophet of the smoky mountain said miss crabb in an earnest stage whisper he's craddock's material we can't touch him touch him i'll interview him on dialect in politics said hubbard and get his views on sex in genius i should like a sketch of his life there must be a human interest to serve as straw for my brick remarked miss stackpole the motive that induced him to become a hermit and all that miss crabb dared not confess that she desired a sketch of the old man for the newspaper syndicate so she merely drummed on her front teeth with her pencil dufour joined the pedestrian party with great enthusiasm having dressed himself for the occasion in a pair of tennis trousers a blue flannel shirt a loose jacket and a shooting cap his shoes were genuine alpine foot gear with short spikes in their heels and soles lead on cattleton he cried jovially and let our motto be 'on to the hut of friar tuck' good answered cattleton in like spirit and you shall be my lieutenant come walk beside me thank you from the bottom of my heart replied dufour but i cannot accept i have contracted to be miss moyne's servant instead that was a gay procession filing away from hotel helicon through the thin forest that fringed one shoulder of stately mt boab cattleton led the column flinging back from time to time his odd sayings and preposterous conceits the day was delightfully cool with a steady wind running over the mountain and eddying in the sheltered coves where the ferns were thick and tall in the sky were a few pale clouds slowly vanishing whilst some broad pinioned buzzards wheeled round and round above the blue green abyss of the valley there were sounds of a vague dreamy sort abroad in the woods like the whisperings and laughter of legions of invisible beings everybody felt exhilarated and buoyant tramping gaily away to the hut of the hermit at a certain point cattleton commanded a halt and pointing out the entrance to the ravine said now good friends we must have perfect silence during the descent or our visit will be all in vain furthermore the attraction of gravitation demands that in going down we must preserve our uprightness else our progress may be facilitated to an alarming degree and our advent at the hut be far from becomingly dignified like a snake flecked with touches of gay color the procession crawled down the ravine the way becoming steeper and more tortuous at every step thicker and thicker and thicker grew the trees saving where the rock broke forth from the soil and closer drew the zig zags of the barely possible route cattleton silenced every voice and rebuked every person who showed signs of weakening it's just a few steps farther he whispered back from his advanced position don't make the least sound but the ravine proved upon this second descent much more difficult and dangerous than it had appeared to cattleton at first and it was with the most heroic exertions that he finally led the party down to the point whence he had viewed the cabin by this time the column was pressing upon him and he could not stop down he went faster and faster barely able to keep his feet now sliding now clutching a tree or rock with the breathless and excited line of followers gathering dangerous momentum behind him it was too late now to command silence or to control the company in any way an avalanche of little stones loosened by scrambling feet swept past him and went leaping on down below he heard miss moyne utter a little scream of terror that mingled with many exclamations from both men and women and then he lost his feet and began to slide down he sped and down sped the party after him till in a cataract of mightily frightened but unharmed men and women they all went over a little precipice and landed in a scattered heap on a great bed of oak leaves that the winds had drifted against the rock a few moments of strange silence followed then everybody sprang up disheveled and red faced to look around and see what was the matter they found themselves close to the long low cabin from under which flowed a stream of water a little column of smoke was wandering out of a curious clay chimney beside the low door way stood a long deep trough filled with water in which a metal pipe was coiled fantastically two earthen jugs with cob stoppers sat hard by a sourish smell assaulted their sense and a faint spirituous flavor burdened the air cattleton who was first upon his feet shook himself together and drolly remarked we have arrived in good order let's interview the just then rushed forth from the door the old man of the place who halted outside and snatched from its rack on the wall a long tin horn which he proceeded to blow vigorously the echoes prowling through the woods and over the foot hills and scampering far away up and down the valley not a soul present ever could forget that sketch the old man with his shrunken legs bent and wide apart his arms akimbo as he leaned far back and held up that wailing howling bellowing horn and his long coat tail almost touching the ground whilst his fantastic hat quivered in unison with the strain he was blowing how his shriveled cheeks puffed out and how his eyes appeared to be starting from their bony sockets that is what i call a fitting reception said cattleton gazing at the trumpeter see here exclaimed crane with evident excitement i smell whisky this hyer what d'ye mean hyer you all a comin' down hyer broke forth a wrathful voice and wesley tolliver rushed with melodramatic fierceness upon the scene oh i i wa want to g go home cried little mrs philpot clutching bartley hubbard's arm so do i said he with phlegmatic cleverness i should like to see my mother i'm feeling a little lonely and what upon yearth do this yer mean anyhow thundered tolliver who invited you all down yer tell me thet will ye oh mr tolliver mr tolliver exclaimed miss crabb rushing upon him excitedly i'm so glad you are here well i'll ber dorged he ejaculated you down hyer again well i never seed the like afore in all my born days he gazed at first one and then another of the party and a sudden light flashed into his face well i'll ber dorged ef ther whole kepoodle of 'em hain't done jest gone and tumbled off'n the mounting an' jest rolled down hyer you're a very accurate reasoner my friend said cattleton trying to get his hat into shape i think we touched at two or three points as we came down however about this time four or five more mountaineers appeared bearing guns and looking savage bandits said miss stackpole with a shudder moonshiners muttered crane oh for heaven's sake mr hubbard do t t take m me home wailed mrs philpot i should be delighted said hubbard his voice concealing the uneasiness he felt indeed i should more men appeared and at the same time a roll of thunder tumbled across the darkening sky a sudden mountain storm had arisen the pedestrians found themselves surrounded by a line of grim and silent men who appeared to be waiting for orders from tolliver a few large drops of rain come slanting down from the advancing fringe of the sable cloud and again the thunder bounded across the heavens i guess you'd better invite us in suggested cattleton turning to the old man who stood leaning on his tin horn the ladies will get wet i say cattleton called out bartley hubbard if a fellow only had a little supply of stockton's negative gravity he could ameliorate his condition don't you think yes i'd like to fall up hill just now the excitement would be refreshing there came a spiteful dash of rain and a flurry of wind you'ns had better go inter the still house said tolliver hit air goin' ter rain yearlin' calves go right erlong in ye sha'n't be hurt another gush of rain enforced the invitation and they all scrambled into the cabin pell mell glad of the relief from a strain that had become almost unbearable to some of them but they stared at each other when they found the door closed and securely locked on the outside prisoners cried some one whose voice was drowned by a deafening crash of thunder and a mighty flood of rain that threatened to crush in the rickety roof of the house the treacherous villain exclaimed dufour speaking of tolliver and holding miss moyne's hand the poor girl was so frightened that it was a comfort to her to have her hand held how grand how noble it is in mr tolliver and his friends said miss crabb to stand out there in the rain and let us have the shelter i never saw a more virile and thoroughly unselfish man than he is he is one of nature's unshorn heroes a man of the ancient god like race mrs nancy jones black gave the young woman a look of profound contempt then a crash of thunder wind and rain scattered everybody's thoughts xvii the storm was wild enough but of short duration and it came to its end as suddenly as it had begun as the black cloud departed from the sky the darkness which had been almost a solid inside the still house was pierced by certain lines of mild light coming through various chinks in the walls and roof our friends examined one another curiously as if to be sure that it was not all a dream cattleton found himself face to face with a demure looking young man whom he at once recognized as harry punner a writer of delicious verses and editor of a rollicking humorous journal at new york hello hal you here he cried well how does it strike your funny bone it insists upon appearing serious to me i'm smothering for a whiff of fresh air said punner in a very matter of fact tone can't we raise a window or something the only window visible to the naked eye said cattleton is already raised higher than i can reach and he pointed to a square hole in the wall about seven and a half feet above the ground and very near the roof crane went about in the room remarking that the aroma floating in the air was the bouquet of the very purest and richest copper distilled corn whisky and that if he could find it he was quite sure that a sip of it would prove very refreshing under the peculiar circumstances of the case an observation which called forth from mrs nancy jones black a withering temperance reprimand as the presiding officer of the woman's prohibition promulgation society i cannot let such a remark pass without condemning it if this really is a liquor establishment i desire to be let out of it forthwith so do i exclaimed little mrs philpot with great vehemence open the door mr hubbard please hubbard went to the door and finding that it was constructed to open outwardly gave it a shove with all his might there was a short tussle and he staggered back why don't you push it open fretfully exclaimed mrs nancy jones black the gentlemen outside object for reasons not stated was the rather stolidly spoken answer cattleton had taken off his hat and was going about through the company soliciting handkerchiefs drop them in drop them in he urged i need all of them that i can get he offered his hat as a contribution box as he spoke and nearly every one gave a handkerchief without in the least suspecting his purpose when he had collected a round dozen cattleton crammed them all down in the crown of his hat which he then put on his head now hal he said addressing punner give me a boost and i'll make an observation through that window the rain was now entirely ended and the wind had fallen still with punner's help cattleton got up to the window and poked out his head git back ther' growled a vicious voice and at the same time the dull sound of a heavy blow was followed by the retreat of cattleton from the window to the floor in a great hurry upon top of his hat was a deep trench made by a club the handkerchiefs did their duty nobly he remarked let everybody come forward and identify his property what did you see asked punner a giant with an oak tree in his hand and murder in his eye said cattleton busily selecting and returning the handkerchiefs this eleemosynary padding was all that saved me the blow was aimed at my divine intellect see here cried peck in great earnest this is no joking matter we're in the power of a set of mountain moonshiners and may be murdered in cold blood we'd better do something crane had prowled around until he had found a small jug of fragrant mountain dew whisky which he was proceeding to taste in true kentucky style when a gaunt form rose in a corner of the room and tottering forward seized the jug and took it out of his hand no ye don't sonny no ye don't this yer mounting jew air not ever'body's licker 'at wants it not by er half er mile at the littlest calc'lation miss crabb made a note crane gazed pathetically at the fantastic old man before him and brushed his handkerchief across his lips as if from habit as he managed to say i meant no undue liberty i assure you that whisky is overpowerin' interrupted the old man taking a sip from the vessel yes i don't blame ye fur a wantin' of it but this yer licker air mine up in kentucky said crane we are proud to offer kaintucky did ye say ole kaintuck air ye from ther' boy the octogenarian leaned forward as he spoke and gazed at crane with steadfast rheumy eyes miss henrietta stackpole came forward to hear what was to follow her instinct telling her that a point of human interest was about to be reached yes said crane i was born and reared on lulbegrud creek lulbegrud yes how fur f'om wright's mill close by at kiddville said crane ye 'member easton's springs close by an' pilot knob away off in the distance very well indeed and guoff's pond boy what mought yer name be crane crane yes well i'll ber dorg the old man stood gazing and grinning at crane for some moments and then added what's yer pap's name eliphas crane 'liphas crane yore pap yes child i air yer pap's uncle what i air peter job crane you sartin es anything are you my father's uncle peter i air yer pap's uncle pete how strange miss stackpole did not permit a word a look or a shade of this interview to escape her she now turned to bartley hubbard and said we americans are the victims of heterogeneous consanguinity such an incident as this could not happen in england it will be a long time before we can get rid of our ancestors yes assented hubbard nonchalantly yer pap's uncle certainly is a large factor in american life how many men did you see when you looked out peck inquired addressing cattleton i saw only one but he was a monster was the ready reply it's no use brooding over trying to escape by force we're utterly helpless and that jolt on my head has rendered me unfit for diplomatic efforts what do you suppose they will do with us they won't dare let us go why they'd be afraid that we would report their illicit distillery ah i see the affair began to take on a very serious and gloomy aspect and the room was growing oppressively hot owing to the presence of a a small but energetic furnace that glowed under a sighing boiler outside with the clearing sky and refreshed air there arose a clamor of bird song in the dripping trees under the floor the spring stream gurgled sweetly ye 'member abbott's still house on ole lulbegrud said the old man pursuing his reminisences after he had permitted his grand nephew to taste the mounting jew an' dan rankin's ole bob tail hoss very well indeed responded crane and billy pace's blackberry fields where i picked berries in summer and chased rabbits in winter take er nother drop o' the jyful juice boy fur the mem'ry o' ole kaintuck oh dear but isn't it incomparably awful exclaimed mrs nancy jones black gazing in horrified fascination upon the two kentuckians as they bowed to each other and drank alternately from the little jug characteristic southern scene not used by craddock murmured miss crabb making a whole page of a single note don't this yere liquor taste o' one thing an' smell o' another an' jes' kinder git ter the lowest p'int o' yer appetite continued crane's great uncle peter delicious beyond compare responded the young man drinking again it is nectar of the gods mrs nancy jones black groaned but could not withdraw her eyes from the scene good deal like ole times down to abbott's still house on lulbegrud boy the old man suggested ye don't forgit erbout dan rankin's mule a kickin' ole man hornback's hat off the poet laughed retrospectively and mopped his glowing face with his handkerchief the heat from the furnace and the stimulus of the excellent beverage were causing him to feel the need of fresh air indeed everybody was beginning to pant miss moyne was so overcome with excitement and with the heat of the place that she was ready to faint when the door was flung open and tolliver appeared a rush of sweet cool air flooding the room revived her just as she was sinking into dufour's arms xviii authors who have added the vice of elocution to the weakness of dialect verse making are often at a loss for a sympathetic audience whilst it is true that literary people are apt to bear with a good deal of patience the mutually offered inflictions incident to meeting one another they draw the line at dialect recitations and as a rule stubbornly refuse to be bored with a fantastic rendition of when johnny got spanked by a mule or livery stable bob or samantha's courtin' or over the ridge to the pest house no matter how dear a friend may offer the scourge circumstances alter cases however and although neither carleton nor riley nor yet burdette nor bill nye those really irresistible and wholly delightful humorists had come to hotel helicon there was a certain relief for those of the guests who had not joined the luckless pedestrians in hearing miss amelia lotus nebeker recite a long poem written in new jersey patois miss nebeker was very hard of hearing almost stone deaf indeed which affliction lent a pathetic effect even to her humor she was rather stout decidedly short and had a way of making wry faces with a view to adding comicality to certain turns of her new jersey phraseology and yet she was somewhat of a bore at times possibly she wished to read too often and sometimes upon very unsuitable occasions it was mrs bridges who once said that if the minister at a funeral should ask some one to say a few appropriate words miss nebeker if present would immediately clear her throat and begin reciting a jerseyman's jewsharp and if she once got started you'd never be able to stop her for she's as deaf as an adder it was during the rainstorm while those of the guests who had not gone to the hermit's hut with cattleton were in the cool and spacious parlor of the hotel that something was said about charles dickens reading from his own works strangely enough although the remark was uttered in a low key and at some distance from miss nebeker she responded at once with an offer to give them a new rendering of the jerseyman's jewsharp lucas the historian objected vigorously but she insisted upon interpreting his words and gestures as emphatic applause of her proposition she arose while he was saying oh now that's too much we're tired of the jangling of that old harp give us a rest this unexpected and surprising slang from so grave and dignified a man set everybody to laughing miss nebeker bowed in smiling acknowledgement of what appeared to her to be a flattering anticipation of her humor and taking her manuscript from some hiding place in her drapery made a grimace and began to read mrs philpot's cat in the absence of its mistress had taken up with the elocutionist and now came to rub and purr around her feet while she recited this was a small matter but in school or church or lecture hall small matters attract attention the fact that the cat now and again mewed plaintively set some of the audience to smiling and even to laughing such apparent approval of her new rendition thrilled miss nebeker to her heart's core her voice deepened her intonations caught the spirit of her mood and she read wildly well every one who has even a smattering of the patois current in new jersey will understand how effective it might be made in the larynx of a cunning elocutionist and then whoever has had the delicious experience of hearing a genuine jerseyman play on the jewsharp will naturally jump to a correct conclusion concerning the pathos of the subject which miss nebeker had in hand she felt its influence and threw all her power into it heavy as she was she arose on her tip toes at the turning point of the story and gesticulated vehemently the cat taken by surprise leaped aside a pace or two and glared in a half frightened way with each separate hair on its tail set stiffly of course there was more laughter which the reader took as applause a brace of cats exclaimed the historian a brace of cats nobody knew what he meant but the laughing increased simply for the reason that there was nothing to laugh at discovering pretty soon that miss nebeker really meant no harm by her manoeuvres the cat went back to rub and purr at her feet then miss nebeker let down her heel on the cat's tail at the same time beginning with the pathetic part of the jerseyman's jewsharp the unearthly squall that poor puss gave forth was wholly lost on the excited elocutionist but it quite upset the audience who not wishing to appear rude used their handkerchiefs freely miss nebeker paused to give full effect to a touching line the cat writhed and rolled and clawed the air and wailed like a lost spirit in its vain endeavor to free its tail but miss nebeker all unconscious of the situation and seeing her hearers convulsed and wiping tears from their faces redoubled her elocutionary artifices and poured incomparable feeling into her voice suddenly the tortured and writhing animal uttered a scream of blood curdling agony and lunged at miss nebeker's ankles with tooth and claw she was in the midst of the passage where the dying jerseyman lifts himself on his elbow and calls for his trusty jewsharp gi' me my juice harp sarah ann she was saying when of a sudden she screamed louder than the cat and bounded into the air sending her manuscript in fluttering leaves all over the room the cat with level tail and fiery eyes sailed through the door way into the hall and went as if possessed of a devil bounding up the stairway to mrs philpot's room congratulations were in order and lucas insisted upon bellowing in miss nebeker's ear his appreciation of the powerful effect produced by the last scene in the little drama if our friends who are out in this rain are finding anything half as entertaining he thundered they needn't mind the drenching but i'm bitten i'm scratched i'm hurt she exclaimed lucas suddenly realized the brutality of his attitude and hastened to rectify it by collecting the leaves of her manuscript and handing them to her i beg pardon he said sincerely i hope you are not hurt much just like a cat she cried always under somebody's feet i do despise them with a burning face and trembling hands she swiftly rearranged the manuscript and assuming the proper attitude asked the audience to be seated again i am bitten and scratched quite severely she said and am suffering great pain but if you will resume your places i will begin over again call that cat back then quick exclaimed lucas it's the star performer in the play she proceeded forthwith setting out on a new journey through the tortuous ways of the poem and held up very well to the end what she called new jersey patois was a trifle flat when put into verse and she lacked the polished buffoonery of a successful dialect reader wherefore she failed to get along very successfully with her audience in the absence of the cat still the reading served to kill a good deal of time by a mangling process the storm was over long ago when she had finished and the sun was flooding the valley with golden splendor along the far away mountain ridges some slanting wisps of whitish mist sailed slowly like aerial yachts riding dark blue billows the foliage of the trees lately dusky and drooping twinkled vividly with a green that was almost dazzling and the air was deliciously fresh and fragrant everybody went out on the veranda for a turn and a deep breath the mail had arrived and by a mistake a bundle of letters bearing the card of george dunkirk co and addressed to george dunkirk esq hotel helicon room was handed to lucas the historian gazed at the superscription adjusted his glasses and gazed again and slowly the truth crept into his mind there were ten or fifteen of the letters evidently some of them as lucas's experience suggested had alien letters inclosed within their envelopes and thus forwarded by the mailing clerk of the firm had at last come to the senior partner at room gaspard dufour indeed lucas exclaimed inwardly george dunkirk rather this is a pretty kettle of fish he sent the letters up to room to await the return of their proper recipient and fell to reflecting upon the many very many and very insulting things that he and nearly all the rest of the hotel guests as well had said in dufour's hearing about publishers in general and about george dunkirk co in particular his face burned with the heat of the retrospect as he recalled such phrases as sleek thief manipulator of copy right statements cadmean wolf ghoul of literary grave yards and a hundred others applied with utter unrestraint and bandied around while george dunkirk was sitting by listening to it all he called ferris to him and imparted his discovery in a stage whisper the dickens was all that gentleman could say as the full text of his address of the other evening rushed upon him it is awkward devilish awkward remarked lucas wiping his glasses and nervously readjusting them a few minutes later two men rode up to the hotel one of them was a very quiet looking fellow who dryly stated that he was the high sheriff of mt boab county xix meantime down the ravine in the obscure little still house our pedestrians were held in durance vile by tolliver and his obedient moon shiners it was a puzzling situation to all concerned far from wishing or intending to harm his prisoners tolliver still could not see his way clear to setting them at liberty on the other hand he was clever enough to perceive that to hold them very long would be sure to lead to disaster for their friends would institute a search and at the same time telegraph an account of their disappearance all over the country 'pears ter me like i've ketched bigger game 'an my trap'll hold he thought as he stood in the door way surveying his victims what ye all a doin' a monkeyin' round' these yer premerses anyhow he demanded w'y c'udn't ye jest wait 'll i sent for ye ter kem yer it's a sort of surprise party my dear sir said cattleton don't you see s'prise set o' meddlin' yankees a foolin' roun' wher' they air not got no business at responded tolliver that's w'at i calls it where's your pantry inquired punner i'm as hungry as a wolf hongry air ye what'd ye 'spect ter git ter eat at er still house anyhow hain't ye got no sense er tall air ye er plum blasted eejit tolliver made these inquiries in a voice and manner suggestive of suppressed but utter wrath oh he's always hungry he would starve in a feed store exclaimed cattleton don't pay the least attention to him mr tolliver he's incurably hungry w'y ef the man's really hongry tolliver began to say in a sympathetic tone here interrupted hubbard gruffly let us out of this immediately can't you the ladies can't bear this foul air much longer it's beastly mebbe hit air you 'at air a running this yer chebang said tolliver with a scowl i'll jes' let ye out w'en i git ready an' not a minute sooner nother so ye've hearn my tin horn miss stackpole and miss crabb made notes in amazing haste hubbard shrugged his heavy shoulders and bit his lip he was baffled do you think they'll kill us murmured miss moyne in dufour's ear dufour could not answer crane and his pap's uncle pete were still hobnobbing over the jug yer's a lookin' at ye boy an' a hopin' agin hope 'at ye may turn out ter be es likely a man es yer pap the old man was saying preliminary to another draught crane was bowing with extreme politeness in acknowledgement of the sentiment and was saying i am told that i look like my father yes ye do look a leetle like im interrupted the old man with a leer over the jug but l'me say at it air dern leetle boy dern leetle punner overhearing this reply laughed uproariously crane appeared oblivious to the whole force of the joke however he was simply waiting for his turn at the jug as i wer' a sayin' resumed the old man yer's er hopin' agin' hope an' a lookin' at ye how utterly brutal and disgusting cried mrs nancy jones black i must leave here i cannot bear it longer this is nothing but a low vile dram shop let me pass she attempted to go through the doorway but tolliver interfered stay wher' ye air he said in a respectful but very stern tone ye can't git out o' yer jist yit dear me dear me wailed mrs black what an outrage what an insult are you men she cried turning upon the gentlemen near her and will you brook this give me your handkerchiefs again said cattleton and i will once more poke out my head 'tis all that i can do shoot the fust head 'at comes out'n thet ther winder dave ordered tolliver speaking to some one outside i don't care for any handkerchiefs thank you said cattleton i've changed my mind miss moyne was holding dufour's arm with a nervous clutch her eyes were full of tears and she was trembling violently he strove to quiet her by telling her that there was no danger that he would shield her die for her and all that but tolliver looked so grim and the situation was so strange and threatening that she could not control herself goodness but isn't this rich material miss crabb soliloquized writing in her little red book with might and main bret harte never discovered anything better miss henrietta stackpole was too busy absorbing the human interest of the interview between the two cranes to be more than indirectly aware of anything else that was going on around her ye needn't be erfeard as ter bein' hurt boy said the old man not es long es yer pap's uncle pete air eroun' yer hit ain't often 'at i meets up wi' kinfolks downyer an' w'en i does meet up wi' 'em i treats 'em es er southern gen'l'man orter treat his kinfolks precisely so said crane taking another sip hospitality is a crowning southern virtue when i go up to louisville henry watterson and i always have a good time spect ye do boy spect ye do louisville use ter be a roarin' good place ter be at tolliver whose wits had been hard at work now proposed what he called terms o' pay roll like what they hed in the war ef ye'll all take a oath an' swa' at ye'll never tell nothin' erbout nothin said he w'y i'll jest let ye off this yer time that is fair enough said dufour we are not in the detective service then observed tolliver ef i ken git the 'tention of this yer meetin' i move 'at it air yerby considered swore 'at nothin' air ter be said erbout nothin' at no time an' never do ye all swa' yes rang out a chorus of voices hit air cyarried said tolliver an' the meetin' air dismissed sigh er die ye kin all go on erbout yer business the pedestrians filed out into the open air feeling greatly relieved crane lingered to have a few more passages with his sociable and hospitable grand uncle indeed he remained until the rest of the party had passed out of sight up the ravine and he did not reach the hotel until far in the night when he sang some songs under miss moyne's window taken altogether the pedestrians felt that they had been quite successful in their excursion dufour was happiness itself on the way back he had chosen for himself and miss moyne a path which separated them from the others giving him an opportunity to say a great deal to her now it is a part of our common stock of understanding that when a man has an excellent and uninterrupted opportunity to say a great deal to a beautiful young woman he usually does not find himself able to say much still he rarely fails to make himself understood they both looked so self consciously happy when they arrived a little later than the rest at hotel helicon that suspicion would have been aroused but for two startling and all absorbing disclosures which drove away every other thought one was the disclosure of the fact that dufour was not dufour but george dunkirk and the other was the disclosure of the fact that the high sheriff of mt boab county was in hotel helicon on important official business little mrs philpot was the first to discover that the great publisher really had not practiced any deception as to his name indeed her album showed that the signature therein was after all george dunkirk and not gaspard dufour the autograph was not very plain it is true but it was decipherable and the mistake was due to her own bad reading if the sheriff had been out of the question the humiliation felt by the authors for whom dunkirk was publisher and who had talked so outrageously about him would have crushed them into the dust but the sheriff was there in his most terrible form and he forced himself upon their consideration with his quiet but effective methods of legal procedure xx gaslucky has been caught in a wheat corner at chicago lucas explained and has been squeezed to death dead cried punner it's a great loss we'll have to hold a meeting and pass res we'll have to get out of this place in short order said lucas the sheriff has levied an attachment on the hotel and all it contains what how's that do you mean that the house is to be shut up and we turned out just that said lucas the sheriff has invoiced every thing even the provisions on hand he says that we can't eat another bite here and i'm starving even now exclaimed punner i could eat most anything let's walk round to delmonico's cattleton but really what can we do demanded ferris dolefully enough go home of course said cattleton ferris looked blank and stood with his hands thrust in his pockets i can't go home he presently remarked why i haven't money enough to pay my way by george neither have i exclaimed cattleton with a start that is precisely my fix said lucas gravely you echo my predicament said peck my salary is suspended during my absence said punner with his eyes bent on the floor little mrs philpot was speechless for a time as the force of the situation broke upon her squeezed in a wheat corner inquired miss stackpole what do you mean by that i mean that gaslucky got sheared in the big deal the other day at chicago lucas explained got sheared yes the bulls sat down on him oh you mean a speculation a yes gaslucky was in for all he was worth and they run it down on him and flattened him a gas man's no business in wheat especially in chicago they spread him out just as the sheriffs proceedings have flattened all our hopes for the present it's just outrageous cried little mrs philpot finding her voice he should have notified us so that they didn't notify him i guess said cattleton no he found it out afterwards remarked lucas glancing gloomily toward where dunkirk and miss moyne stood apparently in light and pleasant conversation viewed in any light the predicament was a peculiar and distressing one to the guests of hotel helicon the sheriff a rather ignorant but very stubborn and determined man held executions and writs of attachment sued out by gaslucky creditors which he had proceeded to levy on the hotel and on all the personalty visible in it belonging to the proprietor 'course said he hit'll be poorty hard on you'ns but i can't help it i've got ter do my juty let it hurt whoever it will not er thing kin ye tech at's in this yer tavern 'ceptin' what's your'n that air's jest how it air so now mind w'at yer a doin' the servants were idle the dining room closed the kitchen and pantries locked up never was there a more doleful set of people mrs nancy jones black thought of playing a piece of sacred music but she found the grand piano locked with its key deep in the sheriff's pocket the situation was made doubly disagreeable when at last the officer informed the guests that they would have to vacate their rooms forthwith as he should proceed at once to close up the building heavens man are you going to turn us out into the woods demanded peck woods er no woods he replied ye'll hev ter git out'n yer right off but the ladies mr sheriff suggested punner no southern gentleman can turn a lady out of doors the officer actually colored with the force of the insinuation he stood silent for some time with his eyes fixed on the floor presently he looked up and said the weeming kin stay till mornin' well they must have something to eat said punner they can't starve thet's so the sheriff admitted they kin hev a bite er so and we you men folks cayn't hev a dorg gone mouthful so shet up well observed cattleton dryly it appears the odds is the difference between falling into the hands of moonshiners and coming under the influence of a lawful sheriff i know a little law interposed bartley hubbard with a sullen emphasis and i know that this sheriff has no right to tumble us out of doors and for my part fur yer part said the sheriff coolly fur yer part mister ef ye fool erlong o' me i'll crack yer gourd fur ye you'll do what i'll stave in yer piggin i don't understand w'y blame yer ignorant hide wha' wer' ye borned and fotch up i'll jest knock the everlastin' head off'n ye thet's 'zac'ly w'at i says mebbe ye don't understan' thet yes said hubbard visibly shrinking into himself i begin to suspect your meaning miss crabb was taking notes with enthusiastic rapidity dunkirk called the sheriff to him and a long conference was held between them the result of which was presently announced i heve thort it over said the quiet officer of the law an' es hit appear thet w'at grub air on han' an' done cooked might spile afore it c'u'd be sold therefore i proclamate an' say at you'ns kin stay yer tell termorrer an' eat w'at's cooked but tech nothin' else cattleton and punner applauded loudly to everybody the announcement was a reprieve of no small moment and a sigh of relief rustled through the groups of troubled guests those who had been down the ravine were very tired and hungry the thought of a cold luncheon to them was the vision of a feast dunkirk had a basket of wine brought down from his room and he made the sheriff sit beside him at the table we may as well make the most of our last evening together he said glancing jovially around we shall have to walk down the mountain in the morning i suppose remarked bartley hubbard that's jest w'at's the matter observed the sheriff but the ladies my dear sir the ladies began punner the weeming they'll hev kinveyances young man so ye kin jest shet up ef ye please the officer interrupted with a good natured wink and a knowing wag of his head a disinterested observer would have noted readily enough that the feast was far from a banquet there was ferris for instance munching a biscuit and sipping his wine and pretending to enjoy punner's sallies and cattleton's drolleries while down in his heart lay the leaden thought the hideous knowledge of an empty pocket indeed the reflection was a common one weighting down almost every breast at the board one little incident did make even ferris forget himself for a moment or two it was when deaf miss nebeker misinterpreted some remark made by hubbard and arose with a view to reciting the jerseyman's jewsharp with a new variation oh jerseyman joe had a jewsharp of gold she began in her most melodious drawl she could not hear the protesting voices of her friends and she misinterpreted the stare of the sheriff for the good heaven's sake hubbard cried lucas do use your influence quick please or i shall collapse bartley hubbard took hold of her dress and gently pulled her down into her chair the sheriff objects he yelled in her ear after dinner she resignedly inquired well then after dinner in the parlor when the feast had come to the crumbs dunkirk arose and said we all have had a good time at the hotel helicon but our sojourn upon the heights of mt boab has been cut short by a certain chain of mishaps over which we have had no control and to morrow we go away doubtless forever i feel like saying that i harbor no unpleasant recollections of the days we have spent together cattleton sprung to his feet to move a vote of thanks to the public spirited and benevolent man who built this magnificent hotel and threw open its doors to us it was carried now then said lucas adjusting his glasses and speaking in his gravest chest tones i move that it be taken as the sense of this assembly that it is our duty to draw upon our publisher for money enough to take us home the response was overwhelming dunkirk felt the true state of affairs he arose his broad face wreathed with genial smiles and said to the certain knowledge of your unhappy publisher your accounts are already overdrawn but in view of the rich material you have been gathering of late your publisher will honor you draughts to the limit of your expenses home never did happier people go to bed the last sleep in hotel helicon proved to be the sweetest far in the night it is true some one sang loudly but plaintively under miss moyne's window until the sheriff awoke and sallied forth to end the serenade with some remarks about cracking that eejit's gourd but there was no disturbance the sounds blending sweetly with the dreams of the slumberers they all knew that it was crane poor fellow who had finally torn himself away from his father's fascinating uncle xxi the retreat from hotel helicon was picturesque in the extreme there had been much difficulty in finding vehicles to take the retiring guests down the mountain to the railway station but tolliver had come to the rescue with a mule a horse a cart and an ox these when added to the rather incongruous collection of wagons and carts from every other available source barely sufficed tolliver led the mule with ferris on its back while miss crabb and miss stackpole occupied the ox cart the former acting as driver good bye and good luck to ye the sheriff called after them mighty sorry ter discommode ye but juty air juty an' a officer air no respecter of persons mrs nancy jones black sat beside crane in a rickety wagon and between jolts gave him many a word of wisdom on the subject of strong drink which the handsome bourbon poet stowed away for future consideration dunkirk and miss moyne rode upon the hounds of a naked wood wain as happy as two blue birds in april while bartley hubbard with little mrs philpot and her child and some other ladies was in an old weather beaten barouche a sad relic of the ante bellum times for the rest there were vehicles of every sort save the comfortable sort and all went slowly winding and zig zagging down mt boab toward the valley and the river why pursue them once they all looked up from far down the slope and saw hotel helicon shining like a castle of gold in the flood of summer sunlight its verandas were empty its windows closed but the flag on its wooden tower still floated bravely in the breeze its folds appearing to touch the soft gray blue sky a year later crane and peck met at saratoga and talked over old times at length coming down to the present crane said of all of us who were guests on mt boab miss moyne is the only one who has found success her story on the heights is in its seventieth edition oh well said peck that goes without the saying anybody could succeed with her chance her chance why do you say that haven't you heard ah i see that the news has not yet penetrated the wilds of kentucky the open secret of miss moyne's success lies in the fact that she has married her publisher a silence of some minutes followed during which crane burned his cigar very rapidly what fools we were peck presently ventured to be fighting a duel about her no sir said crane with a far away look in his eyes no sir i would die for her right now so the subject was dropped between them forever some of gaslucky's creditors bought hotel helicon at the sheriff's sale but it proved a barren investment the house stands there now weather beaten and lonely on the peak of mt boab all tenantless and forlorn as to tolliver's still house i cannot say but at stated intervals crane receives a small cask marked j'yful juice hannel with keer which comes from his pap's uncle pete the end the tale of a sculptor by hugh conway the tale of a sculptor chapter i after you pass the blue anchor the sign of which swings from the branch of an elm tree older even than the house itself a few steps along the road bring you in sight of the pinnacled square tower of coombe acton church you cannot see the church itself as with schools and rectory close by it it lies at the back of the village about two hundred yards up a lane like the village to whose spiritual needs it ministers the church to an ordinary observer is nothing out of the common although certain small peculiarities of architecture not noticed by an uncultured eye make it an object of some interest to archaeologists visit it or not according to your inclination but afterwards keep on straight through the long straggling village until the houses begin to grow even more straggling the gardens larger and less cared for as ornaments displaying more cabbages and scarlet runners than roses keep on until the houses cease altogether and hawthorn hedges take the place of palings and crumbling walls and at last you will come to watercress farm a long low white house one side of which abuts on the highway whilst the other looks over the three hundred acres of land attached to it not a very large acreage it is true but then it is all good land for the most part such as auctioneers describe as rich warm deep old pasture land such land that at the time this tale opens any farmer by thrift knowledge of his business and hard work could make even more than a bare living out of and could meet his landlord on rent day with a cheerful face knowing that after rent and other outgoings were provided for something would yet be left for himself who occupies the watercress farm now and whether in these days of depression his rent is forthcoming or not matters little at the time i write of it it was rented by farmer leigh even as his forefathers according to village tradition had rented it for some two hundred years in quiet conservative places like coombe acton a farm of this kind often goes from father to son with more regularity than an entailed estate landlord and tenant well knowing that their interests are identical it was a fine afternoon towards the end of june abraham leigh was standing by the gate of the field known as the home meadow looking at the long ripe grass rippling as the summer breeze swept across it he was a thoroughly good specimen of the somersetshire farmer a big sturdy man whose movements were slow and deliberate his face if heavy and stolid not by any means the face of a fool no doubt a man of circumscribed views the world for him extending eastwards to bristol market and westwards to the bristol channel nevertheless respected in his little world as a wonderful judge of a beast a great authority on tillages and above all a man who always had a balance in his favor at the somersetshire bank a type of that extinct race the prosperous farmer who looked on all townsmen with contempt thinking as all farmers should think that the owners of broad acres and those engaged in agriculture were alone worthy of respect yet to day in spite of his advantages and acquirements farmer leigh looked on the fifteen acre meadow with a puzzled and discontented expression on his honest face and moreover murmurs of dissatisfaction were proceeding from his lips farmers somersetshire farmers especially are proverbial grumblers but it is seldom they grumble without an audience it is outsiders who get the benefit of their complaints besides one would think that the tenant of watercress farm had little at present to complain of the drop of rain so badly wanted had been long in coming but it had come just in the nick of time to save the grass and if the crop outwardly looked a little thin mr leigh's experienced eye told him that the undergrowth was thick and that the quality of the hay would be first class moreover what corn and roots he had looked promising so it seems strange that the farmer should be grumbling when he had no one to listen to him and should lean so disconsolately upon the gate of the field when no one observed him i can't make him out he said good boy he be too yet instead o' helping me with the land always going about dreaming or messing with mud can't think where he got his notions from suppose it must 'a been from the mother poor thing always fond o' gimcracks and such like she were gave the lad such an outlandish name i'm ashamed to hear it father's and grandfather's name ought to be good enough for a leigh good boy though he be too a soft look settled on abraham leigh's face as he repeated the last words then he went deeper into his slough of despond where no doubt he battled as manfully as a christian until he reached the other shore and fancied he had found the solution of his difficulties his face brightened tell 'ee what he said addressing the waving grass in front of him i'll ask mr herbert squire's a man who have seen the world i'll take his advice about the boy seems hard like on me too ne'er a leigh till this one but what were a farmer to the backbone his mind made up the farmer strode off to make arrangement with mowers had he been troubled with twenty unnatural and incompetent sons the hay must be made while the sun shines although he had settled what to do it was some time before the weighty resolve was carried into execution folks about coombe acton do not move with the celerity of cotton brokers or other men of business sure they are but slow so it was not until the september rent day that the farmer consulted his landlord about his domestic difficulty the possession of a son an only child of about fifteen who instead of making himself useful on the land did little else save wander about in a dreamy way looking at all objects in nature animate or inanimate or employed himself in the mysterious pursuit which his father described as messing with mud such conduct was a departure from the respectable bucolic traditions of the leigh family so great that at times the father thought it an infliction laid upon him for some cause or other by an inscrutable providence there are certain spanish noblemen who on account of the antiquity of their families and services rendered are permitted to enter the royal presence with covered heads it was perhaps for somewhat similar reasons a custom handed down from father to son and established by time that the tenant of watercress farm paid his rent to the landlord in person not through the medium of an agent mr herbert being an important man in the west country the leigh family valued this privilege as highly as ever hidalgo valued the one above mentioned mr herbert a refined intellectual looking man of about fifty received the farmer kindly and after the rent without a word as to abatement or reduction had been paid in notes of the county bank dark and greasy but valued in this particular district far above bank of england promises landlord and tenant settled down to a few minutes' conversation on crops and kindred subjects then the farmer unburdened his mind i've come to ask a favor of your advice sir about my boy jerry yes said mr herbert i know him a nice good looking boy i see him at church with you and about your place when i pass what of him well you zee zur said the farmer speaking with more somerset dialect than usual he've a been at bristol grammar school till just now masters all send good accounts of him i don't hold wi' too much learning so thought 'twere time he come home and helped me like but not a bit o' good he be on the varm not a bit zur spends near all his time messing about wi' dirt doing what asked mr herbert astonished a muddling and a messing with bits o' clay making little figgers like and tries to bake 'em in the oven oh i see what you mean what sort of figures all sorts sir little clay figgers of horses dogs pigs why you'd scarce believe it sir last week i found him making the figger of a naked 'ooman a naked 'ooman why the lad could never a' seen such a thing abraham leigh waited with open eyes to hear mr herbert's opinion of such an extraordinary if not positively unusual proceeding mr herbert smiled perhaps your son is a youthful genius genius or not i want to know sir what to do wi' him how's the boy to make a living a farmer he'll never be you follow me and i will show you something mr herbert led his guest to his drawing room a room furnished with the taste of a travelled man as the farmer gaped at its splendor he directed his attention to four beautiful statues standing in the corners of the room i gave the man who made those seven hundred pounds for them and could sell them to morrow for a thousand if i chose that's almost as good as farming isn't it his tenant's eyes were wide with amazement a thousand pounds sir he gasped why you might have bought that fourteen acre field with that these give me more pleasure than land replied mr herbert but about your boy when i am riding by i will look in and see what he can do then give you my advice the farmer thanked him and returned home as he jogged along the road to watercress farm he muttered at intervals a thousand pounds in those white figures well well well i never did mr herbert was a man who kept a promise whether made to high or low five days after his interview with abraham leigh he rode up to the door of the farm he was not alone by his side rode a gay laughing light haired child of thirteen who ruled an indulgent father with a rod of iron mr herbert had been a widower for some years the girl and a boy who was just leaving harrow for the university being his only surviving children the boy was perhaps all that mr herbert might have wished but he could see no fault in the precocious imperious spoilt little maid who was the sunshine of his life she tripped lightly after her father into the farm house laughing at the way in which he was obliged to bend his head to avoid damage from the low doorway she seated herself with becoming dignity on the chair which the widowed sister who kept house for abraham leigh tendered her with many courtesies a pretty child indeed and one who gave rare promise of growing into a lovely woman the farmer was away somewhere on the farm but could be fetched in a minute if mr herbert would wait mr herbert waited and very soon his tenant made his appearance and thanked his visitor for the trouble he was taking on his behalf now let me see the boy said mr herbert after disclaiming all sense of trouble leigh went to the door of the room and shouted out jerry jerry come down you're wanted my man in a moment the door opened and the cause of mr leigh's discontent came upon the scene in the form of a dark eyed dark haired pale faced boy tall but slightly built not so far as physique went much credit to the country side yet in some respects a striking looking if not handsome lad the dark eloquent eyes and strongly marked brow would arrest attention but the face was too thin too thoughtful for the age and could scarcely be associated with what commonly constitutes a good looking lad yet regularity of feature was there and no one would dare to be sure that beauty would not come with manhood he was not seen at that moment under advantageous circumstances knowing nothing about the distinguished visitors he had obeyed his father's summons in hot haste consequently he entered the room in his shirt sleeves which were certainly not very clean and with hands covered with red clay mr herbert looked amused while the little princess turned up her nose in great disdain poor abraham leigh was much mortified at the unpresentable state in which his son showed himself to make matters worse the boy was not soiled by honest legitimate toil tut tut he said crossly all of a muck as usual the boy who felt that his father had a right to complain hung his head and showed signs of retreating mr herbert came to the rescue never mind he said patting young leigh on the shoulder he has been working in his own fashion i have come on purpose to see those modellings of yours my boy the boy started as one surprised his cheek flushed and he looked at the speaker with incredulity yet hope in his eyes yes said his father sharply go and put your hands under the pump jerry then bring some of 'em down maybe anyway they'll amuse the little lady no no said mr herbert i'll come with you and see them for myself lead the way young leigh did not speak but his eyes thanked mr herbert that gentleman followed him from the room leaving the farmer to amuse the little maid he did this so far as he was able by producing a well thumbed copy of the pilgrim's progress the leaves of which miss herbert condescended to turn daintily over until she was quite terrified by the picture of the combat with apollyon meanwhile jerry with a beating heart led mr herbert up stairs to a room destitute of furniture save an old table and chair a bucket half full of common red clay stood in one corner and on the table were several of the little clay figures which had excited the farmer's ire and consternation crude defective full of faults as they were there was enough power in them to make mr herbert look at the lad in wonderment almost envy he was a man who worshipped art who had dabbled as an amateur in painting and sculpturing for years who considered a gifted artist the most fortunate of mankind so the word envy is not ill chosen what he would have given half his wealth to possess came to this boy unsought for to the son of a clod of a farmer the precious gift was vouchsafed as he would have expected the most ambitious efforts were the worst the naked 'ooman was particularly atrocious but still wet and not ruined by an abortive attempt at baking was a group modelled from life a vulgar subject representing as it did abraham leigh's prize sow surrounded by her ten greedy offspring there was such power and talent in this production that had he seen nothing else mr herbert would have been certain that the lad as a modeller and copyist must take the first rank if in addition to his manual dexterity he had poetry feeling and imagination it might well be that one of the greatest sculptors of the nineteenth century stood in embryo before him as mr herbert glanced from the rough clay sketches to the pale boy who stood breathless as one expecting a verdict of life or death he wondered what could have been the cause of such a divergence from the traits habitual to the leighs then he remembered that some twenty years ago abraham leigh had chosen for a wife not one of his own kind but a dweller in cities a governess who exchanged no doubt a life of penury and servitude for the rough but comfortable home the somersetshire farmer was willing to give her mr herbert remembered her remembered how utterly out of place the delicate refined woman seemed to be as leigh's wife remembered how a few years after the birth of the boy she sickened and died it was from the mother's side the artistic taste came mr herbert although a kind man was cautious he had no intention of raising hopes which might be futile yet he felt a word of encouragement was due to the lad some of these figures show decided talent he said after seeing them i need scarcely ask you if you wish to be a sculptor young leigh clasped his hands together oh sir he gasped if it could only be you do not care to be a farmer like your father i could never be a farmer sir i am not fit for it yet if you follow in your father's track you will lead a comfortable useful life if you follow art you may go through years of poverty and suffering before success is attained the boy raised his head and looked full at the speaker there was almost passionate entreaty in his eyes oh sir he said if you would only persuade my father to let me try even for a few years if i did not succeed i would come back to him and work as a laborer for the rest of my life without a murmur mr herbert was impressed by the boy's earnestness i will speak to your father he said then the two went back to the sitting room where they found abraham leigh much exercised by some difficult questions propounded by miss herbert respecting the nature of apollyon take my little girl for a walk round the garden said mr herbert to young leigh i want to speak to your father in spite of the great gulf between her and the clay bespattered boy in his shirt sleeves the little princess was too glad of a change of scene to wish to disobey her father she followed her conductor to the back of the house and the boy and girl stepped out into the autumnal sunshine the little maid looked so trim and dainty in her neat riding habit coquettish hat and tiny gloves that his own draggled appearance struck the boy forcibly if you will excuse me a minute he said i will run and wash my hands yes i think it will be better said miss herbert with dignity in a minute or two young leigh returned he had found time not only to wash the rich red clay from his long well shaped fingers but to slip on his coat and generally beautify himself his improved appearance had a great effect upon the child who like most of her age was influenced by exteriors so miss herbert this little great lady unbent and allowed jerry to lead her round the old fashioned garden to the out houses and pigsties where the obese pigs lay oblivious of what fate had in store for them to the stables to the dairy where she condescended to drink a glass of new milk and by the time they had returned to the garden the two were as good friends as their different stations in life would permit young leigh who saw in this dainty little maid the incarnation of fairies nymphs goddesses and other ideals which in a dim way were forming themselves in his brain endeavored after his first shyness had passed away to show her what beautiful shapes and forms could be found in flower leaf and tree and other things in nature his talk indeed soared far above her pretty little head and when they returned to the garden he was trying to make her see that those masses of white clouds low down in the distance were two bodies of warriors just about to meet in deadly fray you are a very very funny boy said miss herbert with such an air of conviction that he was startled into silence your name is jerry isn't it she continued jerry's an ugly name my name is gerald gerald leigh oh gerald even this child could see the impropriety of a tenant farmer having a son named gerald no wonder abraham leigh addressed his boy as jerry do you like being a farmer she asked i am not going to be a farmer i don't like it what a pity farmers are such a worthy respectable class of men said the girl using a stock phrase she had caught up somewhere the boy laughed merrily mr herbert's approbation sat newly upon him and he was only talking to a child so he said i hope to be worthy and respectable but a much greater man than a farmer oh how great as great as papa yes i hope so that's absurd you know said miss herbert with all the outraged family pride that thirteen years can feel and turning away she switched at the flowers with her riding whip however a few words from gerald made them friends once more and she expressed her pleasure that he should pick her one of the few roses which remained in the garden roses are common said the boy every one gives roses i will give you something prettier he went to the sunny side of the house and soon returned with half a dozen pale lavender stars in his hands they were blossoms of a new sort of late clematis which some one's gardener had given abraham leigh gerald's deft fingers arranged them into a most artistic bouquet the appearance of which was entirely spoilt by miss herbert's insistence that two or three roses should be added the bouquet was just finished and presented when mr herbert followed by the farmer appeared although he said nothing more to young leigh on the subject which was uppermost in the boy's mind the kindly encouraging look he gave him raised the widest hopes in his heart mr herbert bade the father and son a pleasant good day and rode off with his little daughter miss herbert carried the bunch of clematis for about two miles when finding it rather encumbered her tossed it over a hedge gerald leigh went back to his attic and commenced about half a dozen clay sketches of the prettiest object which as yet had crossed his path for several days he was on thorns to hear what fate had in store for him but fate personified by his father made no sign but went about his work stolid and sphinx like mr herbert gerald learned had gone to london for a few days however before a fortnight had gone by abraham leigh received a letter from his landlord and the same evening whilst smoking his pipe in the farm kitchen informed his son and his sister that to morrow he was going into gloucestershire to see if his brother joseph could spare him one of his many boys to take jerry's place jerry was to go to london the next day and meet mr herbert most likely he'd stay there 'twas clear as noontide the boy would never make a farmer and if there were fools enough in the world to buy white figures at hundreds of pounds apiece jerry might as well try to make his living that way as any other the truth is mr herbert told abraham leigh that if he would not consent to pay for his son's art education he mr herbert would bear the expense himself but the monetary part of it troubled the substantial farmer little he could pay for his child's keep if he could bring his mind to consent to his going and now the consent was given gerald heard his father's communication with glowing eyes for shame's sake he hid his joy for he knew that with all his stolid demeanor his father almost broke down as he contemplated the diverging paths his son and he must henceforward thread the boy thanked him from his heart and the rough farmer laying his hand on his child's head blessed him and bade him go and prosper in this way gerald leigh left coombe acton at long intervals he reappeared for a few days the worthy villagers eyed him askance the only conception they could form of his profession being connected with dark skinned itinerants who bore double tiered platforms on their heads and earned a precarious livehood by traversing the country selling conventional representations of angels and busts of eminent men chapter ii some seven years after the ambitious boy left coombe acton honest farmer abraham just when the old fashioned hawthorn hedges were in whitest bloom sickened turned his stolid face to the wall and died gerald had been summoned but arrived too late to see his father alive perhaps it was as well it should be so the farmer's last moments were troubled ones and full of regret that watercress farm would no longer know a leigh the nephew who had taken gerald's place had turned out an utter failure so much so that abraham leigh had roundly declared that he would be bothered with no more boys and for the last few years had managed his business single handed however although gerald's upheaval of family traditions made the farmer's deathbed unhappy he showed that his son had not forfeited his love all he possessed some three thousand pounds was left to him mr herbert took the lease of the farm off the young man's hands by and by the live and the dead stock were sold off and watercress farm was waiting for another tenant the winding up of the father's affairs kept gerald in the neighborhood of some weeks and when it became known that mr herbert had insisted upon his taking up his quarters at the hall the simple coombe acton folks were stricken with a great wonder knowing nothing of what is called the aristocracy of art their minds were much exercised by such an unheard of proceeding what had jerry leigh being doing in the last seven years to merit such a distinction nothing his agricultural friends could have understood after picking up the rudiments of his art in a well known sculptor's studio young leigh had been sent to study in the schools at paris mr herbert told him that so far as his art was concerned paris was the workshop of the world rome its bazaar and showroom so to paris the boy went he studied hard and lived frugally he won certain prizes and medals and was now looking forward to the time when he must strike boldly for fame even now he was not quite unknown a couple of modest but very beautiful studies in low relief had appeared in last year's exhibition and if overlooked by the majority had attracted the notice of a few whose praise was well worth winning he was quite satisfied with the results of his first attempt in all things that concerned his art he was wise and patient no sooner had he placed his foot on the lowest step of the ladder than he realized the amount of work to be done the technical skill to be acquired before he could call himself a sculptor even now after seven years' study and labor he had selfdenial enough to resolve upon being a pupil for three years longer before he made his great effort to place himself by the side of contemporary sculptors passionate and impulsive as was his true nature he could follow and woo art with that calm persistency and method which seem to be the surest way of winning her smiles he is now a man a singularly handsome man if not so tall as his youth promised he is well built and graceful artist is stamped all over him brow eyes even the slender well shaped hands proclaim it the general expression of his face is one of calm and repose yet an acute observer might assert that when the moment came that face might depict passions stronger than those which sway most men his dark hair and eyes and something in the style of his dress gave him a look not quite that of an englishman a look that terribly vexed poor abraham leigh on those rare occasions when his erratic boy paid him a visit but nevertheless it is a look not out of place on a young artist this is the kind of man gerald leigh has grown into and whilst his transformation has been in progress miss eugenia herbert has become a woman although remembering every feature of the child who seemed in some way associated with the day of his liberation gerald had not again seen her until his father's death called him back to england each time he had visited coombe acton he had of course reported progress to mr herbert but shortly after the change in his life mr herbert by a great effort of self denial had sent his darling away to school and at school she had always been when gerald called at the hall but now when he accepted mr herbert's hospitality he found the fairy like child grown it seemed to him into his ideal woman and found moreover that there was a passion so intense that even the love of art must pale before it he made no attempt to resist it he let it master him overwhelm him sweep him along ere a week had gone by not only by looks but also in burning words he had told eugenia he loved her and how did he fare his very audacity and disregard of everything save that he loved the girl succeeded to a marvel eugenia had already met with many admirers but not one like this such passionate pleading such fiery love such vivid eloquence were strange and new to her there was an originality a freshness a thoroughness in the love he offered her his very unreasonableness affected her reason all the wealth of his imagination all the crystallizations of his poetical dreams he threw into his passion his ecstasy whirled the girl from her mental feet his warmth created an answering warmth his reckless pleading conquered she forgot obstacles as his eloquence overleaped them she forgot social distinction as his great dark eyes looked into hers and at last she confessed she loved him then gerald leigh came down from the clouds and realized what he had done and as soon as he touched the earth and became reasonable eugenia fancied she did not care for him quite so much his conscience smote him not only must mr herbert be reckoned with but a terrible interval must elapse before he had fame and fortune to lay before eugenia he could scarcely expect her to leave her luxurious home in order to live au quatrieme or au cinquieme in paris whilst he completed his studies he grew sad and downcast as he thought of these things and eugenia who liked pleasant bright well to do people felt less kindly disposed toward him and showed she did so this made him reckless again he threw the future to the winds recommenced his passionate wooing recovered his lost ground and gained perhaps a little more but abraham leigh's affairs were settled up and gerald knew he must tear himself from acton hall and go back to work he had lingered a few days to finish a bust of mr herbert this done he had no excuse for staying longer the summer twilight deepened into night the sculptor and miss herbert stood upon the broad and gravelled terrace walk that runs along the stately front of acton hall they leaned upon the gray stone balustrade the girl with musing eye was looking down on shadowy lawn and flower bed underneath the young man looked at her and her alone silence reigned long between them but at last she spoke you really go to morrow tell me to stay and i will stay he said passionately but next week next month next year the moment when it does come will be just as bitter she did not urge him she was silent he drew very near to her eugenia he whispered you love me i think so her eyes were still looking over the darkening garden she spoke dreamily and as one who is not quite certain you think so listen before we part let me tell you what your love means to me if when first i asked for it you had scorned me i could have left you unhappy but still a man now it means life or death to me there is no middle course no question of joy or misery simply life or death eugenia look at me and say you love me his dark eyes charmed and compelled her i love you i love you she murmured her words satisfied him moreover she let the hand he grasped remain in his perhaps even returning the pressure of his own so they stood for more than an hour whilst gerald talked of the future and the fame he meant to win talked as one who has the fullest confidence in his own powers and directing genius presently they saw mr herbert walking through the twilight towards them gerald's hand tightened on the girl's so as to cause her positive pain remember he whispered life or death think of it while we are apart your love means a man's life or death many a lover has said an equally extravagant thing but eugenia herbert knew that his words were not those of poetical imagery and as she re entered the house she trembled at the passion she had aroused what if time and opposition should work a change in her feelings she tried to reassure herself by thinking that if she did not love him in the same blind reckless way at any rate she would never meet another man whom she could love as she loved gerald leigh the sculptor went back to paris to his art and his dreams of love and fame two years slipped by without any event of serious import happening to the persons about whom we are concerned then came a great change mr herbert died so suddenly that neither doctor nor lawyer could be summoned in time either to aid him to live or to carry out his last wishes his will gave eugenia two thousand pounds and an estate he owned in gloucestershire everything else to his son unfortunately some six months before he had sold the gloucestershire property and with culpable negligence had not made a fresh will therefore the small money bequest was all that his daughter could claim however this seemed of little moment as her brother at once announced his intention of settling upon her the amount to which she was equitably entitled he had given his solicitors instructions to prepare the deed james herbert eugenia's brother was unmarried and at present had no intention of settling down to the life of a country gentleman six weeks after mr herbert's death the greater number of the servants were paid off and acton hall was practically shut up eugenia after spending some weeks with friends in the north of england came to london to live for an indefinite time with her mother's sister a mrs cathcart since her father's death gerald leigh had written to her several times letters full of passionate love and penned as if the writer felt sure of her constancy and wish to keep her promise he too was coming to london had she wished it he would at once have come to her side but as it was he would take up his quarters in town about the same time eugenia arrived there the hour was at hand the hour to which miss herbert had for two years looked forward with strangely mingled feelings when her friends must be told that she intended to marry the young and as yet unknown sculptor gerald leigh the son of her father's late tenant farmer abraham she loved him still she felt sure of that much if time and absence had somewhat weakened the spell he had thrown over her proud nature she knew that unless the man was greatly changed the magic of his words and looks would sway her as irresistibly as before she loved him yet rebelled against her fate her father had died ignorant of what had passed between his daughter and the young artist many a time eugenia had tried to bring herself to confess the truth to him she now regretted she had not done so mr herbert's approval or disapproval would have been at least a staff by which to guide her steps he had suspected nothing the few letters which passed between the lovers had been unnoticed their love was as yet a secret known only to themselves she loved him but why had he dared to make her love him or why was he not well born and wealthy could she find strength to face for his sake the scorn of her friends she must decide at once she is sitting and thinking all these things in her own room at mrs cathcart's and in front of her lies a letter in which gerald announces his intention of calling upon her to morrow she knows that if she receives him she will be bound to proclaim herself his affianced wife he called she saw him mrs cathcart was out so eugenia was alone when the servant announced mr leigh she started and turned pale she trembled in every limb as he crossed the room to where she stood he took her hand and looked into her face he spoke and his rich musical voice thrilled her eugenia is it life or death she could not answer she could not turn her eyes from his she saw the intensity of their expression deepen saw a fierce yearning look come into them a look which startled her is it life or death he repeated his love conquered gerald it is life she said drunk with joy he threw his arms around her and kissed her until the blushes dyed her cheeks he stayed with her as long as she would allow but his delight was too delicious to permit him to say much about his plans for the future when at last she made him leave her he gave her the number of a studio at chelsea which he had taken and she promised to write and let him know when he might call again they parted eugenia walked to the window and for a long time looked out on the gay thoroughfare now full of carriages going to and returning from the park of course she loved gerald dearly that was now beyond a doubt but what would she have to go through when the engagement was announced what had she to look forward to as his wife must love and worldly misery be synonymous the current of her thoughts was interrupted by the arrival of another visitor her brother james herbert was a tall young man faultlessly dressed and bearing a general look of what is termed high breeding he bore a likeness to his father but the likeness was but an outward one by this time he was a cold cynical man of the world he had not lived the best of lives but being no fool had gained experience and caution he was clever enough to study human nature with a view of turning his knowledge to account eugenia had some pride of birth her brother had or affected a great deal more he was by no means unpopular few men could make themselves more agreeable and fascinating than james herbert when it was worth his while to be so in his way he was fond of his sister certainly proud of her beauty and she who knew nothing of his true nature thought him as perfect as a brother can be he kissed her complimented her on her good looks then sat down and made himself pleasant she answered his remarks somewhat mechanically wondering all the time what effect her news would have upon him she hated things hanging over her head and had made up her mind to tell him of her intentions if not to day the next time she met him the lawyers have almost settled your little matter he said it's lucky for you i made up my mind at once things haven't turned out so well as we expected she thanked him not effusively as if he was doing no more than she had a right to expect yet the thought flashed across her that before she took his bounty she was by honor compelled to make him acquainted with what she proposed doing by the bye eugenia said herbert you know ralph norgate yes he called a day or two ago i did not see him well i expect he'll soon call again he has been forcing his friendship on me lately in fact i'd better tell you his mind is made up you are to be the future lady norgate now you know what to look forward to her face flushed her troubles were beginning but james she stammered i was just going to tell you i am already engaged he raised his eyebrows to express great surprise was against his creed and the idea that eugenia was capable of disgracing herself did not enter his head so much the worse for norgate he said who is the happy man you will be angry very angry i fear she spoke timidly his manner told her she had good grounds for fear his mouth hardened but he still spoke politely and pleasantly my dear girl don't discount my displeasure tell me who it is his name is gerald leigh a pretty name and one which sounds familiar to me now who is gerald leigh he is a sculptor ah now i know son of that excellent old tenant of my father's the genius he discovered on a dungheap eugenia are you quite mad he will be a famous man some day herbert shrugged his shoulders in a peculiarly irritating way let him be as famous as he likes what does it matter the proudest family may be proud of allying themselves to a great artist herbert looked at his sister with a pitying but amused smile my poor girl don't be led astray by the temporary glorification of things artistic when these fellows grow talked about we ask them to our houses and make much of them it's the fashion but we don't marry them indeed as they all begin in the lower ranks of life like your friend they are generally provided with wives of their own station who stay at home and trouble no one she winced under the sting of his scorn he saw it and knew he was pursuing the right treatment for her disease now this young leigh he continued what will he be for years and years a sort of superior stone cutter he will make what living he can by going about and doing busts of mayors and mayoresses and other people of that class who want their common features perpetuated perhaps he might get a job on a tombstone for a change bah of course you have been jesting with me eugenia i shall tell norgate to call as soon as possible i shall marry gerald leigh said eugenia sullenly all the same the busts and tombstones weighed heavily upon her that said her brother rising and still speaking with a smile i am not the least afraid of although you are of age and mistress of two thousand pounds you are not cut out to ornament an attic i need not say i must countermand that settlement it must wait until you marry norgate or some other suitable man he kissed her and walked carelessly away to all appearance the matter did not cause him a moment's anxiety he was a clever man and flattered himself he knew how to treat eugenia human nature should be assailed at its weakest points his carelessness was of course assumed for meeting mrs cathcart as she drove home eugenia's news was sufficiently disturbing to make him stop the carriage seat himself beside his aunt and beg her to take another turn in the park during which he told her what had transpired they were fitting coadjutors mrs cathcart was delighted to hear of sir ralph's overtures and was shocked to find that eugenia was entangled in some low attachment she quite agreed that the girl must be led not driven must be laughed not talked out of her folly girls nearly always make fools of themselves once in their lives said mr cathcart cynically they do said james herbert who knew something about the sex all the same eugenia shall not find out all about the fellow where he lives and all the rest of it she doesn't know i've told you about this keep a sharp lookout for any letters so the next day when eugenia and her aunt were together the latter a skilled domestic diplomatist commenced operations by regretting that mr herbert although so fond of statuary had never employed a sculptor to make his own bust mrs cathcart spoke so naturally that eugenia fell into the trap and informed her that mr herbert's likeness had been taken in clay two years ago by a young sculptor then staying at acton hall it had been done for pleasure not profit but her father had always intended to order a copy in marble mrs cathcart was delighted did eugenia know where the young man could be found eugenia did know she told her with a tinge of color on her cheeks and took advantage of the opportunity and perhaps soothed her spirit somewhat by expatiating on what a great man her lover was to become mrs cathcart in return spoke of geniuses as struggling poverty stricken persons to befriend whom was the one great wish of her life it was indeed pleasant for miss herbert to hear her aunt speak of her lover as she might of a hard working seamstress or deserving laundress she had not yet written to gerald she must find strength to throw off her brother's scorn and the busts and tombstones before she again met her lover sir ralph norgate called that morning he was a man of about forty not ill looking but with the unmistakable appearance of one who had led a hard life he was rich and of fine old family it was clear to mrs cathcart that he meant business eugenia had met him several times last year and it was no news to her that he was her ardent admirer she was very cold towards him to day but mrs cathcart did not chide her she clever woman knew that men like norgate value a prize at what it costs them to win it so the baronet came stayed his appointed time then went away presumably in fair train to a declaration by and by chapter iii the next day whilst driving with her niece mrs cathcart was seized by a sudden thought my dear she said let us go and see about that bust where did you say the sculptor man was to be found nelson studios king's road what number no said eugenia wondering if her aunt's sudden resolve would be productive of good or evil the carriage went to nelson studios the ladies dismounted and mrs cathcart tapped at the door of no a studio which being a sculptor's was of course on the ground floor the door was opened by a handsome young man whose outside garb was a ragged old blouse and whose hands were white with half dried clay one of those hands moreover held a short pipe indeed gerald leigh was in as unpresentable trim as when years ago he first met miss herbert he did not at once see the girl she was behind mrs cathcart and that lady's majestic presence absorbed all his attention mrs cathcart put up her eye glass is your master in she asked gerald laughed i am my own master he said this is mr leigh aunt said eugenia coming forward oh said mrs cathcart and the palpable meaning of that exclamatory monosyllable sent the blood to eugenia's cheek gerald started as he heard the girl's voice and recognized her in the shadow he stretched out his clay covered hand then withdrew it and laughed mrs cathcart who saw the action put on a look of supreme astonishment then she recovered herself oh i forgot she said to eugenia of course you have seen mr leigh before may we come in mr leigh he moved aside and the ladies entered the studio he placed his two chairs at their disposal he wondered the while what had brought eugenia to him he gave her a questioning glance but her eyes avoided his then mrs cathcart began she spoke in that manner which certain persons assume towards those whom they are pleased to think their inferiors i believe some time ago you made a bust of my late brother in law mr herbert of coombe acton gerald bowed i wish to have a copy of it can you make one certainly in marble in marble of course how much will it cost it was a painful experience to eugenia to hear her future husband talked to by mrs cathcart much as that lady talked to the obliging young men and women at the various emporiums which enjoyed her patronage mr herbert was my best friend said gerald my services are at your disposal you do not understand me said mrs cathcart coldly i asked you what it would cost gerald colored and glanced at eugenia he was utterly puzzled it could only have been through the agency of the girl he loved that this new patroness sought him mr leigh was my father's friend aunt said eugenia my dear mr leigh is not my friend i want to know his terms for a marble bust eighty pounds madam said gerald rather shortly oh much too much eugenia do you not think such a price extortionate eugenia was silent but her cheeks burned gerald's lip quivered with anger only mrs cathcart was calm i will pay you forty pounds she said but then it must be approved by a competent judge you have heard my terms madam said leigh curtly absurd i will even say fifty pounds if you like to take that you may call upon me good morning come eugenia she swept out of the studio eugenia followed her she looked back and saw gerald's face wearing an expression of actual pain for a moment her impulse was to run back throw her arms round his neck and defy every one however she did not yield to it but followed her aunt to the carriage i call that young man a most common ill bred person said mrs cathcart eugenia flushed he is not she said hotly your manner towards him must have been most mortifying my dear child exclaimed mrs cathcart in innocent surprise and i was trying to befriend the young man he presumes on his acquaintance with your father i always told your poor father it was a mistake becoming intimate with persons of that class eugenia said no more if she had thought of so doing it was not the moment to open her heart to mrs cathcart she went to her room intending to write to gerald but no letter was written that day how could she ask him to call at her aunt's after what had occurred i love him she said to herself but i am not brave enough to give up all for him oh why did we ever meet the next morning she received a letter from gerald it contained no reproach only an entreaty that she would name a time when he might see her mrs cathcart was true to her duty before james herbert was out of bed she had sent him word that a letter had come for eugenia he went at once to his sister his greeting was quite friendly eugenia he said presently of course by now you have put all that nonsense about that sculptor fellow out of your pretty head it is no nonsense well if you mean to be obstinate i must interfere have you seen him since aunt went to his studio i was with her she ought to have known better if she encourages you we shall quarrel do you correspond tell me the truth she offered him gerald's letter he waved it aside as a thing beneath his notice have you answered it he asked not yet i am just going to her brother still remained calm and polite with that contemptuous incredulous smile playing round his lips if you will make a fool of yourself i can't stop you if you with your beauty and position choose to go and live in a garret you must do so still as your brother i have certain responsibilities which would still be mine were your lover the highest in the land i must make inquiries as to his character and moral worth these fellows are generally a loose lot you may make what inquiries you choose thank you now one favor a command the last i shall ask or give you will not answer this letter you will not see the man until i have satisfied myself on these points it is not too much to ask eugenia she felt the justice of his remarks could it be she was weak enough to be glad of a little delay and breathing space but gerald's face as last she saw it rose before her you must name a time she said so impatient for true love and social extinction sneered herbert surely you can restrain yourself until this day week it was longer than she had meant but her brother's bitter sneers settled it so be it she said until this day week the promise given james herbert dismissed the matter but he filled up the next half hour with the very cream of society gossip which was undoubtedly as palatable to eugenia as it would have been to any other woman james herbert lived within the inner circle and as to day for purposes of his own he spoke to eugenia as if she were one of the initiated his conversation was not without charm he was clever to know when to trust he had not the slightest fear that eugenia would break her promise so he cautioned mrs cathcart to keep the little fool well within sight and thus avoid danger of a chance meeting to order the servants to refuse the sculptor admission if he ventured to call and above all to be sure that norgate had every opportunity of pressing his suit after this he waited calmly and did nothing more in the matter for six whole days days during which gerald leigh chafed and fretted he refused to doubt but his heart grew heavy within him he felt sure that mrs cathcart's visit boded no good at last he could bear the suspense no longer he called and asked for eugenia she was out he called again the same result he went back to his studio and tried to conquer his growing uneasiness by hard work one morning a gentleman called and introduced himself as james herbert gerald received him courteously herbert was suave smiling and bland he spoke of the interest he felt in the young sculptor for his father mr herbert's sake he admired some embryo designs and wished and prophesied all success then as gerald began to hope that eugenia's brother might some day be his friend he turned upon him and tore him to pieces but after all mr leigh my great object in calling concerns my sister gerald grew very pale she is a good girl but weak she has confessed to me that some sort of romantic nonsense had passed between you she has vowed to be my wife no more no less his impetuosity seemed to amuse herbert i am afraid such a thing is an impossibility he said serenely i shall not insult you by telling you she is all but penniless geniuses i know never think of money but i fear i must pain you by saying she repents of her hasty words that said gerald slowly yet fiercely is a lie my good sir i cannot allow you to use such words my temper is fair but it has its limits i apologize said gerald sullenly i should have said you were coercing her i never coerced any one in my life much less my sister naturally i shall object to her marriage with you but that makes no difference tell me what you have to tell said gerald nervously he hated and feared this smooth smiling man in a few words then my sister is unhappy and unsettled for several days she has been trying to answer a letter you sent her at last she confided all to me i am sure i am not going too far when i say she would be glad to think that all boy and girl promises between you were forgotten she sent you to tell me this asked gerald hoarsely no she knew i was coming i am putting her thoughts in my own words i don't expect you to understand what my love for your sister means you could not said gerald but you know she has vowed to be my wife yes and will keep her promise if you insist upon it the emphasis herbert laid on insist made gerald's heart sick he said nothing but with a strange smile on his white face he went to a table and wrote a few words he handed the paper to his visitor read he said you say you are her messenger now you can be mine the words were eugenia if this is unanswered i shall believe you wish to recall everything that has passed between us thank you said herbert this is all i could expect with trembling hands the sculptor placed the paper in an envelope and once more tendered it to herbert no thank you said herbert people have been tempted to suppress letters before now post it in the ordinary way gerald left the room he returned in a few moments and herbert knew that the letter had been posted he had nothing further to do with gerald so held out his hand affably no said gerald i would rather not his eyes were gleaming strangely as you will said herbert with indifference i will change my mind said gerald in a low voice and taking the other's hand condemned people always shake hands with the hangman i think he spoke with a ghastly attempt at mirth herbert left the studio without another word but as he drove to mrs cathcart's said to himself the sooner that beggar shoots or hangs himself the better he went straight to his sister he placed his hand on her shoulder and with a look she had never yet seen on his face said in a cold contemptuous manner eugenia i have been taking some trouble on your behalf to day two things are going to happen which will settle your future norgate will be here presently and ask you to be his wife by the next post you will get a letter from that stone cutter before you answer it shut yourself up and think until you are in a proper frame of mind women are fools but surely you can't be the biggest among them you have seen him asked eugenia faintly yes an extremely nice young man in his place was he well very well and very comfortable my dear girl he quite won my respect a thoroughly practical young man with lots of common sense now good bye don't make any mistake did she hear aright her brother found gerald a thoroughly practical young man the lie was so gigantic that it seemed impossible it could be all a lie she was revolving it in her mind even when sir ralph norgate was announced as for the practical young man he had locked his door and thrown himself on the ground james herbert's words had impressed him and perhaps his faith in eugenia's faith was not so great as he fancied to morrow he would know the verdict he felt sure that if his letter remained unanswered for twenty four hours james herbert had spoken the truth miss herbert found her brother a true prophet sir ralph norgate offered his hand and when the offer was refused told her he did not mean to accept her answer as final she did not on her part say anything about her love being given elsewhere then gerald's letter came and following her brother's advice she did think everything over she sat for hours trying to nerve herself to answer the letter as love and faith demanded she loved him had he been present her indecision would soon have vanished but as it was she could reflect fully on what an answer to his letter must mean alienation of all her friends an end of social ambition many years if not a life of poverty eugenia shuddered as she thought of the consequences and wished that she and gerald had never met she wished moreover that the temptations of rank and wealth held out by her other suitor were less what would gerald do if his letter was not answered if she could but persuade herself that her brother's estimate of his character was the right one possibly it might be james knew mankind well if she could but think so could believe that gerald would forget she might then find it easier to be wise and by taking him at his word save herself and perhaps him from what must insure unhappiness so she reasoned so she excused her half meditated treason so she persuaded herself it would eventually be better for both if they parted yet all the while she knew she loved gerald leigh as she could love no other man in this mental conflict the day passed and night found the letter unanswered then james herbert came to her eugenia have you replied to that letter she shook her head give it to me he said she did so it was a relief to get rid of it he tore it into fragments there he said i knew i could trust your good sense there is an end of the affair it is a secret between you and me and i shall never again allude to it for good or ill the die was cast she had freed herself but she had left the room with swimming eyes and went to mrs cathcart aunt she cried will you take me abroad for a long time it was hard for mrs cathcart to be called upon to give up the rest of the london season but then mr herbert's recent death prevented her going out much and it was paramount that eugenia's future should be satisfactorily disposed of so the excellent woman sacrificed herself at once i will take you abroad eugenia if you will promise to be sir ralph's wife eugenia had chosen her own path and knew where it would lead yet for very shame she would not show her thoughts to others i can promise nothing she said take me away three days afterward gerald leigh learned that eugenia had gone abroad with her aunt although in his studio all day long the sculptor did no work for weeks at last he aroused himself engaged a model and set to work with feverish energy from morn to night he thumbed and pushed about the ductile clay he laughed in a sort of bitter triumph his hands had not lost their cunning the work grew and grew apace until the clay was done with and a fair white block of marble stood in the centre of the studio waiting to be hewn into the statue which was to be gerald leigh's first high bid for fame chapter iv it was early in may the academy had been open about a week long enough for the newspaper critics to tell the public what it ought to admire strange to say this year the critics were unanimous in bestowing their highest praises on a piece of statuary and a great future for the sculptor was predicted no in the catalogue appealed to no one by cheap sentiment or sensational treatment it was but the lightly draped figure of a beautiful girl one in the first flush of womanhood she was in the act of stepping hastily forward her arms were extended as if to welcome perhaps embrace some one who was coming towards her her face bore a smile of eager delight the grace the likeness the life of the figure arrested each passer by the fall of the drapery the position of each well rounded limb conveyed the idea of rapid motion it was indeed hard to believe that she was doomed to remain forever in one fixed attitude the stock remark of the spectators was that in a minute they expected to see her at the other side of the room this statute bore no distinguishing title but those persons who turned to their catalogues found under the number and the artist's name a few words of poetry her hands outstretched to greet the new love whilst her feet tread scornful on the old love's gifts after reading this one turned of course to her feet and found that one of them was treading on flowers roses and large star shaped blossoms several people whilst admiring the statue fancied they had somewhere seen the original of that beautiful face but save the sculptor only one james herbert knew the truth he cursed leigh's impertinence but was too wise to take any notice of it yet he determined to keep eugenia from the academy if possible she was in town and in a week's time was to be married to sir ralph two months after mrs cathcart had taken her niece abroad the baronet joined them and renewed his proposals this time with success the girl stipulated that the marriage should not take place until the spring the truth is she wanted some months' delay in order to get rid of the memories of gerald leigh and by the time she returned to england flattered herself she had successfully completed the operation she had in the last few days heard some talk about the statue but had steadfastly kept her eyes from the art criticisms fearing to see gerald's name nevertheless she wished to visit the academy and was surprised when james herbert now amiability itself refused to take her there you mustn't go this year he said that fellow's statute is creating quite a furore well what of that asked eugenia coldly he has had bad taste enough to represent you the likeness is unmistakable it is a maudlin thing a girl deserting her old love or some such nonsense still you'd better not go eugenia said no more but all day long she was thinking of her brother's words and longing to see what gerald had wrought that evening she dined out at the table were several persons who worshipped art and eugenia's cheek burned as she heard the praise bestowed on the new sculptor and the great future prophesied for him had she after all been wrong would it not have been better to have followed the mandates of her heart had she not been weak and mercenary no matter it was too late now to repent poor gerald she must see this wonderful image of herself early next morning she went alone to burlington house unlike others she knew the meaning of the statue knew the mute reproach it conveyed knew why the marble foot trod down those particular flowers she had never told him the fate of his boyish gift but gerald had often and often recalled his first meeting with her eugenia's heart swelled as she remembered his brave words and confidence in himself how sure he felt of success he had indeed succeeded but the first great work from his hands was a memento of his love for a faithless woman herself two gentlemen were at her side they were talking of the work and the sculptor one of them she knew he was a lord famous for his love of art and encouragement of rising artists i tried to buy it he said but found it was not for sale commercially speaking said his companion it is as well you cannot buy it why the man must go to the top of his profession i think not indeed my belief is he will do little more i have inquired about him he does not live the life a genius must live in these days if he wants to succeed i am sorry to hear it said lord moving away miss herbert left the academy with an echo of gerald's extravagant statement that life or death hung upon her love sounding in her ears the conversation she had overheard distressed her greatly the thought that her treachery had ruined a life full of promise would not be dismissed she spent a most miserable day and its misery was not diminished by the truth which she could no longer conceal from herself that she still loved gerald she loved him more than ever too late too late and eugenia herbert wept as many others have wept that the past could not be undone sir ralph norgate and james herbert dined that evening at mrs cathcart's their society was little comfort to eugenia she felt now that she hated her lover hated his polite hollow society ways and expressions hated that blase look which so often settled on his face she had never cared for him their love making had been of a frigid kind not be it said by sir ralph's wish he was proud of and perhaps really fond of the beautiful girl he had bought so it was scarcely fair that eugenia should compare his polite wooing with that of the impassioned boy's which recked no obstacles heeded no consequences her bitter thoughts made it impossible for her to sit out the dinner very soon she pleaded headache and went to her own room to resume her self revilings she made no further attempt to banish gerald from her thoughts she lived again every moment she had spent in his company heard again every word of wild love felt his hand close on hers his lips press her own and shuddered as the dismal words life or death seemed echoing through her ears if she could but undo the past why not the thought rushed through her what hindered her save the false gods to whom she had bent she was still legally free gerald was in the same town why should she heed her friends why trouble as to what people would think or say by one bold step she could right everything if to morrow nay this very hour she went to gerald and bade him take her and hold her against all she knew he would do so he would forgive to him her action would not seem bold or unmaidenly in his eyes she would rank as high as ever and what mattered the rest to morrow they might be miles away and the bliss of being gerald's wife might well compensate for what people would say about her conduct she herself could forget all save that she was now bound forever to the man she loved she would do it with feverish impatience she threw off her rich dress and wrapped herself in a plain cloak she put on the quietest hat she could find stole down stairs and was out of the house before second thoughts had time to bring irresolution her heart beat wildly she hailed a cab and was driven to nelson studios on the way she remembered it was an unlikely hour to find an artist in his studio but nevertheless now she had set out resolved to complete her journey she walked quickly to gerald's door she knocked softly but met with no response she dared not wait longer outside the pictured consequences of her rash act were assuming tremendous proportions in her brain another minute's delay and she must leave the spot never to return she turned the handle of the door and entered the room now miss herbert's half formed plan of action when she found herself face to face with her ill treated lover had been something like this she would walk up to him and simply say gerald i am come the rest must be left to him but she believed in spite of her weakness and treachery he would freely forgive her all gerald was not in the studio the gas was half turned down and the clay casts on the wall looked grim and spectral but if gerald was not in the room it was still inhabited on a low couch a couch covered by a rich oriental rug lay a woman fast asleep she crept across the room and gazed on the sleeper even by the dim gas light she knew that she gazed on beauty before which her own must pale the woman might have been some five years older than herself and those wonderful charms were at their zenith the rich clear warm color on the cheek the long black lashes the arched and perfect eyebrows told of southern lands the full voluptuous figure the shapely rounded arms the red lips the soft creamy neck before these the heart of man would run as wax before a fire eugenia seeking her lover found this woman in her stead a bitter scornful smile played on miss herbert's lips as she gazed at the sleeper somehow that oval sunny face seemed familiar to her well might it be in london paris everywhere she had seen it in the shop windows there were few people in france or england who had not heard the name of mlle carlotta singer dancer darling of opera bouffe whose adventures and amours were notorious who had ruined more men than she could count on the fingers of her fair hands eugenia recognized her and her smile of scorn deepened the sight of a half emptied champagne bottle close to the sleeper a half smoked cigarette lying on the floor just as it had fallen from her fingers added nothing to the contempt miss herbert's smile expressed gathering her skirts together to avoid any chance of contamination by touch she was preparing to leave the studio as noiselessly as she had entered it when suddenly the sleeper awoke awoke without any warning simply opened her splendid dark eyes stared for half a second then with wonderful lightness and agility sprang to her feet que faites vous la why are you here she cried without a word eugenia moved towards the door mlle carlotta was before her she turned the key and placed her back against the door doucement doucement ma belle she said permit me to know who honors me with a visit i wished to see mr leigh i suppose he is out be good enough to let me pass are you a model then but no models look not as you look i am not a model not fi donc you are perhaps one of those young misses who write geraldo letters of love a la bonne heure i wish to see one of them moi with a saucy smile carlotta pocketed the key turned up the gas and commenced a cool scrutiny of her prisoner eugenia blushed crimson qui vous etes belle ma chere belle mais blonde and geraldo he loves not the blonde let me pass said eugenia stamping her foot her tormentor laughed but not ill temperedly he will soon be here she said mockingly surely mademoiselle will wait he will be enchanted to see one of the young misses mlle carlotta when not injured was not vindictive or unkindly but she was as mischievous as a monkey no doubt having teased the girl to her satisfaction she would have soon released her but it happened that eugenia turned her head and for the first time the light shone full upon her face her gaoler started she sprang towards her seized her arm and dragged her across the room still holding her captive she tore down a sheet and revealed the clay model of the statue which had made gerald famous she looked from the lifeless to the living face then burst into a peal of derisive laughter eugenia's secret was discovered ha ha ha the young miss that geraldo loved the one who threw him away for a rich lover yet she wishes to see him again so at night she comes ah mademoiselle you have w r r recked him c r r rushed him r r ruined him still would see him good good it is now his turn my gerald shall have revenge revenge eugenia thoroughly aroused commanded her to let her go carlotta laughed in her face was even ill bred enough to snap her fingers and poke out her tongue at her prisoner eugenia humbled herself and implored her by their common womanhood carlotta laughed the louder eugenia appealed to her venality and tried to bribe her carlotta lowered her black eyebrows and scowled but laughed louder than ever he will come very soon was all she said he will not stop long away from me carlotta miss herbert was at her wit's end yet even through the shame of the situation the anguish of her heart made itself felt after having wrought herself up to make such a sacrifice such an atonement it was pitiable to find gerald no better than the rest of his sex she sat upon a chair longing for release yet dreading to hear the step which would herald it half an hour passed mlle carlotta whiled it away by emptying a glass of champagne smoking a cigarette and making comments upon gerald's prolonged absence presently she cried ah mademoiselle this is dull for you see i will dance to you and therewith she raised herself on her toes and went pirouetting round her captive humming the while an air of offenbach's her dress was long but she managed it with marvellous skill and eugenia whilst loathing could not help watching her with a sort of fascination she was as agile as a panther every attitude was full of grace every gesture alluring suddenly she stopped short her great eyes sparkled even more brightly she glanced at her victim hist she said i hear him i know his step he comes a moment afterwards the door was tried eugenia covered her face with her hands she knew not what the woman meant to do or say but she felt that her crowning shame was at hand yet her heart beat at the thought of seeing gerald once more and a wild idea of forgiveness on either side passed through her mlle carlotta turned down the gas unlocked the door and as it opened threw herself into the arms of the new comer eugenia heard the sound of kisses given and returned and her heart grew like stone geraldo mon ami she heard the dancer say in passionate tones dis moi que tu m'aimes que tu m'aimes toujours je t'adore ma belle tu es ravissante tell me in your own dear barbarous tongue swear it to me in english i swear it my beautiful gipsy i love you me only you only and eugenia heard him kiss her again and again dis done my geraldo you love me more than the pale faced miss who scorned you he laughed a wild unpleasant sounding laugh why not you can love or say you can love she was the changeable white moon you are the glorious southern sun she was ice you are fire better be burnt to death than die of cold and starvation men have worshipped you men have died for you i love you they came into the room his arm was round her her radiant face rested on his shoulder again and again he kissed those beautiful lips his eyes were only for her and saw not eugenia miss herbert rose her face was as white as her marble prototype's she might have passed out unobserved by gerald but mlle carlotta was on the watch she pointed to her and gerald turned and saw eugenia he had but time to realize it was no vision then she was gone with a wild cry he turned to follow her but the woman twined her arms around him and restrained him she was strong and for some moments detained him her resistance maddened him with a fierce oath he grasped her round arms and tore them from his neck throwing her away with such force that she fell upon the floor then he rushed after eugenia she was walking swiftly along the road he soon reached her side but although aware of his presence she neither spoke nor looked at him what brought you here he said hoarsely she made no reply only walked the faster tell me why you came he said i will never leave you until you answer me she turned and looked at him fresh from that scene in the studio with those words still ringing in her ears even the great change she saw in his face did not move her to pity i came she said on the eve of my marriage to ask forgiveness of a man whom i fancied i had wronged i am glad i came i found him happy and in society after his own heart her voice was cold and contemptuous he quivered beneath her scorn at that moment a cab passed eugenia called it leave me she said to gerald leave me our paths in life shall cross no more he grasped her wrist do you dare to reproach me you eugenia i told you it was life or death life or death she repeated death at any rate seems made very sweet to you still holding her wrist he looked into her eyes in a strange hopeless way he saw nothing in them to help him he leaned down to her ear yes death he said in a solemn whisper but the moral and spiritual death comes first his hand left her wrist he turned and without a word strode away whither even as tannhauser returned to the venusberg so gerald leigh returned to his studio and carlotta eugenia wept all the way home wept for herself and gerald wept for the shame she had endured wept for the uselessness of the contemplated atonement wept for the life before her and for a man's future and career wrecked by her weakness the next week she married sir ralph norgate the ceremony was surrounded by befitting splendor yet even at the alter gerald leigh's pale passionate face rose before her and she knew it would never leave her thoughts she loved him still on her wedding morning she received many letters she had no time to read them so took them with her and perused them as she went north with her husband among them was one in a strange handwriting it ran thus for your sake he struck me carlotta but he came back to me and is mine again him i forgive not you we go abroad together to warm sunny lands some day we shall quarrel and part then i shall remember you and take my revenge how that husband for whom you deserted gerald i shall take from you eugenia's lip curled she tore the letter and threw the pieces out of the carriage window two years afterwards lady norgate was listlessly turning the leaves of a society journal although she was a great and fashionable lady she was often listless and found life rather a dreary proceeding she read to day among the theatrical notes that mlle carlotta the divine opera bouffe actress was engaged to appear next month at the frivolity although the woman's absurd threat was unheeded if not forgotten her name recalled too vividly the most painful episode in lady norgate's life she turned to another part of the paper and read that the gentleman who committed suicide under such distressing circumstances at monaco had now been identified he was mr gerald leigh the sculptor whose first important work attracted so much attention two years ago it was hinted that his passion for a well known actress was the cause of the rash deed lady norgate dropped the paper and covered her face with her hands he had spoken truly her love meant life or death had she believed or troubled about the concluding paragraph of the notice had she ventured to tell herself it was true that gerald had forgotten her and carlotta was responsible for his death her mind would soon have been set at rest like a courteous foe who gives fair warning mlle carlotta wrote once more he is dead he died for your sake not mine your name not mine was on his lips look to yourself i am coming to london no doubt carlotta meant this letter as a first blow towards revenge she would hardly have written it had she known that lady norgate would cherish those words forever poor comfort as it was they told her that gerald had loved her to the last then mlle carlotta more beautiful more enticing more audacious than ever came to london for some months it had been whispered in society that sir ralph norgate was not so perfect a husband as such a wife as eugenia might rightly expect after carlotta's reappearance the whispers grew louder the statements more circumstantial eugenia caught an echo of them and smiled disdainfully then the name of carlotta's new victim became town talk yet eugenia made no sign not even when she met her husband in broad daylight seated side by side with the siren the man had the grace to turn his head away but carlotta shot a glance of malicious triumph at the pale lady who passed without a quiver of the lip james herbert was with his sister and found this encounter too much even for his cynicism he was bound to speak the blackguard he said but eugenia i don't think i would have a divorce or a separation it makes such a scandal it is a matter of perfect indifference to me she said coldly she spoke the truth carlotta's romantic vengeance was an utter failure lady norgate and her husband were in truth no farther apart than they had been for many months eugenia was indifferent and as time goes on grows more and more so indifferent to wealth indifferent to rank to pleasure even to pain she cherishes nothing cares for nothing save the remembrance that she was once loved by gerald leigh that he bade her give him life or death that although she gave him death he died with her name on his lips carriston's gift part i told by philip brand md london i i wish i had the courage to begin this tale by turning to my professional visiting books and taking at random any month out of the last twenty years give its record as a fair sample of my ordinary work the dismal extract would tell you what a doctor's i suppose i may say a successful doctor's lot is when his practice lies in a poor and densely populated district of london dreary as such a beginning might be it would perhaps allay some of the incredulity which this tale may probably provoke as it would plainly show how little room there is for things imaginative or romantic in work so hard as mine or among such grim realities of poverty pain and grief as those by which i have been surrounded it would certainly make it appear extremely unlikely that i should have found time to imagine much less to write a romance or melodrama the truth is that when a man has toiled from nine o'clock in the morning until nine o'clock at night such leisure as he can enjoy is precious to him especially when even that short respite is liable to be broken in upon at any moment still in spite of the doleful picture i have drawn of what may be called the daily grind i begin this tale with the account of a holiday in the autumn of i turned my back with right good will upon london streets hospitals and patients and took my seat in the north express the first revolution of the wheels sent a thrill of delight through my jaded frame a joyful sense of freedom came over me i had really got away at last moreover i had left no address behind me so for three blessed weeks might roam an undisputed lord of myself three weeks were not very many to take out of the fifty two but they were all i could venture to give myself for even at that time my practice if not so lucrative as i could wish was a large and increasing one having done a twelvemonth's hard work i felt that no one in the kingdom could take his holiday with a conscience clearer than mine so i lay back in a peculiarly contented frame of mind and discounted the coming pleasures of my brief respite from labor there are many ways of passing a holiday many places at which it may be spent but after all if you wish to enjoy it thoroughly there is but one royal rule to be followed that is simply to please yourself go where you like and mount the innocent holiday hobby which is dearest to your heart let its name be botany geology entomology conchology venery piscation or what not then you will be happy and return well braced up for the battle of life i knew a city clerk with literary tastes who invariably spent his annual fortnight among the mustiest tomes of the british museum and averred that his health was more benefited by so doing than if he had passed the time inhaling the freshest sea breezes i dare say he was right in his assertion sketching has always been my favorite holiday pursuit poor as my drawings may be nevertheless as i turn them over in my portfolio they bring to me at least vivid remembrances of many sweet and picturesque spots happy days and congenial companions it was not for me to say anything of their actual merits but they are dear to me for their associations this particular year i went to north wales and made bettws y coed my headquarters i stayed at the royal oak that well known little inn dear to many an artist's heart and teeming with reminiscences of famous men who have sojourned there times without number it was here i made the acquaintance of the man with whose life the curious events here told are connected on the first day after my arrival at bettws my appreciation of my liberty was so thorough my appetite for the enjoyment of the beauties of nature so keen and insatiable that i went so far and saw so much that when i returned to the royal oak night had fallen and the hour of dinner had long passed by i was when my own meal was placed on the table the only occupant of the coffee room just then a young man entered and ordered something to eat the waiter knowing no doubt something of the frank camaraderie which exists or should exist between the followers of the painter's craft laid his cover at my table the new comer seated himself gave me a pleasant smile and a nod and in five minutes we were in full swing of conversation the moment my eyes fell upon the young man i had noticed how singularly handsome he was charles carriston for this i found afterwards to be his name was about twenty two years of age he was tall but slightly built his whole bearing and figure being remarkably elegant and graceful he looked even more than gentlemanly he looked distinguished his face was pale its features well cut straight and regular his forehead spoke of high intellectual qualities and there was somewhat of that development over the eye brows which phrenologists i believe consider as evidence of the possession of imagination the general expression of his face was one of sadness and its refined beauty was heightened by a pair of soft dark dreamy looking eyes it only remains to add that from his attire i judged him to be an artist a professional artist to the backbone in the course of conversation i told him how i had classified him he smiled i am only an amateur he said an idle man nothing more and you alas i am a doctor then we shall not have to answer to each other for our sins in painting we talked on pleasantly until our bodily wants were satisfied then came that pleasant craving for tobacco which after a good meal is natural to a well regulated digestion shall we go and smoke outside said carriston the night is delicious we went out and sat on one of the wooden benches as my new friend said the night was delicious there was scarcely a breath of air moving the stars and the moon shone brightly and the rush of the not far distant stream came to us with a soothing murmur near us were three or four jovial young artists they were in merry mood one of them had that day sold a picture to a tourist we listened to their banter until most likely growing thirsty they re entered the inn carriston had said little since we had been out of doors he smoked his cigar placidly and gazed up at the skies with the white moonlight falling on his strikingly beautiful face the graceful pose into which he fell he seemed to me the embodiment of poetry he paid no heed to the merry talk or the artists which so much amused me indeed i doubted if he heard their voices yet he must have done so for as soon as they had left us he came out of his reverie it must be very nice he said to have to make one's living by art nice for those who can make livings by it i answered all can do that who are worth it the day of neglected genius is gone by muller was the last sufferer i think and he died young if you are so sanguine why not try your own luck at it i would but unfortunately i am a rich man i laughed at this misplaced regret then carriston in the most simple way told me a good deal about himself he was an orphan an only child he had already ample means but fortune had still favors in store for him at the death of his uncle now an aged man he must succeed to a large estate and a baronetcy the natural unaffected way in which he made these confidences moreover made them not i knew from any wish to increase his importance in my eyes greatly impressed me by the time we parted for the night i had grown much interested in my new acquaintance an interest not untinged by envy young handsome rich free to come or go work or play as he listed happy carriston ii i am disposed to think that never before did a sincere friendship one which was fated to last unbroken for years ripen so quickly as that between carriston and myself as i now look back i find it hard to associate him with any even a brief period of time subsequent to our meeting during which he was not my bosom friend i forget whether our meeting at the same picturesque spot on the morning which followed our self introduction was the result of accident or arrangement anyway we spent the day together and that day was the precursor of many passed in each other's society morning after morning we sallied forth to do our best to transfer the same bits of scenery to our sketching blocks evening after evening we returned to dine side by side and afterward to talk and smoke together indoors or outdoors as the temperature advised or our wishes inclined great friends we soon became inseparable as long as my short holiday lasted it was perhaps pleasant for each to work in company with an amateur like himself each could ask the other's opinion of the merits of the work done and feel happy at the approval duly given an artist's standard of excellence is too high for a non professional when he praises your work he praises it but as the work of an outsider you feel that such commendation condemns it and disheartens you however had carriston cared to do so i think he might have fearlessly submitted his productions to any conscientious critic his drawings were immeasurably more artistic and powerful than mine he had undoubtedly great talent and i was much surprised to find that good as he was at landscape he was even better at the figure he could with a firm bold hand draw rapidly the most marvellous likenesses so spirited and true were some of the studies he showed me that i could without flattery advise him provided he could finish as he began to keep entirely to the higher branch of the art i have now before me a series of outline faces drawn by him many of them from memory and as i look at them the original of each comes at once before my eyes from the very first i had been much interested in the young man and as day by day went by and the peculiarities of his character were revealed to me my interest grew deeper and deeper i flatter myself that i am a keen observer and skilful analyst of personal character and until now fancied that to write a description of its component parts was an easy matter yet when i am put to the proof i find it no simple task to convey in words a proper idea of charles carriston's mental organization i soon discovered that he was i may say afflicted by a peculiarly sensitive nature although strong and apparently in good health the very changes of the weather seemed to affect him almost to the same extent as they affect a flower sweet as his disposition always was the tone of his mind his spirits his conversation varied as it were with the atmosphere he was full of imagination and that imagination always rich was at times weird even grotesquely weird not for one moment did he seem to doubt the stability of the wild theories he started or the possibility of the poetical dreams he dreamed being realized he had his faults of course he was hasty and impulsive indeed to me one of the greatest charms about the boy was that right or wrong each word he spoke came straight from his heart so far as i could judge the whole organization of his mind was too highly strung too finely wrought for every day use a note of joy of sorrow even of pity vibrated through it too strongly for his comfort or well being as yet it had not been called upon to bear the test of love and fortunately i use the word advisedly fortunately he was not according to the usual significance of the word a religious man or i should have thought it not unlikely that some day he would fall a victim to that religious mania so well known to my professional brethren and have developed hysteria or melancholia he might even have fancied himself a messenger sent from heaven for the regeneration of mankind from natures like carriston's are prophets made in short i may say that my exhaustive study of my new friend's character resulted in a certain amount of uneasiness as to his future an uneasiness not entirely free from professional curiosity although the smile came readily and frequently to his lips the general bent of his disposition was sad even despondent and morbid and yet few young men's lives promised to be so pleasant as charles carriston's i was rallying him one day on his future rank and its responsibilities you will of course be disgustingly rich i said carriston sighed yes if i live long enough but i don't suppose i shall why in the world shouldn't you you look pale and thin but are in capital health twelve long miles we have walked to day you never turned a hair carriston made no reply he seemed in deep thought your friends ought to look after you and get you a wife i said i have no friends he said sadly no nearer relation than a cousin a good deal older than i am who looks upon me as one who was born to rob him of what should be his but by the law of primogeniture so sacred to the upper ten thousand he must know you are entitled to it yes but for years and years i was always going to die my life was not thought worth six months' purchase all of a sudden i got well ever since then i have seemed even to myself a kind of interloper it must be unpleasant to have a man longing for one's death all the more reason you should marry and put other lives between him and the title i fancy i shall never marry said carriston looking at me with his soft dark eyes you see a boy who has waited for years expecting to die doesn't grow up with exactly the same feelings as other people i don't think i shall ever meet a woman i can care for enough to make my wife no i expect my cousin will be sir ralph yet i tried to laugh him out of his morbid ideas those who live will see i said only promise to ask me to your wedding and better still if you live in town appoint me your family doctor it may prove the nucleus of that west end practice which it is the dream of every doctor to establish i have already alluded to the strange beauty of carriston's dark eyes as soon as companionship commenced between us those eyes became to me from scientific reasons objects of curiosity on account of the mysterious expression which at times i detected in them often and often they wore a look the like to which i imagine is found only in the eyes of a somnambulist a look which one feels certain is intently fixed upon something yet upon something beyond the range of one's own vision during the first two or three days of our new born intimacy i found this eccentricity of carriston's positively startling when now and then i turned to him and found him staring with all his might at nothing my eyes were compelled to follow the direction in which his own were bent it was at first impossible to divest one's self of the belief that something should be there to justify so fixed a gaze however as the rapid growth of our friendly intercourse soon showed me that he was a boy of most ardent poetic temperament perhaps even more a poet than an artist i laid at the door of the muse these absent looks and recurring flights into vacancy we were at the fairy glen one morning sketching to the best of our ability the swirling stream the gray rocks and the overhanging trees the last just growing brilliant with autumnal tints so beautiful was everything around that for a long time i worked idled or dreamed in contented silence carriston had set up his easel at some little distance from mine at last i turned to see how his sketch was progressing he had evidently fallen into one of his brown studies and apparently a harder one than usual his brush had fallen from his fingers his features were immovable and his strange dark eyes were absolutely riveted upon a large rock in front of him at which he gazed as intently as if his hope of heaven depended upon seeing through it he seemed for the while oblivious to things mundane a party of laughing chattering terrible tourist girls scrambled down the rugged steps and one by one passed in front of him neither their presence nor the inquisitive glances they cast on his statuesque face roused him from his fit of abstraction for a moment i wondered if the boy took opium or some other narcotic on the sly full of the thought i rose crossed over to him and laid my hand upon his shoulder as he felt my touch he came to himself and looked up at me in a dazed inquiring way really carriston i said laughingly you must reserve your dreaming fits until we are in places where tourists do not congregate or you will be thought a madman or at least a poet he made no reply he turned away from me impatiently even rudely then picking up his brush went on with his sketch after awhile he seemed to recover from his pettishness and we spent the remainder of the day as pleasantly as usual as we trudged home in the twilight he said to me in an apologetic almost penitent way i hope i was not rude to you just now when do you mean i asked having almost forgotten the trivial incident when you woke me from what you called my dreaming oh dear no you were not at all rude if you had been it was but the penalty due to my presumption the flight of genius should be respected not checked by a material hand that is nonsense i am not a genius and you must forgive me for my rudeness said carriston simply after walking some distance in silence he spoke again i wish when you are with me you would try and stop me from getting into that state it does me no good seeing he was in earnest i promised to do my best and was curious enough to ask him whither his thoughts wandered during those abstracted moments i can scarcely tell you he said presently he asked speaking with hesitation i suppose you never feel that under certain circumstances circumstances which you cannot explain you might be able to see things which are invisible to others to see things what things things as i said which no one else can see you must know there are people who possess this power i know that certain people have asserted they possess what they call second sight but the assertion is too absurd to waste time in refuting yet said carriston dreamily i know that if i did not strive to avoid it some such power would come to me you are too ridiculous carriston i said some people see what others don't because they have longer sight you may of course imagine anything but your eyes handsome eyes they are too contain certain properties known as humors and lenses therefore in order to see yes yes interrupted carriston i know exactly all you are going to say you a man of science ridicule everything which breaks what you are pleased to call the law of nature yet take all the unaccountable tales told nine hundred and ninety nine you expose to scorn or throw grave doubt upon yet the thousandth rests on evidence which cannot be upset or disputed the possibility of that one proves the possibility of all not at all but enough for your argument i said amused at the boy's wild talk you doctors he continued with that delicious air of superiority so often assumed by laymen when they are in good health put too much to the credit of diseased imagination no doubt it's a convenient shelf on which to put a difficulty but go on the body is your province yet you can't explain why a cataleptic patient should hear a watch tick when it is placed against his foot nor you nor any one but perhaps it may aid you to get rid of your rubbishing theories if i tell you that catalepsy as you understand it is a disease not known to us in fact it does not exist he seemed crestfallen at hearing this but what do you want to prove i asked what have you yourself seen nothing i tell you and i pray i may never see anything after this he seemed inclined to shirk the subject but i pinned him to it i was really anxious to get at the true state of his mind in answer to the leading questions with which i plied him carriston revealed an amount of superstition which seemed utterly childish and out of place beside the intellectual faculties which he undoubtedly possessed so much so that at last i felt more inclined to laugh at than to argue with him yet i was not altogether amused by his talk his wild arguments and wilder beliefs made me fancy there must be a weak spot somewhere in his brain even made me fear lest his end might be madness the thought made me sad for with the exception of the eccentricities which i have mentioned i reckoned carriston the pleasantest friend i had ever made his amiable nature his good looks and perfect breeding had endeared the young man to me so much so that i resolved during the remainder of the time we should spend together to do all i could toward talking the nonsense out of him my efforts were unavailing i kept a sharp lookout upon him and let him fall into no more mysterious reveries but the curious idea that he possessed or could possess some gift above human nature was too firmly rooted to be displaced on all other subjects he argued fairly and was open to reason on this one point he was immovable when i could get him to notice my attacks at all his answer was you doctors clever as you are with the body know as little of psychology as you did three thousand years ago when the time came for me to fold up my easel and return to the drudgery of life i parted from carriston with much regret one of those solemn but often broken promises to join together next year in another sketching tour passed between us then i went back to london and during the subsequent months although i saw nothing of him i often thought of my friend of the autumn iii in the spring of i went down to bournemouth to see for the last time an old friend who was dying of consumption during a great part of the journey down i had for a travelling companion a well dressed gentlemanly man of about forty years of age we were alone in the compartment and after interchanging some small civilities such as the barter of newspapers slid into conversation my fellow traveller seemed to be an intellectual man and well posted up in the doings of the day he talked fluently and easily on various topics and judging by his talk must have moved in good society although i fancied his features bore traces of hard living and dissipation he was not unprepossessing in appearance the greatest faults in his face were the remarkable thinness of the lips and his eyes being a shade closer together than one cares to see with a casual acquaintance such peculiarities are of little moment but for my part i should not choose for a friend one who possessed them without due trial and searching proof at this time the english public were much interested in an important will case which was then being tried the reversion to a vast sum of money depended upon the testator's sanity or insanity like most other people we duly discussed the matter i suppose from some of my remarks my companion understood that i was a doctor he asked me a good many technical questions and i described several curious cases of mania which had come under my notice he seemed greatly interested in the subject you must sometimes find it hard to say where sanity ends and insanity begins he said thoughtfully yes the boundary line is in some instances hard to define to give in such a dubious case an opinion which would satisfy myself i should want to have known the patient at the time he was considered quite sane to mark the difference exactly and to know the bent of the character for instance there is a friend of mine he was perfectly sane when last i saw him but for all i know he may have made great progress the other way in the interval then without mentioning names dates or places i described carriston's peculiar disposition to my intelligent listener he heard me with rapt interest you predict he will go mad he said certainly not unless anything unforeseen arises he will probably live and die as sane as you or i why do you fear for him then for this reason i think that any sudden emotion violent grief for instance any unexpected and crushing blow might at once disturb the balance of his mind let his life run on in an even groove and all will be well with him my companion was silent for a few moments did you mention your friend's name he asked i laughed doctors never give names when they quote cases at the next station my companion left the train he bade me a polite adieu and thanked me for the pleasure my conversation had given him after wondering what station in life he occupied i dismissed him from my mind as one who had crossed my path for a short time and would probably never cross it again although i did not see charles carriston i received several letters from him during the course of the year he had not forgotten our undertaking to pass my next holiday together early in the autumn just as i was beginning to long with a passionate longing for open air and blue skies a letter came from carriston he was now he said roughing it in the western highlands he reminded me of last year's promise could i get away from work now would i join him if i did not care to visit scotland would i suggest some other place where he could join me still the scenery by which he was now surrounded was superb and the accommodation he had secured if not luxurious fairly comfortable he thought we could not do better a postscript to his letter asked me to address him as cecil carr not charles carriston he had a reason for changing his name a foolish reason i should no doubt call it when we met he would let me know it this letter at once decided me to accept his invitation in a week's time my arrangements for leave of absence were complete and i was speeding northward in the highest spirits and well equipped with everything necessary for my favorite holiday pursuit i looked forward with the greatest pleasure to again meeting carriston i found him at callendar waiting for me the coach did not follow the route we were obliged to take in order to reach the somewhat unfrequented part of the country in which our tent was pitched so my friend had secured the services of a primitive vehicle and a strong shaggy pony to bear us the remainder of the journey so soon as our first hearty greetings were over i proceeded to ascertain how the last year had treated carriston i was both delighted and astonished at the great change for the better which had taken place in his manner no less than his appearance he looked far more robust he seemed happier brighter although more like ordinary humanity not only had he greeted me with almost boisterous glee but during our drive through the wonderful scenery he was in the gayest of spirits and full of fun and anecdote i congratulated him heartily upon the marked improvement in his health both mentally and physically yes i am much better he said i followed a part of your advice gave up moping tried constant change of scene interested myself in many more things i am quite a different man no supernatural visitations i asked anxious to learn that his cure in that direction was complete his face fell he hesitated a second before answering no not now he said i fought against the strange feeling and i believe have got rid of it at least i hope so i said no more on the subject carriston plunged into a series of vivid and mimetic descriptions of the varieties of scotch character which he had met with during his stay he depicted his experiences so amusingly that i laughed heartily for many a mile but why the change in your name i asked when he paused for a moment in his merry talk he blushed and looked rather ashamed i scarcely like to tell you you will think my reason so absurd never mind i don't judge you by the ordinary standard well the fact is my cousin is also in scotland i feared if i gave my true name at the hotel at which i stayed on my way here he might perchance see it and look me up in these wild regions well and what if he did i can't tell you i hate to know i feel like it but i have always perhaps without cause been afraid of him and this place is horribly lonely now that i understood the meaning of his words i thought the boy must be joking but the grave look on his face showed he was never further from merriment why carriston i cried you are positively ridiculous about your cousin you can't think the man wants to murder you i don't know what i think i am saying things to you which i ought not to say but every time i meet him i feel he hates me and wishes me out of the world between wishing and doing there is a great difference i dare say all this 's fancy on your part perhaps so any way cecil carr is as good a name up here as charles carriston so please humor my whim and say no more about it as it made no difference to me by what name he chose to call himself i dropped the subject i knew of old that some of his strange prejudices were proof against anything i could do to remove them at last we reached our temporary abode it was a substantial low built house owned and inhabited by a thrifty middle aged widow who although well to do so far as the simple ideas of her neighbors went was nevertheless always willing to add to her resources by accommodating such stray tourists as wished to bury themselves for a day or two in solitude or artists who like ourselves preferred to enjoy the beauties of nature undisturbed by the usual ebbing and flowing stream of sightseers as carriston asserted the accommodation if homely was good enough for two single men the fare was plentiful and our rooms were the picture of cleanliness after a cursory inspection i felt sure that i could for a few weeks make myself very happy in these quarters i had not been twenty four hours in the house before i found out one reason for the great change for the better in charles carriston's demeanor knew his step was lighter his eye brighter his voice gayer and his whole bearing altered whether the reason was a subject of congratulation or not i could not as yet say the boy was in love in love as only a passionate romantic imaginative nature can be and even then only once in a lifetime heedless headstrong impulsive and entirely his own master he had given his very heart and soul into the keeping of a woman iv that a man of carriston's rank breeding and refinement should meet his fate within the walls of a lonely farm house beyond the trossachs seems incredible one would scarcely expect to find among such humble surroundings a wife suitable to a man of his stamp and yet when i saw the woman who had won him i neither wondered at the conquest nor did i blame him for weakness i made the great discovery on the morning after my arrival eager to taste the freshness of the morning air i rose betimes and went for a short stroll i returned and whilst standing at the door of the house was positively startled by the beauty of a girl who passed me and entered as if she was a regular inhabitant of the place not a rosy scotch lassie such as one would expect to find indigenous to the soil but a slim graceful girl with delicate classical features a girl with a mass of knotted light hair yet with the apparent anomaly dark eyes eyelashes and eyebrows a combination which to my mind makes a style of beauty rare irresistible and dangerous above all others the features which filled the exquisite oval of her face were refined and faultless her complexion was pale but its pallor in no way suggested anything save perfect health to cut my enthusiastic description short i may at once say it has never been my good fortune to cast my eyes on a lovelier creature than this young girl although her dress was of the plainest and simplest description no one could have mistaken her for a servant and much as i admire the bonny healthy scotch country lassie i felt sure that mountain air had never reared a being of this ethereally beautiful type as she passed me i raised my hat instinctively she gracefully bent her golden head and bade me a quiet but unembarrassed good morning my eyes followed her until she vanished at the end of the dark passage which led to the back of the house even during the brief glimpse i enjoyed of this fair unknown a strange idea occurred to me there was a remarkable likeness between her delicate features and those scarcely less delicate of carriston this resemblance may have added to the interest the girl's appearance awoke in my mind any way i entered our sitting room and a prey to curiosity and perhaps hunger awaited with much impatience the appearance of carriston and breakfast the former arrived first generally speaking he was afoot long before i was but this morning we had reversed the usual order of things as soon as i saw him i cried carriston tell me at once who is the lovely girl i met outside an angel with dark eyes and golden hair is she staying here like ourselves a look of pleasure flashed into his eyes a look which pretty well told me everything nevertheless he answered as carelessly as if such lovely young women were as common to the mountain side as rocks and brambles i expect you mean miss rowan a niece of our worthy landlady she lives with her she cannot be scotch with such a face and eyes half and half her father was called an englishman but was i believe of french extraction they say the name was originally rohan carriston seemed to have made close inquiries as to miss rowan's parentage but what brings her here i asked she has nowhere else to go rowan was an artist he married a sister of our hostess and bore her away from her native land some years ago she died leaving this one daughter last year the father died penniless they tell me so the girl has since then lived with her only relative her aunt well i said as you seem to know all about her you can introduce me by and by with the greatest pleasure if miss rowan permits said carriston i was glad to hear him give the conditional promise with as much respect to the lady's wishes as if she had been a duchess then with the liberty a close friend may take i drew toward me a portfolio full i presumed of sketches of surrounding scenery to my surprise carriston jumped up hastily and snatched it from me they are too bad to look at he said as i struggled to regain possession sundry strings broke and lo and behold the floor was littered not with delineations of rock lake and torrent but with images of the young girl i had seen a few minutes before full face profile three quarter face five even seven eight face all were there each study perfectly executed by carriston's clever pencil i threw myself into a chair and laughed aloud whilst the young man blushing and discomforted quickly huddled the portraits between the covers just as a genuine scotch lassie bore in the plentiful and to me very welcome breakfast carriston did favor me with his company during the whole of that day but in spite of my having come to scotland to enjoy his society that day from easily guessed reasons was the only one in which i had undisputed possession of my friend of course i bantered him a great deal on the portfolio episode he took it in good part attempting little or no defence indeed before night he had told me with all a boy's fervor how he had loved madeline rowan at first sight how in the short space of time which had elapsed since that meeting he had wooed her and won her how good and beautiful she was how he worshipped her how happy he felt how when i went south he should accompany me and after making a few necessary arrangements return at once and bear his bride away i could only listen to him and congratulate him it was not my place to act the elder and advise him either for or against the marriage carriston had only himself to please and if he made a rash step only himself to blame for the consequences and why should i have dissuaded i who in two days envied the boy's good fortune i saw a great deal of madeline rowan how strange and out of place her name and face seemed amid our surroundings if at first somewhat shy and retiring she soon if only for carriston's sake consented to look upon me as a friend and talked to me freely and unreservedly then i found that her nature was as sweet as her face such a conquest did she make of me that save for one chimerical reason i should have felt quite certain that carriston had chosen well and would be happy in wedding the girl of his choice heedless of her humble position in the world and absence of fitting wealth when once his wife i felt sure that if he cared for her to win social success her looks and bearing would insure it and from the great improvement which as i have already said i noticed in his health and spirits i believed that his marriage would make his life longer happier and better now for my objection which seems almost a laughable one i objected on the score of the extraordinary resemblance which so far as a man may resemble a woman existed between charles carriston and madeline rowan the more i saw them together the more i was struck by it a stranger might well have taken them for twin brother and sister the same delicate features drawn in the same lines the same soft dark dreamy eyes even the same shaped heads comparing the two it needed no phrenologist or physiognomist to tell you that where one excelled the other excelled where one failed the other was wanting now could i have selected a wife for my friend i would have chosen one with habits and constitution entirely different from his own she should have been a bright bustling woman with lots of energy and common sense one who would have rattled him about and kept him going not a lovely dark eyed dreamy girl who could for hours at a stretch make herself supremely happy if only sitting at her lover's feet and speaking no word yet they were a handsome couple and never have i seen two people so utterly devoted to each other as those two seemed to be during those autumn days which i spent with them i soon had a clear proof of the closeness of their mental resemblance one evening carriston madeline and i were sitting out of doors watching the gray mist deepening in the valley at our feet two of the party were of course hand in hand the third seated at a discreet distance not so far away as to preclude conversation but far enough off to be able to pretend that he saw and heard only what was intended for his eyes and ears how certain topics which i would have avoided discussing with carriston were started i hardly remember probably some strange tale had been passed down from wilder and even more solitary regions than ours some ridiculous tale of highland superstition no doubt embellished and augmented by each one who repeated it to his fellows from her awed talk i soon found that madeline rowan perhaps by reason of the scotch blood in her veins was as firm a believer in things visionary and beyond nature as ever charles carriston in his silliest moments could be as soon as i could i stopped the talk and the next day finding the girl for a few minutes alone told her plainly that subjects of this kind should be kept as far as possible from her future husband's thoughts she promised obedience with dreamy eyes which looked as far away and full of visions as carriston's by the by i said has he ever spoken to you about seeing strange things yes he has hinted at it and you believe him of course i do he told me so this was unanswerable a pretty pair they will make i muttered as madeline slipped from me to welcome her lover who was approaching they will see ghosts in every corner and goblins behind every curtain nevertheless the young people had no doubts about their coming bliss everything was going smoothly and pleasantly for them carriston had at once spoken to madeline's aunt and obtained the old scotchwoman's ready consent to their union i was rather vexed at his still keeping to his absurd whim and concealing his true name he said he was afraid of alarming her aunt by telling her he was passing under an alias whilst if he gave madeline his true reason for so doing she would be miserable moreover i found he had formed the romantic plan of marrying her without telling her in what an enviable position she would be placed so far as worldly gear went a kind of lord burleigh surprise no doubt commended itself to his imaginative brain the last day of my holiday came i bade a long and sad farewell to lake and mountain and accompanied by carriston started for home i did not see the parting proper between the young people that was far too sacred a thing to be intruded upon but even when that protracted affair was over i waited many many minutes whilst carriston stood hand in hand with madeline comforting himself and her by reiterating only six weeks six short weeks and then and then it was the girl who at last tore herself away and then carriston mounted reluctantly by my side on the rough vehicle from edinburgh we travelled by the night train the greater part of the way we had the compartment to ourselves carriston as a lover will talked of nothing but coming bliss and his plans for the future after a while i grew quite weary of the monotony of the subject and at last dozed off and for some little time slept the shrill whistle which told us a tunnel was at hand aroused me my companion was sitting opposite to me and as i glanced across at him my attention was arrested by the same strange intense look which i had on a previous occasion at bettws y coed noticed in his eyes the same fixed stare the same obliviousness to all that was passing remembering his request i shook him somewhat roughly back to his senses he regarded me for a moment vacantly then said now i have found out what was wanting to make the power i told you of complete i could see her if i wished of course you can see her in your mind's eye all lovers can do that if i tried i could see her bodily know exactly what she is doing he spoke with an air of complete conviction then i hope for the sake of modesty you won't try it is now nearly three o'clock she ought to be in bed and asleep i spoke lightly thinking it better to try and laugh him out of his folly he took no notice of my sorry joke no he said quietly i am not going to try but i know now what was wanting love such love as mine such love as hers makes the connecting link and enables sight or some other sense to cross over space and pass through every material obstacle look here carriston i said seriously you are talking as a madman talks i don't want to frighten you but i am bound both as a doctor and your sincere friend to tell you that unless you cure yourself of these absurd delusions they will grow upon you develop fresh forms and you will probably end your days under restraint ask any doctor he will tell you the same doctors are a clever race answered my strange young friend but they don't know everything so saying he closed his eyes and appeared to sleep we parted upon reaching london many kind words and wishes passed between us and i gave him some well meant and i believed needed warnings he was going down to see his uncle the baronet then he had some matters to arrange with his lawyers and above all had to select a residence for himself and his wife he would no doubt be in london for a short time if possible he would come and see me any way he would write and let me know the exact date of his approaching marriage if i could manage to come to it so much the better if not he would try as they passed through town to bring his bride to pay me a flying and friendly visit he left me in the best of spirits and i went back to my patients and worked hard to make up lost ground and counteract whatever errors had been committed by my substitute some six weeks afterward late at night whilst i was deep in a new and clever treatise on zymotics a man haggard wild unshorn and unkempt rushed past my startled servant and entered the room in which i sat he threw himself into a chair and i was horrified to recognize in the intruder my clever and brilliant friend charles carriston v the end has come sooner than i expected these were the sad words i muttered to myself as waving my frightened servant away i closed the door and stood alone with the supposed maniac he rose and wrung my hand then without a word sank back into his chair and buried his face in his hands a sort of nervous trembling seemed to run through his frame deeply distressed i drew his hands from his face now carriston i said as firmly as i could look up and tell me what all this means look up i say man and speak to me he raised his eyes to mine and kept them there whilst a ghastly smile a phantom humor flickered across his white face no doubt his native quickness told him what i suspected so he looked me full and steadily in the face no he said not as you think but let there be no mistake question me talk to me put me to any test satisfy yourself once for all that i am as sane as you are he spoke so rationally his eyes met mine so unflinchingly that i was rejoiced to know that my fears were as yet ungrounded there was grief excitement want of rest in his appearance but his general manner told me he was as he said as sane as i was thank heaven you can speak to me and look at me like this i exclaimed you are satisfied then he said on this point yes now tell me what is wrong now that he had set my doubts at rest his agitation and excitement seemed to return he grasped my hand convulsively madeline he whispered madeline my love she is gone gone i repeated gone where she is gone i say stolen from me by some black hearted traitor perhaps forever who can tell but carriston surely in so short a time her love cannot have been won by another if so all i can say is what he shouted you have seen her you in your wildest dreams to imagine that madeline rowan would leave me of her own free will no sir she has been stolen from me entrapped carried away hidden but i will find her or i will kill the black hearted villain who has done this he rose and paced the room his face was distorted with rage he clinched and unclinched his long slender hands my dear fellow i said you are talking riddles sit down and tell me calmly what has happened but first of all as you look utterly worn out i will ring for my man to get you some food no he said i want nothing weary i am for i have been to scotland and back as fast as man can travel i reached london a short time ago and after seeing one man have come straight to you my only friend for help it may be for protection but i have eaten and i have drank knowing i must keep my health and strength however i insisted on some wine being brought he drank a glass and then with a strange enforced calm told me what had taken place his tale was this after we had parted company on our return from scotland carriston went down to the family seat in oxfordshire and informed his uncle of the impending change in his life the baronet an extremely old man infirm and all but childish troubled little about the matter every acre of his large property was strictly entailed so his pleasure or displeasure could make but little alteration in his nephew's prospects still he was the head of the family and carriston was in duty bound to make the important news known to him the young man made no secret of his approaching marriage so in a very short time every member of the family was aware that the heir and future head was about to ally himself to a nobody knowing nothing of madeline rowan's rare beauty and sweet nature carriston's kinsmen and kinswomen were sparing with their congratulations indeed mr ralph carriston the cousin whose name was coupled with such absurd suspicions went so far as to write a bitter sarcastic letter full of ironical felicitations this and charles carriston's haughty reply did not make the affection between the cousins any stronger moreover shortly afterward the younger man heard that inquiries were being made in the neighborhood of madeline's home as to her position and parentage feeling sure that only his cousin ralph could have had the curiosity to institute such inquiries he wrote and thanked him for the keen interest he was manifesting in his future welfare but begged that hereafter mr carriston would apply to him direct for any information he wanted the two men were now no longer on speaking terms charles carriston in his present frame of mind cared little whether his relatives wished to bless or forbid the banns he was passionately in love and at once set about making arrangements for a speedy marriage although madeline was still ignorant of the exalted position held by her lover although she came to him absolutely penniless he was resolved in the matter of money to treat her as generously as he would have treated the most eligible damsel in the country there were several legal questions to be set at rest concerning certain property he wished to settle upon her this of course caused delay as soon as they were adjusted to his own or rather to his lawyer's satisfaction he purposed going to scotland and carrying away his beautiful bride in the meantime he cast about for a residence somewhat bohemian in his nature carriston had no intention of settling down just yet to live the life of an ordinary moneyed englishman his intention was to take madeline abroad for some months he had fixed upon cannes as a desirable place at which to winter but having grown somewhat tired of hotel life wished to rent a furnished house he had received from an agent to whom he had been advised to apply the refusal of a house which from the glowing description given seemed the one above all others he wanted as an early decision was insisted upon my impulsive young friend thought nothing of crossing the channel and running down to the south of france to see with his own eyes that the much lauded place was worthy of the fair being who was to be its temporary mistress he wrote to madeline and told her he was going from home for a few days he said he should be travelling the greater part of the time so it should be no use her writing to him until his return he did not reveal the object of his journey were madeline to know it was to choose a winter residence at cannes she would be filled with amazement and the innocent deception he was still keeping up would not be carried through to the romantic end which he pictured to himself the day before he started for france madeline wrote that her aunt was very unwell but said nothing as to her malady causing any alarm perhaps carriston thought less about the old scotch widow than her relationship and kindness to miss rowan merited he started on his travels without any forebodings of evil his journey to cannes and back was hurried he wasted no time on the road but was delayed for two days at the place itself before he could make final arrangements with the owner and the present occupier of the house thinking he was going to start every moment he did not write to madeline at the rate at which he meant to return a letter posted in england would reach her almost as quickly as if posted at cannes he reached his home which for the last few weeks had been oxford and found two letters waiting for him the first dated on the day he left england was from madeline it told him that her aunt's illness had suddenly taken a fatal turn that she had died that day almost without warning the second letter was anonymous it was written apparently by a woman and advised mr carr to look sharply after his lady love or he would find himself left in the lurch the writer would not be surprised to hear some fine day that she had eloped with a certain gentleman who should be nameless this precious epistle probably an emanation of feminine spite carriston treated as it deserved he tore it up and threw the pieces to the wind but the thought of madeline being alone at that lonely house troubled him greatly the dead woman had no sons or daughters all the anxiety and responsibility connected with her affairs would fall on the poor girl the next day he threw himself into the scotch express and started for her far away home on arriving there he found it occupied only by the rough farm servants they seemed in a state of wonderment and volubly questioned carriston as to the whereabouts of madeline the question sent a chill of fear to his heart he answered their questions by others and soon learned all they had to communicate little enough it was on the morning after the old woman's funeral madeline had gone to callendar to ask the advice of an old friend of her aunt's as to what steps should now be taken she had neither been to this friend nor had she returned home she had however sent a message that she must go to london at once and would write from there that was the last heard of her all that was known about her upon hearing this news carriston became a prey to the acutest terror an emotion which was quite inexplicable to the honest people his informants the girl had gone but she had sent word whither she had gone true they did not know the reason for her departure so sudden and without luggage of any description true she had not written as promised but no doubt they would hear from her to morrow carriston knew better without revealing the extent of his fears he flew back to callendar inquiries at the railway station informed him that she had gone or had purposed going to london but whether she ever reached it or whether any trace of her could be found there was at least a matter of doubt no good could be gained by remaining in scotland so he travelled back at once to town half distracted sleepless and racking his brain to know where to look for her she has been decoyed away he said in conclusion she is hidden imprisoned somewhere and i know as well as if he told me who has done this thing i can trace ralph carriston's cursed hand through it all i glanced at him askance this morbid suspicion of his cousin amounted almost to monomania he had told the tale of madeline's disappearance clearly and tersely but when he began to account for it his theory was a wild and untenable one however much he suspected ralph carriston of longing to stand in his shoes i could see no object for the crime of which he accused him that of decoying away madeline rowan but why should he have done this i asked to prevent your marriage you are young he must have foreseen that you would marry some day carriston leaned toward me and dropped his voice to a whisper this is his reason he said this is why i come to you you are not the only one who has entirely misread my nature and seen a strong tendency to insanity in it of course i know that you are all wrong but i know that ralph carriston has stolen my love stolen her because he thinks and hopes that her loss will drive me mad perhaps drive me to kill myself i went straight to him i have just come from him brand i tell you that when i taxed him with the crime when i raved at him when i threatened to tear the life out of him his cold wicked eyes leaped with joy i heard him mutter between his teeth 'men have been put in strait waistcoats for less than this' then i knew why he had done this i curbed myself and left him most likely he will try to shut me up as a lunatic but i count upon your protection count upon your help to find my love that any man could be guilty of such a subtle refinement of crime as that of which he accused his cousin seemed to me if not impossible at least improbable but as at present there was no doubt about my friend's sanity i promised my aid readily and now i said my dear boy i won't hear another word to night nothing can be done until to morrow then we will consult as to what steps should be taken drink this and go to bed yes you are as sane as i am but remember insomnia soon drives the strongest man out of his senses i poured out an opiate he drank it obediently before i left him for the night i saw him in bed and sleeping a heavy sleep vi the advantage to one who writes not a tale of imagination but a simple record of events is this he need not be bound by the recognized canons of the story telling art need not exercise his ingenuity to mislead his reader need not suppress some things and lay undue stress on others to create mysteries to be cleared up at the end of the tale therefore using the privilege of a plain narrator i shall here give some account of what became of miss rowan as so far as i can remember i heard it some time afterward from her own lips the old scotchwoman's funeral over and those friends who had been present departed madeline was left in the little farm house alone save for the presence of the two servants several kind bodies had offered to come and stay with her but she had declined the offers she was in no mood for company and perhaps being of such a different race and breed would not have found much comfort in the rough homely sympathy which was offered to her she preferred being alone with her grief grief which after all was bound to be much lightened by the thought of her own approaching happiness for the day was drawing near when her lover would cross the border and bear his bonny bride away she felt sure that she would not be long alone that the moment carriston heard of her aunt's death he would come to her assistance in such a peaceful god fearing neighborhood she had no fear of being left without protection moreover her position in the house was well defined the old woman who was childless had left her niece all of which she died possessed so madeline decided to wait quietly until she heard from her lover still there were business matters to be attended to and at the funeral mr douglas of callendar the executor under the will had suggested that an early interview would be desirable he offered to drive out to the little farm the next day but miss rowan who had to see to some feminine necessaries which could only be supplied by shops decided that she would come to the town instead of troubling mr douglas to drive so far out madeline in spite of the superstitious element in her character was a brave girl and in spite of her refined style of beauty strong and healthy early hours were the rule in that humble home so before seven o'clock in the morning she was ready to start on her drive to the little town at first she thought of taking with her the boy who did the rough out door work but he was busy about something or other and besides was a garrulous lad who would be certain to chatter the whole way and this morning miss rowan wanted no companions save her own mingled thoughts of sadness and joy she knew every inch of the road she feared no evil she would be home again long before nightfall the pony was quiet and sure footed so away went madeline in the strong primitive vehicle on her lonely twelve miles' drive through the fair scenery she passed few people on the road indeed she remembered meeting no one except one or two pedestrian tourists who like sensible men were doing a portion of their day's task in the early morning i have no doubt but miss rowan seemed to them a passing vision of loveliness but when she was a mile or two from callendar she saw a boy on a pony the boy who must have known her by sight stopped and handed her a telegram she had to pay several shillings for the delivery or intended delivery of the message so far from the station the boy galloped away congratulating himself on having been spared a long ride and miss rowan tore open the envelope left in her hands the message was brief mr carr is seriously ill come at once you will be met in london madeline did not scream or faint she gave one low moan of pain set her teeth and with the face of one in a dream drove as quickly as she could to callendar straight to the railway station fortunately or rather unfortunately she had money with her so she did not waste time in going to mr douglas in spite of the crushing blow she had received the girl had all her wits about her a train would start in ten minutes' time she took her ticket then found an idler outside the station and paid him to take the pony and carriage back to the farm with the message as repeated to carriston the journey passed like a long dream the girl could think of nothing but her lover dying dying perhaps dead before she could reach him the miles flew by unnoticed twilight crept on the carriage grew dark at last london at last miss rowan stepped out on the broad platform not knowing what to do or where to turn presently a tall well dressed man came up to her and removing his hat addressed her by name the promise as to her being met had been kept she clasped her hands tell me oh tell me he is not dead she cried mr carr is not dead he is ill very ill delirious and calling for you where is he oh take me to him he is miles and miles from here at a friend's house i have been deputed to meet you and to accompany you if you feel strong enough to continue the journey at once come said madeline take me to him your luggage asked the gentleman i have none come you must take some refreshment i need nothing come the gentleman glanced at his watch there is just time he said he called a cab told the driver to go at top speed they reached paddington just in time to catch the mail during the drive across london madeline asked many questions and learned from her companion that mr carr had been staying for a day or two at a friend's house in the west of england that yesterday he had fallen from his horse and sustained such injuries that his life was despaired of he had been continually calling for madeline they had found her address on a letter and had telegraphed as soon as possible for which act miss rowan thanked her companion with tears in her eyes her conductor did not say much of his own accord but in replying to her questions he was politely sympathetic she thought of little outside the fearful picture which filled every corner of her brain but from her conductor's manner received the impression that he was a medical adviser who had seen the sufferer and assisted in the treatment of the case she did not ask his name nor did he reveal it at paddington he placed her in a ladies' carriage and left her he was a smoker he said she wondered somewhat at this desertion then the train sped down west at the large stations the gentleman came to her and offered her refreshments hunger seemed to have left her but she accepted a cup of tea once or twice at last sorrow fatigue and weakness produced by such a prolonged fast had their natural effect with the tears still on her lashes the girl fell asleep and must have slept for many miles a sleep unbroken by stoppages at stations her conductor at last aroused her he stood at the door of the carriage we must get out here he said all the momentarily forgotten anguish came back to her as she stood beside him on the almost unoccupied platform are we there at last she asked i am sorry to say we have still a long drive would you like to rest first no no come on if you please she spoke with feverish eagerness the man bowed a carriage waits he said outside the station was a carriage of some sort drawn by one horse and driven by a man muffled up to the eyes it was still night but madeline fancied dawn could not be far off her conductor opened the door of the carriage and waited for her to enter she paused ask him that man must know if i am most remiss said the gentleman he exchanged a few words with the driver and coming back told madeline that mr carr was still alive sensible and expecting her eagerly oh please please drive fast said the poor girl springing into the carriage the gentleman seated himself beside her and for a long time they drove on in silence at last they stopped the dawn was just glimmering they alighted in front of a house the door was open madeline entered swiftly which way which way she asked she was too agitated to notice any surroundings her one wish was to reach her lover allow me said the conductor passing her this way please follow me he went up a short flight of stairs then paused and opened a door quietly he stood aside for the girl to enter the room was dimly lit and contained a bed with drawn curtains madeline flew past her travelling companion and as she threw herself on her knees beside the bed upon which she expected to see the helpless and shattered form of the man she loved heard or fancied she heard the door locked behind her vii carriston slept on late into the next day knowing that every moment of bodily and mental rest was a precious boon to him i left him undisturbed he was still fast asleep when about mid day a gentleman called upon me he sent up no card and i supposed he came to consult me professionally the moment he entered my room i recognized him he was the thin lipped gentlemanly person whom i had met on my journey to bournemouth last spring the man who had seemed so much impressed by my views on insanity and had manifested such interest in the description i had given without mentioning any name of carriston's peculiar mind i should have at once claimed acquaintanceship with my visitor but before i could speak he advanced and apologized gracefully for his intrusion you will forgive it he added when i tell you my name is ralph carriston remembering our chance conversation the thought that after all charles carriston's wild suspicion was well founded flashed through me like lightning my great hope was that my visitor might not remember my face as i remembered his i bowed coldly but said nothing i believe dr brand he continued you have a young relative of mine at present staying with you yes mr carriston is my guest i answered we are old friends ah i did not know that i do not remember having heard him mention your name as a friend but as it is so no one knows better than you do the unfortunate state of his health how do you find him to day violent i pretended to ignore the man's meaning and answered smilingly violence is the last thing i should look for he is tired out and exhausted by travel and is in great distress that i believe is the whole of his complaint yes yes to be sure poor boy his sweetheart has left him or something but as a doctor you must know that his mental condition is not quite what it should be his friends are very anxious about him they fear that a little restraint temporary i hope must be put upon his actions i called to ask your advice and aid in what mr carriston in this a young man can't be left free to go about threatening his friends' lives i have brought dr daley with me you know him of course he is below in my carriage i will call him up with your permission he could then see poor charles and the needful certificate could be signed by you two doctors mr carriston i said decidedly let me tell you in the plainest words that your cousin is at present as fully in possession of his wits as you are dr daley whoever he may be could sign no certificate and in our day no asylum would dare to keep mr carriston within its walls an unpleasant sinister look crossed my listener's face but his voice still remained bland and suave i am sorry to differ from you dr brand he said but i know him better than you do i have seen him as you have never yet seen him only last night he came to me in a frantic state i expected every moment he would make a murderous attack on me perhaps he fancied he had some reasons for anger i said ralph carriston looked at me with those cold eyes of which his cousin had spoken if the boy has succeeded in converting you to any of his delusions i can only say that doctors are more credulous than i fancied but the question is not worth arguing you decline to assist me so i must do without you good morning dr brand he left the room as gracefully as he had entered it i remained in a state of doubt it was curious that ralph carriston turned out to be the man whom i had met in the train but the evidence offered by the coincidence was not enough to convict him of the crime of endeavoring to drive his cousin mad by such a far fetched stratagem as the inveigling away of madeline rowan besides even in wishing to prove charles carriston mad he had much to say on his side supposing him to be innocent of having abducted madeline carriston's violent behavior on the preceding evening must have seemed very much like insanity in spite of the aversion with which ralph carriston inspired me i scarcely knew which side to believe carriston still slept so when i went out on my afternoon rounds i left a note begging him to remain in the house until my return then i found him up dressed and looking much more like himself when i entered dinner was on the table so not until that meal was over could we talk unrestrainedly upon the subject which was uppermost in both our minds as soon as we were alone i turned toward my guest and now i said we must settle what to do there seems to me to be but one course open you have plenty of money so your best plan is to engage skilled police assistance young ladies can't be spirited away like this without leaving a trace to my surprise carriston flatly objected to this course no he said i shall not go to the police the man who took her away has placed her where no police can find her i must find her myself find her yourself why it may be months years before you do that good heavens carriston she may be murdered or worse i shall know if any further evil happens to her then i shall kill ralph carriston but you tell me you have no clew whatever to trace her by do talk plainly tell me all or nothing carriston smiled very faintly no clew that you at any rate will believe in he said but i know this much she is a prisoner somewhere she is unhappy but not as yet ill treated heavens do you think if i did not know this i should keep my senses for an hour how can you possibly know it by that gift that extra sense or whatever it is which you deride i knew it would come to me some day but i little thought how i should welcome it i know that in some way i shall find her by it i tell you i have already seen her three times i may see her again at any moment when the strange fit comes over me all this fantastic nonsense was spoken so simply and with such an air of conviction that once more my suspicions as to the state of his mind were aroused in spite of the brave answers which i had given mr ralph carriston i felt that common sense was undeniably on his side tell me what you mean by your strange fit i said resolved to find out the nature of carriston's fancies or hallucinations is it a kind of trance you fall into he seemed loath to give any information on the subject but i pressed him for an answer yes he said at last it must be a kind of trance an indescribable feeling comes over me i know that my eyes are fixed on some object presently that object vanishes and i see madeline how do you see her she seems to stand in a blurred circle of light as cast by a magic lantern that is the only way that i can describe it but her figure is plain and clear she might be close to me the carpet on which she stands i can see the chair on which she sits the table on which she leans her hand anything she touches i can see but no more i have seen her talking i knew she was entreating some one but that some one was invisible yet if she touched that person the virtue of her touch would enable me to see him so far as i could see carriston's case appeared to be one of over wrought or unduly stimulated imagination his i had always considered to be a mind of the most peculiar construction in his present state of love grief and suspense these hallucinations might come in the same way in which dreams come for a little while i sat in silence considering how i could best combat with and dispel his remarkable delusions before i had arrived at any decision i was called away to see a patient i was but a short time engaged then i returned to carriston intending to continue my inquiries upon re entering the room i found him sitting as i had left him directly opposite to the door his face was turned fully toward me and i trembled as i caught sight of it he was leaning forward his hands on the table cloth his whole frame rigid his eyes staring in one direction yet i knew capable of seeing nothing that i could see he seemed even oblivious to sound for i entered the room and closed the door behind me without causing him to change look or position the moment i saw the man i knew that he had been overtaken by what he called the strange fit my first impulse a natural one was to arouse him but second thoughts told me that this was an opportunity for studying his disease which should not be lost i felt that i could call it by no other name than disease so i proceeded to make a systematic examination of his symptoms i leaned across the table and with my face about a foot from his looked straight into his eyes they betrayed no sign of recognition no knowledge of my presence i am ashamed to say i could not divest myself of the impression that they were looking through me the pupils were greatly dilated the lids were wide apart i lighted a taper and held it before them but could see no expansion of the iris it was a case i confess entirely beyond my comprehension i had no experience which might serve as a guide as to what was the best course to adopt all i could do was to stand and watch carefully for any change save for his regular breathing and a sort of convulsive twitching of his fingers carriston might have been a corpse or a statue his face could scarcely grow paler than it had been before the attack altogether it was an uncomfortable sight a creepy sight this motionless man utterly regardless of all that went on around him and seeing or giving one the idea that he saw something far away i sighed as i looked at the strange spectacle and foresaw what the end must surely be but although i longed for him to awake i determined on this occasion to let the trance or fit run its full course that i might notice in what manner and how soon consciousness returned i must have waited and watched some ten minutes minutes which seemed to me interminable at last i saw the lips quiver the lids flicker once or twice and eventually close wearily over the eyes the unnatural tension of every muscle seemed to relax and sighing deeply and apparently quite exhausted carriston sank back into his chair with beads of perspiration forming on his white brow the fit was over in a moment i was at his side and forcing a glass of wine down his throat he looked up at me and spoke his voice was faint but his words were quite collected i have seen her again he said she is well but so unhappy i saw her kneel down and pray she stretched her beautiful arms out to me and yet i know not where to look for her my poor love my poor love i waited until i thought he had sufficiently recovered from his exhaustion to talk without injurious consequences carriston i said let me ask you one question are these trances or visions voluntary or not he reflected for a few moments i can't quite tell you he said or rather i would put in this way i do not think i can exercise my power at will but i can feel when the fit is coming on me and i believe can if i choose stop myself from yielding to it very well now listen promise me you will fight against these seizures as much as you can if you don't you will be raving mad in a month i can't promise that said carriston quietly see her at times i must or i shall die but i promise to yield as seldom as may be i know as well as you do that the very exhaustion i now feel must be injurious to any one in truth he looked utterly worn out very much dissatisfied with his concession the best i could get from him i sent him to bed knowing that natural rest if he could get it would do more than anything else toward restoring a healthy tone to his mind viii although carriston stated that he came to me for aid and it may be for protection he manifested the greatest reluctance in following any advice i offered him the obstinacy of his refusal to obtain the assistance of the police placed me in a predicament that madeline rowan had really disappeared i was of course compelled to believe it might even be possible that she was kept against her will in some place of concealment in such a case it behooved us to take proper steps to trace her her welfare should not depend upon the hallucinations and eccentric ideas of a man half out of his senses with love and grief i all but resolved even at the risk of forfeiting carriston's friendship to put the whole matter in the hands of the police unless in the course of a day or two we heard from the girl herself or carriston suggested some better plan curiously enough although refusing to be guided by me he made no suggestion on his own account he was racked by fear and suspense yet his only idea of solving difficulties seemed to be that of waiting he did nothing he simply waited as if he expected that chance would bring what he should have been searching for high and low some days passed before i could get a tardy consent that aid should be sought even then he would not go to the proper quarter but he allowed me to summon to our councils a man who advertised himself as being a private detective this man or one of his men came at our call and heard what was wanted of him carriston reluctantly gave him one of madeline's photographs he also told him that only by watching and spying on ralph carriston's every action could he hope to obtain the clew i did not much like the course adopted nor did i like the look of the man to whom the inquiry was intrusted but at any rate something was being done a week passed without any news from our agent carriston in truth did not seem to expect any i believe he only employed the man in deference to my wishes he moved about the house in a disconsolate fashion i had not told him of my interview with his cousin but had cautioned him on the rare occasions upon which he went out of doors to avoid speaking to strangers and my servants had strict instructions to prevent any one coming in and taking my guest by surprise for i had during those days opened a confidential inquiry on my own account i wanted to learn something about this mr ralph carriston so i asked a man who knew everybody to find out all about him he reported that ralph carriston was a man well known about london he was married and had a house in dorsetshire but the greater part of his time was spent in town once he was supposed to be well off but now it was the general opinion that every acre he owned was mortgaged and that he was much pressed for money but my informant said there is but one life between him and the reversion to large estates and that life is a poor one i believe even now there is talk about the man who stands in his way being mad if so ralph carriston will get the management of everything after this news i felt it more than ever needful to keep a watchful eye on my friend so far as i knew there had been no recurrence of the trance and i began to hope that proper treatment would effect a complete cure when to my great alarm and annoyance carriston while sitting with me suddenly and without warning fell into the same strange state of body and mind as previously described this time he was sitting in another part of the room after watching him for a minute or two and just as i was making up my mind to arouse him and scold him thoroughly for his folly he sprung to his feet and shouting let her go loose her i say rushed violently across the room so violently that i had barely time to interpose and prevent him from coming into contact with the opposite wall upon returning to his senses he told me with great excitement that he had again seen madeline moreover this time he had seen a man with her a man who had placed his hand upon her wrist and kept it there and so according to carriston's wild reasoning became on account of the contact visible to him he told me he had watched them for some moments until the man tightening his grip on the girl's arm endeavored he thought to lead her or induce her to follow him somewhere at this juncture unaware that he was gazing at a vision he had rushed to her assistance in the frantic way i have described then he awoke he also told me he had studied the man's features and general appearance most carefully with a view to future recognition all these ridiculous statements were made as he made the former ones with the air of one relating simple undeniable facts one speaking the plain unvarnished truth and expecting full credence to be given to his words it was too absurd too sad it was evident to me that the barrier between his hallucinations dreams visions or what he chose to call them and pure insanity was now a very slight and fragile one but before i gave up his case as hopeless i determined to make another strong appeal to his common sense i told him of his cousin's visit to me of his intentions and proposition i begged him to consider what consequences his extraordinary beliefs and extravagant actions must eventually entail he listened attentively and calmly you see now he said how right i was in attributing all this to ralph carriston how right i was to come to you a doctor of standing who can vouch for my sanity vouch for your sanity how can i when you sit here and talk such arrant nonsense and expect me to believe it when you jump from your chair and rush madly at some visionary foe sane as you may be in all else any evidence i could give in your favor must break down in cross examination if an inkling of these things got about come carriston be reasonable and prove your sanity by setting about this search for miss rowan in a proper way he made no reply but walked up and down the room apparently in deep thought my words seemed to have had no effect upon him presently he seated himself and as if to avoid returning to the argument drew a book at hazard from my shelves and began to read he opened the volume at random but after reading a few lines seemed struck by something that met his eyes and in a few minutes was deeply immersed in the contents of the book i glanced at it to see what had so awakened his interest by a curious fatality he had chosen a book the very worst for him in his present frame of mind gilchrist's recently published life of william blake that masterly memoir of a man who was on certain points as mad as carriston himself i was about to remonstrate when he laid down the volume and turned to me varley the painter he said was a firm believer in blake's visions varley was a bigger fool than blake i retorted fancy his sitting down and watching his clever but mad friend draw spectral heads and believing them to be genuine portraits of dead kings whose forms condescended to appear to blake a sudden thought seemed to strike carriston will you give me some paper and chalk he asked upon being furnished with these materials he seated himself at the table and began to draw at least a dozen times he sketched with his usual rapidity some object or another and a dozen times after a moment's consideration threw each sketch aside with an air of disappointment and began a fresh one at last one of his attempts seemed to come up to his requirements i have it now exactly he cried with joy even triumph in his voice he spent some time in putting finishing touches to the successful sketch then he handed me the paper that is the man i saw just now with madeline he said when i find him i shall find her he spoke with all sincerity and conviction i looked at the paper with i am bound to say a great amount of curiosity no matter from what visionary source carriston had drawn his inspiration his sketch was vigorous and natural enough i have already mentioned his wonderful power of drawing portraits from memory so was willing to grant that he might have reproduced the outline of some face which had somewhere struck him yet why should it have been this one his drawing represented the three quarter face of a man an ordinary man apparently between forty and fifty years of age it was a coarse featured ill favored face with a ragged ruff of hair round the chin it was not the face of a gentleman nor even the face of a gentle nurtured man and the artist by a few cunning strokes had made it wear a crafty and sullen look the sketch as i write this lies before me so that i am not speaking from memory now there are some portraits of which without having seen the original we say what splendid likenesses these must be it was so with carriston's sketch looking at it you felt sure it was exactly like the man whom it was intended to represent so that with the certain amount of art knowledge which i am at least supposed to possess it was hard for me after examining the drawing and recognizing the true artist's touch in every line to bring myself to accept the fact that it was but the outcome of a diseased imagination as at this very moment i glance at that drawing i scarcely blame myself for the question that faintly frames itself in my innermost heart could it be possible could there be in certain organizations powers not yet known not yet properly investigated my thought supposing such a thought was ever there was not discouraged by carriston who speaking as if his faith in the bodily existence of the man whose portrait lay in my hand was unassailable said i noticed that his general appearance was that of a countryman an english peasant so in the country i shall find my love moreover it will be easy to identify the man as the top joint is missing from the middle finger of his right hand as it lay on madeline's arm i noticed that i argued with him no more i felt that words would be but wasted ix a day or two after i had witnessed what i must call carriston's second seizure we were favored with a visit from the man whose services we had secured to trace madeline since he had received his instructions we had heard nothing of his proceeding until he now called to report progress in person carriston had not expressed the slightest curiosity as to where the man was or what he was about probably he looked upon the employment of this private detective as nothing more useful than a salve to my conscience that madeline was only to be found through the power which he professed to hold of seeing her in his visions was i felt certain becoming a rooted belief of his whenever i expressed my surprise that our agent had brought or sent no information carriston shrugged his shoulders and assured me that from the first he knew the man's researches would be fruitless however the fellow had called at last and i hoped had brought us good news he was a glib tongued man who spoke in a confident matter of fact way when he saw us he rubbed his hands as one who had brought affairs to a successful issue and now meant to reap praise and other rewards his whole bearing told me he had made an important discovery so i begged him to be seated and give us his news carriston gave him a careless glance and stood at some little distance from us he looked as if he thought the impending communication scarcely worth the trouble of listening to he might indeed from his looks have been the most disinterested person of the three he even left me to do the questioning now then mr sharpe i said let us hear if you have earned your money i think so sir replied sharpe looking curiously at carriston who strange to say heard this answer with supreme indifference i think i may say i have sir continued the detective that is if the gentlemen can identify these articles as being the young lady's property thereupon he produced from a thick letter case a ribbon in which was stuck a silver pin mounted with scotch pebbles an ornament that i remembered having seen madeline wear mr sharpe handed them to carriston he examined them and i saw his cheeks flush and his eyes grow bright how did you come by this he cried pointing to the silver ornament i'll tell you presently sir do you recognize it i gave it to miss rowan myself then we are on the right track i cried joyfully go on mr sharpe yes gentlemen we are certainly on the right track but after all it isn't my fault if the track don't lead exactly where you wish you see when i heard of this mysterious disappearance of the lady i began to concoct my own theory i said to myself when a young and beautiful confound your theories cried carriston fiercely go on with your tale the man gave his interrupter a spiteful glance well sir he said as you gave me strict instructions to watch a certain gentleman closely i obeyed those instructions of course although i knew i was on a fool's errand will you go on cried carriston if you know where miss rowan is say so your money will be paid you the moment i find her i don't say i exactly know where to find the lady but i can soon know if you wish me to tell your tale your own way but as shortly as possible i said seeing that my excitable friend was preparing for another outburst i found there was nothing to be gained by keeping watch on the gentleman you mentioned sir so i went to scotland and tried back from there as soon as i worked on my own lay i found out all about it the lady went from callendar to edinburgh from edinburgh to london from london to folkestone and from folkestone to boulong i glanced at carriston all his calmness seemed to have returned he was leaning against the mantelpiece and appeared quite unmoved by mr sharpe's clear statement as to the route madeline had taken of course continued mr sharpe i was not quite certain i was tracking the right person although her description corresponded with the likeness you gave me but as you are sure this article of jewelry belonged to the lady you want the matter is beyond a doubt of course i said seeing that carriston had no intention of speaking where did you find it it was left behind in a bedroom of one of the principal hotels in folkestone i did go over to boulong but after that i thought i had learned all you would care to know there was something in the man's manner which made me dread what was coming again i looked at carriston his lips were curved with contempt but he still kept silence why not have pursued your inquiries past boulong i asked for this reason sir i had learned enough the theory i had concocted was the right one after all the lady went to edinburgh alone right enough but she didn't leave edinburgh alone nor she didn't leave london alone nor she didn't stay at folkestone where i found the pin alone nor she didn't go to boulong alone she was accompanied by a young gentleman who called himself mr smith and what's more she called herself mrs smith perhaps she was as they lived like man and wife whether the fellow was right or mistaken this explanation of madeline's disappearance seemed to give me what i can only compare to a smack in the face i stared at the speaker in speechless astonishment if the tale he told so glibly and circumstantially was true farewell so far as i was concerned to belief in the love or purity of women madeline rowan that creature of a poet's dream on the eve of her marriage with charles carriston to fly whether wed or unwed mattered little with another man and yet she was but a woman carriston or carr as she only knew him was in her eyes poor the companion of her flight might have won her with gold such things have been still my rapid and wrongful meditations were cut short in an unexpected way suddenly i saw mr sharpe dragged bodily out of his chair and thrown on the floor while carriston standing over him thrashed the man vigorously with his own ash stick a convenient weapon so convenient that i felt mr sharpe could not have selected a stick more appropriate for his own chastisement so carriston seemed to think for he laid on cheerfully some eight or ten good cutting strokes nevertheless being a respectable doctor and a man of peace i was compelled to interfere i held carriston's arm while mr sharpe struggled to his feet and after collecting his hat and his pocket book stood glaring vengefully at his assailant and rubbing the while such of the weals on his back as he could reach annoyed as i felt at the unprofessional fracas i could scarcely help laughing at the man's appearance i doubt the possibility of any one looking heroic after such a thrashing i'll have the law for this he growled i ain't paid to be beaten by a madman you're paid to do my work not another's said carriston go to the man who has over bribed you and sent you to tell me your lies go to him tell him that once more he has failed out of my sight as carriston showed signs of recommencing hostile operations the man flew as far as the door way there being in comparative safety he turned with a malignant look you'll smart for this he said when they lock you up as a raving lunatic i'll try and get a post as keeper i was glad to see that carriston paid no attention to this parting shaft he turned his back scornfully and the fellow left the room and the house now are you convinced asked carriston turning to me convinced of what that his tale is untrue or that he has been misled i am quite certain tush that is not worth consideration don't you see that ralph has done all this i set that man to watch him he found out the espionage suborned my agent or your agent i should say sent him here with a trumped up tale oh yes i was to believe that madeline had deserted me that was to drive me out of my senses my cousin is a fool after all without further proof i cannot believe that your suspicions are correct i said but i must own i spoke with some hesitation proof a clever man like you ought to see ample proof in the fact of that wretch having twice called me a madman i have seen him but once before you know if i then gave him any grounds for making such an assertion tell me from whom could he have learned the word except from ralph carriston i was bound if only to save my own reputation for sagacity to confess that the point noted by carriston had raised certain doubts in my mind but if ralph carriston really was trying by some finely wrought scheme to bring about what he desired there was all the more reason for great caution to be exercised i am sorry you beat him i said he will now swear right and left that you are not in your senses of course he will what do i care only remember this it is easier to get put into an asylum than to get out of it it is not so very easy for a sane man like myself to be put in especially when he is on his guard i have looked up the law there must be a certificate signed by two doctors surgeons or i believe apothecaries will do who have seen the supposed lunatic alone and together i'll take very good care i speak to no doctor save yourself and keep out of the way of surgeons and apothecaries it quite cheered me to hear him speaking so sensibly and collectedly about himself but i again impressed upon him the need of great caution although i could not believe that his cousin had taken madeline away i was inclined to think after the affair with the spy that as carriston averred he aimed at getting him sane or insane into a mad house but after all these days we were not a step nearer to the discovery of madeline's whereabouts carriston made no sign of doing anything to facilitate that discovery again i urged him to intrust the whole affair to the police again he refused to do so adding that he was not quite ready ready for what i wondered x i must confess in spite of my affection for carriston i felt inclined to rebel against the course which matters were taking i was a prosaic matter of fact medical man doing my work to the best of my ability and anxious when that work was done that my hours of leisure should be as free from worry and care as possible with carriston's advent several disturbing elements entered into my quiet life let ralph carriston be guilty or innocent of the extraordinary crime which his cousin laid at his door i felt that he was anxious to obtain possession of the supposed lunatic's person it would suit his purposes for his cousin to be proved mad i did not believe that even if the capture was legally effected carriston's liberation would be a matter of great difficulty so long as he remained in his present state of mind so long as i a doctor of some standing could go into the witness box and swear to his sanity but my old dread was always with me the dread that any further shock would overturn the balance of his sensitive mind so it was that every hour that carriston was out of my sight was fraught with anxiety if ralph carriston was really as unscrupulous as my friend supposed if he had really as seemed almost probable suborned our agent he might by some crafty trick obtain the needful certificate and some day i should come home and find carriston had been removed in such a case i foresaw great trouble and distress besides after all that had occurred it was as much as i could do to believe that carriston was not mad any doctor who knew what i knew would have given the verdict against him after dismissing his visions and hallucinations with the contempt which they deserved the fact of a man who was madly passionately in love with a woman and who believed that she had been entrapped and was still kept in restraint sitting down quietly and letting day after day pass without making an effort toward finding her was in itself prima facie evidence of insanity a sane man would at once have set all the engines of detection at work i felt that if once ralph carriston obtained possession of him he could make out a strong case in his own favor first of all the proposed marriage out of the defendant's own sphere of life the passing under a false name the ridiculous or apparently ridiculous accusation made against his kinsman the murderous threats the chastisement of his own paid agent who brought him a report which might not seem at all untrue to any one who knew not madeline rowan leaving out the question what might be wrung from me in cross examination ralph carriston had a strong case and i knew that once in his power my friend might possibly be doomed to pass years if not his whole life under restraint so i was anxious very anxious and i felt an anxiety scarcely second to that which prevailed on carriston's account as to the fate of madeline granting for sake of argument that carriston's absurd conviction that no bodily harm had as yet been done her was true i felt sure that she with her scarcely less sensitive nature must feel the separation from her lover as much as he himself felt the separation from her once or twice i tried to comfort myself with cynicism tried to persuade myself that a young woman could not in our days be spirited away that she had gone by her own free will that there was a man who had at the eleventh hour alienated her affections from carriston but i could not bring myself to believe this so i was placed between the horns of a dilemma if madeline had not fled of her own free will some one must have taken her away and if so our agent's report was a coined one and if a coined one issued at ralph's instance therefore ralph must be the prime actor in the mystery but in sober moments such a deduction seemed an utter absurdity although i have said that carriston was doing nothing toward clearing up the mystery i wronged him in so saying after his own erratic way he was at work at such work too i really lost all patience with him he shut himself up in his room out of which he scarcely stirred for three days by that time he had completed a large and beautiful drawing of his imaginary man this he took to a well known photographer's and ordered several hundred small photographs of it to be prepared as soon as possible the minute description which he had given me of his fanciful creation was printed at the foot of each copy as soon as the first batch of these precious photographs was sent home to my great joy he did what he should have done days ago yielded to my wishes and put the matter into the hands of the police i was glad to find that in giving details of what had happened he said nothing about the advisability of keeping a watch on ralph carriston's proceedings he did indeed offer an absurdly large reward for the discovery of the missing girl and moreover gave the officer in charge of the case a packet of photographs of his phantom man telling him in the gravest manner that he knew the original of that likeness had something to do with the disappearance of miss rowan the officer who thought the portrait was that of a natural being took his instructions in good faith although he seemed greatly surprised when he heard that carriston knew neither the name nor the occupation in fact knew nothing concerning the man who was to be sought for however as carriston assured him that finding this man would insure the reward as much as if he found madeline the officer readily promised to combine the two tasks little knowing what waste of time any attempt to perform the latter must be two days after this carriston came to me i shall leave you to morrow he said where are you going i asked why do you leave i am going to travel about i have no intention of letting ralph get hold of me so i mean to go from place to place until i find madeline be careful i urged i shall be careful enough i'll take care that no doctors surgeons or even apothecaries get on my track i shall go just as the fit seizes me if i can't say one day where i shall be the next it will be impossible for that villain to know this was not a bad argument in fact if he carried out his resolve of passing quickly from place to place i did not see how he could plan anything more likely to defeat the intentions with which we credited his cousin as to his finding madeline by so doing that was another matter his idea seemed to be that chance would sooner or later bring him in contact with the man of his dream however now that the search had been intrusted to the proper persons his own action in the matter was not worth troubling about i gave him many cautions he was to be quiet and guarded in words and manner he was not to converse with strangers if he found himself dogged or watched by any one he was to communicate at once with me but above all i begged him not to yield again to his mental infirmity the folly of a man who could avoid it throwing himself into such a state ought to be apparent to him not oftener than i can help was all the promise i could get from him but see her i must sometimes or i shall die i had now given up as hopeless the combat with his peculiar idiosyncrasy so with many expressions of gratitude on his part we bade each other farewell during his absence he wrote to me nearly every day so that i might know his whereabouts in case i had any news to communicate but i had none the police failed to find the slightest clew i had been called upon by them once or twice in order that they might have every grain of information i could give i took the liberty of advising them not to waste their time in looking for the man as his very existence was problematical it was but a fancy of my friend's and not worth thinking seriously about i am not sure but what after hearing this they did not think the whole affair was an imagined one and so relaxed their efforts once or twice carriston happening to be in the neighborhood of london came to see me and slept the night at my house he also had no news to report still he seemed hopeful as ever the weeks went by until christmas was over and the new year begun but no sign word or trace of madeline rowan i have seen her wrote carriston several times she is in the same place unhappy but not ill treated evidently his hallucinations were still in full force at first i intended that the whole of this tale should be told by myself but upon getting so far it struck me that the evidence of another actor who played an important part in the drama would give certain occurrences to the reader at first instead of at second hand so i wrote to my friend dick fenton of frenchay gloucestershire and begged him if he found himself capable of so doing to put in simple narrative form his impressions of certain events which happened in january events in which we two were concerned he has been good enough to comply with my request his communication follows part ii told by richard fenton of frenchay gloucestershire esquire i as my old friend phil brand has asked me to do this i suppose i must brand is a right good fellow and a clever fellow but has plenty of crotchets of his own the worst i know of him is that he insists upon having his own with people with those who differ from him he is as obstinate as a mule anyhow he has always had his own way with me this custom so far as i am concerned commenced years ago when we were boys at school together and i have never been able to shake off the bad habit of giving in to him he has promised to see that my queen's english is presentable for to tell the truth i am more at home across country than across foolscap and my fingers know the feel of the reins or the trigger better than that of the pen all the same i hope he won't take too many liberties with my style bad though it may be for old brand at times is apt to get well a bit prosy to hear him on the subject of hard work and the sanctity thereof approaches the sublime what freak took me to the little god forsaken village of midcombe in the depth of winter is entirely between myself and my conscience the cause having no bearing upon the matters i am asked to tell you about is no one's business but mine i will only say that now i would not stay in such a place at such a time of the year for the sake of the prettiest girl in the world let alone the bare chance of meeting her once or twice but one's ideas change i am now a good bit older ride some two stones heavier and have been married ever so many years perhaps after all as i look back i can find some excuse for being such an ass as to endure for more than a fortnight all the discomforts heaped upon me in that little village inn a man who sojourns in such a hole as midcombe must give some reason for doing so my ostensible reason was hunting i had a horse with me and a second rate subscription pack of slow going mongrels did meet somewhere in the neighborhood so no one could gainsay my explanation but if hunting was my object i got precious little of it a few days after my arrival a bitter biting frost set in a frost as black as your hat and as hard as nails yet still i stayed on from private information received no matter how when or where i knew that some people in the neighborhood had organized a party to go skating on a certain day at lilymere a fine sheet of water some distance from midcombe i guessed that some one whom i particularly desired to meet would be there and as the skating at lilymere was free to any one who chose to take the trouble of getting to such an out of the way place i hired a horse and an apology for a dog cart and at ten in the morning started to drive the twelve miles to the pond i took no one with me i had been to lilymere once before in bright summer weather so fancied i knew the way well enough the sky when i started was cloudy the wind was chopping round in a way which made the effete rustic old hostler predict a change of weather he was right before i had driven two miles light snow began to fall and by the time i reached a little wretched wayside inn about a mile from the mere a film of white covered the whole country i stabled my horse as well as i could then taking my skates with me walked down to the pond now whether i had mistaken the day or whether the threatening fall of snow had made certain people change their minds i don't know but to my annoyance and vexation no skaters were to be seen and moreover the uncut white surface told me that none had been on the pond that morning still hoping they might come in spite of the weather i put on my skates and went outside edging and grape vining all over the place but as there was no person in particular in fact no one at all to note my powers i soon got tired it was indeed dreary dreary work but i waited and hoped until the snow came down so fast and furiously that i felt sure that waiting was in vain and that i had driven to lilymere for nothing back i went to the little inn utterly disgusted with things in general and feeling that to break some one's head would be a relief to me in my present state of mind of course a sensible man would at once have got his horse between the shafts and driven home but whatever i may be now in those days i was not a sensible man brand will i know cordially indorse this remark the accommodation of the inn was not such as to induce one to linger within its precincts but the fire was a right good one and a drink which i skilfully manufactured out of some hot beer not to be despised and proved warming to the body and soothing to the ruffled temper so i lingered over the big fire until i began to feel hungry and upon the landlady assuring me that she could cook a rasher decided it would be wiser to stay where i was until the violence of the snowstorm was over for coming down it was now and no mistake and it kept on coming down about half past three when i sorrowfully decided i was bound to make a move it was snowing faster than ever i harnessed my horse and laughing at the old woman's dismal prophecy that i should never get to midcombe in such weather gathered up the reins and away i went along the white road i thought i knew the way well enough in fact i had always prided myself upon remembering any road once driven over by me but does any one who has not tried it really know how a heavy fall of snow changes the aspect of the country and makes landmarks snares and delusions i learned all about it then once and for all i found also that the snow lay much deeper than i thought could possibly be in so short a time and it still fell in a manner almost blinding yet i went on bravely and merrily for some miles then came a bit of uncertainty which of those two roads was the right one this one of course no the other there was no house near no one was likely to be passing in such weather so i was left to exercise my free unbiased choice a privilege i would willingly have dispensed with however i made the best selection i could and followed it for some two miles then i began to grow doubtful and soon persuading myself that i was on the wrong track retraced my steps i was by this time something like a huge white plaster of paris figure and the snow which had accumulated on the old dog cart made it run heavier by half a ton more or less by the time i came to that unlucky junction of roads at which my misfortune began it was almost dark the sky as black as a tarpaulin yet sending down the white feathery flakes thicker and faster than ever i felt inclined to curse my folly in attempting such a drive at any rate i blamed myself for not having started two or three hours earlier i'll warrant that steady going old brand never had to accuse himself of such foolishness as mine well i took the other road went on some way came to a turning which i seemed to remember and not without misgivings followed it my misgivings increased when after a little while i found the road grew full of ruts which the snow and the darkness quite concealed from me until the wheels got into them evidently i was wrong again i was just thinking of making the best of my way out of this rough and unfrequented road when there i don't know how it happened such things seldom occur to me a stumble a fall on the part of my tired horse sent me flying over the dashboard with the only consoling thought that the reins were still in my hand luckily the snow had made the falling pretty soft i soon picked myself up and set about estimating damages with some difficulty i got the horse out of the harness and then felt free to inspect the dog cart alas after the manner of the two wheel kind whenever a horse thinks fit to fall one shaft had snapped off like a carrot so here was i five miles apparently from anywhere in the thick of a blinding snow storm left standing helpless beside a jaded horse and a broken cart i should like to know what brand would have done under the circumstances as for me i reflected for some minutes reflection in a snow storm is weary work i reasoned i believe logically and at last came to this decision i would follow the road if as i suspected it was but a cart track it would probably soon lead to a habitation of some kind anyway i had better try a bit further i took hold of the wearied horse and with snow under my feet snow flakes whirling round me and a wind blowing right into my teeth struggled on it was a journey i think i must have been three quarters of an hour going about a quarter of a mile i was just beginning to despair when i saw a welcome gleam of light i steered toward it fondly hoping that my troubles were at an end i found the light stole through the ill fitting window shutters of what seemed so far as i could make out in the darkness to be a small farm house tying to a gate the knotted reins by which i had been leading the horse i staggered up to the door and knocked loudly upon my honor until i leaned against that door post i had no idea how tired i was until that moment i never suspected that the finding of speedy shelter meant absolutely saving my life covered from head to foot with snow my hat crushed in i must have been a pitiable object no answer came to my first summons it was only after a second and more imperative application of my heel that the door deigned to give way a few inches through the aperture a woman's voice asked who was there let me in i said i have missed my way to midcombe my horse has fallen you must give me shelter for the night open the door and let me in shelter you can't get shelter here mister said a man's gruff voice this ain't an inn so you'd best be off and go elsewhere but i must come in i said astonished at such inhospitality i can't go a step further open the door at once you be hanged said the man 'tis my house not yours but you fool i mean to pay you well for your trouble don't you know it means death wandering about on such a night as this let me in you won't come in here was the brutal and boorish reply the door closed that i was enraged at such incivility may be easily imagined but if i said i was thoroughly frightened i believe no one would be surprised as getting into that house meant simply life or death to me into that house i determined to get by door or window by fair means or by foul so as the door closed i hurled myself against it with all the might i could muster although i ride much heavier now than i did then all my weight at that time was bone and muscle the violence of my attack tore from the lintel the staple which held the chain the door went back with a bang and i fell forward into the house fully resolved to stay there whether welcome or unwelcome ii the door through which i had burst like a battering ram opened straight into a sort of kitchen so although i entered in a most undignified way in fact on my hands and knees i was well established in the centre of the room before the man and woman emerged from behind the door where my successful assault had thrown them i stood up and faced them they were a couple of ordinary respectably attired country people the man a sturdy strong built bull necked rascal stood scowling at me and i concluded making up his mind as to what course to pursue my good people i said you are behaving in the most unheard of manner can't you understand that i mean to pay you well for any trouble i give you but whether you like it or not here i stay to night to turn me out would be sheer murder so saying i pulled off my overcoat and began shaking the snow out of my whiskers i dare say my determined attitude my respectable as well as my muscular appearance impressed my unwilling hosts anyway they gave in without more ado whilst the woman shut the door through which the snow flakes were whirling the man said sullenly well you'll have to spend the night on a chair we've no beds here for strangers 'specially those as ain't wanted very well my friend having settled the matter you may as well make yourself pleasant go out and put my horse under cover and give him a feed of some sort make a mash if you can after giving the woman a quick glance as of warning my scowling host lit a horn lantern and went on the errand i suggested i gladly sank into a chair and warmed myself before a cheerful fire the prospect of spending the night amid such discomfort was not alluring but i had at least a roof over my head as a rule the more churlish the nature the more avaricious it is found to be my promise of liberal remuneration was after all not without its effect upon the strange couple whose refusal to afford me refuge had so nearly endangered my life they condescended to get me some tea and rough food after i had disposed of all that the man produced a bottle of gin we filled our glasses and then with the aid of my pipe i settled down to make the best of a night spent in a hard wooden chair i had come across strange people in my travels but i have no hesitation in saying that my host was the sullenest sulkiest most boorish specimen of human nature i had as yet met with in spite of his recent ill treatment of me i was quite ready to establish matters on a friendly footing and made several attempts to draw him into conversation the brute would only answer in monosyllables or often not answer at all so i gave up talking as a bad job and sat in silence smoking and looking into the fire thinking a good deal it may be of some one i should have met that morning at lilymere had the wretched snow but kept off the long clock that cumbrous eight day machine which inevitably occupies one corner of every cottager's kitchen struck nine the woman rose and left us i concluded she was going to bed if so i envied her her husband showed no sign of retiring he still sat over the fire opposite me by this time i was dreadfully tired every bone in my body ached the hard chair which an hour or two ago seemed all i could desire now scarcely came up to my ideas of the comfort i was justly entitled to claim my sulky companion had been drinking silently but steadily perhaps the liquor he had poured into himself might have rendered his frame of mind more pleasant and amenable to reason my good fellow i said your chairs are excellent ones of the kind but deucedly uncomfortable i am horribly tired if the resources of your establishment can't furnish a bed for me to sleep in couldn't you find a mattress or something to lay down before the fire you've got all you'll get to night he answered knocking the ashes out his pipe oh but i say so do i say i say this if you don't like it you can leave it we didn't ask you to come you infernal beast i muttered and meant it too i declare had i not been so utterly worn out i would have had that bullet headed ruffian up for a few rounds on his own kitchen floor and tried to knock him into a more amiable frame of mind never mind i said but remember civility costs nothing and often gets rewarded however if you wish to retire to your own couch don't let your native politeness stand in your way pray don't hesitate on my account leave plenty of fuel and i shall manage until morning where you stay i stay he answered then he filled his pipe and once more relapsed into stony silence i bothered about him no more i dozed off for a few minutes woke dozed off again for some hours i was in an uncomfortable sort of half sleep crammed full of curious dreams dreams from which i started wondering where i was and how i got there i even began to grow nervous all sorts of horrible travellers' tales ran through my head it was in just such places as this that unsuspecting voyagers were stated to have been murdered and robbed by just such unmitigated ruffians as my host i can tell you that altogether i spent a most pleasant night to make matters worse and more dismal the storm still raged outside the wind moaned through the trees but it had again changed and i knew from the sound on the window panes that heavy rain had succeeded snow as the big drops of water found their way down the large old fashioned chimney the fire hissed and spluttered like a spiteful vixen everything combined to deprive me of what dog's sleep i could by sheer persistency snatch i think i tried every position which an ordinary man not an acrobat is capable of adopting with the assistance of a common wooden chair i even lay down on the hard flags i actually tried the table i propped up the upper half of my body against the corner walls of the room but found no rest at last i gave up all idea of sleeping and fully aroused myself i comforted myself by saying that my misery was only temporary that the longest night must come to an end my companion had by now succumbed to fatigue or to the combined effects of fatigue and gin and water his head was hanging sideways and he slept in a most uncomfortable attitude i chuckled as i looked at him feeling quite sure that if such a clod was capable of dreaming at all his dreams must be worse even than mine i filled another pipe poked the smoldering logs into a blaze and sat almost nose and knees over the fire finding some amusement in speculating upon the condition of the churl before me and thanking the lord i was not like unto this man suddenly an idea flashed across me i had seen this fellow before but when or where i could not remember his features as i looked at them with keener interest seemed to grow more and more familiar to me where could i have met him somewhere or other but where i racked my brain to associate him with some scene some event although he was but an ordinary countryman such as one sees scores of in a day's ride only differing from his kind on account of his unpleasant face i felt sure we were old acquaintances when he awoke for a moment and changed his strained attitude my feeling grew stronger and stronger yet puzzle and puzzle as i would i could not call to mind a former encounter so at last i began to think the supposed recognition was pure fancy on my part having smoked out several pipes i thought that a cigar would be a slight break to the monotony of the night's proceedings so i drew out my case and looked at its contents among the weeds was one of a lighter color than the others as i took it out i said to myself why old brand gave me that one when i was last at his house curiously enough that cigar was the missing link in the chain of my memory as i held it in my hand i knew at once why my host's ugly face seemed familiar to me about a fortnight before being in town i had spent the evening with the doctor he was not alone and i was introduced to a tall pale young man named carriston he was a pleasant polite young fellow although not much in my line at first i judged him to be a would be poet of the fashionable miserable school but finding that he and brand talked so much about art i eventually decided that he was one of the doctor's many artist friends art is a hobby he hacks about on grandly mem brand's own attempt at pictures are simply atrocious just before i left carriston the doctor's back being turned asked me to step into another room there he showed me the portrait of a man it seemed very cleverly drawn and i presumed he wanted me to criticise it i am a precious bad judge i said i am not asking you to pass an opinion said carriston i want to beg a favor of you i am almost ashamed to beg it on so short an acquaintance he seemed modest and not in want of money so i encouraged him to proceed i heard you say you were going into the country he resumed i want to ask you if by any chance you should meet the original of that drawing to telegraph at once to dr brand whereabouts does he live i have no idea if chance throws him in your way please do as i ask certainly i will i said seeing the young man made the request in solemn earnest he thanked me and then gave me a small photograph of the picture this photograph he begged me to keep in my pocket book so that i might refer to it in case i met the man he wanted i put it there went my way and am sorry to say forget all about it had it not been for the strange cigar in my case bringing back carriston's unusual request to my mind the probabilities are that i should not have thought again of the matter now by a remarkable coincidence i was spending the night with the very man who so far as my memory served me must have sat for the portrait shown me at brand's house i wonder what i did with the photo i said i turned out my letter case there it was right enough shading it with one hand i carefully compared it with the sleeper not a doubt about it so far as a photograph taken from a picture can go it was the man himself the same ragged beard the same coarse features the same surly look young carriston was evidently a wonderful hand at knocking off a likeness moreover in case i had felt any doubt in the matter a printed note at the bottom of the photograph said that one joint was missing from a right hand finger sure enough my friend lacked that small portion of his misbegotten frame this discovery threw me in an ecstasy of delight i laughed so loudly that i almost awoke the ruffian i guessed i was going to take a glorious revenge for all the discomforts i had suffered no one i felt sure could be looking for such a fellow as this to do any good to him i was quite happy in the thought and for the remainder of the night gloated over the idea of putting a spoke in the wheel of one who had been within an ace of causing my death i resolved the moment i got back to civilization to send the desired intelligence to brand and hope for the best iii the end of that wretched night came at last when the welcome morning broke i found that a great change had taken place out of doors the fierce snow storm had been the farewell of the frost the heavy rain that followed had filled the roads with slushy and rapidly thawing snow i managed to extort some of a breakfast from my host then having recompensed him according to my promise not his deserts started as soon as i could on the bare back of my unfortunate steed for midcombe which place after my night's experience seemed gifted with merits not its own i was surprised upon leaving the house to find it was of larger dimensions than from the little i saw of it during the night i had imagined it was altogether a better class of residence than i had supposed my surly friend accompanied me until he had placed me on the main road where i could make no possible mistake he was kind enough to promise to assist any one i might send out in getting the dog cart once more under way then with a hearty wish on my part that i might never again meet with his like we parted i found my way to midcombe without much trouble i took off my things had a wash and like a sensible man for once went to bed but i did not forget to send a boy straight off to the nearest telegraph station my message to brand was a brief one it simply said tell your friend i have found his man this duty done i dismissed all speculation as to the result from my mind and settled down to make up arrears of sleep i was surprised at the reply received that same evening from brand we shall be with you as soon as we can get down to morrow meet us at station from this it was clear that my friend was wanted particularly all the better i turned to the time table and found that owing to changes and delays they could not get to c the nearest station to midcombe until three o'clock in the afternoon i inquired about the crippled dog cart it had been brought in so i left strict instructions that a shaft of some sort was to be rigged in time for me to drive over the next day and meet the doctor and his friend they came as promised it was a comfort to see friends of any description so i gave them a hearty welcome carriston took hold of both my hands and shook them so warmly that i began to feel i had discovered a long lost father of his in my friend i had almost forgotten the young fellow's appearance or he looked a very different man to day from the one i had seen when last we met then he was a wan pensive romantic poetical looking sort of fellow now he seemed full of energy vitality and grit poor old brand looked as serious as an undertaker engaged in burying his own mother carriston began to question me but brand stopped him you promised i should make inquiries first he said then he turned to me look here richard when he calls me richard i know he is fearfully in earnest i believe you have brought us down on a fool's errand but let us go to some place where we can talk together for a few minutes i lead them across the road to the railway inn we entered a room and having for the sake of appearances ordered a little light refreshment told the waiter to shut the door from the outside brand settled down with the air of a cross examining counsel i expected to see him pull out a new testament and put me on my oath now richard he said before we go further i want to know your reasons for thinking this man about whom you telegraphed is carriston's man as you call him reasons why of course he is the man carriston gave me his photograph the likeness is indisputable leaving the finger joint out of the question here carriston looked at my cross examiner triumphantly the meaning of that look i have never to this hour understood but i laughed because i knew old brand had for once made a mistake and was going to be called to account for it carriston was about to speak but the doctor waved him aside now richard think very carefully you speak of the missing finger joint we doctors know how many people persuade themselves into all sorts of thing tell me did you notice the likeness before you saw the mutilated finger or did the fact of the finger's being mutilated bring the likeness to your mind bless the man i said one would think i had no eyes i tell you there is no doubt about this man being the original of the photo never mind answer my question well then i am ashamed to confess it but i put the photo in my pocket and forgot all about it until i had recognized the man and pulled out the likeness to make sure i didn't even know there was a printed description at the foot nor that any member was wanting confound it brand i'm not such a duffer as you think brand did not retaliate he turned to his friend and said gravely to me the matter is inexplicable take your own course as i promised you should then he sat down looking deliciously crest fallen and wearing the discontented expression always natural to him when worsted in argument it was now carriston's turn he plied me with many questions in fact i gave him the whole history of my adventure what kind of house is it he asked better than a cottage scarcely a farm house a place i should think with a few miserable acres of bad land belonging to it one of those wretched little holdings which are simply curses to the country he made lots of other inquiries the purport of which i could not then divine he seemed greatly impressed when i told him that the man had never for a moment left me alone he shot a second glance of triumph at brand who still kept silent and looked as if all the wind had been taken out of his sails how far is the place asked carriston could you drive me there after dark at this question the doctor returned to life what do you mean to do he asked his friend let us have no nonsense even now i feel sure that fenton is mislead by some chance resemblance deuce a bit old chap i said well whether or not we needn't do foolish things we must go and swear information and get a search warrant and the assistance of the police the truth is richard he continued turning to me we have reason to believe or i should say carriston persists in fancying that a friend of his has for some time been kept in durance by the man whom you say you recognized likely enough i said he looked villain enough for anything up to murder anyway said brand we must do everything according to law law i want no law answered carriston i have found her as i knew i should find her i shall simply fetch her and at once you can come with me or stay here as you like doctor but i am afraid i must trouble your friend to drive me somewhere near the place he speaks of foreseeing an adventure and great fun moreover not unmoved by thoughts of revenge i placed myself entirely at carriston's disposal he expressed his gratitude and suggested that we should start at once in a few minutes we were ready and mounted the dog cart brand after grumbling loudly at the whole proceeding finished up by following us and installing himself in the back seat carriston placed a parcel he carried inside the cart and away we went it was now nearly dark and raining cats and dogs i had my lamps lighted so we got along without much difficulty the roads were deep with mud but by this time the snow had been pretty nearly washed away from everywhere i don't make a mistake in a road twice so in due course we reached the scene of my upset here i drew up the house lies about five hundred yards up the lane i told carriston we had better get out here what about the horse asked brand no chance of any one passing this way on such a night as this so let us put out the lamps and tie him up somewhere we did so then struggled on afoot until we saw the gleam of light which had been so welcomed by me two nights before it was just about as dark as pitch but guided by the light we went on until we stood in front of the house where a turf bank and a dry hedge hid us from sight although on such a night we had little fear of our presence being discovered what do you mean to do now asked brand in a discontented whisper you can't break into the house carriston said nothing for a minute then i felt him place his hand on my shoulder are there any horses any cows about the place he asked i told him i thought that my surly friend rejoiced in the possession of a horse and a cow very well then we must wait he'll come out to see to them before he goes to bed said carriston as decidedly as a general giving orders just before a battle i could not see how brand expressed his feelings upon hearing this order from our commander i know i shrugged my shoulders and if i said nothing i thought a deal the present situation was all very well for a strongly interested party like carriston but he could scarcely expect others to relish the prospect of waiting it might be for hours under that comfortless hedge we were all wet to the skin and although i was extremely anxious to see the end of the expedition and find poetical justice meted out to my late host carriston's fabian tactics lacked the excitement i longed for brand in spite of his disapproval of the whole course of action was better off than i was as a doctor he must have felt sure that provided he could survive the exposure he would secure two fresh patients however we made no protest but waited for events to develop themselves iv more than half an hour went by i was growing numbed and tired and beginning to think that we were making asses of ourselves when i heard the rattle of a chain and felt carriston give my arm a warning touch no doubt my late host had made sure that his new door fastenings were equal to a stronger test than that to which i had subjected the former ones so we were wise in not attempting to carry his castle by force the door opened and closed again i saw the feeble glimmer of a lantern moving toward the out house in which my horse had been stabled i heard a slight rustling in the hedge and stretching out my arm found that carriston had left my side in the absence of any command from him i did not follow but resumed the old occupation waiting in a few minutes the light of the lantern reappeared the bearer stood on the threshold of the house while i wondered what carriston was doing just as the door was opened for the boor's readmittance a dark figure sprung upon him i heard a fierce oath and cry of surprise then the lantern flew out of the man's hand and he and his assailant tumbled struggling through the narrow door way hurrah the door is won anyway i shouted as followed closely by the doctor i jumped over the hedge and rushed to the scene of the fray although carriston's well conceived attack was so vigorous and unexpected that the man went down under it although our leader utilized the advantage he had gained in a proper and laudable manner by bumping that thick bullet head as violently as he could against the flags on which it lay i doubt if after all he could have done his work alone the countryman was a muscular brute and carriston but a stripling however our arrival speedily settled the question bind him panted carriston there is a cord in my pocket he appeared to have come quite prepared for contingencies whilst carriston still embraced his prostrate foe and brand to facilitate matters knelt on his shoulders sat on his head or did something else useful i drew out from the first pocket i tried a nice length of half inch line and had the immense satisfaction of trussing up my scowling friend in a most workmanlike manner he must have felt those turns on his wrists for days afterward yet when we were at last at liberty to rise and leave him lying helpless on his kitchen floor i considered i exercised great self denial in not bestowing a few kicks upon him as he swore at us in the broadest vernacular in a way which under the circumstances was no doubt a great comfort to him we scarcely noticed the man's wife while we rendered her husband helpless as we entered she attempted to fly out but brand with a promptitude which i am glad to record intercepted her closed the door turned and pocketed the key after that the woman sat on the floor and rocked herself to and fro for some moments while recovering his breath carriston stood and positively glared at his prostrate foe at last he found words where is she where is the key you hound he thundered out stooping over the fellow and shaking him with a violence which did my heart good as he received no answers save the unrecordable expressions above mentioned we unbuttoned the wretch's pockets and searched those greasy receptacles among the usual litter we did certainly find a key carriston snatched at it and shouting madeline madeline i come rushed out of the room like a maniac leaving brand and me to keep guard over our prisoners i filled a pipe lit it and then came back to my fallen foe i say old chap i said stirring him gently with the toe of my boot this will be a lesson to you remember i told you that civility costs nothing if you had given me christian bed accommodation instead of making me wear out my poor bones on that infernal chair you could have jogged along in your rascality quite comfortably so far as i am concerned he was very ungrateful so much so that my desire to kick him was intensified i should not like to swear i did not to a slight degree yield to the temptation push a handkerchief in his mouth cried brand suddenly a lady is coming with right good will i did as the doctor suggested just then carriston returned i don't want to raise home tempests yet i must say he was accompanied by the most beautiful creature my eyes have ever lighted upon true she was pale as a lily looked thin and delicate and her face bore traces of anxiety and suffering but for all that she was beautiful too beautiful for this world i thought as i looked at her she was clinging in a half frightened half confiding way to carriston and he happy fellow regardless of our presence was showering down kisses on her sweet pale face confound it i grow quite romantic as i recall the sight of those lovers a most curious young man that carriston he came to us the lovely girl on his arm without showing a trace of his recent excitement let us go now he said as calmly as if he had been taking a quiet evening drive then he turned to me do you think mr fenton you could without much trouble get the dog cart up to the house i said i would try to do so but what about these people asked brand carriston gave them a contemptuous glance leave them alone he said they are but the tools of another him i cannot touch let us go yes yes but why not verify your suspicions while you can just like brand he's always wanting to verify everything in searching for the key we had found some papers on our prisoner brand examined them and handed to carriston an envelope which contained what looked like bank notes carriston glanced at it the handwriting is of course disguised he said carelessly but the postmark shows whence it came it is as i always told you you agree with me now i am afraid i must said brand humbly but we must do something about this man he continued hereupon carriston turned to our prisoner listen you villain he said i will let you go scot free if you breathe no word of this to your employer for the next fortnight if he learns from you what has happened before that time i swear you shall go to penal servitude which do you choose i pulled out the gag and it is needless to say which the fellow chose then i went off and recovered the horse and cart i relighted the lamps and with some difficulty got the dog cart up to the house carriston having exactly anticipated the events of the night the parcel he had brought with him contained a bonnet and a thick warm cloth cloak his beautiful friend was equipped with these then leaving the woman of the house to untie her husband at her leisure and pleasure away we started the doctor sitting by me carriston and the lady behind we just managed to catch the last train from c not feeling sure as to what form inquiries might take to morrow i thought it better to go up to town with my friends so as we passed through midcombe i stopped paid my bill and gave instructions for my luggage to be forwarded to me by six o'clock the next morning we were all in london dr brand in conclusion when i asked fenton to relate his experiences i did not mean him to do so at such length but there as he has written it and as writing is not a labor of love with him let it go when madeline rowan found the bed by the side of which she had thrown herself in an ecstasy of grief untenanted she knew in a moment that she was the victim of a deep laid plot being ignorant of carriston's true position in the world she could conceive no reason for the elaborate scheme which have been devised to lure her so many miles from her home and make a prisoner of her a prisoner she was not only was the door locked upon her but a slip of paper lay on the bed it bore these words no harm is meant you and in due time you will be released ask no questions make no foolish attempts at escape and you will be well treated upon reading this the girl's first thought was one of thankfulness she saw at once that the reported accident to her lover was but an invention the probabilities were that carriston was alive and in his usual health now that she felt certain of this she could bear anything from the day on which she entered that room to that on which we rescued her madeline was to all intents and purposes as close a prisoner in that lonely house on the hill side as she might have been in the deepest dungeon in the world threats entreaties promises of bribes availed nothing she was not unkindly treated that is suffered no absolute ill usage books materials for needle work and other little aids to while away time were supplied but the only living creatures she saw were the women of the house who attended to her wants and on one or two occasions the man whom carriston asserted he had seen in his trance she had suffered from the close confinement but had always felt certain that sooner or later her lover would find her and effect her deliverance now that she knew he was alive she could not be unhappy i did not choose to ask her why she had felt so certain on the above points i wished to add no more puzzles to the one which to tell the truth exercised even annoyed me more than i care to say but i did ask her if during her incarceration her jailer had ever laid his hand upon her she told me that some short time after her arrival a stranger had gained admittance to the house whilst he was there the man had entered her room held her arm and threatened her with violence if she made any outcry after hearing this i did not pursue the subject carriston and madeline were married at the earliest possible moment and left england immediately after the ceremony a week after their departure by carriston's request i forwarded the envelope found upon our prisoner to mr ralph carriston with it i sent a few lines stating where and under what peculiar circumstances we had become possessed of it i never received any reply to my communication so wild and improbable as it seems i am bound to believe that charles carriston's surmise was right that madeline was decoyed away and concealed not from any ill will toward herself but with a view to the possible baneful effect which her mysterious disappearance might work upon her lover's strange and excitable organization and i firmly believe that had he not in some inexplicable way been firmly convinced that she was alive and faithful to him the plot would have been a thorough success and charles carriston would have spent the rest of his days in an asylum both sir charles he succeeded to his title shortly after his marriage and lady carriston are now dead or i should not have ventured to relate these things concerning them they had twelve years of happiness if measured by time the period was but a short one but i feel sure that in it they enjoyed more true happiness than many others find in the course of a protracted life in word thought and deed they were as one she died in rome of fever and her husband without so far as i know any particular complaint simply followed her i was always honored with their sincerest friendship and sir charles left me sole trustee and guardian to his three sons so there are now plenty of lives between ralph carriston and his desire i am pleased to say that the boys who are as dear to me as my own children as yet show no evidence of possessing any gifts beyond nature i know that my having made this story public will cause two sets of objectors to fall equally foul of me the matter of fact prosaic man who will say that the abduction and subsequent imprisonment of madeline rowan was an absurd impossibility and the scientific man like myself who cannot dare not believe that charles carriston from neither memory nor imagination could draw a face and describe peculiarities by which a certain man could be identified i am far from saying there may not be a simple natural explanation of the puzzle but i for one have failed to find it so close this tale as i began it by saying i am a narrator and nothing more eerie tales of
