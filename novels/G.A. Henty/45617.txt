preface my dear lads there are but few words of preface needed to a story that is not historical the principal part of the tale is laid among the cowboys of the western states of america a body of men unrivalled in point of hardihood and devotion to work as well as in reckless courage and wild daring texas which twentyfive years ago was the great ranching state is no longer the home of the typical cowboy but he still exists and flourishes in new mexico and the northern states and territories the picture i have given of their life can be relied upon and its adventures and dangers are in no degree coloured as i have taken them from the lips of a near relative of my own who was for some years working as a cowboy in new mexico he was an actor in many of the scenes described and so far from my having heightened or embellished them i may say that i have given but a small proportion of the perilous adventures through which he went for had i given them in full it would i am sure have seemed to you that the story was too improbable to be true in treating of cowboy life indeed it may well be said that truth is stranger than fiction yours sincerely g a henty contents chap page i an

cowboys charged down upon the indians discovering the body of the bloodhound besieged by brigands illustration redskin and cowboy chapter i an advertisement cedar gulch was in a flourishing camp there had been some good finds by the first prospectors and a rush had of course followed in many cases first discoveries proved illusive but it was not so at cedar gulch the ground turned out well and although no extraordinary finds were made the average was good all over the bottom and there were few who were not doing fairly well the scene was a busy one several hundreds of men were hard at work on the flat which in winter was the bed of a wide stream but which in summer was a mere thread of water among the rocks scarce enough for washing purposes everywhere were piles of stones and rubbish that had been brought up from the shafts men toiled at windlasses others emptied the buckets as they came up into swinging troughs or cradles others again kept these supplied with water and swung or rocked them taking off the large stones that the motion brought to the surface while the slush and mud ran out at the lower end newcomers moved about watching the work with eager eyes wishing that they had had the luck to get there among the early arrivals and to take up a claim for every foot of ground far down the valley had already been occupied and there was now no getting into a claim except by purchasing a share or altogether buying out the present holders one of the claims that was doing best was held by three men who had worked in partnership for the last two years and who had been among the first to arrive at cedar gulch they were known among the others as english bill sim howlett and limping frank sim howlett was perhaps the leader of the party he had been one of the earliest golddiggers and was a square powerfully built man he was a man of few words but the words when spoken were forcible he was by no means quarrelsome but was one whom few cared to quarrel with even in a place where serious quarrels were of constant occurrence and where revolvers cracked so often that the sound of a fray excited but little attention english bill was a tall wiry man hot of temper but a general favourite generous with his money always ready to lend a helping hand to anyone who was down on his luck he also was a capital worker and had in spite of his rough clothes and the use of language as rough as that of his companions a certain air which told that like many others in the diggings he was a gentleman by birth why these two men should have taken up with limping frank as a comrade was a matter of surprise to those who knew them they were both men in the prime of life while he was at least ten years their senior his hair was already white his face was that of a student rather than a miner with a gentle and almost womanly expression his frame was slight and looked altogether incapable of hard work and he walked with a distinct limp the result of a bullet wound in the hip and yet there were men in the gulch who having known the trio at other diggings declared that they would rather quarrel either with english bill or sim howlett than with limping frank and as some of them were desperate fellows and noted pistol shots their report was quite sufficient to secure respect for a man who otherwise would have been regarded with pity or contempt very little of the hard work of the partnership fell upon frank he cooked looked after the shanty did what washing and mending to the clothes was necessary and occasionally came down and assisted to work the cradle and sort the stuff they generally addressed him as doctor not that he made any profession of medical knowledge but he was always ready to give his services in case of sickness and many a miner had he pulled through fevers which had it not been for his nursing and care would have proved fatal i cant make out what yer mean by saying i had best not quarrel with that little old atomy you call limping frank a big powerful fellow who had recently arrived at the camp said to one who had been talking over with him the characteristics of several of the miners i aint very pertiklar who i quarrels with but what on arth there can be in that little chap to make one keep clear of him beats me can he shoot you bet the other replied he could put a bullet plumb between your eyes ten times following the length of the long saloon up there there aint no better shot nor quicker anywhere on the slopes but he dont look as if he could speak up for himself the other said no and he doesnt speak up for himself though his mates would be ready enough to speak up for him if anyone said anything to him there is nothing quarrelsome about him he is always for peace and order he is a sort of judge lynch all to himself he has cleared out one or two camps i have been at when a chap gets too bad for anything and takes to shooting over and above what is usual and right specially if he draws on quiet sort of chaps and becomes a terror then limping frank comes out i was down at dead mans gulch when there was a gang of three or four men who were a terror to the place they had stretched out seven or eight between them and texan jack as the worst of them was called one day shot down a young fellow who had just come into camp for no reason at all as far as any one knew i happened to be in the saloon five minutes afterwards when limping frank came in texan jack was standing drinking there with two of his mates laughing and jawing you would scarcely have known that little chap if you had seen him then he had been nursing a mate of mine only the night before and as i had been sitting near him i thought what a gentle sort of face he hadmore like a womans than a mans but now his eyes were wide open and his lips closed and there was just a set look in his face that i knew meant mischieffor i had seen him once before when his dander was upand i put my hand into my back pocket for my pistol for i knew there was going to be a muss he stopped in the middle of the room and he said in a loud clear voice that made every one look sharp round texan jack murderer and villain we have borne with you too long if you are a man draw texan jack stared with astonishment are you mad you little fool he said draw or i will shoot you down as you stand limping frank said and the texan saw that he meant mischief frank had no weapon in his hand for he was not one to take an advantage the texan carried his weapon up his sleeve but quick as he was with it frank was as quick and the two pistols cracked pretty well at the same moment frank got a ball in the shoulder but the texan fell dead with a bullet in the centre of his forehead his two mates drew in a moment but franks revolver cracked twice as quick as you could count them and there were just three bodies lying dead in a heap then he put up his pistol and said in his ordinary quiet voice i dont like these things but we must have peace and order will some of you tell the others that they had better git and you bet they did git limping frank never said another word about it but got his arm in a sling and half an hour afterwards i saw him quietly cooking his mates dinner while they were both standing by blowing him up for starting out without them to back him what did he say the newcomer asked i heard him say it is no use your going on like that mates if you had gone down he would have got his friends and then there would have been a general fight and several would have got hurt when you have murderers like these you dont want a fightyou want an execution and having a sort of natural knack with the pistol i took it upon myself to be executioner there was another case although it didnt happen at the camp i was at in which a woman was murdered by a halfbreed mexican i did not hear the circumstances but it was a shocking bad case she left a child behind her and her husband a little german went clean off his head next morning limping frank was missing all that was known was that he had bought a horse of a man who had come in late the night before and was gone his two mates looked high and low for him but said at last they guessed he would turn up again it was wellnigh two months before he came back he brought back with him a watch and some trinkets that had been stolen from the murdered woman and it seems that he had followed the fellow right down into new mexico and had shot him there the man who told me said he never made any talk about it but was at work as usual the morning after he came back i tell you i would rather quarrel with sim howlett and english bill together than i would get that little mans dander up he is a peacemaker too he is and many a quarrel he has smoothed down at one camp we were in we made him a sort of judge and whenever there was a dispute about claims or tools or anything else we went to him and he decided and no judge could have gone into the case fairer or given a better judgment and though in course those he decided against were not pleased they had to put up with it in the first place the camp was with him and in the second there aint much use disputing with a judge who can shoot as straight as he can and is ready to do it if necessary the three partners had finished their days work and sat down to a meal of tea steak and corncakes that limping frank had prepared for them we shall have to be moving from here soon the englishman said another week and our claim will be worked out we have not done badly on the whole the question is had we better buy up somebody elses claim and go on working here or make a start for some fresh field i vote for a move sim howlett said i dont say the claim hasnt panned out well but there is no excitement about it the gold lies regular right through the gravel and it is almost as bad as working for wages you can always tell within an ounce or so what there will be when you come to clean up the cradle i like a bit of excitement nothing one day and eight or ten ounces the next it comes to the same thing in the long run the englishman said we dont get very much forwarder grub costs a lot of money and then what there is over and above slips through our fingers somehow the gamblingtables take a large share of mine and your weakness for champagne sim when you break out about once a month makes a hole in yours and as to franks he spends half his in getting meat for soups and wines and medicines for his patients what is one to do frank said apologetically one cannot see people die for want of ordinary necessaries besides bill you give away a lot too only my money is not so well spent as yours doctor well no i dont think it is i suppose it comes to the same thing in the end i dont want to lay by money what should i do with it if i had it you dont want to lay by money because you are strong and can go on earning it for years yet and you both know very well that if you had a hundred thousand dollars you would chuck it all away in six months sim howlett laughed aloud perhaps you are right doctor english bill said but if your argument means anything it means that we are fools for working as hard as we do not at all the doctor said gently you dont earn more than you want as is shown by the fact that you lay by so little and that we havent more than enough dust in our sack to keep us for a month or two if we dont happen to strike it in the next claim we take up no i think we earn just enough if you earned three times as much you would go three times as often to that cursed gamblingtable and it would be bad for your temper if sim earned three times as much he would go on the spree three times as often and it would be bad for his health if i were to earn three times as much i should have three times as many patients to attend to and i couldnt stand such a strain so you see we are just right as we are and he nodded pleasantly to his two comrades you are the most perplexing beggar i ever came across doctor the englishman said and i have seen some rum specimens during the twenty years i have been knocking about in the states the little man nodded as if it had been a compliment i know bill that is what i think myself sometimes there is a tile just a little loose somewhere not at all not at all bill said hotly while sim howlett growled that he would like to hear any one else say so not off you know frank said but just a little loose i know dear boys you see my machine gets muddled up it may work right enough sometimes but the chances are that a cog has got bent or that there is a little twist in a crank and the thing never works quite even it just catches you knowrattles now and then you may look it all over as much as you like but you cannot spot where it is you say it wants grease but you may pour bucketfuls over it and it makes no difference thereand he broke offthey are at it again up in that saloon two or three pistolshots rang out in the evening air things are not going on as they ought to he went on quietly that is another machine that wants regulating there are more bad men in this camp than there ought to be dont you worry yourself bill said hastily you cannot expect a mining camp to be a sort of paradise doctor and all the bad men kept outside things have been going on pretty smooth of late it has been quite a peaceful camp i dont like the ways of that man symonds the gambler the doctor said meditatively with his head a little on one side he is a bad lot sim howlett agreed but he is going i heard tell yesterday that he said he was going down to frisco at the end of the week and if he doesnt go bill and i will get a dozen other fellows to go with us and tell him that he had better git or the air of this camp is likely to be unhealthy for him well if that is so we need not think any more about it the doctor said i dreamt last night i saw him with a bullet mark in the centre of his forehead but perhaps that was a mistake or the mark will not come at present it will come sooner or later he added musingly but perhaps not for a good time yet well well sim howlett broke in we are wandering about like green hands lost in a sagebush we started by talking about whether when we have worked up our claim we shall stop here or foot it if we foot it where do you propose to go sim i heard this morning that they are doing well in that new place they call gold run then again you know we have always had a fancy for a months prospecting up at the head of the yuba the gold must come from somewhere though nobody has ever hit the spot yet i am ready to go where you like sim the doctor said but as i have often told you before you miners are altogether wrong in your notions as any one can see with half an eye by the fact that whether you are down here in the bottom of a gulch or whether you are up on those flats feet above us you always find gravel now those flats were once the bed of a great river that was when the mountains round were tens of thousands of feet higher than they are now they must have been all that or there would never be water enough for such a river as that must have been that river must have rolled on for thousands of years for the gravel which you can see in some places is feet thick is all waterworn whether it is big boulders or little stones it has all been rolled about well in time these mountains were all worn away there wasnt water then for the big river and the water from the hills as you see them now began to cut fresh channels and this yuba which is one of them lies a thousand feet below the old gravel bed in some places it has crossed the old bed and the gold that came down from the former mountains into the gravel has been washed down into these valleys you will never find as you all dream of doing a quartz vein stuck full of gold there may have been veins like that in the old mountains but the quartz veins that you find now and lots of them have been assayed are all very poor they have got gold in them but scarce enough to pay for working even when they get the best machinery i fancy gold goes off with depth though why it should i cannot say and that these quartz veins which near the surface had big nuggets and were chokefull of small stuff just pettered away to nothing as they went deeper that is why i think sim that you will find no quartz reefs worth working anywhere now and why you are less likely to find much pay dirt in the upper gorges because the water there has not gone through the old gravel fields as it has in its windings lower down but according to that doctor we should find it richest of all if we were to sink in the bed of the river down by the plains not at all not at all bill from the point where the yubas course leaves the old gravel bed of the big river and makes its own way through hills down to the plains it has picked up no more gold as you know the big nuggets are generally found pretty high up as was natural they should be for as soon as the new river washed them out of the old bed they would sink down in some convenient hole and as in the course of ages the yuba cut down deeper and deeper they would go down too their weight would prevent their rolling far the light stuff would wash down moving onwards with the sands and gravel and so as you search lower down you get better surface washings but find less coarse gold i dare say you are right doctor sim howlett said yawning so we wont go prospecting up in the hills though some nice little finds have been made up there in spite of what you say i vote we leave it open until we have cleared up and then look round a new rush may be started before a week is over and if we are ready to move at once we may manage to take up claims in the thick of it if one isnt pretty early at a new place one may just as well stay away altogether there is the horn the mail is late tonight i will go out and see if i can get hold of a sacramento paperone sees all about the new places there not that one need swallow all they say for the lies about what is being got are tremendous one fellow strikes it rich and then they put it in that every fellow in the camp is making from four to ten ounces a day i believe most of these lies come from the storekeepers of course it is to their interest to get up a rush to places where they have set up their stores and if a newspaper man comes along they lay it on thick well here goes and throwing on his wideawake sim howlett sauntered off in a quarter of an hour he returned with a newspaper here you are bill you may as well do the reading i am out of practice and the doctor is not to be depended upon and will miss the very bits we want to know taking the paper the englishman read the columns devoted to reports from the mining camps a stranger would have thought from the perusal that every miner on the pacific slope must have been making a fortune so brilliant were the accounts of the gold that was being obtained in every mining camp john wilkins and party obtained at their weeks clearup ounces of gold including many fine nuggets many others have met with almost equal good fortune the sand on the shoulder is panning out very rich such was a sample of the descriptions the three men were unmoved by them they knew too well how untrustworthy were the reports many were as has been said the work of the storekeepers others were the invention of miners desirous of disposing of their claims to newcomers and shifting to more promising regions little was said of the fabulous prices of provisions of the fever that decimated some of the camps of the total abandonment of others and yet even the miners although knowing by frequent experience that no dependence could be placed on these reports were prone to cling to the hope that this time they were correct and the roads were thronged by parties who having failed at one camp were making their way to a distant location of which they had heard brilliant reports and who were met perhaps on their way by parties coming from that very camp to the one they had just quitted it sounds well the doctor said with a quiet smile when the reading was concluded sounds be blowed sim growled they are thundering lies what do they say of this campread it again bill it is difficult to get at the exact state of things at cedar gulch men who are doing well are always reticent as to their earnings but there is little doubt that all are doing well and that while those working in companies are obtaining very large results the average through the camp is not less than from two to three ounces a day the camp is not doing badly sim remarked there are mighty few here who aint earning their grub i dont believe there is one who is making from three to four ounces a day not regular of course if he comes on a pocket or strikes the bed rock he may earn a good bit over that ten times as much perhaps in a day but take it all round an ounce or at most an ounce and a quarter would be the outside english bill nodded i should say an ounce at the outside there are scores who aint earning half an ounce regular and there are a few who have to run into debt for their grub well there is nothing very tempting in that lot of notices we have tried a good many of them in the last two years and at any rate we have got another week before we need make up our minds i expect it will come again bill to what it has come to half a dozen times before write all the names on a piece of paper put them into a bag let the doctor draw one and go for it it is as good a plan as another and the doctors luck has always pulled us through sim and the englishman stretched themselves upon their blankets and lay there smoking while limping frank squatted down by the side of the solitary candle and began to look at the small portion of the paper devoted to general news this was soon finished and then he ran his eye over the advertisements these principally related to articles in demand by minerspatent rockers and cradles picks and shovels revolvers and bowieknives iron houses for stores tents clothing waterproof boots and flannel shirts then there was a column of town lots in sacramento notices of steamers starting for san francisco notices of stolen horses offers of rewards for the capture of notorious criminals and advertisements for missing friends bill he said presently hello said the englishman with a start he had just laid his pipe down and was already dozing didnt you once say your name was tunstall yes thats it though i have pretty well forgotten it what is it well there is an advertisement here that may relate to you what is it say i havent been running off with a horse or shooting a sheriff so i dont know why they are advertising for me five hundred dollars reward the above sum will be paid by james campbell attorney san francisco to any one who will give him information as to the whereabouts of william tunstall who was last heard of four years ago in california the said william tunstall is entitled to property in england under the will of his brother the late edgar tunstall of byrneside cumberland thats me the englishman said sitting upright and staring at the doctor well well so edgar has gone poor lad well i am sorry sim howlett had also roused himself at the news well bill i was going to congratulate you he said but that doesnt seem the light you take the news in no i am not thinking of money the other said i could have had that long ago if i had chosen to take it i was thinking of my brother it is twenty years since i saw him and i dont suppose i should have ever seen him again any way but it is a shock to know that he has gone it never was his fault and i am sorry now i held off so i never thought of this it has come to me sometimes that when i got old and past work i might go back to the old place and end my days there but i never thought that he would go before me i am sorry mates more sorry than i can say how was it bill the doctor asked dont tell us if you dont like it is no business of ours here in the diggings there are few men who talk of old times their eyes are all on the future and what they will do with their wealth when they gain it but no one asks another as to his past history the answer might sometimes be a pistolshot here we three have been living together for more than two years and not one of us has wanted to know what the others were before we met it is quite an accident that i know your name you gave it when you gave evidence as to the murder of that old german that we hung red hugh for it struck me it was an odd name then but i never thought of it again until i saw it in the paper and you said onceit was christmas day i rememberyou said there was a home for you in england if you liked to go to it i will tell you the story the englishman said i would have told it to you long ago only there was nothing in it to tell you it was just what has happened ten thousand times and will happen as often again my father was one of the largest landowners in cumberland i was his eldest son we never got on well together he was cold and haughty a hard landlord and a despot at home we should have quarrelled earlier than we did but i was sent to rugby and often did not even come home for the holidays for i had a good many friends in those days i went back when i was eighteen and was to have gone to college a month or two later i made a fool of myself as boys do and fancied i was in love with one of our tenants daughters some meddling busybodyi always thought it was the parsons wife for she drove along one evening just as i was saying goodbye to the girl at the stiletold my father about it and there was a frightful row for once he got in a passion and i lost my temper too it was really a harmless flirtation i think and would have died out when i went off to college however when my father swore that if i ever spoke to her again he would turn me out of the house i said he might do as he liked and that i would marry her when i came of age he ordered me to leave the house and never see his face again said that i was no longer his son and might go to the devil or words to that effect so being just as obstinate in my way as he was in his i went and never did see him again of course i went first to see the girl she was frightened out of her life when she heard of what had happened said that her father would be turned out of his house and all sorts of things and at any rate she would have nothing more to say to me so i walked to liverpool and took my berth in the first sailing ship to the states my brother edgar who was two years younger than i was away at the time we had always been capital friends ten years later when my father died he advertised for me and the name being an uncommon one someone pointed it out to me and i answered he wrote most affectionately and lamented that our father had died without forgiving me and had not only cut me entirely out of his will but had knowing his affection for me inserted a clause that should he endeavour to alter the purport of the will or to hand over by deed or otherwise any part or share of the estates to me the property should revert at once to a distant relative edgar said however that he had consulted his lawyers and they were of opinion that this clause in no way affected his power to dispose of his income drawn from the estate and that he proposed to share this equally with me i wrote back that while i was obliged to him for his offer i should not accept it for as the property was not entailed our father had a perfect right to leave it as he liked he had left it to him and there was an end of it we exchanged several letters but i was just as obstinate as my father had been i was too busy or too lazy for letterwriting somehow no one writes here and then one is constantly on the move anyhow i had one or two letters from him which i never answered the last was three or four years ago and now he is dead and i suppose has left me some of the property i would not take during his lifetime of course i was a fool and an obstinate fool all along but one never acknowledges this until it is too late the others made no remark for some time well anyhow bill you ought to go down to frisco and see this lawyer i will think it over the other said as after relighting his pipe he lay back on the blankets again there is no hurry for a day or two no further mention was made of the matter until the claim was cleared up but that evening bill returned to the subject i have thought it over and i suppose i had better go down to frisco i dont think i shall take this money i should be like a fish out of water in england and should be miserable there if i take anything it will be a thousand pounds or so i should sink that in buying a snug little place on the foothills and i should put somebody on to work it and plant it up with fruittrees or vines or that sort of thing and then some day when i get too old for knocking about i shall settle down there and i neednt say that my home will also be yours mates i shant be much more than a week away i shall come back here and if you hear of anything before i return leave a line with the storekeeper telling me where you are off to i have my kit packed and if i start in half an hour i shall catch the night coach as it comes along past the top of the gulch sim howlett made no comment but simply observed i expect you will find us here but just as bill was starting the doctor put his hand on his arm and said dont do anything hasty mate you see you made rather a mess of your life by putting your foot down before when it seems there was no occasion for it there is never any good comes of making up your mind in a hurry when there is no need for it when you see a man slipping his hand round towards his back trouserpocket i allow that is not the time for thinking you have got to act and to act mighty sharp too or you will get a bullet in you before you have drawn but in a thing of this sort it makes no difference whether you decide now or six months hence you need only write and say that you are found and ask for particulars and so on and when you have got them you can take your time about giving an answer many men before now have refused a good thing and been sorry for it afterwards your brother according to your own account has acted kindly and well towards you why should you refuse what he wished you to have merely because you think that it ought to have come to you in the first place that is all i have to say bill and he walked slowly back to the tent while bill started at a steady pace up the long steep hill from the gulch to the plateau above along which ran one of the principal roads from sacramento through the mining district we shall miss him sim limping frank said as he and his mate lighted their pipes after their meal that evening it seems kinder lonely without him after sitting down regularly for two years now he aint gone yet sim growled and i dont think as he is going what bill said he will stick to you bet oh yes he means what he says sim bill has gone away from here with the fixed idea of going down there writing a letter or two coming back here waiting for his money to come over investing it in a farm and going on working with us just as before but bless you it is one thing to make up your mind and another to carry it out what is to prevent his carrying it out doctor lots of things sim when a man once gets mixed up in a will or in any kind of law business he ceases to be a free agent ceases to be what doctor well he ceases to be his own master bill thinks he has only got to go into a lawyers office and sayhere i am i am the chap mentioned in that advertisement i dare say my brother has left me a good lot but i dont want it just write and tell them to send me on five thousand dollars thats all i want out of it i am going back to sacramento tomorrow when the money comes pay it into the bank there for me then he thinks that he will have a days spree at frisco and come back by steamer next day and why shouldnt he what is to hinder him well it wont be like that sim at all when he goes in and says i am william tunstall the lawyer will say i am heartily glad to see you sir allow me to congratulate you and he will shake bill by the hand and bill will say to himself this is just as it should be five minutes will do this job i will go out and look up two or three friends who are in from the mines and we will have a bottle of champagne apiece over this business just as he has thought that over the lawyer will say to him of course you are in a position to prove that you are the mr tunstall advertised for bill will say oh yes here are my brothers letters then the lawyer will smile and nod and say most satisfactory and then he will add of course you are in a position to prove that you are the person to whom these letters were sent of course i dont doubt it for a moment but letters do get lost you know and fall into other peoples hands in a matter of this kind we must proceed in a legal and business way then bill will say of course i can prove that there is sim howlett and frank bennett my mates they know i am bill tunstall they knew you before you came out here i suppose oh no but they have known me for two years known you as william tunstall yes of course bill will say beginning to get riled then the lawyer will point out to him that we can only say that he called himself will tunstall and that as the last of these letters he has got is dated earlier than that it comes to the fact that there is only his word to go upon and that the law requires very much stronger proofs of identity than this then bill will get mad and will say the money can go to the deuce and that he shant trouble any more about it what then doctor sim howlett asked as his companion stopped ah well that i cannot say he may come straight off without doing anything more or the lawyer may get him to talk it over as to that i cannot say but you may be quite sure that if bill is to touch a penny of the money left to him he will have to go back to england to prove who he is and it is like enough he may not succeed when he gets there by what he says he was only at home just occasionally during his school holidays he was little more than a boy when he left and after twenty years knocking about on the plains and here it is like enough he may not be able to find a soul to recognize him illustration chapter ii terrible news william tunstall returned to cedar gulch the very day upon which his mates began to expect him having finished up the work in their claim on the previous day they strolled up the hill to meet the coach on the chance of his coming well mate how goes it sim howlett asked well it doesnt go at all sim how is that well the lawyer was civil and all that but if i had let him he would have made me believe that i was not will tunstall at all i showed him my brothers letters which ought to have satisfied anyone and he hinted that these might have come into my possession anyhow that tunstall might be dead or that his kit with these letters in it might have been stolen that is the very thing the doctor said he would be after sim howlett exclaimed in great admiration at the latters perspicacity i suppose he didnt say he thought so bill the doctor asked no he knew better than that doctor he kept on saying that he was quite satisfied but that other people wouldnt be satisfied then he asked about references who could i refer to could i refer to anyone who had known me as william tunstall before the date of these letters i said that i had been knocking about on the plains and doing trapping and indian fighting for years and that i was known as english bill and that i did not suppose there were half a dozen fellows ever did know my name and that for aught i knew they had all been scalped shot or hung long ago he said in that case i should have to go to england to prove my claim i said i would see the claim at the bottom of the sea first and then i left him i met some fellows and made a night of it but in the morning the lawyer turned up at the hotel just as i had finished breakfast i had told him the hotel where i was staying he said it was no use being hasty i said i wasnt hasty and we were near having a row again then he said that he had only had instructions to find me and did not know how much was left me under the will or anything about it except what he had put in the advertisement at any rate he would write to the people who had instructed him in england and tell them that a gentleman representing himself to be william tunstall had called and that he possessed letters from the late mr edgar tunstall that in the present state of affairs i declined to make the voyage to england for the purpose of proving my identity but that he had my address and could communicate further with me upon receiving instructions from them i told him to say that i didnt want the money and was not going to put myself out one way or the other about it he listened and shook his head just the way the doctor does when he dont agree with you then he remarked that he would not do anything rash if he were in my place i told him it was no odds to me whether he would or would not and as i had just time to catch the steamer i wasnt going to waste any more time jawing over it so off i came and here i am well what is doing here has there been any fresh rush nary one the doctor and i think we cannot do better than stay here i was talking with halkett and his partners this afternoon they dont get on well together halkett said they would sell out if they could get a fair price they are getting out about six ounces a day no great thing but they are only halfway down at present it is in four shares for two of the gang are on day wages of course i said that it wasnt much of a thing to buy as they were only getting an ounce a piece and besides the shaft is badly timbered still if they would say what they wanted for it we would talk it over with you when you got back halkett was evidently anxious to sell and said they would take a hundred ounces for it right out of course i said that was too much but i think it is a bargain so does the doctor they have got through the worst half and there is the best behind it dont always turn out rich on the bedrock here it didnt with us still there is the chance of it and if it only keeps as it is now and we take on a couple of men to work with us we should after paying them and keeping ourselves be making three ounces a day anyhow and it will take us a couple of months to get to the bottom and perhaps more how do we stand after the clearup doctor for frank was the treasurer of the party we got twenty ounces at the last clearup and we had eightynine before so if we give him his price we should have nine ounces left it will take fifty or sixty dollars sim howlett said to make that shaft safe halkett is the only one of the lot that knows anything about that and it has been done in a very slovenly style i shouldnt like to work down there until we have strengthened it all the way down i told halkett the other day that if he didnt mind it would be caving in i think that is partly why they are selling well i think we couldnt do better than take it sim but you must get them to knock a few ounces off otherwise we shant have enough to repair the shaft and from what you say we must do that before we go to work in the bottom let us go and make a bargain at once that will never do bill sim howlett said that would look as if we had made up our mind to take it and they wouldnt come down an ounce no no we will have our meal and wait an hour or two then i will stroll round to halketts tent and say that as we calculate it would cost a heap of money to make the shaft safe we do not see our way to it though we might otherwise have taken to the job then you will see tomorrow morning when they knock off for breakfast halkett will come round here and make some proposal so indeed it turned out soon after breakfast halkett came to the tent door look here boys he said i want to get out of this lot the men i am working with aint worth shucks the three of them dont do a fair mans work and i am sick of it but i have been talking to them and they wont take less than twentyfive ounces a share and they have been talking to some men who have pretty well made up their minds to give it if i had the dust i would buy the others out but i havent if you will buy the other three out at their terms i will keep my share and work partners with you i have got enough dust to pay my share of retimbering the shaft what do you say the doctor had gone off to take some broth to two of his patients the other two looked at each other and then sim howlett said well this is how it stands halkett my mate here and i would have no objection to work with you but it is this way we and the doctor have chummed together and have never taken anyone else in with us partly because we are quite content as it is and partly because the doctor cant do his share of the workhe hasnt got it in him we dont want to go away from here now and we have dust enough to buy your three partners out i suppose we should want to work four at that shaft i dont know what you have been working six for except that three of your lot are of no use that is about it halkett said so you see we should have to take on a man to do the doctors work well you would have to do that if you worked it yourselves so we should sim howlett assented what do you say bill halketts proposal seems a fair one sim it seems to me we cant do better than accept it we must consult the doctor halkett he is sure to agree but we should not like to do it without speaking to him that would not be fair but you may consider it a bargain very well i will go back and tell them i have made the agreement with you then i will come back and bring you fifteen ounces of dust which is all i have got i dont want them to know that i am going to stop in it if i do like enough they will cut up rusty so i want you to make it up and hand the hundred ounces over clear then they will hand me my share and i can give you the other ten ounces they will leave the camp as soon as they get their money somebody has been blowing to them about a find he has made prospecting among the hills and i fancy they mean going off with him and it would be no use letting on that i am going to stop in the partnership until they have gone they are just the sort of fellows to think that i had been somehow besting them and if they said so there would be trouble and i dont want to do any of them harm the doctor on his return fell in as a matter of course with his mates arrangement at dinnertime halkett and his partners came in and the dust was weighed out and handed over to them sim howlett and tunstall spent the afternoon in making a careful examination of the shaft and in deciding upon the best plan for strengthening it halketts former partners left a couple of hours after they got the money and on the following morning the new proprietors of the claim set to work the first step was to make an arrangement with a man who had horses to haul timber from a little sawmill that had been erected two miles away and as soon as this began to arrive the work of strengthening the shaft was set about it took the three men and another whom they had taken on at daily pay a week and at the end of that time it was pronounced safe against any pressure it was likely to have to bear the advertisement in the sacramento paper had been noticed by others than by those for whom it was intended and there happened to be among the miners who had worked at various times in the same diggings with william tunstall another who had been on the jury when he had mentioned his name he did not however notice the advertisement until a day or two after the newspaper had arrived in camp there he said to some mates who were sitting round the fire that is just like my luck there is five hundred dollars slipped clean through my fingers because i did not happen to see this here paper before how is that jones why here is five hundred dollars offered for information as to the whereabouts of william tunstall and who is william tunstall i never heard of him why english bill that is his name sure enough he gave it on a jury we served on together i told him then i had never heard the name before that is how i came to remember it well why are you too late why dont you write off at once and say he is here and claim the money because he is gone mate sim howlett asked black johnson yesterday when i was standing by if he knew of a good man he could take on for a weeks work as he was singlehanded for of course limping frank dont count in the way of work i asked him if english bill was laid up and he said no he had gone the night before down to frisco i wondered then at his starting just before they had cleaned up their claim now it is clear enough he had seen this advertisement bolted one of the other men asked bolted no jones said in a tone of contemptuous disgust you dont suppose english bill has been cutting anyones throat do you or robbing some digger of his swag no he has gone down to frisco to see the chap that put this into the paper why look here and he read the advertisement aloud he has come into a fortune i expect they would never have taken the trouble to advertise for him if it hadnt been a big sum you bet english bill has struck it rich like enough it is a thundering big ranche with two or three hundred thousand head of cattle they dont have estates like that in england another digger put in i was chatting with an englishman at holly creek he said land was worth a heap there but it was all cultivated and hedged in and he didnt suppose as there was a man in the whole country who had got as much as five thousand head of cattle however cattle or not i expect it is a big thing english bill has come in for and we shant see him in here again the news spread quickly through the camp it was discussed by the men as they worked the rockers by the gamblers up at the saloon and in the tents when the work was done sim howlett was soon questioned but was surly and little could be got from him limping frank was no more communicative he was accosted frequently as he went from the tents with his soups and medicines with well frank so i hear your mate has come in for a big thing and gone down to frisco jack jones saw the advertisement for him in the paper if jack jones saw it of course it was there the doctor said with his quiet smile couldnt have seen it otherwise could he yes bill has gone off i am glad to hear that it is a big thing hadnt heard it before it will be a surprise to him for he didnt expect it would be a big thing didnt think it would be worth troubling about you see however i daresay he will be back in a week or two and then no doubt he will tell you all about it cedar gulch was greatly disappointed when english bill reappeared in his ordinary red shirt high boots and miners hat and went to work on the following afternoon as if nothing had happened there had been a general idea that if he came back he would appear in storeclothes and a high hat and perhaps come in a carriage with four horses all to himself and that he would stand champagne to the whole camp and that there would be generally a good time he himself when questioned on the subject turned the matter off by saying he had not thought the thing worth bothering about that he could not get what there was without going to england to fetch it and that it might go to the bottom of the sea before he took that trouble the only person to whom he said more was the man who ran the gamblingtable things had been lately going on more quietly there and the gambler had postponed his departure to san francisco bill tunstall spent as the doctor said no inconsiderable portion of his earnings at the gamblingtables and had struck up an acquaintance with symonds the latter was like many of his class a man of quiet and pleasant manners for his profession a nerve of iron was required for pistols were frequently drawn by disappointed miners flushed with drink and furious at their losses and the professional gambler had his life constantly in his hands the accusation you cheated me was the sure signal for one or two pistol shots to ring out in sharp succession then a body would be carried out and play resumed symonds bore no worse reputation than others of the class it was assumed of course that he would cheat if he had the chance but with a dozen men looking on and watching every movement of the fingers even the cleverest gambler generally played fair these men were generally by birth and education far above those with whom they played they had fallen from the position they had once occupied had perhaps in the first place been victims of gamblers just as they now victimized others had been cast out from society as detected cheats or convicted swindlers but now thanks to nerve recklessness of life and sleight of hand they reaped a fortune until the bullet of a ruined miner or the rope of judge lynch cut short their career symonds was not unpopular among the miners he was liberal with his money had many times spared men who according to the code of the diggings had forfeited their lives by an insult or by a shot that had missed its aim he had often set men on their legs again who had lost their all to him and if there was a subscription raised for some man down with fever or for a woman whose husband had been killed in a shaft symonds would head the list with a handsome sum and yet there were few men more feared magnanimous on some occasions he was ruthless on others he was a dead shot and handled his pistol with a lightning speed that in nine cases out of ten enabled him to fire first and while he would contemptuously spare a man who was simply maddened by ruin and drink the notorious bully the terror of a camp a man who deliberately forced a quarrel upon him relying upon his strength or skill would be shot down without hesitation thus in nine cases out of ten the feeling of the communities among whom he plied his vocation was in his favour while he himself was a dangerous man he rid the camp of others who were still more obnoxious and the verdict after most of these saloon frays was served him right but as a rule men avoided discussing symonds or his affairs it was dangerous to do so for somehow he seemed always to learn what was said of him and sooner or later the words were paid for will tunstall knew that he was a dangerous man and had no doubt that he was an utterly unscrupulous one but he himself never drank while he played and was never out of temper when he lost therefore he had no reason whatever to fear the man and symonds had always been civil and pleasant with him recognizing that there was something in him that placed him somewhat apart from the rough crowd he met him one afternoon soon after his return is it true all this they are saying about you bill symonds asked well it is true enough that i was advertised for and went down to frisco to see a man there about it of course it is all nonsense as to what they are saying about the value of it it is some family property that might have come to me long ago if i hadnt kicked over the traces but i am not going to trouble about it i shall have all the bother and expense of going to england to prove who i am and i wouldnt do it if it were ten times as much come and have a glass of cham bill my own story is a good deal like yours i daresay i might be master of a good estate in the old country now if i hadnt gone a mucker it is too early to drink will said if i did drink it would be just a cocktail the champagne you get is poison just as you like by the way if i can be of any use to you let me know it is an expensive run home to england from here and if you have need for a thousand dollars i could let you have them i have had a good run of luck this last six months it would be a business transaction you know and you could pay me a couple of hundred for the use of it it is of no use losing a good thing for the want of funds thank you symonds i have enough to take me home if i have to go but i am very much obliged for the offer all the same it is business the other said carelessly and there are no thanks due if you change your mind let me know mind i owe you a cocktail next time we meet in the saloon the gambler went on will tunstall looked after him with a little wonder at the offer he had made it is a goodnatured thing to offer for of course if i went to england he could not make anything out of me beyond the interest of the money and he would get more than that putting it on house property in frisco he is a queer card and would look more at home in new york than in cedar gulch illustration symonds and bill tunstall have a talk the gamblers dress indeed was out of place with the surroundings like most of his class he dressed with scrupulous neatness his clothes were well made and fitted him he wore a white shirt the only one in the camp and abstained from the diamond studs and rings and heavy gold watchchain that was generally affected by professional gamblers he was tall as tall as tunstall himself though not so broad or so strongly built but his figure was well knit there was in his walk and action an air of lightness and activity and he had more than once shown that he possessed an altogether unusual amount of muscular strength it is a pity that the fellow is what he is will tunstall said when he turned away what a soldier he would have made with his strength and pluck and wonderful coolness this little conversation was followed by several others somehow or other they met more frequently than they had done before and one evening when there was no play in the saloon symonds asked him to come in and have a chat with him in his private room at the hotel for some time they chatted on different subjects symonds had brought out a box of superb cigars and a bottle of such claret as will tunstall had not drunk for years saying carelessly as he did so i always carry my own tipple about with me it would ruin my nerves to drink the poison they keep at these places after a time he brought the subject round to the legacy i have been thinking over what you said about not going back and i think you are wrong if you dont mind my saying so what have you got to look forward to here toil and slave year after year without ever getting a step further living all the time a life harder than that of the poorest labourer at home it is well enough now i suppose you are seven or eight and thirty just about my own age in another ten years you will be sorry you let the chance slip of course it is different with me as far as money goes i could give it up now but i cannot go back again men dont take to my sort of life he said with some bitterness unless they have got a pretty bad record behind them but i shall give it up before very long unless i am wiped out first then ill go and settle in south america or some place of that sort buy an estate and set up as a rich and virtuous englishman whose own climate doesnt agree with him then he carelessly changed the subject again but it was reverted to once or twice in the course of the evening and before will left he had said enough to enable his companion to gather a fair estimate of the value of the property and the share he was likely to have of it the new claim turned out fairly well improving somewhat in depth and yielding a good though not an extraordinary profit to the partners some four months after will tunstall had been down to san francisco he received a bulky letter from the attorney there it contained an abstract of his brothers will this left him half the property with a statement saying that he considered it to be his brothers by right and inclosed with it was a copy of a letter written a few days before his death it ran as follows my dear willyou have wandered about long enough it is high time for you to come back to the old place that you ought never to have left i shall not see you again for i have long been suffering from heartdisease and the doctors tell me the end may come any day i have had the opinion of some of the best authorities and they all say that thanks to some peculiar wording in the will which i dont understand in the slightest the prohibition to divide with you is only binding during my lifetime and that nothing is said that restricts my right to leave it as i please i dont suppose the contingency of your surviving me ever entered into our fathers mind and probably he thought that you would never be heard of again however you see it has turned out otherwise you have wandered and roughed it and gone through dangers of all sorts and are still you tell me strong and healthy i have lived quietly and comfortably with every luxury and without a days trouble save my terrible grief when my wife died and the everconstant regret that you were not here beside me yet i am dying but that enables me at last to redress to some extent the cruel wrong you have suffered i have left you half the estate and it makes me happy to think that you will come back again to it i have appointed you sole guardian of my boy he is only twelve years old and i want you to be a father to him the estate is large enough for you both and i hope that you may on your return marry and be happy here if not i suppose it will all go to him at your death in any case i pray you to come home for the boys sake and for your own it is my last request and i hope and believe that you will grant it you were always good to me when we were boys together and i feel sure that you will well supply my place to hugh god bless you old fellow your affectionate brother edgar with these documents was a letter from the solicitors to the family saying that they had heard from their agents at san francisco that he had presented himself in answer to their advertisement and had shown them the letters of the late mr edgar tunstall they therefore forwarded him copies of the will and of mr tunstalls letter and begged him to return home without delay as his presence was urgently required they assumed of course that they were writing to mr william tunstall and that when he arrived he would have no difficulty whatever in proving his identity i think i must go boys he said as after reading his brothers letter three or four times he folded the papers up and put them in his pocket my brother has made me guardian of his boy and puts it so strongly that i think i must go over for a bit i dont suppose i shall have to stop although the lawyers say that i am urgently required there but mind i mean to do just what i said i shall take a thousand pounds or so and renounce the rest a nice figure i should make setting up at home as a big landowner i should be perfectly miserable there no you take my word for it i shall be back here in six months at the outside i shall get a joint guardian appointed to the boy the clergyman of the place or some one who is better fitted to see after his education and bringing up than i am when he gets to seventeen or eighteen and a staunch friend who knows the world pretty well may be really of use to him i shall go over and take him on his travels for two or three years bring him out here a bit perhaps however that is in the distance i am going now for a few months then you will see me back here i wish i wasnt going it is a horrible nuisance but i dont see that i can get out of it certainly you cannot bill it is your plain duty we dont go by duty much in these diggings and it will be pleasant to see somebody do a thing that he doesnt like because it is right we shall miss you of coursemiss you badly but we all lose friends and nowhere so much as here for what with drink and fever and bullets the percentage wiped out is large you are going because in fact you cant help yourself we shall be glad when you come back but if you dont come back we shall know that it was because you couldnt yes i know you have quite made up your mind about that but circumstances are too strong for men and it may be that however much you may wish it you wont be able to come well we shall be clearing up the claim in another two or three days so it could not come at a better time if it had to come the work was continued to the end of the week and then the last pan of dirt having been washed the partners divided the result each weeks take had been sent down by the weekly convoy to the bank at sacramento for robberies were not uncommon and prudent men only retained enough golddust by them for their immediate wants but adding the dust and nuggets acquired during the last and best weeks work to the amount for which they had the banks receipt the four partners found that they had after paying all their expenses two hundred and fifty ounces of gold sixtytwo ounces and a half each the doctor said it might have been better it might have been worse we put in twentyfive each four months ago so we have got thirtyseven ounces each for our work after paying expenses and each drawing half an ounce a day to spend as he liked this we have of course all of us laid by there was a general laugh for not one of them had above an ounce or two remaining well it isnt bad anyhow doctor william tunstall said sixtytwo ounces apiece will make roughly l which is as much as we have ever had before on winding up a job my share will be enough to lake me to england and back yes provided you dont drop it all in some gambling saloon at sacramento or san francisco the doctor said i shant do that doctor i have lost big sums before now in a nights play i confess but i knew i could set to work and earn more now i have got an object before me that afternoon english bill went round the camp saying goodbye to his acquaintances and although it was very seldom that he drank too much the standing treat and being treated in turn was too much for his head and it was with a very unsteady step indeed that he returned late in the evening to his tent sim howlett who had started with him had succumbed hours before and had been carried down from the saloon by a party who were scarcely able to keep on their own legs when will tunstall woke in the morning he had but a vague idea of the events of the latter part of the evening he remembered hazily that there had been many quarrels and rows but what they had been about he knew not though he felt sure that there had been no shooting he had a dim recollection that he had gone into symonds room at the hotel where he had some champagne and a talk about his trip to england and about the people there what the deuce could have set me talking about them he wondered in his mind he was roused from these thoughts by the doctor if you are going to catch this mornings coach bill you must pull yourself together all right he said getting on to his feet i shall be myself when i have put my head in a bucket of water im afraid i was very drunk last night well you were drunk bill i have never seen you drunk but once before since we were partners but i suppose no one ever did get out of a mining camp where he had been working for some time and had fairly good luck without getting pretty well bowled over after going the rounds to say goodbye now then sim wake up bill will be off in a quarter of an hour i have got breakfast ready sim howlett needed no second call it was no very unusual thing for him to be drunk overnight and at work by daybreak the following morning so after stretching himself and yawning and following wills example of having a wash he was ready to sit down to breakfast with an excellent appetite will however did poor justice to the doctors efforts and ten minutes later the trio started off to meet the coach there were many shouts of goodbye mate good luck to yer from the men going down to the diggings but they were soon beyond the camp few words were said as they went up the hill for the three men were much attached to each other and all felt the parting fortunately they had but two or three minutes to wait before the coach came in sight just you look out for me in about six months time mates but ill write directly i get home and tell you all about things i shall direct here and you can get someone to ask for your letters and send them after you if you have moved to a new camp with a last grasp of the hand tunstall climbed up to the top of the coach his bundle was thrown up to him the coachman cracked his whip the horses started again at a gallop and sim howlett and his mate went down to cedar gulch without another word being spoken between them three days later as they were breakfasting in their tent for they had not yet made up their minds what they should do a miner entered hello dick back from your spree how did you get on at frisco yes i have just got off the coach i have got some bad news to tell you mates bad news why what is that dick sim howlett asked well i know it will hit you pretty hard mates for i know you thought a heap of him well lads it is no use making a long story of it but your mate english bill has been murdered the two men started to their feetsim howlett with a terrible imprecation the doctor with a cry like the scream of a woman it is true mates for i saw the body i should have been up yesterday but i had to wait for the inquest to say who he was i was going to the coach in the morning when i saw half a dozen men gathered round a body on the footway of a small street there was nothing unusual in that at sacramento i dont know what made me turn off to have a look at the body directly i saw it i knew who it was it was english bill so i put off coming and stopped to the inquest he hadnt been killed fair he had been shot down from behind with a bullet in the back of his head no one had heard the shot particular no one thinks anything of a shot in sacramento no one seemed to know anything about him and the inquest didnt take five minutes of course they found a verdict of wilful murder against some person unknown sim howlett listened to the narration with his hands clenched as if grasping a weapon his eyes blazing with fury and muttering ejaculations of rage and horror the doctor hardly seemed to hear what was said he was moving about the tent in a seemingly aimless way blinded with tears presently he came upon his revolver which he thrust into his belt then he dropped his bag of golddust inside his shirt and he then picked up his hat come along sim he said in hurried tones touching his companion on the arm come along sim repeated where are you going to sacramento of course we will hunt him down whoever did it i will find him and kill him if it takes years to do it i am with you sim said but there is no coach until tonight there is a coach that passes through alta at twelve oclock it is fifteen miles to walk but we shall be there in time and it will take us into sacramento by midnight sim howlett snatched up his revolver secured his bag of golddust and said to the man who had brought the news fasten up the tent dick and keep an eye on it and the traps the best thing will be for you to fix yourself here until we come back that will suit me sim i got rid of all my swag before i left you will find it all right when you return they had but four hours to do the distance across a very broken and hilly country but they were at alta a quarter of an hour before the coach was due it taxed sim howletts powers to the utmost and even in his rage and grief he could not help looking with astonishment at his companion who seemed to keep up with him without difficulty they ran down the steep hills and toiled up the formidable ascents the doctors breath came quick and short but he seemed almost unconscious of the exertions he was making his eyes were fixed in front of him his face was deadly pale his white hair damp with perspiration not a word had been spoken since the start except that towards the end of the journey howlett had glanced at his watch and said they were in good time and could take it easy his companion paid no attention but kept on at the top of his speed when the coach arrived it was full but the doctor cried out it is a matter of life and death we must go we will give five ounces apiece to any one who will give us up their places and go on by the next coach two men gladly availed themselves of the offer and at midnight the two companions arrived at sacramento the doctors strength had given way when the necessity for exertion was over and he had collapsed perhaps someone has got a flask with him sim howlett suggested my mate and i have just heard of the murder of an old chum of ours at sacramento and we are on our way down to find out who did it and to wipe him out we have had a hard push for it and as you see it has been too much for my mate who is not over strong half a dozen bottles were instantly produced and some whiskey poured down the doctors throat it was not long before he opened his eyes but remained for some time leaning upon sim howletts shoulder take it easy doctor take it easy the latter said as he felt the doctor straightening himself up you have got to save yourself you know we may have a long job before us there was nothing to do when they entered the town but to find a lodging for the night in the morning they commenced their search it was easy to find the undersheriff who had conducted the inquest he had but little to tell the body had been found as they had already heard there were no signs of a struggle the pockets were all turned inside out the sheriff supposed that the man had probably been in a gamblinghouse had won money there and had been followed and murdered their first care was to find where will tunstall was buried and then to order a stone to be erected at his head then they spent a week visiting every gamblingden in sacramento but nowhere could they find that anyone at all answering to their mates description had been gambling there on the night before he was killed they then found the hotel where he had put up on the arrival of the coach he had gone out after breakfast and had returned alone to dinner and had then gone out again he had not returned it was supposed that he had gone away suddenly and as the value of the clothes he had left behind was sufficient to cover his bill no inquiries had been made at the bank they learned that in the course of the afternoon he had drawn his portion of the joint fund on the order signed by them all at another hotel they learned that a man certainly answering to his description had come in one evening a week or so before with a gentleman staying at the house they did not know who the gentleman was he was a stranger but he was well dressed and they thought he must have come from frisco he had left the next day they had not noticed him particularly but he was tall and dark and so was the man who came in with him the latter was in regular miners dress they had not sat in the saloon but had gone up to the strangers bedroom and a bottle of spirits had been taken up there they did not notice what time the miner left or whether the other went out with him the house was full and they did not bother themselves as to who went in or out it was from a german waiter they learned all this after having made inquiries in vain two or three times previously at this hotel as soon as they left the place the doctor seized sims arm we have got a clew at last sim not much of a clue doctor still there is something to go upon we have got to hunt out this man do you mind going back to the camp tonight sim no i dont mind but what for doctor you go and see whether symonds is still there and if not find out what day and hour he left good heavens you dont suspect him i feel sure sim just as sure as if i had seen it the description fits him exactly who else could bill have known dressed like a gentleman that he would have gone up to drink with when he had l about him you know he had got rather thick with that villain before he left the camp and likely enough the fellow may have got out of him that he was going to draw his money from the bank and thought that it was a good bit more than it was at any rate go and see two days later sim howlett returned with the news that symonds had left two or three hours after tunstall had done so he had said that he had a letter that rendered it necessary that he should go to frisco and had hired a vehicle driven to alta and caught the coach there he had not returned to the camp that settles it sim when i find symonds the gambler i find the murderer of bill tunstall i have been thinking it over it may be months before i catch him he may have gone east into colorado or south into mexico but i am going to find him and kill him i dont think it is any use for us both to hunt it may take months and years perhaps he thinks he is safe and hasnt gone far he may think that poor bill will be picked up and buried and that no one will be any the wiser we would have thought that he had gone off to england and so it would have been if dick hadnt happened to come along and turn off to look at the body like enough he will turn up at cedar gulch again he may the doctor said thoughtfully and that is the more reason why you should stop about here you would hear of his coming back to any of the mining camps on the slopes but i dont think he will he will feel safe and yet he wont feel quite safe besides you know i dreamt that i should kill him however if he does come back anywhere here i leave him to you sim shoot him at sight as if he were a mad dog you dont want any fair play with a fellow like that when you tell the boys the story they will all say you did right i will write to you from time to time to let you know where i am if you have killed him let me know i shall come back to you as soon as i have found him and so it was settled for eager as sim howlett was for vengeance he did not care for the thought of years spent in a vain search and believed that his chance of meeting symonds again was as good among the mining camps as elsewhere illustration illustration chapter iii the wanderers return had the circumstances of william tunstalls leaving his home been more recent or had the son of edgar tunstall been older the news that william tunstall had returned and had taken up his residence at byrneside as master of the portion of the estate left him by his brother and as guardian to the young heir to the remainder would have caused a good deal of interest and excitement in the county the twenty years however that had elapsed since will tunstall had left home and the fact that when he went away he was but a lad quite unknown personally to his fathers acquaintances deprived the matter of any personal interest it had generally been thought that it was hard that he should have been entirely cut out of his fathers will and the clause forbidding his brother to make any division of the property was considered particularly so especially as it was known that edgar was attached to his brother and would have gladly shared the property with him but william had been away twenty years and no one had a personal interest in him ten years had elapsed since he had been finally disinherited by his fathers will beyond a feeling of satisfaction that justice had been done and that there would not be a long minority at byrneside the news that the eldest son had returned created no excitement messrs randolph son of carlisle who were business agents for half the estates in the county reported well of the newcomer they had never seen him as a boy but they expressed themselves as agreeably surprised that the long period he had passed knocking about among rough people in the states had in no way affected him unfavourably his manners were particularly good his appearance was altogether in his favour he was a true cumberland man tall and powerful like his father and brother though somewhat slighter in build he was accompanied by his wife yes they had seen her they had both dined with them they had not been previously aware that mr tunstall was married their client mr edgar tunstall had not mentioned the fact to them they were not prepared to give any decided opinion as to mrs tunstall she had spoken but little and struck them as being nervous probably the position was a novel one for her there were they understood no children messrs randolph father and son oldfashioned practitioners had from the first considered the scruples of their agents in san francisco to be absurd mr tunstall had presented himself as soon as they had advertised he had produced the letters of his brother as proof of his identity and had offered to bring forward witnesses who had known him for years as william tunstall what on earth would they have had more than that mr tunstall had had reason already for resentment and it was not surprising that he had refused to set out at once for england when he found his identity so absurdly questioned so they had immediately sent off the abstract of the will and a copy of edgar tunstalls letter and were much gratified when in due time mr tunstall had presented himself at their office and had personally announced his arrival it was indeed a relief to them for had he not arrived various difficulties would have arisen as to his moiety of the estate there being no provision in the will as to what was to be done should he refuse to accept it moreover application must have been made to the court for the appointment of fresh guardians for the boy altogether they were glad that a business that might have been troublesome was satisfactorily settled mr tunstall after introducing himself had produced the letters he had received from his brother with the abstract of the will and copy of the letter they had sent him he had said smilingly i dont know whether this is sufficient gentlemen for i am not up in english law if it is necessary i can of course get a dozen witnesses from the states to prove that i have been always known as william tunstall though i generally passed as is the custom there under a variety of nicknames such as english bill stiff bill and a whole lot of others it will naturally take some little time and great expense to get witnesses over especially as men are earning pretty high wages in california at present but of course it can be managed if necessary i do not see that there is any necessity for it mr randolph said besides no doubt we shall find plenty of people here to identify you i dont know that mr randolph you see i was little more than a boy when i went away i had been at rugby for years and often did not come home for the holidays twenty years have completely changed me in appearance and i own that i have but a very faint recollection of byrneside of course i remember the house itself and the stables and grounds but as to the neighbours i dont recollect any of them neither my brother nor myself dined in the parlour when my father had dinner parties but it seems to me that after all the best proof of my identity is my correspondence with my brother certainly he would not have been deceived by any stranger and the fact that we exchanged letters occasionally for some years seems to me definite proof that he recognized me as his brother undoubtedly so mr randolph said that in itself is the strongest proof that can be brought we mentioned that in our letter to mr campbell in san francisco his doubts appeared to us i may say to be absurd not altogether absurd mr randolph california has been turned pretty well topsyturvy during the last four or five years and he was not to be blamed for being suspicious may i ask you if you have come across my letters to my brother among his papers no we have not done so in fact your brother told us that he had not preserved them for as you were wandering about constantly the addresses you gave were no benefit and that beyond the fact that you were in california he had no idea where you could be found that is why it became necessary to advertise for you it is unfortunate that he did not keep them mr randolph for in that case of course i could have told you most of their contents and that would have been an additional proof of my identity there is not the least occasion for it mr tunstall we are perfectly and entirely satisfied mr edgars recognition of you as his brother your possession of his letters the fact that you answered at once to the advertisement in california your knowledge of your early life at rugby and so on all tend to one plain conclusion in fact no shadow of doubt was entertained by my son or myself from the first i congratulate you very heartily on your return because to some extent the very hard treatment which was dealt to you by your father mr philip tunstall has now been atoned for of course you only received a short abstract of your brothers will the various properties which fall to you are detailed in full in it byrneside itself goes to his son but against that may be set off a sum invested in good securities and equal to the value of the house and home park so that you can either build or purchase a mansion as good as byrneside we may tell you also that the estates were added to in your fathers time and that other properties have been bought by your brother who owing to the death of his wife and the state of his health has for some years led a very secluded life investing the greater part of his savings in land so that in fact your moiety of the estates will be quite as large as the elder sons portion you might have expected to receive in the ordinary course of events what sort of boy is my nephew mr randolph i have seen him two or three times when i have been over at byrneside of course i did not notice him particularly but he is a bright lad and promises to grow into a very fine young man i fancy from something his father let drop that his disposition resembles yours he is very fond of outdoor exercises knows every foot of the hills round byrneside and though but eleven or twelve years old he is perfectly at home on horseback and he is a good shot he has in fact run a little wild his father spoke of him as being warmhearted and of excellent impulses but lamented that like you he was somewhat quicktempered and headstrong edgar ought not to have selected me for his guardian mr randolph i said almost as much mr tunstall when i drew out the will but mr edgar remarked that you had doubtless got over all that long ago and would be able to make more allowance for him and to manage him far better than anyone else could do i shall try and merit edgars confidence mr randolph i have suffered enough from my headstrong temper and have certainly learnt to control it i shall not be hard upon him never fear are you going over to byrneside at once mr tunstall no i shall go up to london tomorrow morning i want a regular outfit before i present myself there for inspection besides i would rather that you should give notice to them at byrneside that i have returned it is unpleasant to arrive at a place unannounced and to have to explain who you are perhaps you would like to see the will and go through the schedule not at all mr randolph there will be plenty of time for that after my return you will excuse my asking if you want any money for present use mr tunstall no thank you i am amply provided i was doing very well at the diggings when your letters called me away and i have plenty of cash for present purposes you will i hope dine with us today mr tunstall i thank you i should have been very happy but i have my wife with me i have left her at the bull oh indeed i was not aware that i was married yes i have been married for some years i did not think it necessary to mention it to edgar as he would only have used it as an additional argument why i should accept his generous offers we shall be very glad mrs randolph and myself if you will bring mrs tunstall with you and so mrs tunstall came she was a dark woman and as mr randolph and his wife agreed was probably of mexican or spanish blood and spoke english with a strange accent she had evidently at one time been strikingly pretty though now faded she had rather a worn hard expression on her face and impressed mr randolph his wife son and daughterinlaw less favourably than the lawyer had thought it right to say to those who made inquiries about her but she had as they said spoken but little and had seemed somewhat nervous and ill at ease mr tunstall did not appear for some time at byrneside he went down to rugby to see his nephew who had in accordance with his fathers wish been placed there a month or two after his death the holidays were to begin a week later and hugh was delighted when his uncle told him that he and his aunt were thinking of going to the continent for a few months before settling down at byrneside and would take him with them hugh was very much pleased with his new relative he is a splendid fellow he told his schoolboy friends awful jolly to talk to and has been doing all sorts of thingsfighting indians and hunting buffalo and working in the gold diggings of course he didnt tell me much about them there wasnt time for that he tipped me a couple of sovs i am sure we shall get on firstrate together and so during the summer holidays hugh travelled with his uncle and aunt in switzerland and italy he did not very much like his aunt she seemed to try to be kind to him and yet he thought she did not like him his uncle had taken him about everywhere and had told him lots of splendid yarns at christmas they would be all together at byrneside his uncle had been very much interested in the place and was never tired of his talk about his rambles there he remembered the pool where his father had told him they both used to fish as boys and about harry gowan the fisherman who used to go out in his boat and who was with them when that storm suddenly broke when the boat was wrecked on the island and they were all nearly drowned he was very glad to hear that gowan was still alive and that james wilson who was then under stableman and used to look after their ponies was now coachman and that sam the gardeners boy who used to show them where the birds nests were was now headgardener and that mr holbeach the vicar was still alive and so was his sister miss elizabeth and that in fact he remembered quite well all the people who had been there when he was a boy altogether it had been a glorious holiday his uncle and aunt returned with him when it was over the former saying he had had enough of travelling for the present and instead of being away as he had intended for another couple of months he should go down home at once they went with him as far as rugby dropped him there and then journeyed north on their arrival at byrneside where they had not been expected mr tunstall soon made himself extremely popular scarcely had they entered the house when he sent out for james the coachman and greeted him with the greatest heartiness i should not have known you james he said and i dont suppose you would have known me no sir i cannot say as i should you were only a slip of a lad then though you didnt think yourself so no i should not have known you a bit twenty years makes a lot of difference jim ah we had good fun in those days dont you remember that days ratting we had when the big stack was pulled down and how one of them bit you in the ear and how you holloaed i remember that sir mr edgar has often laughed with me about it and you remember how my poor brother and i dressed up in sheets once and nearly scared you out of your life jim ay ay i mind that too sir that wasnt a fair joke that wasnt no that wasnt fair jim ah well i am past such pranks now well i am very glad to see you again after all these years and to find you well i hear that sam is still about the old place and is now headgardener you may as well come out and help me find him while mrs tunstall is taking off her things sam was soon found and was as delighted as james at mr tunstalls recollection of some of their birdnesting exploits after a long chat with him mr tunstall returned to the house where a meal was already prepared you need not wait he said after the butler had handed the dishes i have not been accustomed to have a manservant behind my chair for the last twenty years and can do without it now he laid down his knife and fork with an air of relief as the door closed behind the servant well lola he said in spanish everything has gone off well yes she said i suppose it has in the same language it is all very oppressive i wish we were back in california again you used to be always grumbling there he said savagely i was always away from you and altogether you were the most illused woman in the world now you have got everything a woman could want a grand house and carriages and horses the garden and park what can you want more she shrugged her shoulders i shall get accustomed to it in time she said but so far i do not like it it is all stiff and cold i would rather have a little hacienda down on the del norte with a hammock to swing in and a cigarette between my lips and a horse to take a scamper on if i am disposed and you with me than live in this dreary palace baby you will get accustomed to it in time and you can have a hammock here if you like though it is not often that it is warm enough to use it and you can smoke cigarettes all day it would shock them if you were an englishwoman but in a mexican they will think it right and proper enough and you have got your guitar with you so you can have most of your pleasures and as for the heat there is sure to be some big glass houses where they grow fruit and flowers and you can have one of them fitted up with mexican plants and hang your hammock there and it wont need a very long stretch of imagination to fancy that you are at your hacienda on the del norte if you can manage that it will be nice the woman said anything can be managed in this country when we have got money to pay for it at any rate it will be a comfort to know that there is no fear of your being shot here every time you went away from me if it was only for a week or two i knew i might never see you again and that you might get shot by some of those drunken miners well i shall be free of all that now and i own that i was wrong to grumble i shall be happy here with you and i see that it was indeed fortunate that you found those papers on the body of the man you came across dead in the woods she looked closely at him as she spoke well that is a subject that there is no use talking about lola it was a slice of luck but there is an english proverb that walls have ears and it is much better that you should try and forget the past remember only that i am william tunstall who has come back here after being away twenty years she nodded i shall not forget it you know you always said i was a splendid actress and many a fool with more dollars than wit have i lured on and got to play with you in the old days at santa fe there there drop it lola he said the less we have of old memories the better now we will have the servants in or they will begin to think we have gone to sleep over our meal and he struck the bell which the butler when he went out had placed on the table beside him have you been over the house he asked when they were alone again not over it all the old womanshe called herself the housekeepershowed me a great room which she said was the drawingroom and a pretty little room which had been her mistresss boudoir and another room full of books and a gallery with a lot of ugly pictures in it and the bedroom that is to be ours and a lot of others opening out of it well i will go over them now with you lola of course i am supposed to know them all ah this is the boudoir well i am sure you can be comfortable here lola those chairs are as soft and easy as a hammock this will be your sanctum and you can lounge and smoke and play your guitar to your hearts content yes this is a fine drawingroom but it is a deal too large for two of us though in summer with the windows all open i daresay it is pleasant enough having made a tour of the rooms that had been shown lola they came down to the hall again now let us stroll out into the garden he said you will like that he lit a cigar and lola a cigarette the latter was unfeignedly delighted with the masses of flowers and the beautifully kept lawns and the views from the terrace with a stretch of fair country and the sea sparkling in the sunshine two miles away here comes the headgardener lola my old friend this is sam lola he said as the gardener came up and touched his hat you know you have heard me speak of him my wife is delighted with the garden sam she has never seen an english garden before it is past its best now sir you should have seen it two months ago i dont think it could be more beautiful lola said there is nothing like this in my country we have gardens with many flowers but not grass like this so smooth and so level does it grow no higher oh it grows fast enough and a good deal too fast to please us and has to be cut twice a week i see you are looking surprised at my wife smoking william tunstall said with a smile in her country all ladies smoke show her the greenhouses i think they will surprise her even more than the garden the long ranges of greenhouses were visited and sam was gratified at his new mistresss delight at the flowers many of which she recognized and still more at the fruitthe grapes covering the roofs with black and yellow bunches the peaches and nectarines nestling against the walls the early sorts are all over sam said but i made a shift to keep these back though i did not think there was much chance of any but the grapes being here when you got back as we heard that you would not be home much before christmas we changed our mind you see sam and i am glad we did for if we had come then mrs tunstall would have been frightened at the cold and bleakness ill tell you what i want done sam i want this conservatory next the house filled as much as possible with mexican and south american plants of course you can put palms and other things that will stand heat along with them i want the stages cleared away and the place made to look as much like a room as possible mrs tunstall will use it as a sittingroom i think we shall have to put another row of pipes in mr william those plants will want more heat than we have got here then we must put them in my wife will not care how hot it is but of course we dont want tropical heat i should put some rockery down the side here to hide the pipes and in the centre we will have a fountain with water plants a foot or two below the level of the floor and a low bank of ferns round that is the only change as far as i can see that we shall want in the house i shall be going over to carlisle in a day or two and ill arrange with somebody there to make the alterations very well mr william if you will get some masons to do the rockery and fountain i can answer for the rest but i think i shall need a good many fresh plants we are not very strong in hot subjects mr edgar never cared for them much if you will make out a list of what you want and tell me who is the best man to send to sam i will order them as soon as you are ready to put them in and so when hugh returned at christmas for the holidays he was astonished at finding his aunt swinging in a hammock smoking a cigarette slung near a sparkling little fountain and surrounded by semitropical plants the smoking did not surprise him for he had often seen her with a cigarette during their trip together but the transformation of the conservatory astonished him well hugh what do you think of it she asked smiling at his surprise it is beautiful he said it isnt like a greenhouse it is just like a bit out of a foreign country that is what we tried to make it hugh you see on the side next to the house where there is a wall we have had a mexican view painted with a blue sky such as we have there and mountains and a village at the foot of the hills as i lie here i can fancy myself back again if i dont look up at the sashes overhead oh how i wish one could do without them and that it could be covered with one great sheet of glass it would be better hugh admitted but it is stunning as it is uncle told me as he drove me over from carlisle that he had been altering the conservatory and making it a sort of sittingroom for you but i never thought that it would be like this what are those plants growing on the rocks those are american aloes they are one of our most useful plants hugh they have strong fibres which we use for string and they make a drink out of the juice fermented it is called pulque and is our national drink though of late years people drink spirits too which are bad for them and make them quarrelsome during the holidays hugh got over his former dislike for his aunt and came to like her more than his uncle she was always kind and pleasant with him while he found that although his uncle at times was very friendly his temper was uncertain the want of some regular occupation and the absence of anything like excitement told heavily upon a man accustomed to both at first there was the interest in playing his part of meeting people who had known him in his boyhood of receiving and returning the visits of the few resident gentry within a circuit of ten miles of avoiding mistakes and evading dangers but all this was so easy that he soon tired of it he had tried to make lola contented and yet her lazy contentment with her surroundings irritated him she had created a good impression upon the ladies who had called the expression of her face had softened since her first visit to carlisle and the nervous expression that had struck mr randolph then had disappeared her slight accent and the foreign style of her dress were interesting novelties to her visitors and after the first dinnerparty given in their honour at which she appeared in a dress of dull gold with a profusion of rich black lace she was pronounced charming her husband too was considered to be an acquisition to the county everyone had expected that he would have returned after so long an absence rough and unpolished whereas his manners were quiet and courteous he was perhaps less popular among the sturdy cumberland squires than with their wives he did not hunt he did not shoot i should have thought one of his neighbours said to him that everyone who had been living a rough life in the states would have been a good shot a good many of us are good shots perhaps most of us but it is with the pistol and rifle shotguns are not of much use when you have a party of redskins yelling and shooting round you and it is not a handy weapon to go and fetch when a man draws a revolver on you as to shooting little birds it may be done by men who live on their farms and like an occasional change from the bacon and tinned meat that they live on from years end to years end out there a hunter is a man who shoots gamei mean deer and buffalo and bear and other animalsfor the sake of their skins although of course he does use the meat of such as are eatable with us a good shot means a man who can put a ball into a redskins body at five hundred yards certain and who with a pistol can knock a pipe out of a mans mouth ten yards away twenty times following and it isnt only straightness of shooting but quickness of handling that is necessary a man has to draw and cock and fire in an instant the twinkling of an eye makes the difference of life or death oh yes i am a good shot but not in your way i went away from here too young to get to care about tramping over the country all day to shoot a dozen or two of birds and i have never been in the way of learning to like it since i wish i had for it seems an important part of country life here and i know i shall never be considered as a credit to the county unless i spend half my time in winter riding after foxes or tramping after birds but i am afraid i am too old now ever to take to those sports i heartily wish i could for i find it dull having no pursuit when a man has been earning his living by hunting or gold digging or prospecting for mines all his life he finds it hard to get up in the morning and know that there is nothing for him to do but just to look round the garden or to go out for a drive merely for the sake of driving when summer came mr tunstall found some amusements to his taste if there was a wrestling match anywhere in the county or in westmoreland he would be present and he became a regular attendant at all the racecourses in the north of england he did not bet as he said to a sporting neighbour who always had a tenpound note on the principal races i like to bet when the chances are even or when i can match my skill against another mans but in this horseracing you are risking your money against those who know more than you do unless you are up to all the tricks and dodges you have no more chance of winning than a man has who gambles with a cheat who plays with marked cards i like to go because it is an excitement besides at most of the large meetings there is a little gambling in the evening in mexico and california everyone gambles more or less it is one of the few ways of spending money and i like a game occasionally the result was that mr tunstall was seldom at home during the summer when hugh came home his aunt said i have been talking to your uncle about you and he does not care about going away this year he has taken to have an interest in horseracing of course it is a dull life for him here after leading an active one for so many years and i am very glad he has found something to interest him i should think that it is very dull for you aunt i am accustomed to be alone hugh in countries where every man has to earn his living women cannot expect to have their husbands always with them they may be away a month at a time up in the mountains or at the mines or hunting in the plains i am quite accustomed to that but i was going to talk about you i should like a change and you and i will go away where we like not of course to travel about as we did last year but to any seaside place you would like to go to we need not stop all the time at one but can go to three or four of them i have been getting some books about them lately and i think it would be most pleasant to go down to devonshire there seem to be lots of pretty wateringplaces there and the climate is warmer than in the towns on the east coast i should like it very much aunt but i should like a fortnight here first if you dont mind my pony wants exercise terribly jim says he has been out at grass for months now besides i shall forget how to ride if i dont have some practice so for the next fortnight hugh was out from morning until night either riding or sailing with gowan and then he went south with his aunt and spent the rest of his holidays in devonshire and cornwall he had a delightful time of it his aunt allowing him to do just as he liked in the way of sailing and going out excursions she always took rooms overlooking the sea and was well content to sit all day at the open window seldom moving until towards evening when she would go out for a stroll with hugh occasionally she would take long drives with him in a ponycarriage but she seldom proposed these expeditions as hugh several times met with schoolfellows and always struck up an acquaintance a few hours after arriving at a place with some of the boatmen and fishermen he never found it dull at first he was disposed to pity his aunt and to urge her to go out with him but she assured him that she was quite contented to be alone and to enjoy the sight of the sea and to breathe the balmy air i have not enjoyed myself so much hugh she said when the holidays were drawing to a close since i was a girl i am awfully glad of that aunt i have enjoyed myself tremendously but it always seems to me that it must be dull for you you english never seem to be happy unless you are exerting yourselves hugh but that is not our idea of happiness people in warm climates find their pleasure in sitting still in going out after the heat of the day is over for a promenade and in listening to the music just as we have been doing here besides it has been a pleasure to me to see that you have been happy when the summer holidays had passed away hugh returned to rugby and lola went back to cumberland illustration chapter iv an explosion at christmas hugh found that things were not so pleasant at home there was nothing now to take his uncle away from byrneside and the dullness of the place told upon him his outbursts of illtemper were therefore more frequent than they had been the last holidays hugh had spent at home he sat much longer in the diningroom over his wine after his wife and hugh had left him than he did before and was sometimes moody sometimes badtempered when he joined them hughs own temper occasionally broke out at this and there were several quarrels between him and his uncle but there was a savage fierceness in the latters manner that cowed the boy and whatever he felt he learned to hold his tongue but he came more and more to dislike his uncle especially as he saw that when angry he would turn upon his aunt and speak violently to her in her own language sometimes she would blaze out in return but generally she continued to smoke her cigarette tranquilly as if utterly unconscious that she was spoken to so for the next two years matters went on during the summer holidays hugh seldom saw his uncle who was more and more away from home being now a constant attendant at all the principal racecourses in the country even in winter he was often away in london to hughs great satisfaction for when he was at home there were frequent quarrels between them and hugh could see that his uncle habitually drank a great deal more wine than was good for him indeed it was always in the evening that these scenes occurred at other times his uncle seemed to make an effort to be pleasant with him in summer hugh went away with his aunt for a time but he spent a part of his holidays at byrneside for of all exercises he best loved riding his pony had been given up but there were plenty of horses in the stables for although william tunstall did not care for hunting he rode a good deal and was an excellent horseman what have you got in the stable james hugh asked one day on his return from the school i have got a set of the worsttempered devils in the country master hugh except them two ponies that i drives your aunt out with there isnt a horse in the stables fit for a christian to ride they are all good horses firstrate horses putting aside their tempers but your uncle seems to delight in buying creatures that no one else will ride of course he gets them cheap he doesnt care how wicked they are and he seems to enjoy it when they begin their pranks with him i thought at first he would get his brains dashed out to a certainty but i never saw a man keep his seat as he does he told me once that when a man had been breaking bronchosthat is what he called them which means he said wild horses that had never been backedhe could sit anything and that english horses were like sheep in comparison of course it is no use saying no to you master hugh but if you want to go out you must stick to that big meadow you must mount there and you must promise me not to go beyond it i have been letting the hedges grow there on purpose for the last two years and no horse will try to take them the ground is pretty soft and you will fall light you have been getting on with your riding the last three years and have had some pretty rough mounts but none as bad as what we have got in the stables now i shall always go out with you myself with one of the men in case of accident and i can put you up to some of their tricks before you mount hugh was more than fifteen now and was very tall and strong for his age he had ridden a great deal when he had been at home during the summer and in the winter when the weather was open and had learned to sit on nastytempered animals for these had gradually taken the place of his fathers steady hunters but this year he found that the coachmans opinion of those now under his charge was by no means exaggerated in spite of doing his best to keep his seat he had many heavy falls being once or twice stunned but he stuck to it and by the end of the holidays flattered himself that he could ride the worsttempered animal in the stable he did not go away this year begging his aunt to remain at home it is a splendid chance of learning to ride well aunt he said if i stick at it right through these two months every day i shall really have got a good seat and you know it is a lot better my getting chucked off now than if i was older you see boys bones aint set and they hardly ever break them and if they do they mend up in no time his aunt had at first very strongly opposed his riding any of the animals in the stable and he had been obliged to bring in james to assure her that some of them were not much worse than those he had ridden before and that a fall on the soft ground of the meadow was not likely to be very serious but it was only on his giving her his solemn promise that he would not on any account go beyond the meadow that she finally consented on his return at christmas he found his uncle at home and apparently in an unusually pleasant humour a frost had set in that seemed likely to be a long one and the ground was as hard as iron i hear hugh his uncle said the second morning at breakfast that you are becoming a firstrate rider i am glad to hear it out in the western states every man is a good rider you may say that he lives on horseback and it comes natural even to boys to be able to sit barebacked on the first horse that comes to hand of course it is not so important here still a man who is a really good rider has many advantages in the first place all gentlemen here hunt and a man who can go across any country and can keep his place in the front rank has much honour among his neighbours in the second place he is enabled to get his horses cheap a horse that will fetch two hundred if he is free from vice can be often picked up for twenty if he gets the reputation of being badtempered there is another accomplishment we all have in the west and that is to be good pistolshots as we cannot ride and there is nothing else to do i will teach you if you like hugh accepted the offer with lively satisfaction heedless of an exclamation of dissent from his aunt when he had left the room william tunstall turned savagely upon his wife what did you want to interfere for just attend to your own business or it will be the worse for you it is my own business she said fearlessly i like that boy and i am not going to see him hurt ever since you told me soon after we first came here that by his fathers will the whole property came to you if hugh died before he came of age i have been anxious for him i dont want to interfere with your way of going on lead your own life squander your share of the property if you like it is nothing to me when it is spent i am ready to go back to our old life but i wont have the boy hurt i have always accepted your story as to how you became possessed of the papers without question i know you have killed a score of men in what you call fair fight but i did not know that you were a murderer in cold blood anyhow the boy shant be hurt i believe you bought those horses knowing that he would try them and believing they would break his neck they havent but no thanks to you now you have offered to teach him pistolshooting it is so easy for an accident to take place isnt it but i warn you that if anything happens to him i will go straight to the nearest magistrate and tell him who you really are and that i am certain there was no accident but a murder the man was white with fury and advanced a step towards her have you gone mad he asked between his teeth by heavens no you wont she interrupted dont make the threat because i might not forgive you if you did do you think i am afraid of you you are not in california or mexico now people cannot be shot here without inquiry i know what you are thinking of an accident might happen to me too i know that any love you ever had for me has died out long ago but i hold to my life i have placed in safe handsnever mind where i have placed ita paper telling all the truth it is to be opened if i die suddenly and without sending for it in it i say that if my death is said to have been caused by an accident it would be no accident but murder and that if i die suddenly without visible cause that i shall have been poisoned do you think i dont know you and that knowing you i would trust my life altogether in your hands there that is enough we need not threaten each other i know you and now you know me we will both go our own way and she walked out of the room leaving her husband speechless with fury at this open and unexpected revolt half an hour later his dogcart was at the door and he left for london hugh was astonished when on his return from a walk down to gowans cottage he found that his uncle had gone up to town why i thought aunt he was going to be at home all the holidays and he said that he was going to teach me pistolshooting your uncle often changes his mind suddenly i will teach you pistolshooting hugh most mexican women can use a pistol in case of need i cannot shoot as he does but i can teach you to shoot fairly and after that it is merely a matter of incessant practice if you ever travel i daresay you will find it very useful to be able to use a pistol cleverly there are two or three revolvers upstairs and plenty of ammunition so if you like we will practise in the conservatory it is too cold to go out you had better go and ask james to give you some thick planks five or six of them to set up as targets if he has got such a thing as an iron plate it will be better still i dont want to spoil my picture the place is forty feet long which will be a long enough range to begin with half an hour later the sharp cracks of a revolver rang out in the conservatory and from that time to the end of the holidays hugh practised for two or three hours a day the carrier bringing over fresh supplies of ammunition twice a week he found at first that the sharp recoil of the revolver rendered it very difficult for him to shoot straight but in time he became accustomed to this and at the end of a fortnight could put every shot in or close to the spot he had marked as a bullseye after the first day his aunt laid aside her pistol and betook herself to her favourite hammock where sometimes touching her guitar sometimes glancing at a book she watched his progress at the end of the fortnight she said you begin to shoot fairly straight keep on hugh and with constant practice you will be able to hit a halfcrown every time in the west it is a common thing for a man to hold a copper coin between his finger and thumb for another to shoot at i have seen it done scores of times but it will take you some time to get to that you must remember that there is very seldom time to take a steady deliberate aim as you do when a man shoots he has got to shoot quickly now practise standing with your face the other way and then turn and fire the instant your eye catches the mark after that you must practise firing from your hip sometimes there is no time to raise the arm out in the west a man has got to do one of two things either not to carry a revolver at all or else he must be able to shoot as quickly as a flash of lightning i dont suppose i am ever going to the west aunt still i should like to be able to shoot like that for if one does a thing at all one likes to do it well illustration hugh practices shooting with his revolver and so to the end of the holidays the revolver practice went on steadily every morning hugh generally firing seventy or eighty cartridges he could not do this at first for the wrench of the recoil strained his wrist but this gained strength as he went on before he went back to school he himself thought that he was becoming a very fair shot although his aunt assured him that he had hardly begun to shoot according to western notions mrs tunstall had one day a year before this driven over to carlisle and somewhat to the surprise of mr randolph had called upon him at his office mr randolph she began i do not know anything about english law i want to ask you a question certainly my dear madam if a married woman was to leave a sealed letter in the hands of a lawyer could he retain possession of it for her even if her husband called upon him to give it up it is a nice question mrs tunstall if the lawyer was acting as the fiduciary agent of a lady he would at any rate see that her wishes were complied with whether he could absolutely hold the paper against the husbands claim is a point upon which i am not prepared at present to give an answer but anyhow there are ways of evading the law for instance he could pass it on to a third party and then unless the husband had been absolutely informed by his wife that she had handed over this document to him the husband would be powerless the lawyer would simply declare that he had no such document are you asking for your own sake mrs tunstall or in the interest of a friend in my own interest mr randolph i have a written paper here i have not signed it yet because i believe it is necessary to sign papers in the presence of witnesses it depends upon the nature of the paper mrs tunstall but in all cases it is a prudent step for then no question as to the authenticity can arise and it is not necessary for the witnesses of the signature to read the contents of the document by no means they simply witness the signature well mr randolph this is the document i want to leave in safe hands so that it can be opened after my death unless i previously request not by letter but by word of mouth that it should be returned to me i know of no one else to whom i could commit the paper which is in my opinion a very important one the only question is whether as you are mr tunstalls solicitor you would like to take it frankly without knowing the nature of the contents mrs tunstall i should certainly prefer not to undertake such a charge should it remain in my hands or rather in the hands of our firmfor we may sincerely trust that there would be no occasion for opening it until very many years after my deathit might be found to contain instructions which could hardly be carried out by a firm situated as we are with regard to mr tunstall i see that mr randolph there was a pause and then the lawyer said will you be going up to town shortly mrs tunstall yes in the course of a month or so i shall be passing through london with hugh will the matter keep until then certainly there is no great hurry about it but i wish the packet placed in safe hands where it would be opened in the event of my death unless i recall it before that in that case mrs tunstall i will give you the address of the firm who do my london business they are an old established firm of the highest respectability and the document will be perfectly safe in their hands until you demand it back or until they hear of your demise i will give you a letter of introduction to them accordingly when mrs tunstall went up to town the next time with hugh she called upon the firm of solicitors whose place of business was in essex street and upon reading mr randolphs letter which stated that she was the wife of one of his clients a gentleman of means she was courteously received and they at once agreed to take charge of any document she might place in their hands upon the understanding that if she did not write or call for it it should be opened when they heard of her death and its contents whatever they might be acted upon you will stand in the position of our client mrs tunstall and we will do all in our power to carry out your wishes as expressed in this document whatever it may be it is no unusual matter for a will to be left with us under precisely similar circumstances if the packet should be opened under the conditions i name mrs tunstall said you will probably not regret having undertaken its charge for i can assure you that it may put a considerable amount of business in your hands but how will you know of my death mr randolph or his successor would inform us of course we shall request him to do so and as soon as he knows of the event mrs tunstall added it is of the utmost importance that the paper should be opened as soon as possible after my death we will request mr randolph to inform us by telegraph immediately he receives the news but pardon me you look well and healthy and are young to be making such careful provisions for an event that may be far distant that may or may not be far distant she said but for certain important reasons i wish to be prepared for it at all points i will now sign it in your presence mr curtice i have not yet put my signature to it very well mrs tunstall two of my clerks shall witness your signature it may be many years before any question as to the authenticity of the signature may arise so i shall be a witness also the document was a lengthy one written on sixteen pages of foolscap two of the clerks were called in now if you will turn that last page down mrs tunstall so that its contents cannot be seen you can sign your name and we will witness it this was done now mrs tunstall if you will put a sheet of brown paper over the other sheets and place your initials on the margin at the bottom we will put ours so that no question can arise as to the whole of them forming part of the document signed by you now madam if you will fold it up and place it in this envelope i will attach my seal i presume you do not carry a seal no sir i think it would be more satisfactory that you should affix a seal of some sort no matter how common a thing it may be mr carter will you go up into the strand with this lady and take her to some shop where she can purchase a seal it does not matter what it is mrs tunstall any common thing with a bird or a motto or anything else upon it these things are not cut in duplicate therefore if you seal the envelope in two or three places with it and take the seal away with you it will be a guarantee to you should you ever require it to be returned that it has not been opened in the meantime i will get a small strongbox similar to those you see round the room and have your name painted on it when it is completed i shall put the envelope in it lock it up and place it in our strongroom downstairs the seal was purchased and fixed and mrs tunstall took her departure satisfied that she had left the document in safe hands mr curtice talked the matter over with his partner the latter laughed women love a little mystery curtice i suppose she has got a little property in her own right and does not mean to leave it to her husband and is afraid he may get hold of her will and find out how she has left it i dont think it is that mr curtice said although of course it may be i should say she was a foreignera spaniard or italian she spoke with a slight accent besides the thing extends over sixteen pages of foolscap that is likely enough if she made the will herself curtice she may have gone into a whole history as to why she has not left her money to her husband possibly but i dont think so you mark my words harris if that packet ever comes to be opened there will be some rum disclosures in it that woman was no fool and there is no doubt about her being thoroughly in earnest she said it was likely to give us some work when it was opened and i believe her i will write a letter to randolph and ask him to give us a few particulars about this client he has introduced to us when he received mr randolphs reply stating briefly the history of mr william tunstall the husband of the lady he had introduced to them mr curtice was more convinced than before that the delivery of this packet into his charge was not a mere freak and offered to bet his partner a new hat that the document was not merely a will but that it would turn out something altogether unusual mr randolph congratulated himself on his forethought when a year after mrs tunstalls visit mr tunstall came into the office i am just on my way up to town he said i wish you would let me have a couple of hundred in advance on the next rents certainly mr tunstall you have already had l on them you know yes i know but i have been a little unlucky lately and have got an account i want to settle by the way he said carelessly as he placed the banknotes in his pocketbook mrs tunstall asked me to get from you the letter or packet she left in your charge a letter mr tunstall i think there must be some mistake mrs tunstall has certainly left nothing whatever in my charge oh i suppose i misunderstood her i only made up my mind to start a short time before i came off and did not pay much attention to what she was saying but it was something about a letter and she mentioned your name there were half a dozen commissions she wanted me to execute for her in london and i suppose they all got mixed up together i daresay it is of no consequence one way or the other well thanks for the moneynow i am off i am very much afraid that william tunstall is a liar mr randolph said to himself thoughtfully after his client had left he has found out that his wife has intrusted some document or other to someone and he guessed naturally enough that she had most likely come to me with it and he played a bold stroke to get it i do not like the way he has fallen into of spending all his time going about the country to racecourses i dont believe he has been at home two months this year besides he sounded me last time he was here about raising a few thousands on a mortgage he is not turning out well i thought when he first came back that his wanderings had done him no harm no doubt i had been prepossessed in his favour by his refusal to accept edgars offers to divide the rents with him but i was too hasty i am afraid there will be trouble at byrneside it is very fortunate edgar put my name in as trustee for his son so that his share of the property is safe whatever happens to the other but i hate to see a man of a good old family like the tunstalls going wrong i wonder what this mysterious document his wife wanted to leave with me is it must be something of great importance or he would never have come to me and lied in order to get it into his hands it is a queer business hugh did not see his uncle when he was at home for the summer holidays his aunt seemed to take his absence as a matter of course dont you expect uncle home soon he asked her one day i never expect him she said quietly i think it a shame he stays away so leaving you all by yourself aunt hugh said indignantly i am accustomed to it by this time hugh and upon the whole i think perhaps he is better away than here while you are at home you see you do not get on very well together well aunt i am sure i dont want any rows i dont say you do hugh but still there are rows you see he is passionate and you are passionate and it is very much better you should be apart as for me i have always been accustomed to his being away from me a good deal ever since we married and it does not trouble me at all i would much rather have you all to myself your being here makes it a very pleasant time for me we ride together drive together and practise shooting together it is all a change to me for except when you are here i seldom stir beyond the gardens hugh had indeed no doubt that his aunt was more comfortable when his uncle was away for he heard from wilson that when mr tunstall was at home there were constant quarrels between him and his wife he aint like your father mr hugh ah he was a gentleman of the right sort not that your uncle is a bad master he is hasty if everything is not quite right but in general he is pleasant spoken and easy to get on with he is popular with the gentry though of late they have held off a bit i hear it said they dont hold to a gentleman spending all his life on the racecourses and leaving his wife by herself your aunt is well liked and would be better liked if she would only go abroad and visit but she never drives out unless when you are here and people have given up calling it is a bad job but i hope when you come of age mr hugh we shall have the old times back again when the tunstalls were one of the first families in the county and took the lead of pretty nigh everything well they have five years to wait for that wilson i am just sixteen now and i mean when i do come of age and am my own master to travel about for a bit before i settle down into a country squire well i suppose that is natural enough mr hugh though why people want to be running off to foreign parts is more than i can make out anyhow sir i hope you wont be bringing a foreign wife back with you there is no fear of thathugh laughedat least according to my present ideas but i suppose that is a thing no one can settle about until their time comes at any rate aunt is a foreigner and i am sure no one could be kinder or nicer than she is that she is mr hugh i am sure everyone says that still you see there is drawbacks her ways are different from the ways of the ladies about here and that keeps her apart from them she dont drive about and call and make herself sociable like nor see to the charities down in the village it aint as she doesnt give money because i know that whenever the rector says there is a case wants help she is ready enough with her purse but she dont go among them or know anything about them herself no mr hugh your aunt is a wonderful nice lady but you take my advice and bring home an english wife as mistress of the hall when he came home for the christmas holidays hugh found his uncle again at home for a time matters went on smoothly mr tunstall made an evident endeavour to be friendly with him talked to him about his life at school asked whether he wished to go to the university when he left and when hugh said that he didnt see any use in spending three years of his life there when he did not intend entering any of the professions and that he would much rather travel and see something of foreign countries he warmly encouraged the idea quite right hugh there is nothing opens a mans mind like foreign travel but dont stick in the great towns of course you will want a year to do europe after that strike out a line of your own if i had my time over again i would go into central asia or africa or some place where there was credit to be gained and some spice of adventure and danger that is just what i should like uncle hugh said eagerly and looking at his aunt for confirmation he was surprised to see her watching her husband intently beneath her halfclosed eyelids dont you think so aunt illustration hugh seizing a poker sprang at his uncle i dont know hugh she said quietly there is a good deal to be said both ways but i dont think we need settle it now you have another year and a half at school yet you know hugh went out skating that afternoon for it was a sharp frost as he was passing through the hall on his return he heard his uncles voice raised in anger in the drawingroom he paused for a moment he could not catch the words for they were spoken in mexican there was silence for a moment and he imagined that his aunt was answering then he heard a loud exclamation in mexican then a slight cry and a heavy fall he rushed into the room his aunt lay upon the hearthrug his uncle was standing over her with clenched hand you coward you brutal coward hugh exclaimed rushing forward and throwing himself upon his uncle he tried to force him back from the hearthrug for a moment the fury of his assault forced his uncle back but the latters greatly superior strength then enabled him to shake off his grasp and the moment he was free he struck the lad a savage blow across the face that sent him reeling backwards mad with passion hugh rushed to the fender and seizing a poker sprang at his uncle william tunstalls hand went behind him and as hugh struck he levelled a pistol but he was too late the blow came down heavily and the pistol exploded in the air as the man fell back his head came with terrible force against the edge of a cabinet and he lay immovable hughs passion was stilled in an instant he dropped the poker and leaned over his uncle the blood was flowing down his forehead from the blow he had given him but it was the injury to the back of the head that most alarmed the lad he lifted an arm and it fell heavily again he knelt down and listened but could hear no sound of breathing he rose to his feet and looked down white and trembling at the body i have killed him he said well he brought it on himself and i didnt mean it it was the cabinet that did it perhaps he is only stunned if he is he will charge me with trying to murder him well it is no use my staying here they will be here in a moment and he glanced at the door but the servants at byrneside were so accustomed to the sound of pistol shots that they paid no attention to it hugh picked up the weapon that had dropped from his uncles hand and put it in his pocket then glanced at his aunt and hesitated she will come round in time he muttered and i can do nothing for her then he walked out of the room turned the key in the door and took it with him he went out to the stable and ordered his horse to be saddled keeping in the stable while it was being done so that his white face should not attract notice as soon as the horse was brought out he leapt into the saddle and galloped off illustration illustration chapter v across the sea mr randolph was at dinner when the servant came in and said that young mr tunstall wished to speak to him he was in the library and begged the lawyer to give him two minutes conversation hugh was walking up and down the little room when he entered the old lawyer saw at once that something was wrong what is it hugh what is the matter lad a good deal is the matter mr randolph but i dont want you to ask me i am sure you will be glad afterwards that you didnt know you were a friend of my fathers sir you have been always very kind to me will you give me fifty pounds without asking why i want it certainly i will lad but in heavens name dont do anything rash anything that was to be done is done mr randolph please let me have the money at once you dont know how important it is you will know soon enough mr randolph unlocked his desk without a word and handed him ten fivepound notes then he said by the way i have gold if you would rather have it there were some rents paid in this afternoon i would much rather have gold mr randolph put the notes in the desk and then unlocked the safe would you rather have a hundred yes sir if you will let me have them the lawyer handed him a small canvas bag god bless you sir the lad said remember please whatever you hear it was done in selfdefence then without another word he opened the door and was gone why what is the matter my dear mrs randolph exclaimed as her husband returned to the diningroom why you are as pale as death i dont know what is the matter exactly he said hugh has borrowed a hundred pounds of me and has gone gone where has he gone to i dont know my dear i hope i sincerely hope he is going out of the country and can get away before they lay hands on him why what has happened i dont know what has happened i know things havent been going on well for some time at byrneside i am afraid there has been a terrible quarrel he begged me to ask him no questions and i was glad not to do so the less one knows the better but i am afraid there has been a scuffle all he said was just as he went out whatever you hear remember i did it in selfdefence but goodness gracious thomas you dont mean to say that he has killed his uncle i dont mean anything the lawyer said those were his words i am afraid it wont be long before we hear what he meant if they come to ask me questions fortunately i know nothing i shall say no word except before a magistrate and then my story is simple enough he came and asked me to let me have l and as i was his trustee and have the rents of his estate for the past five years in my hands i let him have it as a matter of course i did not ask him why he wanted it i saw that he was agitated and from his manner and from my knowledge that he and his uncle did not get on very well together i judged there had been a quarrel and that he intended to leave home for a while it was only when he was leaving the room that i gathered there had been any personal fracas and then from his words it was done in selfdefence i judged that his uncle had struck him and that he had probably struck him in return i hope that is all my dear i pray heaven that it may be all hugh had dismounted just outside the town opened a gate leading into a field taken off his horses bridle and turned the horse in and closed the gate behind it then he had turned up the collar of his coat pulled his hat down over his eyes and made his way to the lawyers he had cooled down now but still felt no regret for what had passed he would have killed me he said to himself and i had no thought of killing him when i knocked him down anyhow he brought it on himself if he is dead and i am pretty sure he is i have no one to prove that it was done in selfdefence but if he is not dead he will give his own version of it when he recovers i know he is a liar and in his quiet manner he would be able to make everyone believe that i had attacked him without the least provocation he might even say that i fired the pistol that he knocked it out of my hand and that then i sprang on him and struck him down with his head against that cabinet either way i shall get years of imprisonment if i am caught but i dont mean to be caught if i can help it on leaving mr randolphs he proceeded to the railwaystation consulted the timetables and then took a thirdclass ticket to glasgow he bought a bradshaw and sitting down on a bench under a light turned to the advertisements of the sailing of steamers by the time he had done that the train came in it was a slow one stopping at every station he got out at the first station and paid the fare from carlisle then walked back to the town and took a secondclass ticket by the night mail for london arriving at euston he walked across to the docks whence he had found that a steamer started for hamburg at eight oclock and he would catch a transatlantic steamer that started the next day on his arrival at hamburg he went to the steamboat office and took a secondclass ticket to new york having done this he bought at a shop near the wharves a supply of clothes for the voyage placed them in a cheap german trunk and walked on board the steamer he was now he thought fairly safe from pursuit the hour at which he would arrive at the station at carlisle would be known and as the northern train was nearly due and someone answering to his description had taken a ticket to glasgow it would be at once suspected that he intended to sail by a steamer from that port no pursuit could be set on foot before the morning indeed it was probable that before the police took the matter fairly in hand it would be late in the afternoon it might then be another day before they picked up the clue that he had gone to glasgow and followed him there if a steamer had happened to start that morning or the day before it would be supposed that he had gone by it and they might telegraph across and search the ship for him when it arrived at new york if no steamer had started and they could obtain no clue to him in glasgow they would think that he had gone back to liverpool and would make search there watching all the steamers sailing they would in any case hardly suspect that he could have gone up to london across to hamburg and caught the steamer sailing from there indeed it would not have been possible for him to do so had he first gone up to glasgow as they would believe he had done as soon as the vessel was fairly under way hugh looked round on deck there was no distinction made between secondclass emigrants and steerage but it was easy to distinguish the two classes the secondclass kept somewhat together near the companion leading to their portion of the ship while the steerage passengers were well forward the number of the latter was not very large for the emigrant traffic across the atlantic was still carried principally in sailing ships the secondclass were composed chiefly of substantiallooking germans for the most part farmers going out with a small amount of capital to settle in the west there were two or three other young englishmen and with one of these named luscombe hugh struck up an acquaintance before he had been many hours on board he was a young man of about twenty and hugh soon learned from him that he was the son of a large landed proprietor in norfolk he had for a few months been in a crack regiment of hussars but had gone as he expressed it a fearful mucker his father had paid the greater portion of his debts but had refused to settle some that he considered debts of honour luscombe therefore sold out and was now as he expressed it going over to knock about for a bit in the states till his father took a sensible view of things it was rough on him he said for i had run him up a pretty heavy bill twice before however i think it is all for the best i should never have got out of that line if i had stopped in the regiment two or three years knocking about and hard work wont do me any harm and by that time the governor will be prepared to receive the prodigal son with open arms hugh was slower in giving his confidence but before the voyage was over he had told luscombe why he had left england well you did quite right of course luscombe said in knocking that brute of a fellow down and if you did split his skull and make your aunt a widow you have nothing to reproach yourself with still i agree with you that it will be more pleasant for you if he gets round as i daresay he will or else it will be a long while before you can show up at home well you will know by the time we have been in new york a few days if the papers the next mail brings out dont say anything about it you may be sure he has got over it a gentleman killed by his nephew would be a startling heading and if it is not there you may go about your work with a light heart the voyage was marked by no incident whatever on arriving at new york luscombe and hugh put up at a good hotel for a few days before making a start west they had agreed to keep together at any rate for a time luscombe was several years older than hugh but he saw that the lad had plenty of good sense and a fund of resolution and knew that he himself was more likely to stick to work in such companionship than he should be by himself luscombes lighthearted carelessness amused hugh and though he did not think that his companion was likely to stick very long to anything he took up he was very glad to have his companionship for a time hugh was thankful indeed when the next mail brought a batch of papers of a date a week later than that of his leaving cumberland and when a careful examination of the file disclosed no allusion whatever to the event at byrneside well i congratulate you hugh luscombe said when he told him i expected it would be all right if he had been a good old man you would have killed him no doubt but bad men have always wonderfully thick skulls well now you are ready i suppose to make our start tomorrow quite ready luscombe we are only throwing away our money here they had already made many inquiries and had settled that they would in the first place go down to texas and would there take the first job of any kind that offered itself keeping it until they had time to look round and see what would suit them best luscombe however said frankly that he thought it probable that sooner or later he should enlist in the cavalry out west i know i shall never stick to hard work very long hugh i have not got my fortune to make and i only want to pass away the time for a year or two until the old lady and the girls get the governor into a charitable state of mind again he is a firstrate fellow and i am not surprised that he cut up rough at last i expect a few months will bring him round but i should not know what to do if i went back i will give myself three years anyhow i am very much in the same position luscombe i shant go back until i come of age then i can snap my fingers at my uncle i have got a very good trustee who will look after the estate i will write to him tonight and let him know that i am all right and very glad to find that uncle has not been killed and that he may expect me when i come of age but not before on the following morning they took their places in the train and travelled west and proceeded to what was then the nearest terminus to their destinationnorthern texas travelling sometimes by stagewaggons sometimes on foot they arrived at mkinney which they had been told was a young place but growing fast well here we are at last luscombe said as they alighted at a onestoried building on which was a board roughly painted the empire hotel at any rate the scenery is better than it has been for the last two or three hundred miles there are some goodsized hills some of those across the country ahead might almost claim to be mountains and that is a relief to the eyes after those dreary flats well let us go in and have a meal first then we will look round the place has certainly not an imposing aspect the meals here as at the other places where they had stopped consisted of fried steak which although tough was eatable and abundance of potatoes and cabbages followed by stewed fruit they had arrived just at the dinnerhour and seven or eight men in their shirtsleeves came in and sat down with them the tea was somewhat better than that they had hitherto obtained and there was in addition the luxury of milk scarcely a word was spoken during the meal it was evidently considered a serious business and the chief duty of each man was to eat as much as possible in the shortest possible time after the meal was over and the other diners had gone out the landlord who had taken his seat at the top of the table opened the conversation are you thinking of making a stay here gentlemen yes if we can get any work to suit us luscombe said it is a rising place the landlord said as he lit his pipe there are two stores and eight houses being built now this town has a great future before it luscombe and hugh had some difficulty in preserving their gravity it is the chief town of the county the landlord went on they are going to set about the courthouse in a month or two our sheriff is a pretty spry man and doesnt stand nonsense we have an orderly population sir we had only two men shot here last week that is satisfactory luscombe said dryly we are peaceable characters ourselves and is two about your average well i cant say that the landlord said that would be too much to expect the week before last buck harris with three of his gang came in and set up the town what do you mean by set up luscombe asked the landlord looked surprised at the question oh to set up a town is to ride into it and to clear out the saloons and to shoot at anyone seen outside their doors and to ride about and fire through the windows they had done it three or four times before and as four or five men had been killed the citizens became annoyed i am not surprised at that hugh put in the sheriff got a few men together and the citizens began to shoot out of their windows buck harris and two of his gang were killed and four of the citizens since then we have had quiet and what sort of work do you want gentlemen perhaps i could put you in the way of getting it well we wanted to get work among horses luscombe said the landlord shook his head you want to go further south among the big ranches for that this is not much of a horse country if you had been carpenters now there would have been no difficulty a good workman can get his four dollars aday then there is james pawsons woodyard i reckon you might get a job there one of his hands got shot in that affair with buck harris and another broke his leg last week i should say there was room for you there madden thats the man who was shot used to board here what is your charge for boarding landlord seventyfive cents aday for three square meals a dollar aday if you lodge as well but i could not lodge you at present i must keep a couple of rooms for travellers and the others are full but you will have no difficulty in getting lodgings in the town you can get a room for about a dollar aweek well let us try the woodyard luscombe all right luscombe said there is a certain sense of novelty about a woodyard well landlord if we agree with this mr pawson we will arrange to board with you at any rate for the present they went down the straggling street until they came to a lot on which was piled a quantity of sawn timber of various dimensions the name pawson was painted in large letters on the fence a man and a boy were moving planks here goes luscombe said and entered the gate want a job the man asked looking up as they approached him yes we are on the lookout for a job and heard there might be a chance here i am james pawson the man said and i want hands what wages do you want as much as we can get luscombe replied pawson looked them up and down not much accustomed to hard work i reckon not much luscombe said but we are both pretty strong and ready to do our best well i tell you what the man said i will give you a dollar and a half aday for a week and at the end of that time if you get through your work well i will raise it to two dollars luscombe looked at hugh who nodded all right he said we will try pawson gave a sigh of relief for hands were scarce take off your coats then he said and set to work right here there is a lot to be done luscombe and hugh took off their coats and were soon hard at work moving and piling planks before they had been half an hour at it there was a shout and a waggon heavily laden with planks entered the yard james pawson himself jumped up on to the wagon and assisted the teamster to throw down the planks while the other two carried them away and stacked them both of them had rolled up their sleeves to have a freer use of their arms the sun blazed hotly down and they were soon bathed in perspiration they stuck to their work until six oclock but by that time their backs were so stiff with stooping that they could scarcely stand upright and their hands were blistered with the rough wood pawson was well satisfied with their work well he said you move about pretty spry you two do and handle the wood quickern most i see you will suit me if i shall suit you so i will make it two dollars aday at once i aint a man that stints half a dollar when i see hands work willing well that is not a bad beginning luscombe hugh said as they went to put on their coats we have earned a dollar hugh luscombe said and we have broken our backs and blistered our hands to say nothing of losing three or four pounds of solid flesh we did wrong to turn up our sleeves hugh said i had no idea that the sun was so strong why my arms are a mass of blisters so are mine luscombe said ruefully and they are beginning to smart furiously they will be in a nice state tomorrow let us stay at the hotel tonight hugh i feel so tired that i am sure i could never set out to look for lodgings after supper the next morning their arms were literally raw before starting to work they got some oil from the landlord and rubbed them it will be some time before i turn up my sleeves to work again luscombe said i have had my arms pretty bad sometimes after the first long days row in summer but i have never had them like this they worked until dinnertime and then luscombe went up to pawson and pulled up his sleeve i think he said you must let us both knock off for the day we are really not fit to work we darent turn up our sleeves and yet the flannel rubbing on them makes them smart so that we can hardly work besides as you said yesterday we are not accustomed to work we are so stiff that we are not doing justice either to ourselves or you if you have any particular job you want done of course we will come after dinner and do it but if not we would rather be off altogether your arms are bad pawson said i thought yesterday when you were working that being newcomers you would feel it a bit certainly you can knock off you aint fit for it as you are take it easy boys for a few days till you get accustomed to it we aint slavedrivers out here and i dont expect nothing beyond what is reasonable i should get my arms well rubbed with oil at once then tonight wash the oil off and give them a chance to harden and in the morning powder them well with flour as soon as they had had their dinner they went out and found a room with two beds in it and moved their small kits across there then they took a stroll round the town of which they had seen little and then lay down in the shade of a thick cactus hedge and dozed all the afternoon the next morning they felt all the better for their rest the inflammation of their arms had greatly abated and they were able to work briskly what do you want with that revolver of an evening hugh when you do not wear it during the day luscombe asked as he saw hugh put his revolver in his pocket when they went to their lodgings for a wash after work was over for the day i take off my coat during the day luscombe and whatever may be the custom here i think it ridiculous to see a man at work in a woodyard with a revolver stuck into his pocket at the back of his trousers at night it is different the pistol is not noticed under the coat and i dont suppose there is a man here without one i think one is just as safe without a pistol luscombe said even these rowdies would hardly shoot down an unarmed man they might not if they were sober hugh agreed but most of this shooting is done when men are pretty nearly if not quite tipsy i heard my uncle say once a man may not often want to have a revolver on him when he does want a revolver he wants it pretty badly a few days later they heard at supper that three notorious ruffians had just ridden into the place i believe one of them is a mate of buck harris who was shot here three weeks ago i hear he has been in the bar swaggering about and swearing that he means to wipe out every man in the place who had a hand in that business the sheriff is away he went out yesterday with two men to search for a fellow who murdered a man and his wife somewhere down south and who has been seen down in the swamps of the east fork he may be away two or three days worse luck there is the undersheriff but he isnt much good by himself he can fight gilbert can but he never likes going into a row on his own account he will back up the sheriff in anything he does but he has got no head to take a thing up by himself but surely hugh said people are not going to let three men terrorize the whole place and shoot and carry on just as they like well mate i dont suppose we like these things more than anyone else but i can tell you that when one of the three men is dutch sam and another is wild harvey and the third is black jake it is not the sort of business as anyone takes to kindly seeing that if there is one thing more tarnal sartin than another it is that each of them is good to lay out five or six men before he goes under when things are like that one puts up with a goodish lot before one kicks they are three as ugly men as there are anywhere along this part of texas any one of them is game to set up a town by himself and when it comes to three of them together i tell you it would be a game in which i certainly should not like to take a hand you are new to these parts mate or you wouldnt talk about it so lightly when you have been out here for a few months you will see that it is small blame to men if they get out of the way when two or three fellows like this are on the warpath at this moment there was a sound of shouting and yelling with a clatter of horses hoofs outside then came the rapid discharge of firearms and the three upper panes of glass in the window were pierced almost simultaneously with small round holes in the very centres every one bent down over their plates the next shot might come through the second line of window panes in which case they would have taken effect among those sitting at the table then there was a yell of laughter and the horses were heard to gallop furiously away that is only their fun at present one of the men said it will be more serious later on when they have drunk enough to be savage i dont see much fun in firing through the windows of a house luscombe said oh that is nothing another put in i have seen a score of cowboys come into a place and half an hour afterwards there wasnt a windowpane that hadnt a round hole in its middle they will shoot the hats off a score of men that is one of their favourite amusements in the first place it shows their skill with the pistol and in the next it scares people pretty nigh to death and i have seen the cowboys laugh until they have nearly tumbled off their horses to see a fellow jump and make a straight line into a house nobody minds the cowboys they are a good sort they are reckless enough when they are on a spree but they dont really mean to do harm they spend their money freely and they hate ruffians like those three fellows outside if it wasnt for cowboys the bad men as we call them would be pretty well masters of texas but the cowboys hunt them down like vermin and i have known them hang or shoot over a dozen murderers and gamblers in one afternoon they fight among themselves sometimes pretty hard perhaps the men on two ranches will quarrel and then if it happens that a party from one ranch meets a party from the other down in a town there is sure to be trouble i remember one battle in which there were over twenty cowboys killed besides six or eight citizens who happened to get in the way of their bullets just as they had finished the meal a man ran in have you heard the news dutch sam and his party have broken open the door of the undersheriffs house pulled him out and put a dozen bullets into him there was an exclamation of indignation there hugh said if the undersheriff had done his duty and called upon every one to help him to capture or shoot these fellows as soon as they came into the town he wouldnt have lost his life and i suppose it will have to be done after all the best thing we can do one of the men said is to go round from house to house and agree that every man shall take his rifle and pistol and take his stand at a window then we will shoot them down as they ride past but that wouldnt be giving them a fair show another objected a fair show the other repeated scornfully did they give the undersheriff a fair show do you think they give notice to a man before they shoot him and ask him to draw and be fairly heeled before they draw a trigger not a bit of it and i say we ought to clear them out there was a general expression of approval and after one of the party had opened the door and looked out cautiously to see if the coast was clear and reported that none of the desperadoes were in sight the party at once scattered luscombe and hugh stopped for half an hour chatting with the landlord the latter did not believe that the people would attack the ruffians if the sheriff had been here to take the lead he said they might have acted but as he is away i dont think it likely that anyone will draw a bead upon them you see no one is sure of anyone else and he knows that if he were to kill or wound one of them the others would both be upon him if we had a regular street here with a row of houses running along each side so that a volley could be poured into them it would be a different thing but you see the houses are separated some stand back from the road some stand forward they are all scattered like and i dont expect anyone will begin they will be in here presently he said and they will drink my bar pretty well dry and i dont expect i shall get a dime for the liquor they drink and that is not the worst of it they are like enough to begin popping at the bottles and smashing more than they drink well it seems to me a disgraceful thing hugh said that a place with something like a hundred men in it should be kept down by three it sounds bad if you put it that way the landlord agreed but you must remember that each of these three men could hit every pip on a card twenty yards away they each carry two revolvers that is to say they have got twelve mens lives in their belt and they are so quick with their weapons that they could fire the twelve shots before an ordinary man could get out his revolver and cock it why not shut up your place for the night luscombe asked then they couldnt come in and drink your spirits and wreck your bar they couldnt eh why they would blow the door open with their pistols and if it was so barred they couldnt get in that way they would like enough burn the house about my ears i have known such things done many a time well let us get home hugh luscombe said it seems to me the sooner we are quietly in bed the better as our room is at the back of the house they may fire away as much as they like without a chance of our being hit hugh put on his hat and the two started down the street they had gone but a short distance when the sound of a horses hoofs was heard here is one of them a voice shouted from an upper window run round to the back of the house the door is open there i have heard two or three pistol shots and he will shoot you down to a certainty come on hugh luscombe said you go round luscombe you are unarmed i am not going to run away from anyone hugh said doggedly go on man it is no use your staying here you have no pistol i shant leave you by yourself luscombe said quietly besides here he comes hughs hand had already slipped round to his back and he now had his pistol in his hand in the pocket of his coat the horseman threw up his arm as he came along and hugh saw the glitter of the moonlight on a pistol barrel another instant the pistol cracked but hugh the moment he saw it bear on him dropped on to one knee and the ball struck the wall just above his head he lifted his arm and fired while two other shots rang out from the window the man threw up his hands and fell back over the crupper of his horse to the ground and the welltrained animal stopped instantaneously in his gallop and turning stood still by his side come on luscombe hugh said the sooner we are out of this the better before however they had gone twenty yards they heard the sound of two horses coming up behind them let us get round the corner of that house luscombe i dont suppose they will pass those men at the windows if they do they will be thinking of their own safety as they gallop past and wont notice us illustration when the cowboy fired hugh dropped on one knee they had scarcely got round the corner when there was a discharge of firearms and the reports of the rifles were followed by the quick sharp cracks of revolvers then a man dashed past them at a gallop one of his arms hung by his side and the reins were loose on the horses neck i suppose they have killed the other hugh said and this fellow is evidently hit well let us go on to bed luscombe did not speak until they reached their room hugh struck a match and lighted a candle well you are a nice lad hugh luscombe said i thought you were always against quarrels and wanted nothing but to go on with your work peaceably and here you are throwing yourself into this and standing the chance of being shot as if you had been fighting ruffians all your life it was he attacked me hugh said i didnt fire first i gave him no provocation and was not going to run away when i was armed it is you ought to be blamed stopping there to be shot at when you had no weapon i call it the act of a madman well there is nothing more to say about it so let us get into bed illustration illustration chapter vi a horse deal after having been at work for a week hugh and luscombe found it come comparatively easy to them their hands had hardened and their back and legs no longer ached with the exertion of stooping and lifting planks and beams they had now got the yard into order the various lengths and thicknesses of planks piled together and also the various sized timber for the framework of the houses their work was now more varied the dray had of course to be unloaded on its arrival from the mills and its contents stowed away and as soon as james pawson found that his new hands could be trusted to see after things he left them pretty much to themselves going up himself to the mill of which he was part owner it now fell to them to keep an account of the outgoings to see that the planks they handed over to purchasers were of the right lengths and thicknesses and also to saw the woodwork of the frames for the houses into their required lengths all this afforded a change and gave them an interest in their work and they came to know a good many not only of those living in the town but men who were taking up ground in the neighbourhood and who came in with their teams for planks and shingles to construct the rough houses which were to shelter them until at any rate they got their land under cultivation and things began to prosper three months after their arrival luscombe began to show signs of getting wearied of the work hugh was quick to notice it i can see you are getting tired of it he said one sunday as they started for a walk to a small ranche three miles away whose owner had been buying wood for a cowhouse and had asked them to come over for dinner you didnt mean me to see it but i know that it is so i dont know that i am tired hugh but i feel a restless sort of feeling well my dear luscombe i dont want you to feel that you are in any way bound here on my account we agreed that from the first you know it was a great thing our being together at first but now the ice is broken we have fallen into the groove and can either of us shoulder our kits and go where we like in search of a job we are no longer fresh from the other side of the atlantic i shall carry out my idea of enlisting luscombe said there is a military post at fort mkayett i can strike down by road to meridian i can get waggons as far as that pick up a horse for a few dollars there and then make my way down until i strike the colorado river and crossing that bear west stopping at cattle ranches until i get to the fort i shall be happier as a trooper than at any other work of course the pay is not high but that does not matter a rap to me it goes further here than it does at home and there is not much use for money out on the plains they say the indians are very troublesome and there will be some excitement in the life while here there is none i dont like leaving you hugh that is the only drawback dont let that stop you hugh said of course i shall be very sorry when you go but as you have your plans and i have none it would come at any rate before long and as i have said now that i have got over the feeling of strangeness i dont suppose that i shall stay here long after you have left the following day luscombe told his employer that he should leave at the end of the week i am sorry you are going he said but i expected that you would be on the move before long that is the worst of it out herenobody sticks to a job however i cannot blame you you have stopped a good bit longer than they generally do and are you going too he asked turning to hugh not just yet hugh replied but i do think of going in another week or two you see boss one is not learning anything here thats so say would you like to go up to the mill for a bit that is different sort of work and as you say you would be learning something one of the men jammed his hand on saturday and wont be fit for that kind of work for some time so as your mate is going off at the end of the week you can go up there if you like hugh gladly accepted the offer he would have felt it very dull without luscombe but by going to a different sort of work he would feel his companions departure less hardly he would have much to learn and be among new companions and have much to attend to so at the end of the week luscombe set out upon his long journey to fort mkayett and on monday morning hugh started for the sawmill at daybreak in a waggon that had come in on saturday afternoon with timber james pawson had told him that he had spoken to the foreman about him and the latter would know what to do with him the team consisted of two fine mules in the shafts and two horses ahead climb up the driver said we shall go a goodish pace till we get to the hills that is righthold on as he cracked his whip the animals started at a trot and presently broke into a gallop the road was nothing but a track across the country and hugh held on to the seat expecting every moment to be jerked off the track was as hard as iron but the passages of the waggons in wet weather had worn deep holes and ruts in it and hugh thought it was a miracle that the waggon did not upset and smash to pieces as the wheels went down first on one side and then on the other and the whole framework creaked and quivered with the shock at the end of about three miles the animals slackened their pace to hughs intense relief thats just their little play the driver said they know they wont get a chance again today and they generally lay themselves down for a gallop where it is good going do you call that good going hugh asked in astonishment sartin why it is level ground and not a watercourse to go over you dont expect a railway track graded and levelled do yer hugh hastened to say that he entertained no such extravagant ideas this road aint nowhere so to speak real bad the driver went on that is not for a hill road i dont say as there aint some baddish places but nothing to what i have driven teams over the animals had now dropped down into a walk although so far as hugh could see the track was no worse than that which they had been hitherto following the critters are just getting their breath the driver said as he proceeded to light his pipe they have had their fling and now they are settling down to the days work they know as well as i do what they have got before them dont you pete the mule addressed lifted one of its long ears and partly turned his head round they are fine mules hugh remarked you will see bigger than them thems mexicans and they have wonderful big mules in northern mexico i have seen them standing a hand higher than these but pete and bob are good mules they would be better if they were a bit heavier when it comes to a dead pull but except for that i would as lief have them as the biggest are they better than horses bettern horses you bet why i would rather have a pair of mules than three pair of horses why for steady work and for stay and for strength there aint no comparison between a mule and a horse why that pair of mules is worth twice as much as the best pair of horses you could find in texas except of course picked horses for riding if you pay a hundred dollars for a horse you have paid a long price in this country but that pair of mules wouldnt be dear at eight hundred for the two of them there is no trouble with mules they wont stray far when you turn them out they wont stampedenot if they are properly trained why there is as much sense in a mule as there is in a score of horses and the horses know it themselves if there is a mule turned out among a troop of horses he takes the lead natural and they will follow him wherever he goes knowing right well that he has got more sense than they have besides mules seem to get fond of each other and you dont see horses do that in a roundup the team horses will just mix up with the others you dont see two of them keep together or have any sort of friendship but if there are a pair of mules among the lot you will see them keep together i had an idea that mules were obstinate beasts i wont deny as they have their tempers sometimes but in most cases it comes from their getting into bad hands but treat a mule well and he will in general do his best when they once find they have got a job beyond them they aint going to break their hearts by trying to do it and if they are treated bad when there is no call for it then they puts up their backs and wont stir another foot and when they makes up their minds to that you may kill them and they wont do it then but treat a mule fair and kind and there is no better beast in the world you know all about it pete dont you and he gave the animal a slight flick on the neck with his whip to which it replied by throwing up its hindquarters and giving a playful kick which caused hugh whose legs were hanging down over the front of the waggon to withdraw them hastily you are a rascal pete the driver said come now you have all got your winds just sharpen up a bit till you get among the hills as if they understood what he said the mules threw their weight on the traces broke into a slow trot and the crack of the drivers whip woke the leaders into activity this pace was not kept up long for the ground had now begun to rise they presently entered a valley between two spurs of the hills and soon began to mount by a rough road this became steeper and steeper and hugh was glad to get off and walk in front at times the track they had to cross was bare rock so smooth and slippery that the animals could scarcely keep their feet and drag up the waggon then they wound along on the side of a hill the ground on one side being so much higher than on the other that it seemed to hugh that a loaded waggon would infallibly topple over and go rolling down into the valley below sometimes they descended sharply into some lateral ravine cut by a stream and climbed up the other side the hills now were covered with a growth of small trees and brushwoodthe larger timber had already been felled at last the waggon turned up the bed of a stream running through a rocky gorge here we are the driver said and fifty yards further they came upon the sawmilla roughlybuilt structure with a waterwheel a low loghut stood beside it beyond the valley opened out at the upper end its sides far up the hills were covered with trees but the woodmans axe had already stripped the lower part of the valley of all its timber trees a dam had been built across the stream and a leat cut to the waterwheel which was sunk five or six feet below the level of the ground around it and the tailrace continued nearly down to the mouth of the gorge where the water fell again into the old bed of the stream the wheel was revolving and the sound of the machinery inside the mill deadened that of the mules and waggon but a shrill whistle from the driver brought a man to the door he nodded to hugh you are the new hand the boss spoke of i suppose well clarkson have you brought the things we wanted yes i think the list is complete i gave it to the old man and he had all the things on board the first thing this morning here they are six pounds of tea a barrel of pork sack of flour keg of molasses twenty pounds of sugar here is a box of dried apples and the two crosscut saws he will see about a grindstone he thinks you might make that one last a bit longer it was pretty well worn out when it was put up the foreman grumbled it aint fit to grind axes on i told the boss the other day that it had cost him ten times its vally already because the men couldnt keep a sharp edge on their tools with it well you know ben grindstones dont grow down in mkinney and he has got to get them sent out from missouri if he had to get them from china he might have had one here by this time the foreman grumbled have you got that bag of iron dogs i wanted no there warnt one to be had in mkinney the old man told me to tell you he wrote off on saturday to little rock and told them to express them on a negro now came out from the hut and began to carry the provisions in and hugh followed the foreman into the mill there was another man there one side of the mill was open to a yard behind in which lay the logs as brought down by the team these were placed on rollers and so run into the mill one end of the log was then lifted by a screwjack until level with the sawbench here it was packed up and the jack then taken to the other end the machinery consisted solely of one large circular saw and of another of smaller size the waterpower would not have been sufficient to drive framesaws and the whole work had to be done with the circular saws the mill was not large but it sufficed for the wants of mkinney and the neighbourhood and two waggonloads of planks were sent down daily three axemen who felled and squared the trees and a teamster with four horses to drag the balks down to the mill completed the establishment hugh soon found that the work was far more interesting than it had been in the woodyard it needed a good deal of skill to handle the heavy pieces of timber and get them upon the sawbench although they were crosscut by the woodmen into lengths suitable for planks then the great saw cut the balks into planks three inches wide these were taken to the smaller saw which ran them down into half threequarter or inch planks as required the benches were of a primitive description the balks being laid on fixed rollers and the necessary movement given to them by a rope passed through blocks and taken round a shaft which as it revolved wound up the rope and brought the logs forward against the saw the noise at first of the saws and of the waterwheel and its machinery almost deafened hugh but he soon ceased to notice it he found that his duties were of a general kind he assisted in raising the logs to their place and in getting them properly placed on the rollers and then he helped to fix the blocks and pulleys to remove the planks as they were cut off and to work the log back to its place in readiness for another plank to be cut from it the small saw required one mans constant attention as the threeinch planks were simply pushed forward by hand against it being kept in their true position by guides you have got to be careful when you get near the end the foreman said to him or you will find yourself without a finger or two in no time when you get to within a foot of the end you must not push the plank any further but go to the other end of the saw and pull it to you it is a pretty rough business altogether but it will only last another few months there are not enough trees to supply it longer than that pawson has bought up another place a bit further among the hills and he has ordered a better plant than this and reckons it will be up and ready to run by the time we are done here this place aint fit for carrying on much trade when it was put up two years ago there were but few people about on the plain and a waggonload a week was about the outside pawson could get rid of i have been here from the first in those days we used to work with our rifles handy for there was always a chance of an attack by indians but the country has grown so much since then that the indians moved further north and dont bother us ah there is joes dinnerbell hugh following the example of the others went down to the millstream and gave his hands a rinse dried them on a towel hanging from a nail on the door of a hut and then went in in five minutes the whole party were assembled and took their seats on benches beside a long narrow table the negro cook brought in bowls of peasoup this was followed by boiled pork and potatoes and then came a great dish of dried apples boiled with molasses poured over them we get our board up here the foreman who had placed hugh beside him said i suppose the boss told you yes he said i should get forty dollars a month and my grub thats it it is better pay than you can get on a farm below but it is harder work and lonesome besides unless you are careful you run a pretty good risk of an accident there have been eight or ten fellows hurt here since we began it is healthy among the hills and we dont get fevers and it is cool enough to sleep comfortably at night even in summer but in winter it is cold i can tell you the old man feeds us pretty well i must say that for him and he is as good a boss as there is about here hugh liked the life the keen mountain air braced him up and every day he found it more and more easy to do his share of the work of moving the heavy balks the men as a whole were pleasant fellows and of an evening hugh listened with great interest to the stories they told as they smoked their pipes it was wonderful how many occupations most of them had followed two of them had been mining in california before they came down to texas one of them had been working with teams across the santa fe route another named bill royce had been a sailor had deserted his ship at galveston had enlisted and served for three years at a cavalry post west had deserted again had worked for two years as a cowboy on one of the texan ranches had gone down into mexico and worked at a ranche there had come up by sea to galveston working his passage had served as a farm hand for a few months and then after various experiences had come to mkinney when there were only three or four houses there another of the men had also worked as a cowboy but his experience had been but a short one i stopped just a week at it he said and what with being thrown off a horse twenty times a day and what with the work and what with the goingson of the boys i had enough of it by that time i had been in one or two indian fights and i didnt feel scared then but those cowboys scared me pretty nigh to death the way they let off their pistols was a caution four or five times when i was sitting quiet smoking bang and a revolver bullet would knock my pipe into chips and then they laughed fit to kill themselves when i got up and swore then without the least reason someone as we were all sitting round the fire would take it into his head to hit a little bit of flaming wood then half a dozen others would go at it and the bits of fire would be sent flying in all directions and how it was that none of them got killed was more than i could make out i stood it for the week and then i weakened i had got that nervous that i would jump if a fellow moved suddenly and i concluded that i was not made the same way as the cowboys and had better quit and take to some other job i reckon you were about right there bill royce said anyone as is thinking of going for a cowboy had best know how to ride how to throw a rope and how to draw his pistol as quick as lightning before he begins the next day hugh asked the teamster to bring him up from the town a rope such as the cowherders used this will do bill royce said as he examined it the cowboys and mexicans both use ropes sometimes but they chiefly make them themselves from strips of raw hide which they work and grease until they run almost as easy as if they were made of silk yes this is the right length forty feet some men will use fifty and i have known mexicans who would throw a sixtyfoot length with certainty but that is quite out of the way forty feet is the right length i will splice one end into an eye for you the other goes through it and makes a running noose when you throw it the loop is three or four feet across of course the better you can throw the smaller you can have the loop and the smaller it is the better for the jerk comes all the quicker before the horse or steer is prepared for it now you see that stump of a young tree sticking up two feet above the ground well you form your loop and you gather the rest in coils in your hand like this and you stand to begin with twenty feet away and you cast the loop over the stumpso of an evening when supper was over hugh went out and practised with the rope and at the end of a month found that he could throw it at a distance of thirty feet with a fair certainty of dropping the loop over the stump he also took royces advice as to the pistol he had laid it by since arriving at mkinney but he now got a belt similar to those worn by the cowboys and took to carrying the pistol in it but unloaded and at odd moments practised drawing from the belt levelling it and pulling the trigger with the greatest possible speed the action seemed simple enough but he was surprised to find how with practice the time taken in doing it diminished and his fingers came to close upon the handle in exactly the right position almost instantaneously and as his hand shot out his thumb drew back the hammer and his forefinger closed on the trigger all this he had practised before more or less when he had learned to use the weapon in the conservatory at byrneside but at that time it had not appeared probable the accomplishment would be of any use now he knew that his life might depend upon it and he came in time to be able to perform it with as royce had said something of the sleight of hand of a conjurer he devoted the whole of his spare time to practising with the pistol and rope and by the time that summer had gone hugh was able to throw the rope with certainty over any fixed object within reach and to draw his revolver with a quickness that astounded bill royce i have seen a lot of pistol shooting the latter said since i came out westcowboys and mexicans and horsethieves and such like but i have never seen one draw as quick as you do and there are many as draws quick you shoot fair but nothing out of the way theres many a cowboy kin shoot a sight straighter but for quick drawing you are wonderful and that is the great thing when one fellow gets his pistol out the other has got to cave in the valley was now pretty well cleared of its trees and the party prepared to go down to mkinney for the winter the woodcutters were to move at once to the new location and to begin to fell trees and as soon as the snow fell deep the teams would go up and drag them down to the new sawmill for the timber is hauled down much more easily over the snow than over the rough ground in summer thus there would be a big stock in readiness when the thaw came and the mill began to work in the spring hugh was not sorry when the work of the mill came to an end he had determined to remain until the season closed and he was glad he had done so the time had been by no means lost he had learned a good deal as to the ways and character of the men with whom he should have to associate he had from one or other of them picked up a great deal of knowledge about the country and knew the best places for making a start the towns from which most of the teams started and the localities that were best to make for in order to gain the heart of the cattle country he had learned to throw a rope with enough dexterity to aid him materially in any work he might undertake among cattle or horses and his constant practice with his revolver gave him a confidence in himself and in his ability to hold his own in the wild life of the plains and mountains in the nine months which had elapsed since he left england he had gained strength had become manly and selfreliant and felt that his apprenticeship had been of great value to him the first thing to do after he came down to mkinney was to look out for a horse he had been put up to a useful wrinkle in this respect by bill royce you be careful about any horse trade you make bet your boots that any horse that is offered to you here is stolen and you would get into one of the awkwardest of scrapes if you chanced to go into a district where that horse is known they dont trouble themselves to ask many questions over a stolen horse if you buy a horse the best thing to do is to go before a justice or the sheriff will do pay your money before him and get him to sign his name as a witness to the bargain his fee will be one or two dollars and you could not lay out the money better men aint altogether unreasonable even where a horse is concerned and a paper issued from a sheriffs office certifying that you had bought the horse and paid a fair price for it might save your neck from a noose you may ride a stolen horse all your life and never happen to light on the place he was taken from but if you do happen to light on it you may find yourself in a tight corner hugh put up at the hotel and having told the landlord that he was on the lookout for a horse the latter told him one evening when he returned from a visit to some friends at a farm that two men had come in an hour before and had said they had a good horse to dispose of bill royce was sitting in the saloon when hugh went in i dropped in to see you hugh i saw two fellows come in an hour ago on two likelylooking horses and they were leading two others one of which seemed to me as good a bit of horse flesh as i have seen fur a long time i expect they are on for a trade the horse is a mustang i dont expect they come by it honest but that aint your business and you will get it cheaper than if they had go slow in bargaining dont you let out you really want him presently two men came in they were dressed in broad hats red shirts over which they wore jackets with silver buttons breeches made of a soft leather and high boots they wore brightcoloured sashes round the waist they look pretty hard bill royce said quietly they may be anything they are not regular cowboys but they may have been working on a ranche they may have been prospecting they may be horsethieves they may be regular border ruffians anyhow they have got a horse to sell maybe they have stole it from a ranche maybe they have got it from the indians maybe they have wiped out its owner you will be able to tell pretty well by the price they want for it he would be cheap at two hundred dollars if he is anything like as good as he looks if they will take anything under that it is because they darent keep him after standing at the bar and talking for some time to the landlord one of the men came across to hugh i hear you are looking for a horse yes i am wanting to buy one if i find one to suit me at my price i have a horse to trade that would suit anyone and as to its price i am ready to let him go a bargain i should like to have a look at him hugh said well he is in the stable now yes but i should want to see him by daylight get on his back and try him look here the man said me and my mate are pressed for time perhaps we have got an appointment with the president perhaps we havent anyhow we want to go on we have got two spare horses and we dont wish to bother with them no further well i will look at the horse now hugh said and accompanied by bill royce he followed the man to the stables two horses were standing ready saddled and bridled hitched to hooks outside the shed inside were two others one was an ordinarylooking horse bony and angular a packsaddle hung on a beam close by he had evidently been used for carrying baggage the other was a handsome roan which snorted angrily as they approached with lanterns that is something like a horse the man said five years old strong and up to anything cleanlimbed full of courage and fast he has got a temper hugh said as the horse laid back his ears and made a sudden and vicious snap at the mans hand he is a bit playful the man said well i dont like buying him without trying him hugh said he may be up to all sorts of tricks and may kick his saddle over his head what do you want for him i tell you what the man said that horse would be dirt cheap at two hundred and fifty dollars but as i have told you we want to be moving on and i will sell him for a hundred and fifty i would rather put a bullet through his head than let him go for less than that well let us go back into the saloon and talk it over hugh said it is a rum way to buy a horse but i like his looks the other man was still standing at the bar when they entered hugh knowing that it would be an unheardof thing to buy a horse without the ceremony of taking drinks being performed went to the bar and ordered them for the four if i buy that horse he said it will be on one condition you see i dont know where he has come from the man you got him from may have stolen him and i might happen to come across the former owner and i havent any fancy for being strung up as a horsethief you dont mean stranger to say as we have stolen him one of the men said angrily not at all it may have gone through half a dozen hands before it came into yours and yet it may have been stolen of course if you know anyone here who can guarantee that you raised the horse or have owned him for a couple of years i shall be quite content but if you dont you can hardly expect me to take your word any more than i should expect them to take my word if a party were to ride up to me and accuse me of stealing it that is right enough isnt it landlord i dont see as there is anything to be said against that the landlord said it is a mighty unpleasant thing in this country to be found riding on the back of a horse that has mayhap been stolen what i propose is this hugh went on seeing that these gentlemen are strangers here i propose that i should call in the sheriff and james pawson who is a justice and that they should witness the sale and give me a signed paper saying that they know me as a resident here and that i have in their presence bought this horse i dont think there is anything unreasonable in that if at any time i am held up for stealing it i can show this paper and if they doubt it they can write to the sheriff here and find that it is genuine the two men exchanged a few words together in a low voice and then the one who had shown the horse said well i reckon that is a fair enough offer we know we came by the horse honestly but as we are strangers it is right enough you should be cautious bring your sheriff along and lets be done with it i will fetch the sheriff across royce said if you go over to pawsons hugh in five minutes they returned with the two men the sheriff looked sharply at the two horsedealers they were unknown to him will you give me my belt landlord hugh said the landlord went out and returned with hughs belt which had been locked up in his chest since hugh arrived in the town the latter counted out dollars in gold wait a moment the sheriff said i must see the horse first and see what brand is on him i cannot describe the horse unless i see him again taking lanterns the party went out to the stable the horse had been branded with a circle in which was the letter e there was no other mark on him the sheriff brought across with him some official paper and returning to the bar wrote i bear witness to the purchase byand he pausedhugh tunstall hugh put inwho is well known to me as having been working for six months in and near the town of a roan horse branded brand e ofof jake wittingham the man saidand to the passing of payment for the same the sheriff then added his name writing under it sheriff of mkinney county and james pawson added his signature with the word judge that is right and square the sheriff said now hand over the money and the trade is done i will throw in the other horse for twenty dollars i will take it hugh said and adding this sum to that he had counted out handed it over to the men if you will just step over with me hugh the sheriff said i will put my official seal to that paper i have not a doubt he went on as they left the saloon that those two fellows have stolen that horse they would never have sold him for that money had they come by him honestly i should have been glad to buy him myself for anything like that price i dont know the men and i reckon i know most of the rogues for a hundred miles round here so that if it has been stolen it has probably been brought a good distance i shouldnt be surprised if there has been murder as well as robbery if i knew the men i would seize them and have them searched but as i have never seen them before and know nothing against them i cannot do that i think it is a very good idea of yours getting me in to witness the sale that horse might get you into serious trouble if you could not prove that you came by it honestly he had now reached his house and proceeded to stamp the document with the official seal you may as well put your signature to this he said and i will witness it then if there is any question about your being hugh tunstall you would only have to sign your name and they would see that you are the man mentioned that is right my fee is two dollars hugh gladly paid the money and putting the document in his pocket returned to the hotel those fellows have just ridden off royce said when he entered pretty hard couple that i wonder where they got that horse nowhere about here or the sheriff would have known it a horse like that would be sure to catch the eye the next morning hugh got up early to inspect his purchase the horse again made hostile demonstrations when he approached it but talking to it quietly hugh went into the stall patted and soothed it when it had quieted down he took the headrope and led it out into the yard you are a beauty he said there is no mistake about that and tying it up to a post he walked round it well put together plenty of muscle fine bone and splendid quarters what a hunter you would make if i had you at home the landlord came out as he was admiring the animal a mustang he said bigger than they usually run a good bit and a beauty all over he is worth double what you gave for him this is not much of a horse country if you had him down south you could get three hundred for him any day i expect those fellows were afraid to take him down there too well known i reckon look here i will give you a paper too and if i were you i would get another from pawson saying that you have been working for him at his sawmill and that he recommends you as a good hand at that work you cant have too many certificates as to who you are when you are riding on an animal like that in this country if you want a saddle and bridle jim hoskings has got one to sell he was speaking to me about it a fortnight ago half an hour later hugh became the owner of a saddle and bridle the former was made in the texan fashion which closely resembles the mexican being very heavy and with high peak and cantle i hardly see how a man can be thrown off a horse with such a saddle as this hugh said as he examined it one would be boxed in before and behind wait till you get on a bad bucking horse the man said with a smile you wont wonder about it then carrying it back to the hotel hugh saddled his horse and mounted he felt strange and uncomfortable at first for the stirrupleathers were placed much further back than those to which he was accustomed the stirrups were very large and broad and the position of the stirrupleathers rendered it necessary for him to ride almost with a straight leg so that his grip was with his thighs instead of his knees i shall get accustomed to him in time he said to himself but at present i feel as if i was riding barebacked well i had plenty of practice at that so i ought to be able to stick on he rode at a quiet pace down the street and then shook the reins and the horse at once started at a handgallop hugh was delighted with his pace which was wonderfully smooth and easy and returned in an hour fully satisfied with his purchase illustration illustration chapter vii among the cowboys well now you have got your horses and outfit hugh what air you going to do next bill royce said after the rest of the party had got up from breakfast and gone out i dont quite know bill hugh laughed i thought of going teaming but i am afraid my horse has spoilt me for that well so i should say i should like to be my own master for a bit hugh went on and do some shooting and hunting on the plains work across to sante fe and then take anything that turns up i have got three hundred dollars in cash that will last me for a long time but i dont like striking out for myself i know nothing of the country or the life what do you say to going with me bill that is just what i have been turning over in my mind bill said i know the plains powerful well and have been hunting and shooting there for months i was saying to myself as like enough you would be thinking of striking out for a bit afore you settled down again to anything and you would be wanting some one with you as could put you up to the ropes i have got pretty sick of working here but i have spent my money as fast as i have got it and cannot afford to get an outfit so i said to myself if hugh likes to start me with an outfit i think it would be about square seeing as he knows nothing of the country and i could put him straight there we have worked together for a bit and i reckon we would get on firstrate so if that would suit you it would just suit me it suits me capitally bill nothing could be better it is just what i wanted i dont suppose i should ever have gone by myself but with you it would be the very thing to suit me theres my hand on it in another three days their preparations were made bill knew of a horse that could be picked up for forty dollars two rifles were bought a saddle and bridle for bill and saddlebags for the spare horse a large stock of ammunition was laid in fifty pounds of flour a few pounds of tea and sugar four blankets and a few odds and ends completed the outfit royce had already a revolver and on the morning of the fourth day they started from mkinney striking nearly due south so as to work round the range of hills for the first few days they passed occasional settlements and then struck out across an open country now we may begin to look out for game royce said you can shoot i suppose hugh i have had no practice whatever with the rifle but i am a pretty good shot with a shotgun you will soon pick it up anyhow royce said anyone who can shoot as you do with a colt is sure to shoot pretty straight with a rifle for the next four months hugh and his companion wandered over the plains and hugh enjoyed the life immensely they had directed their course toward the southwest for winter was setting in when they started and as the cold is sometimes severe in northern texas they made down towards the mexican frontier and there enjoyed delightful weather they found an abundance of game and could have shot any number of deer but they were useless to them except for food herds of wild horses were sometimes seen and occasionally in quiet valleys they came across halfwild cattle which had strayed away from fardistant ranches it was strange to hugh to travel thus at will to wander freely in whichever direction fancy led them sometimes passing a week or two without seeing any other human being sometimes stopping for a night at the campfire of a party of cowboys sometimes bivouacking with a wandering hunter like themselves or with a ranchman in search of stray animals during this time their expenses had been next to nothing their sole outlay being for flour tea and sugar and even these they generally obtained in exchange for venison or other game hugh had learned to use his rope with considerable skill on horseback for as soon as he got fairly away on the plains he had begun to practise the first time he tried it upon his companion he would have given him a very heavy fall had not bill reined in his horse on to its haunches as soon as the rope fell over his shoulders for prince as hugh called his horse was thoroughly up in his work the instant the rope had been thrown he stopped and braced himself with his forelegs extended to meet the shock and had it not been for bills quickness he would in an instant have been torn from the saddle thunder the latter exclaimed do you want to break my neck hugh i had nothing to do with it hugh protested prince nearly sent me over his head i had not the least idea of pulling him in and was perfectly taken aback by his playing me that trick we ought to have thought of it bill said it was dead sure he would be trained to the work the idea flashed across me just as the rope came down and lucky it was so well you will find plenty of other things to practise on as we go along there are cattle enough running about here without owners and if you come across a bunch of wild horses you can give chase and rope some of the young ones and there are coyotes they will give you plenty of sport that way hugh had used all these opportunities and had come to throw the noose over the head of a flying animal as well as bill royce himself could do but as yet he was unable to throw the rope round their legs with any certainty as the spring approached hugh proposed that instead of carrying out their plan of going to santa fe they should for a time take service on a ranche i enjoy this life immensely bill and i should like to become thoroughly up to all the work at present i am what you call a tenderfoot and i should certainly like to have a few months among the cowboys just as well do that as anything else bill said it is always handy to know that you can hold your own in a roundup and know the ways of cattle and i tell you that there is plenty to learn but mind you it aint going to be like this time weve been having theres no fooling about a cowboys life it is just about the hardest life there is however it wont be as hard for you as it is for most fellows you can ride though there aint much merit in sitting on that horse of yours still i see you know your way among horses and you have taught him to come to you when you whistle and to do pretty nigh everything you want him to but you will find it a mighty different thing when you get on the back of a broncho however it is worth learning to ride a horse that has never been backed anyhow i am with you i have had a spell at it and dont mind having another and there is one thingyou can quit when you like but how about this horse i should not like to give up prince well you could do as you like about that each cowboy has six or eight horsessometimes he has as many as a dozenand he just ropes one out of the crowd and rides him as he has a fancy so you could let prince run with the rest and use him when you liked or you could leave him at the headquarters station what do they want such a lot of horses for hugh asked they want them to do the work bill said a man can go on pretty nigh for ever but a horse cant you will find that you can use up six horses in the twentyfour hours and they want a day to rest before they are fit for work again well they will be starting on their roundup soon so we may as well head in their direction so as to get taken on before they are full i was working in the o triangle ranche two years ago their station aint above a hundred and fifty miles from where we are the boss wasnt a bad sort we may as well go there as to another what do you mean by the o triangle bill that is their branda circle in a triangle we call them always by their brands they have all sorts of names of their own but they are never known by them there is the o triangle and the double a and the cross ts and the diamond square and the halfcircles and a dozen others well we will head that way tomorrow morning i dont know that i shall be sorry to be in a crowd again for a bit it gets lonesome when there are only two of you after a while hugh was beginning to feel this also their subjects of conversation had long been exhausted and after the events of the days hunting had been discussed there was little for them to talk about as they sat by their fire on the evening of the third day they arrived at the headquarters station of the ranche it consisted of a long low building which formed the storehouse and general room near it was the managers house and behind the barracks for the men a short distance away was a fence which inclosed fifty or sixty acres of ground here were some of the more valuable of the animals some handsome bulls and a couple of dozen good horses three or four waggons stood near the huts and a number of horses were grazing about over the country the huts themselves lay in a hollow down which a small belt of trees extended a score of men were standing or sitting near the huts and as many more came out as the newcomers rode up one or two of these recognized bill royce hello bill one of them said back again i thought you had got rubbed out where have you been all this time been down in mexico and then back among the settlements got tired of it and here i am been hunting last this is my mate gentlemen he is a good sort a britisher and his name is hugh now you are properly introduced glad to see you the man said holding out his hand to hugh come to pay us a visit no i have come to work if i can get work hugh said oh theres plenty of work well get off your horse he is a good un he is such was evidently the opinion of the rest of the cowboys for they gathered round and made remarks on princes points he is too good for this sort of work altogether leastways for most of it though he would do well enough for scouting round and hunting for cattle among the foothills where did you get him i bought him at mkinney hugh said two fellows came along with him and wanted to sell bad so i got him a bargain i expect he didnt cost them much the man said well it is all right as long as you dont fall across the chap he was stolen from if you do there will be a good many questions asked i can tell you i guess he came from some mexican ranche down south you dont often see such a bit of horseflesh about here here is the boss hugh bill said we may as well speak to him at once and they walked together to a man who had just come out from the managers house have you got room for two hands bill asked i was here a couple of years back my mate is new at this work but he can ride and shoot and throw a rope oh its you bill is it yes i can put you both on i am not quite full yet forty dollars a month for you thirty for your mate till he learns his business that will suit bill said he wont be long before he gets up to the forty he will find it hard work at first the manager said but he doesnt look as if that would hurt him bill and his companion now rejoined the group of cowboys while the manager went into the store hugh looked with interest at the men who were to be his associates for some time their dress was similar to that of all the cowboys he had met while hunting they wore hats with a very wide straight brim and made of a stiff felt almost as hard as a board most of them wore a cord of gold or silver mixed with colour round it all wore flannel shirts with a handkerchiefwhich in the majority of cases was of silkround their throats round the waist they wore a mexican sash of bright colour their trousers were either of thick material or of very soft tanned leather and over these were chaperajos or mexican overalls with a coloured fringe down the outside seam a few had jackets on and these had also tufts of coloured fringe on the seams of the arms they were most of them spare active men without an ounce of superfluous flesh they were quiet in manner with little of the reckless jollity of the ordinary frontiersman hugh was particularly struck with the keen watchful expression of their eyes the result of long nights of watching and of days spent on horseback in search of stray animals and of danger from indians all carried a revolver on the hip or hind pocket had a long knife stuck in their sash and wore high boots cut away behind at the bend of the knee but coming several inches higher in front following bills example hugh unsaddled his horse go off old boy he said giving him a pat and prince walked leisurely away accompanied by his two companions who always kept near to him we cannot offer you a drink one of the cowboys said to hugh no liquor is allowed on the ranche it comes rather hard at first but it is best for us all i have touched nothing for the last four months but tea hugh said and dont care for spirits anyway it would be a good thing if none of us did the other said but one must do something when one goes down to a town just at this moment a bell began to ring there is supper the man said there was a general movement into the large hut here long tables were laid out and dishes piled up with meat and great platters of potatoes were ranged along at short intervals hugh was gifted with an excellent appetite but he was astonished at the way in which the food disappeared the meal was accompanied by a supply of very fair bread fresh from the oven and tea with milk ewart keeps a few cows down here the man next to hugh said in answer to his remark about his not having seen milk for three months of course we dont get it at the outstations who is ewart hugh asked oh he is boss we dont have any misters out hereone man is as good as another you have just arrived here at the right time we have been driving in the horses from the ranche for the last three days and tomorrow we are going to begin breaking them of course a good many of them were ridden last year but there are a lot of bronchos among them we have got a bronchobreaker out here a broncho hugh knew was a horse that had never been ridden how do you do about horses he said well three or four of those that have been ridden before are told off to each man then if anyone fancies a broncho he can take him and break him for himself then men can swop with each other you see some men ride better than others some men like quiet mounts others dont mind what they sit on and you see the best horses are very often the most full of tricks you ride your horses as you like but everyone keeps his quietest for night watches you must have a quiet horse for that for if your horse was to begin to play tricks he would stampede the cattle sure i suppose after they have been ridden one season they are quiet enough hugh said not a bit of it the man replied some of them seem to get wickeder and wickeder they get a bit better towards the end of the season but six months running wild does away with all that i would just as soon take my chance with a fresh broken broncho as with one that has been ridden before they are wilder you know but not so cunning an old horse seems to spend most of his time in thinking what game he shall be up to next and when you see one walking along as if he had never done anything but walk along all his time just look out or you will find yourself six feet up in the air supper over pipes were lighted and hugh listened with great interest to the talk going on around him some of the men had been on the ranche all the winter others had been away some back in the settlements others in new mexico where they had been either loitering away their time in the towns or working on mexican ranches hugh was struck with the quiet way in which they talked the absence of argument and the air of attention with which each speaker was listened to he thought he had never been among a more quiet set of men and wondered if these could be really the cowboys of whose wild doings he had heard such tales gradually one by one they lounged off to the hut behind and he and bill soon went off also it consisted of one room about sixty feet long a stove with a huge fire burned in the middle for the nights were cold down both sides and along the ends extended a double row of bunks in the great majority of these lay blankets showing that they were occupied choosing two empty ones they placed the blankets and other articles they had taken from their saddles in them put their belongings under their heads rolled themselves in their blankets and were soon sound asleep the first thing next morning they handed over to the storekeeper the remainder of their flour tea and sugar the value of these was credited to them and they took out the amount in a couple of pairs of chaperajos two cowboy hats and two pairs of high boots paying the balance in cash they then joined the cowboys these were gathered in an inclosure with a very strong fence adjoining the fencedin ground several cowboys rode off as they entered and in a quarter of an hour a mob of horses was seen approaching the men riding behind cracking their whips and yelling at the top of their voices the gates were opened and a couple of minutes later the horses rushed in there were some forty or fifty of them and of these about twothirds were branded in the first place the others were speedily roped both by the head and hind legs four cowboys hung on to the ropes while another approached with a heated brand and applied it to the animals hind quarters the horses kicking and struggling wildly as soon as the operation which lasted but a second or two was completed the ropes were loosed and the frightened animals rejoined their companions who were huddled in a corner of the inclosure now each man of no and no outfit take one of the horses the manager said hugh and bill had the night before been told that they were to form part of no outfit like the others they had their ropes in their hands and had brought their saddles inside the inclosure hugh picked out a horse that struck him as being a good one and threw his lasso round its neck one of the cowboys belonging to the other outfit who was standing by said that is a pretty bad horse mate i would take a quieter one if i were you i have got to learn to sit them hugh replied so i may as well begin with a bad one as a good one all right the other said taking hold of the rope and helping hugh haul upon it the animal resisted violently but the pressure of the rope halfchoked him and he was forced to leave the group and come up to them i will hold him hughs assistant said get your saddle and bridle there was some difficulty in putting these on for the animal kicked plunged and reared furiously and it was only when another cowboy threw a rope and catching one of its hind legs pulled it out stiffly behind that hugh succeeded in saddling it now up you go the man said gathering up the reins hugh sprang into the saddle and the two men as soon as they saw him seated slipped off the ropes for a moment the horse stood perfectly still keep his head up one of the men shouted but before hugh could draw in the reins the horse dropped its head to its knees then it seemed to hugh that it doubled itself up and before he knew what had happened he felt himself flying through the air and came down to the ground with a crash there was a shout of laughter from the cowboys but two or three of them helped hugh who for a moment was almost stunned to his feet that is bucking i suppose he said as soon as he could get breath thats bucking sure enough one of those who had helped him said well i will try again in a minute hugh said take it quietly the man said goodnaturedly you fell pretty heavy and you are shaken up a bit youd better hitch him on to the fence and look about you for a few minutes before you try again hugh thought the advice good and after fastening up the horse stood watching the man they called the bronchobreaker who was fighting one of the most vicious of the last years horses had he not seen it hugh would not have believed it possible that a horse could go through such performances he had ridden many vicious brutes at home and had thought that he knew something of horses but this was a new experience for him in the rearing kicking and plunging there was nothing novel and as the horses were much smaller than the english hunters to which he had been accustomed he felt that if this had been all he should have no difficulty in keeping his seat but the bucking was new to him to perform it it was necessary that the horse should be able to get its head down the moment this was done it sprang straight into the air at the same moment rounding its back and this with such a sharp sudden jerk that it fairly threw the rider into the air on coming down the animal kept its legs stiff so that the jerk to the rider was scarcely less than that of the upward spring and before he had time to settle himself in the slightest the horse repeated the performance varying it occasionally by springing sideways backwards or forwards the breaker or as they were generally called the bronchobuster kept his figure perfectly upright with a tremendous grip upon the saddle with his thighs but depending as hugh could see rather upon balance than upon his hold the exertion was evidently great the mans hat had been jerked off the perspiration stood upon his bronzed forehead from time to time he dug his spurs into the animals flanks and excited it to continue its desperate efforts until at last the horse was utterly exhausted and stood with its head drooping unable to make another effort there was a shout of applause from the cowboys looking on bully for you jake he is a brute that is and no mistake i will give him a turn every day for a week jake said he is worth taking trouble with i will take him for a gallop tomorrow do they buck when they are galloping hugh asked the cowboy next to him the latter nodded not when they are going at their best pace they havent time to do it then but when they are going at handgallop they will do it they wait until you are off your guard and then up they go in the air and come down perhaps three yards sideways and its fifty to one against your being on their back when they do come down i see how it is done now though i dont see how i can do it hugh said but i will try again illustration the next jump threw him fairly over the horses head the horse was led out and hugh again mounted this time he was prepared for what was to come but in spite of the grip with his legs the blow lifted him far above the saddle it seemed to him that the next buck came before he had fairly descended for it struck him with the force and suddenness of an electric shock again and again he was thrown up until he felt his balance going and the next jump threw him fairly over the horses head but as he was prepared for the fall it was much less heavy than the first time well done well done several of the cowboys said as he rose to his feet you will do you will and make a good rider before long that will do for today i would not try any more i am going to try it until i can sit him hugh said i have got to do it and i may as well go on now before i get stiff the bronchobreaker came up to him as after waiting a minute or two to get his breath he again prepared to mount dont keep your back so stiff young fellow just let your back go as if there was no bones in it i have known a mans spine broke before now by a bucker sit easy and lissom keep your head that is the principal thing it aint easy when you are being pitched up and down like a ball but it all turns upon that let your legs close on him tight each time you come down if only for a moment that saves you from being thrown clean away from him hugh sprang on to the horse and the struggle again began it ended like the last but hugh had kept his seat somewhat longer than before again and again he tried each time with more success the fifth time he felt that the horses action was less sudden and violent and that it was becoming fatigued with its tremendous exertions now you brute he muttered it is my turn and he dug his spurs into the horse a spring more violent than any he had yet felt followed the application and for a minute or two he was almost bewildered by the force and rapidity of the animals springs but he was now confident that he was gaining the mastery and the moment he found that its efforts were decreasing he again applied the spurs the response was less vigorous than before and in five minutes the animal stood exhausted and subdued a cheer broke from the cowboys who were standing round looking on at the struggle well done young fellow you are the toughest tenderfoot i have ever seen one of them said shaking him by the hand i dont believe there are ten men in the camp who would have sat that horse as you have and you say that it is the very first time you have been on a bucker i have beaten him hugh said but he has pretty well beaten me you must help me off my saddle for i feel as if my back was broken and that i could not lift my leg over the saddle if my life depended on it two cowboys lifted him from his seat that is a hard tussle mate the bronchobreaker said coming up to him and you have stuck to it well you are clear grit you are the best thing you can do is to walk about for the next hour just keep yourself moving then go and wrap yourself up in two or three blankets and lie down in your bunk for a bit have a thorough good sweat and then strip and rub yourself down get your mate to rub your back well and then dress and move about the great thing is not to get stiff but you will feel it for a day or two hugh followed the advice but he found it hard work to do so he was bruised all over with his falls he scarce seemed able to put one leg before another and at every movement a sharp pain shot through the loins and he felt as if his spine had been dislocated still for an hour he walked about and at the end of that time felt that his movements were more easy then he went to the hut wrapped himself in bills blankets and his own and presently dozed off to sleep a couple of hours later he woke and saw bill standing beside him now hugh you had better turn out and let me give you a rub just take off that shirt i have got a lump of hogs grease here hugh got out of the bunk with some difficulty and took off his shirt now you lean your hands on that bunk and arch your back thats it now here goes for a good halfhour bill worked at his back kneading it with his knuckles down both sides of the spine and across the loins now you will do he said at last put on a dry shirt and come out hugh strolled down to the stockyard he felt wonderfully better after the rubbing and was able to walk with far greater ease than before the scene in the yard was unchanged fresh groups of horses had been driven in as fast as the others had been saddled and mounted and by nightfall each of the cowboys had been provided with three horses hugh was greatly amused at the scene for the spills were numerous and the shouting and laughter incessant the next day the work of breaking in the bronchos commenced one after another they were roped and dragged out of the drove the bridle was slipped on and they were then blindfolded while the saddle was put on and fastened then jake mounted the cloth was drawn off the animals head and the struggle commenced the horses tried every means to unseat their rider but in vain some submitted after comparatively short struggles others fought long and desperately as soon as the first victory was won bars were let down and the horse was taken for a long gallop across the country returning home subdued and trembling then the process was repeated with a fresh animal how long does he take to break them hugh asked a cowboy three days generally sometimes he will ride them four or five times but three is generally enough then they are handed over to us to finish it must take a lot out of them hugh said it would be better to do it more gradually you see they are scared nearly to death before they are begun with he cannot afford the time the man said he gets two dollars a horse for breaking them he will be here for a fortnight and in that time he will do pretty well a hundred then he will go off somewhere else it must be tremendous work for him hugh said it is that you bet a bronchobuster seldom lasts above two years they get shaken all to pieces and clean broke up by the end of that time as fast as the horses were broken in they were handed over to the cowboys and hugh who had been unable to do any work for two days then began to break in the lot that were to be his particular property but he was fond of horses and could not bring himself to use such violent measures as those which he saw adopted by his companions the first lesson they taught them was to stand still the moment a rope fell over their necks the animal was led up to the stump of a tree and then loosed it at once went off at full speed but as it did so its owner threw the noose of his rope over its head and then gave the other end a turn round the stump the shock was tremendous the horses being frequently jerked right over on to their backs two or three experiences of this sort was sufficient and the animal thenceforth learned to stand not only when a rope was thrown round its neck but even when the reins were dropped upon it so that when its master dismounted it remained perfectly quiet until he again mounted and took the reins in his hand even if he was absent a considerable time as the teams were to start in a few days on the roundup hugh felt that it would be useless for him to attempt to break the horses in by english methods and he was therefore obliged to adopt those in use by his companions he mollified them however to some extent by getting another rope and tying it to his own he then took only half a turn round the stump and let the rope run out at first fast but checking it gradually until its pressure upon the neck brought the animal half suffocated to a stop it took him longer to accomplish his object but he found that by the end of a week the seven horses had all learned their lessons each having been ridden for an hour every day he had had several severe battles with the animal he had first mounted which was by far the most vicious of them but the struggle each day had become less severe as the horse recognized the futility of endeavouring to unseat its master hugh had many falls during the schooling but he was upon the whole well satisfied with the result several of the cowboys had advised him to use the methods they adopted for securing them in their seats upon specially vicious horses one of these methods was the fastening of a loop of leather to the high pommel holding this in the hand it was wellnigh impossible to be bucked from the saddle but there was the disadvantage that if the strap broke nothing could save a rider from a fall far more violent and heavy than that which came from being pitched from the saddle in the ordinary way another method was to fasten a strap passed under the horses belly tightly below each knee but this although it held the riders in their saddles had the serious disadvantage that in the event of the horse rearing and falling back or of its falling headlong from putting its foot in a hole the rider could not free himself and was almost certain to be crushed under the horse others again fastened themselves by bringing their feet together and crossing their spurs under the horses belly a safer measure than the last but objectionable inasmuch as the spurs when the animal bucked struck him in the belly and so increased the violence of his action of course the best riders refrained from using any of these methods trusting only to their leg grip and to balance and hugh determined to ride in this way even if it did cost him a few more falls he was on excellent terms with the rest of the cowboys the tenderfoot as a newcomer is called is always the subject of endless pranks and annoyances if he evinces the least timidity or nervousness but if on the other hand he shows that he has pluck determination to succeed and good temper he is treated with kindness and cordiality hughs exhibition therefore of courage and horsemanship on the occasion of his first attempt at once won their liking and admiration and all were ready to lend him a hand when necessary and to give him hints and advice and he was free from any of the annoyances to which new hands are often exposed there were several other tenderfeet among the party two or three of these got on fairly and soon ceased to be butts but the rest before a week was up found the work altogether too trying and one after another went off in search of some less dangerous occupation illustration chapter viii a rattlesnake diet everything was now ready and one morning four waggons started the brand circle triangle was one of the most northern of the ranches and the four outfits would therefore travel south searching the whole width of country as they went along those from the other ranches would come up from the south or in from the east all moving towards a general meetingplace the range of country which served as common pasturage to some eight or ten ranches was about two hundred miles from north to south and nearly as much from east to west the eastern portion of this great tract consisted of plain sometimes flat and level but more often undulating the western portion was broken up into valleys and gorges by the spurs of the great ranges included under the name of the rocky mountains the cattle of each ranche were as far as possible kept in that portion of the territory nearest their own stations but during the winter they scattered to great distances in search of better grazing ground or shelter in the more northern ranges when snowstorms with violent wind swept down from the northwest the cattle would drift before it always keeping their heads from the wind and feeding as they travelled sometimes great herds would thus travel hundreds of miles until brought up by some obstacle at this time such things as fences were absolutely unknown on the plains and when years after they came to a certain extent into use they were in the regions exposed to snowstorms causes of terrible disaster for when a herd drifting before a snowstorm came to one of them it would be checked and many thousands of cattle would when the snow cleared be found frozen or starved to death in a mass two of the outfits of the brand circle triangle ranche were to proceed due west and then to search the ranges among the hills while the other two were to work the plains nos and were chosen for the former work and were to keep within twenty or thirty miles of each other so as to be able to draw together for support should the indians prove troublesome it was not until the afternoon that the cowboys mounted and the men of each outfit collecting their own horses into a bunch started for the spot where their waggon was to halt for the night it had brought up near a stream and the cook had already lighted his fires and put on his cooking pots when they arrived each outfit consisted of ten cowboys and a man who acted as waggondriver and cook the duties of the cook of an outfit were by no means a sinecure as he had to prepare two meals a day breakfast and supper at all times and dinner for the men whose work allowed them to ride in to it he had to bake bread to wash up pots pans and dishes and to cut wood for the fire in the latter task he was always assisted by the first arrivals at the camping place the bread was baked in iron pans the dough was made of flour and water with a mixture of saleratus which took the place of yeast and caused the dough to rise the pans were placed in the wood embers a quantity of which were piled upon the flat iron lid so that the bread was baked equally on all sides meat was cut into steaks and fried those of the men who preferred it cutting off chunks of the meat and grilling or roasting them on sticks over the fire once or twice a week there was duff or plumpudding the cook was up long before daybreak preparing breakfast and the men started as soon as it was light directly the meal was over plates pots and pans were washed and packed in the waggon the horses or mules harnessed and he started for the spot named as the evening camping ground where he had his fires lighted and the meal well on its way by the time the cowboys arrived a good deal more meat than was required was cooked at breakfast and each man before he started on his days work cut off a chunk of bread and meat for his midday meal hugh had ridden prince who had been having a very easy time of it for the last three weeks the horse had for the first few days kept somewhat apart and had resented any advances on the part of the strangers he had now however fallen into their ways and as soon as the saddle was taken off he like those ridden by the other cowboys went off at a trot to join the bunch of horses a short distance out on the plain well hugh how do you think you shall like cattle work one of the men known as long tom asked him as they sat round the fire after supper was over so far i like it immensely hugh replied but of course i have only seen the smooth side of it i have not been on night cattleguard yet yes that is the worse part of the work the man said especially when you are shorthanded for then there is only one relief of course on a fine night if the cattle are quiet there is no hardship about it but on a dark night when you cannot see your horses ears and the wind is blowing and the rain coming down and the cattle are restless it is no joke i have been a sailor in my time and i tell you that keeping watch on a wild night at sea isnt a circumstance to it you know that if the cattle break you have got to ride and head them off somehow and i tell you when you cannot see your horses ears and are going at a wild gallop and know that if he puts his foot in a hole there is no saying how far you may be chucked and you have got the herd thundering along beside you you begin to feel that a cowboys life is not all meat and molasses there is one comfort when you do have to ride like that you have no time to funk your blood just boils up with excitement and the one thing that you think of is to head the herd shall we place a horseguard tonight yes there is always a horseguard when we are away from the station the horses are more inclined to wander at first than they are afterwards and ours are a pretty wild lot at present but i dont think we shall have trouble with them for we have brought that white jackass along and the horses are sure to keep round him there is nothing like a jack for keeping horses quiet they seem to know that he has more sense than they have as long as he takes things quietly there is not much fear of their moving do you think a donkey has more sense than a horse hugh asked in surprise ever so much the man replied and so have mules havent they mates there was a general chorus of assent i had no idea of that hugh said i should have thought that horses would look down upon a donkey that is where you are wrong a cowboy called broncho harry said trust to a jack to find out the best forage and the nearest water he would manage to pick up a living where a horse would starve he doesnt get scared and lose his head about nothing as a horse does if there is a noise he just cocks one ear forward and makes up his mind what it is about and then goes on eating while a horse fidgets and sweats and is ready to bolt from his own shadow besides the horses know that the jack is their master why you dont mean to say that a donkey can kick harder than a horse i dont say he can kick harder though a mule can and twice as quick but a jack does not fight that way he fights with his teeth i have seen several fights between stallions and jacks and the jack has always got the best of it i remember down at the red springs there was a big black stallion with a bunch of mares came down the valley where we camped and he went at the horses and stampeded them all down the valley well we had a jack with us he did not seem to pay much attention to what was going on until the stallion came rushing at him thinking no doubt that he was going to knock his brains straight out with a blow of his forefoot but the jack went at him with open mouth dodged a blow of his hoofs and made a spring and caught him by the neck he held on like a bulldog the stallion reared and plunged and lifted the jack off his feet time after time but each time he came down with his legs stiff and well apart the stallion struck at him with his forelegs and cut the skin off his shoulders once or twice they fell but the jack never let go his hold and he would have killed the stallion sure if it had not torn itself away leaving a big bit of skin and flesh in the jacks mouth the stallion went up the valley again like a flash and the jack turned off and went on grazing as if nothing had happened jacks dont have a chance in towns but give them a free hand out on the plains and i tell you they are just chokefull of sense but it is getting dark and i am first on guard so i must be off the other three men who had been told off for guard had each brought in a horse and fastened the ends of their ropes to picket pins driven into the ground so that they could graze a little and yet be near at hand when the time came to relieve the guard how do you know when to wake it is habit broncho harry said one gets to wake up just at the right time and if you aint there within a quarter of an hour of the time you ought to be you are likely to hear of it one of the guards will ride in and talk pretty straight to you or like enough he will drop his rope round your foot or arm and give you a jerk that will send you ten yards when you have been woke up once or twice like that there aint much fear of your oversleeping yourself ah there is black sams accordion black sam was the cook a merry goodtempered negro and the outfit which secured sam with the waggon considered itself in luck cowboys are very fond of music and sams accordion helped to while away the evening for the next two hours there was singing and choruses and then the men rolled themselves in their blankets with their feet to the fire and the camp was soon asleep the next morning at daybreak the cowboys started in pairs two of them accompanied the waggon in charge of the spare horses the rest went in various directions to hunt up cattle before nightfall they had collected fifty or sixty cattle mostly in bunches of threes and fours at least a third of the number were calves by their mothers side some of them were only captured after a long chase as they ran with a swiftness far beyond anything of which hugh could have supposed cattle to be capable the cows and steers were for the most part branded but a few were found without marks these were hugh learned called mavericks they were animals that had escaped search at the previous roundup and it was consequently impossible to tell to what herd they belonged when the days work was done these were roped thrown down and branded with the brand circle triangle and became the property of the ranche whose cowboys discovered them there is many a man has become rich by branding mavericks one of the cowboys said it was a regular business at one time of course no one could tell whose cattle they were and when a man had put his brand on them he became the owner but it was carried on so that the ranche owners all came to an agreement and any man caught branding cattle with his own brand except at the regular roundup got shot of course the calves belonged to one or other of the ranches round and as each ranche sends out a number of outfits to the roundup in proportion to the numbers of its cattle the present rule is fair enough when night fell the cattle were bunched down by the stream by which the party had camped six of them were told off on night guard while three others of whom hugh was one were to look after the horses hugh was to take the first watch and as soon as he had eaten his supper he received his instructions from john colley the overseer of the outfit you will have little enough to do he said you have merely got to keep near them and you neednt even keep on your horse unless you like as long as they graze quietly leave them alone if you see two or three wandering away from the rest ride quickly and head them in hugh mounted one of the quietest of his horses and rode out to the bunch a few hundred yards from camp at his whistle prince at once trotted out from the rest and came up to him and took from his hand the piece of bread hugh had put in his pocket for him go back to the others prince he said with a wave of his hand your business is to eat at present the horses were all quiet and hugh when darkness had fairly fallen was struck with the quiet of the plain above the stars shone through the clear dry air near him were the dark bunch of horses and he was surprised at the loudness of the sound of their cropping the grass broken only by that of an occasional stamp of a hoof he could easily hear the accordion and the singing away back at the camp when this ceased there came occasionally the crack of a breaking twig as the herd of cattle forced their way through the bushes by the stream on his left and the songs of the cowboys on watch as they rode in circles around them the time did not seem long and he was quite surprised when bill royce cantered up and told him his watch was over the next days work was similar to the first except that soon after starting on ascending a slope they saw a small herd of deer some eighty yards away before hugh had time to think broncho harry who was his companion had drawn his revolver and as the deer bounded off fired one of them leaped high in the air ran fifty yards and then dropped while the others made off at the top of their speed that was a good shot hugh said i should hardly have thought of firing at an object so far distant oh these colts carry a long way the cowboy said carelessly they will carry four hundred yards though you cant depend upon their shooting much over a hundred i have seen a man killed though at over three hundred but i look upon that as a chance shot up to a hundred a man aint much of a shot who cannot bring down a deer four times out of five i dont mean hitting of course you ought to hit him every time but hit him so as to stop him i dont mean to say as the shot would be sure if you were galloping over rough ground but in a steady saddle you ought not to miss on riding up to the deer broncho harry dismounted lifted it on the horse and lashed it to the back of the saddle i am not particularly partial to deermeat he said but it makes a change to beef i own i prefer beef hugh said especially after living on venison as i have been doing for the last three months i consider bearmeat to be about as good as anything you get in these parts the cowboy said i dont say as it isnt tough but it has got flavour i dont want to put my teeth into anything better than a good bear ham if we have any luck we shall get some up among the hills most things are eatable i lived on rattlers once for a month at a time i tell you a rattler aint bad eating are there many of them out on the plains a good many the cowboy said but you get them most among the foothills they like to lie on the rocks in the sun and i have seen them by dozens on a sunny ledge do many people get killed by them bless you no the natives are afraid of them cause you see they often go barefoot but they cannot bite through our thick boots the only danger is when you lie down or something of that sort they are fond of warmth and if you camp near where they are thick they will crawl down to the fire and sometimes get into your blanket i suppose their bite is fatal if they do bite not once in fifty times if you take them right i have known mexicans killed by them but then a mexican gives himself away directly and makes no fight for it now if we are bitten we just whip out a knife and cut the part out straight clap a poultice of fresh dung on it and tie a string round tight above it of course if you have got spirits handy you pour some in directly you cut it out and drink as much as you can but then you see we dont often have spirits out here i was bit once there and he pointed to a scar on his right hand between the little finger and the wrist a rattler bit me just on the fleshy part there i blew his head off with my revolver and then whipped out my knife and cut the bit out there wasnt any dung handy and i had no spirits so i broke up a revolver cartridge and poured the powder in and clapped a match to it it hurt a bit of course because it was bleeding and the powder didnt all flash off at once but i was all right afterwards my arm felt numbed for an hour or two and there was an end of it cattle and horses get bit sometimes on the head when they are grazing and it swells up to pretty well twice its proper size but they generally get over it in a day or two no there is no great danger about rattlers but if you are in the neighbourhood where they are thick it is just as well to look round before you sit down but how was it you came to live on rattlesnakes for a month well i was up north a bit i had been looking after a bunch of cattle that had gone up a canyon when i saw a party of indians coming my way lucky i saw them before they saw me and you guess i was off the horse pretty sharp i turned his head up the canyon and sent him galloping on and then i sheltered among the rocks the indians came up no doubt to look for cattle i heard them pass by and then come galloping down again and i knew they had happened upon my horse they hunted about that place for two days but the soft rocks had fallen and they were piled thick along the foot of the cliffs on both sides and you may guess i had worked myself down pretty deep in among them i was in too much of a hurry to think of the rattlers as i got in but i had noticed as i went up what a lot of them there were lying on the rocks and i thought a good deal about them as i was lying there of course i had my knife and pistol with me but the pistol was no good for a shot would have cost me my scalp sure and a knife aint the sort of weapon you would choose to use in a tussle with a rattler when night came i could have shifted but i guessed i had got as good a place as another and i might have put my foot into a nest of rattlers in the dark so i lay there all night and all next day i slept a bit at night but all day i kept awake and listened i could hear the injuns going about and shoving their lances all about down the holes among the rocks luckily the place i had got into was just at the foot of the cliffs and you could not see that there was a hole unless you climbed up there well when night came again i guessed they would give up searching and take to watching i got out and went a good bit higher up the gorge i was pretty nigh mad with thirst and there werent no water as i knew of within wellnigh a hundred miles i felt sure the injuns wouldnt come up the valley again but would keep watch at the mouth for the hills went up both sides and there was no getting out anywhere cept there soon as it got light i cut a stoutish stick tore off a strip of my sash and tied my bowie to the end then i hid up agin there but so that i could see out a bit about ten oclock as there wur no signs of the injuns and the sun wur blazing down fit to frizzle up ones brain i guessed rattlers would be out i had got so bad with thirst by that time that i blieve even if i had seen the injuns i should have gone out i had not long to search i had not gone five yards when i saw a rattler lying on a rock there are two sorts of rattlers there is the plain rattler and the rock rattler the rock aint so big as the other but he bites just as bad he saw me coming but he did not trouble to move he just sounded his rattles and lifted up his head as much as to say you had best leave me alone when i got near him he lifted his head a bit higher and swish went my stick and his head flew off him i picked up the body and went back among the bushes skinned it cut it up into chunks and ate it just as it was that was the first of them and i had three or four more before the day was over that night and next day i remained quiet except to fill up my larder and the next night crawled down to the mouth of the valley and just where it narrowed i could hear injuns talking they hadnt lighted a fire they knew better than that it would have been just throwing away their lives so back i went again for i could not tell how many of the skunks were there i guessed perhaps they would come up the valley again the next day so i hid again in my old place and it was lucky i did for in the afternoon i heard their horses feet and knew there must have been a dozen of them that night i went down again i could hear no voices and i crawled out and out until i was well on the plain but they was gone that wur just what i had expected they had got my waterskin with my horse and knew well enough that no one could have stood that four days heat in that valley without dying or going off his head and as they could see nothing of me they must have thought that i had got into some hole and stuck there till i died their own water too must have been running short and they couldnt stay any longer so off they had gone i wasnt much better off than i was before they had driven the cattle away and as to starting to walk a hundred miles without water the thing wur not to be thought of i had found there was juice enough in the rattlers to do me besides there wur plants growing about that would help me a bit if i chewed the leaves so i made up my mind that there was nothing else to do but to stop some of my mates would be sure to get up a hunt for me when they found that i didnt come back i didnt care so much now that i could light a fire for i was getting pretty sick of raw rattler i lit one next morning right up at the head of the valley choosing a place among the rocks where i could pitch a stone over it and hide the ashes if the injuns should take it into their heads to pay me another visit every morning i cooked enough rattlers for the day and then took them down and sat among some bushes high up at the mouth of the valley so that i could see if anyone was coming two or three miles away for i hoped that a deer or a bear or perhaps a head or two of cattle might come up but nary one did i see though i stayed there a month at the end of that time i saw four mounted figures far out on the plain and pretty soon made out as they was cowboys they was riding towards the hills and you bet i tracked out to meet them pretty slick they was four men of my own outfit they had halted for three or four days after i wur lost and scoured the plains pretty considerable for me then they wur obliged to go with the rest to drive the cattle into the station and as soon as they got there they started out again making up their minds that they wouldnt go back till they found my body they reckoned for sure that i had been scalped and never expected to do more for me than to bury me they had been four days riding along at the bottom of the foothills searching every valley they had a spare horse or two with them with water and grub yes that is how i came to live on rattlers for a month and though i dont say anything against them as food and allow as they make a change to cows flesh i have never been able to touch them since that was a close shave hugh said i suppose people do get lost and die on the plains sometimes lots of them but not old hands you know a cowboy gets to know which way he is going without looking at a mark at night he has got the stars to guide him but tenderfeet often get lost and when they once lose their bearings there aint much chance for them unless someone happens to come along they most all go out of their mind the same day they run a bit and then drop down and then run another way and drop again i tell you there aint a more awful sight than a man who has been lost for a day or two and you have got to look out sharp if you come upon one of them for he is as like as not to shoot you being altogether off his head and taking you for an enemy i once came across a chap who was off his head but who hadnt got weak he drew his sixshooter when he saw me it was a long way from a station and i had no time to fool about and i didnt want to get shot he fired once and the ball went pretty close so i knew i might chuck away my life by going near enough to rope him so i fetched out my pistol and took a shot at his ankle and of course down he went as i expected he let drop his pistol as he tumbled and before he could get it again i had ridden up and roped him then of course it wur easy enough i tied him tight first poured a few drops of water into his mouth fastened him across the horse behind the saddle and rode with him into the camp he wur laid up for nigh six weeks with his ankle but it saved his life hello he broke off reining back his horse suddenly there is a good bunch of cattle right up that dip ahead of us we are on the wrong side of them now and if they was to catch sight of us we should have a long ride before we came up to them we must work round and come down on them from the other side and head them this way then we shall be travelling in the right direction hughs eye less accustomed to search the plains had not caught the cattle how far are they off he said about a mile you go round to the right and ill go round to the left when you get to where you think you are behind them stop until you see me or look here you are new at this sort of thing so we may as well ride together until we get to your station else we might miss each other and lose a lot of time so saying he rode off at full speed hugh who was on prince following him as they went hugh congratulated himself that he had not started by himself for riding up and down the undulations and making a halfcircle as they were doing he very soon lost all idea of direction after ten minutes riding the cowboy reined in his horse now he said they are in the next dip just about over the line of that bush i will go a bit further round and come down on the other side of them you move on to that bush and wait until you see me coming and then ride forward keep on their flank that dip lies just about in the line of the camp so keep them going that way hugh rode until he approached the bush harry had pointed out and then sat quiet until he saw the cowboy approaching from the opposite direction the latter threw up his arm and hugh moved forward a few strides of the horse took him to the brow and there below him some forty or fifty cattle were grazing broncho harry was already dashing down the opposite slope for a moment the cattle stood with heads up and snorts of alarm and then as the cowboy uttered a wild yell dashed off down the hollow a little behind them one on each side rode the two cowboys and for three miles there was no change in their relative position then the speed of the cattle began to abate but they kept on at a run for another two miles and then settled gradually into a walk an hour later the camp was reached there is no occasion to watch them broncho harry said as they arrived within a quarter of a mile of the waggon they will go on to the stream and have a drink and then lie down in the shade of the bushes or else mix up with the other cattle down somewhere there they have done enough running for today back early harry the cowboy who had remained behind to look after the horses said yes we have been in luckgot a goodish bunch hello sam hello broncho harry the negro replied putting his head out of the waggon got any hot water because we want tea not got now but make him quick plenty of fire in the ashes not expect anyone back to dinner only just twelve oclock well here we are sam anyhow hand me out a fryingpan a hot dinner is better than a cold lunch any day i have brought you in a stag sam dats good broncho deers meat better than cow meat not a bit of it sam it does for a change but you cannot go on eating it every day as you can beef unless you have got to and then one can eat anything are we going out again after dinner harry hugh asked as they watched the beef frying over the embers of the great fire no sirree we have done our days work we have brought in our bunch and a good bunch it is it is just luck that we came on them early and are back early if it had been the other way we might not have got back until after dark maybe we mightnt have got back until tomorrow after we have done our meal we will go and see if the cattle have settled down quiet and if they have joined the rest if they have we will have a bathe in the stream and then wash our shirts it will be a good opportunity one dont get many chances of washing on a roundup the cattle were found to have joined those brought in the day before and the cowboys programme was carried out you ought to practise with that sixshooter of yours hugh a cowboy aint thought much of if he cant shoot straight look at that tin on the low bough there that has been there ever since we were here a year ago i mind that someone stuck it up for a tenderfoot to shoot at now you see me knock it off jehoshaphat he exclaimed when as he put his hand on the butt of his pistol a sharp crack sounded beside him and the tin fell to the ground a laugh from hugh accompanied the shot how in thunder did you do that the usual way i suppose hugh said i drew my pistol and pulled the trigger the cowboy looked him over from head to foot i tell you what hugh you are a fraud you come here as a tenderfoot and you can sit on a bucking broncho youve a good notion of throwing a rope and you can shoot like lightning where did you get it all i have simply practised hugh said smiling at the others gravity of manner i made up my mind to take to ranching some months ago and i practised with the pistol and rope before i started and as i told you i have been three months hunting it dont seem nateral the cowboy said doubtfully i dont say the shot was out of the way for it wur an easy mark enough at twenty yards but it wur the spryness of the shooting that fetched me that is what i have been specially practising broncho i was told that the great thing was to be able to draw quick well let us see a little more of your shooting he walked to the tree and picked up the tin hugh put in a fresh cartridge in place of that he had just fired now i will throw this up and you fire at it in the air bill royce had told hugh that this was a favourite mark of the cowboys and not having any tins out on the plains he had thrown up sods or the head of a stag for hugh to fire at harry took his place about five yards from hugh now he said hugh waited until the tin reached the highest point and then fired it flew upward again the other five shots were fired in quick succession and then the tin fell to the ground it was a feat frequently accomplished among the cowboys and broncho harry was himself perfectly capable of accomplishing it but he was not the less surprised at seeing it performed by a newcomer to the plains well you can shoot now let us see you draw your pistols empty so there aint no fear of an accident just put it in your belt again now stand facing me we will draw together keep your hand down by your side till i say now then draw cock and pull your trigger stop i will take my cartridges out there aint no use in taking risks and in a hurry my trigger might go off too now i am readynow broncho harry rather prided himself on the quickness with which he could draw but his pistol was not out of his belt when the hammer of hughs fell the lad having fired from his hip waal i swar he exclaimed why how in thunder did you do it i wur looking at your hand and amost before i saw it move there was the thing pinting at me why i am reckoned pretty slick and i aint a spot upon you do it again lad hugh repeated the action waal that beats me i cant see how you do it your hand goes up to your hip thars a twinkle and thars the pistol cocked and the hammer falling at once its like conjuring just do it slow hugh showed that as his hand fell on the pistol his thumb rested on the hammer and his forefinger on the trigger while the others closed on the butt drew the pistol from the belt and threw the barrel forward it is just practice he said i have been at it for the last six months waal young fellow broncho harry said solemnly i have been out on the plains for ten years and i have seen pretty considerable shooting but i never saw anything that was a circumstance to that you are all right you can get into a muss with the worst bad man in texas just as soon as you like and you have got him sure i wouldnt have blieved it if i hadnt seen it it is a kind of lightning trick it air useful to be able to back an unbroken broncho it air useful to throw a rope sartin and sure at full gallop over rough ground but it air fifty times more useful to be able to draw a pistol like a flash as you do waal let us go back to camp you dont mind my telling the boys it would be hardly fair as any of them should get into a muss with you thinking as they had got a soft thing and it will keep you out of trouble for you may be sure as no one is like to be getting up a muss with you when they know it would be sartin death do as you like broncho but it seems to me that there is no fear of quarrelling everyone seems to be wonderfully goodtempered and not to mind a bit what jokes are played upon him that is so hugh people are apt to keep their temper when they know that if they dont someone gets killed but it wont be always like this you see we have all been going through the winter and some of us have been having pretty hard times and anyhow we are all pleased to be at work again and out on the plains but you will see that this kind of thing wont last long when the work gets heavy and men dont get four hours a night in their blankets and the herds take to stampeding and one thing and another mens tempers wont be as they is now some of them grow sulky and wont open their lips all day and others get that crusty that they are ready to jump down the throat of the first man that speaks to them then trouble begins you bet besides when we get further south we may come upon mexican villages and where there is mexicans there is spirits and where there is spirits there is trouble i tell you lad you dont begin to know about a cowpunchers life yet that evening after the rest of the outfit had returned and supper was over broncho harry said i have had about the biggest surprise today boys that i have ever had i looked upon hugh here as a tenderfoot a good un but still new to it and i found out that when it comes to a sixshooter there aint a man in the camp nor in the ranche and i doubt whether there is in all texas as can shoot as he does no one expressed a doubt as to the cowboys assertion for on the plains to doubt a mans word is a grave insult but there was a murmur of surprise i dont say as he is the straightest shot harry went on he is a good shot although maybe there are plenty who can beat him but when it comes to quickness of drawing i never see a man who was a spot to him thats so bill royce put in hugh can shoot straight wonderful straight but i have seen men shoot better and he aint quite sartin in his shooting when he is going at a gallop although hell learn that but as for quicknesswell i dont know how he does it his pistol is out before i have time to get a grip of mine let us see you hugh two or three of the cowboys said simultaneously i have no objection hugh said standing up what shall i fire at oh fire at anything it aint the aim its the quickness broncho and bill are talking about heres a mark i have often seen him fire at when we were out on the plains together and taking a stick of about the thickness of his wrist from the fire bill royce walked ten or twelve paces away then he held out the stick which was blazing at the end all eyes were fixed on hugh who drew and fired from his hip and the burning end of the brand flew in fragments there was an exclamation of astonishment from all present waal i never long tom said in course the shot wur nothing from the shoulder but there aint many as could do it from the hip but that aint so much it wur the quickness how on arth did you do it i had my eyes on your hand and i dont know how it wur done no more nor a baby waal hugh i have never felt like quarrelling with you and you may take your davie i shall never feel like it now waal i am jiggered the rest all assented with much variety of strange oaths and then the cowboys favourite topic having been broached there was a good deal of talk about shooting and several exhibitions of skill that surprised hugh long tom picked a tiny gourd about the diameter of a penny from a trailing vine common on the plains and after giving a stir to the fire to make it blaze up went ten paces away and held it up between his finger and thumb and broncho harry shattered it with a bullet then broncho went the same distance out turned himself sideways and long tom smashed the bowl of his pipe would you like to have a try hugh he asked no thank you broncho i daresay i might hit the pipe if it were fixed at that distance but i would not try when it was within three inches of your nose for anything it will come in time hugh it is just nerve but i wouldnt mind holding it out to you now i should not be a bit afeard then they sat down to the fire again and hugh heard many anecdotes of marvellous shooting hitherto he had borne no nickname being the only one in camp addressed by his simple name but he found next morning that he had been rechristened and henceforward he was always addressed as lightning illustration illustration chapter ix a roundup day by day the herds swelled and at the end of two months they began to move in the direction of the general rendezvous hugh had soon taken his share in the nightguarding of the cattle and found it fascinating work he and broncho harry generally worked together the first watch was preferred because this allowed a fair nights rest to be taken afterwards but at the same time the work was far harder and more arduous than in the later watches the cattle were still on their feet when the watch began and on reaching them the two guards began to ride round and round them going in opposite directions for a time the cattle would go on feeding then gradually they would lie down until perhaps all but five or six were on the ground at this time however the slightest noise would bring them on to their feet again and then groups would try to leave the mass to begin to feed again and the cowboys had to drive them in upon a dark night they depended more upon their horses sight than their own for these would of their own accord leave the closepacked circle and strike out to turn back any animals that had wandered from it at last after an hour or two the herd would all subside and the cowboys would flatter themselves that their work was done then one of the cattle lying outside would leap to his feet with a snort alarmed perhaps by the sudden scamper of an inquisitive jackrabbit which having come up to examine what was going on had fled at the approach of one of the cowboys with a loud snort the whole herd would then spring to their feet perhaps after a time the herd would lie down again reassured by the song of the cowboys who from the time they came on duty always continued to sing unless they played on a fife or some other musical instrument which answered as well as the voice at other times a sort of general agitation communicated itself to the herd those on the outside finding themselves unable to leave the mass owing to the vigilance of their guard would begin to move along its edge the motion would spread and in a short time the whole mass be circling or as the cowboys call it weaving as this action unless checked always terminated in a general stampede the duty of the cowboys was at once to check it this could only be done by wedging themselves into the mass shouting and using their heavy whips to break it up and put a stop to the motion this was dangerous work not only from the pressure but from the sea of horns and angry tossing heads sometimes it would be successful sometimes it would fail above the lowing and bellowing there would be a thunder of hoofs on the side opposite to that on which they were engaged then would rise a shout of they are off and the cowboys would edge their horses out of the mass and one on each flank gallop at the top of their speed to head the animals back as soon as they came near the head of the herd they would yell and shout at the top of their voices sometimes discharging their pistols in the air pressing the animals on the flank gradually inward and so checking the speed of the whole until they at last met in front of the herd sometimes they would succeed before two or three miles of ground were passed over sometimes the wild flight of the herd could not be checked before morning when they would be thirty or forty miles away from their startingplace if unable to stop them the great aim of the cowboys was to keep them in one body in that case no great trouble resulted from the stampede the other men would be out in the morning and the herd would be driven back to its startingplace but if the herd broke up as was sometimes the case and scattered over the country it might take many days of hard work before they could again be got together if the night set in wild so as to render it probable that the cattle would stampede a third man was placed on the guard he would aid in keeping them in as long as possible but if they broke the circle and went off his duty was to gallop back to camp the cowboys there would leap to their feet in an instant run to the horses picketed near saddled and bridled ready for instant use throw themselves on their backs and gallop off at the top of their speed in the direction in which the herd had gone thunderstorms were of not infrequent occurrence and when the clouds were seen banking up before sunset and the lightning began to play the cattleguard knew that they were in for a troubled night long before the storm approached close enough to cause actual alarm among the cattle they would evince signs of uneasiness the electrical condition of the air seeming to affect them they might lie down but it was only to rise again and the distant roll of the thunder seemed to be answered by their restless bellowing on such a night it needed no message to the camp to bring up help as the storm approached and it became evident by the brightness and rapidity of the flashes that it was going to be an unusually severe one one by one the men would leave their fire or rise from their couches and go out to their horses pull up and coil their ropes leap into the saddle wrap a blanket round them and gallop off to the herd beginning always to sing as they approached it as otherwise their arrival might stampede the animals when the storm came overhead the terror of the cattle rose to the highest point and the efforts of the whole of the cowboys of the outfit scarcely sufficed to restrain them the almost incessant flashes of lightning showed a sea of heads and horns wild eyes and distended nostrils the thunder was continuous and so terrible were some of these storms that hugh felt grateful to the animals that the trouble they gave and the incessant efforts and activity required to restrain them diverted his attention from the terrible war of elements overhead on such a night it was almost certain that sooner or later the herd would stampede and once off the efforts of their guard were directed to keep them together rather than to head them so long as they remained in a bunch it mattered little whether they were one mile or thirty from the camp if headed and held up they would probably start again and it was less anxious work to gallop by the side of the frightened mass than to hold them in check when once their excitement reached its height in some respects the ride in such a storm as this was less dangerous than upon a dark still night for the lightning flashes showed not only the exact position of the herd but greatly diminished the chance of serious falls by lighting up the whole configuration of the country and showing any obstacles in the way even a fall heavy though it might be would be a trifle in comparison to one occurring while endeavouring to head the herd for in that case it would entail certain death as life would be trampled out in an instant by the onward torrent of cattle hugh had by this time come to understand that even twelve horses were by no means too much for the use of each man wiry and tough as were the ponies the men who rode them seemed to be iron hugh was frequently in his saddle eighteen hours a day occasionally twenty and four or even five horses would be thoroughly done up before his work was over had they been fed with grain a smaller number might have sufficed for unless unusually pressed they could have been ridden again on the following day but fed entirely upon the dry grasses of the plains they needed a days rest before they were again fit for work the herd increased by another thousand before it reached the general rendezvous of the roundup for each day six of the men scoured the country lying within ten or fifteen miles of the line of march and drove in all the cattle met with on their way at last they reached the stream near whose banks the vast herds driven in from all quarters were gathered there had been an occasional days halt on the way to give a needed rest to cattle horses and men but now that the outfit had arrived at the spot indicated before they had left the headquarters station there was a rest for four days before operations commenced the time was employed by the men in washing overhauling and mending their clothes repairing their saddles and in sleep they knew nothing of the position of the other outfits of their own and of the other ranches but were sure that they all lay within a radius of some twenty or thirty milesthat is to say all that had as yet arrived some had probably come up days before perhaps weeks others would not be there for some time all depended upon the nature of the country to be worked and the distance traversed there were several other outfits scattered along the banks of the stream above and below them at distances of about half a mile apart and the overseers of the different ranches were busy making arrangements for the general campaign four days after their arrival a cowboy rode in with a letter to the overseer of the outfit a few minutes later broncho harry and four other hands among whom were hugh and bill royce were ordered to saddle up and to go down to the central station the term order is scarcely a correct one for cowboys are not men to be ordered a cowboy is asked to do a thing and asked in civil terms the request has all the force of an order but it is not so conveyed it is put in the form i want you to do so and so or will you saddle up and do so and so it is just as easy to put it in that form as in any other and though the cowboy knows that if he does not comply with the request he has got to ride back to the headquarters station and get his money he does not feel his dignity injured as it would be by a direct order there are no men more independent than cowboys they know their value and a really good man knows and this was more especially the case at that time that he has but to ride to the next ranche to get employment the consequence is that although willing to work to the utmost of his powers in the interest of his employers he by no means regards that employer as a master but treats even the chief manager on terms of absolute equality and insists upon being so treated by him in return broncho harry the overseer said i want you jack johnson bowie bob chunky royce and lightning hugh to saddle up and ride down to the forks and help in the roundup the waggon is going to stay here till our herd is called up there are men from the other outfits there the boss is there and he will settle about things two of the waggons are there so you will be all right as to grub i expect you will be there about a fortnight and then the others will come down and take your place are we to take down our other horses the cowboy asked no no outfit will take charge of the cattle as they are cut out and branded no will take the next mob anyhow you wont want horses except to take you down there all right harry said and proceeded to call the other four together in a few minutes the horses were brought in and saddled the blankets rolled up and strapped to the saddles and the five men chosen after eating a hasty meal started for the point named which was some twentyfive miles distant now you are going to see some fun hugh bill royce who had got the nickname of chunky from his short square figure remarked as they rode along yes broncho harry put in you will have to look out sharp hugh i tell you it is pretty lively work when you get hold of a six months calf and the old savage of a mother is trying her best to hook you thar aint a day that some fellow dont get hurt but as long as you dont let a cow jam you against the posts it dont much matter that is what you have got to look to special a chuck in the air dont much matter nor being knocked a dozen yards or so but if you get jammed by one of those brutes against a fence there aint nothing to do but to bury you three hours riding brought them to the forks two or three large herds of cattle could be made out far on the plains another mob could be seen not far from the wooded hollow that marked the course of the stream horsemen were hovering round them and there was a confused mass of animals in what looked to hugh like a strong stockade near it a short distance away twelve waggons were drawn up in regular order some fifty yards apart columns of light smoke rising near them showed that cooking was going on at each waggon quickening the speed of their horses the cowboys rode on until they drew up at the waggon of the brand circle triangle ranche howdy pete broncho harry said as he leapt from his horse to a negro who with a mexican assistant was engaged in cooking howdy broncho harry where are the boys and whats new dey is out dar the negro said waving his hand in the direction of the corral some of dem is working in de herd some of dem is inside irish is in de waggon him leg broken new york john got killed three days back thats bad pete how did he manage that old cow hooked himran horn right through him body irish got tossed against posts i suppose there are boys down from the other outfits here pete yes five no five no no came in dis mornin now you come dat make fifteen and all our own outfit dat too much for pete to cook for well you have got someone to help you pete so you ought not to grumble pete made a grimace as much as to signify that he did not consider the assistance of the mexican to be of much account between the men of these two races there was a general feud while the cowboys looked down upon both and as a rule refused to allow them to work with them except in the capacity of cook where are our horses pete no horses over dere the negro said pointing to a group of horses out on the plain young nat looking arter dem well we may as well take our horses out there boys broncho harry said turning to the others it is no use picketing them here we aint likely to want them i will ride them out hugh volunteered the others removed their saddles and bridles and hugh drove them out to the group on the plain well nat how are you getting on he asked a boy of about fifteen years old who was lying on the ground with his horses rein over his arm near them oh im all right the boy replied been here a week and getting pretty tired of this job you bet with nothing to do but just to lie here blast all camps i say you ought to be at school you young imp hugh laughed i would just as soon be doing that as lying here the boy said it will be all right when i get to be a cowboy but there aint much fun about this just come in yes who is with you hugh gave the names broncho harry aint a bad sort the boy said the others aint of much account you had better tell them so hugh said with a smile i would tell them if i thought fit the boy said angrily you dont suppose that im afraid of any of that mob i know you are a very bad man nat hugh said with assumed gravity a very dangerous character in a camp but i hope you wont do any of them any harm i shant do them no harm if they dont do me any the boy said but i dont take no sauce from no one by this time hugh had unsaddled prince and placing the saddle over his head and carrying the bridle in his hand nodded to the boy and started back to the camp while prince joined the four horses which began to graze at a little distance from the rest presently two or three of the other horses came over to the newcomers and after a little snorting apparently recognized them as friends with whom they had been acquainted at the headstation and this fact being established prince and his companions were allowed to join them there were many boys like nat out on the plains for the most part lads who had run away from home and who were now training up to be cowboys being engaged in dayherding the horseswork that demanded but little skill or attention they were generally regarded with favour by the outfits to which they were attached for the cowboys as a rule are silent men and the liveliness of the boys amused them these boys generally grew up into the most reckless and daredevil of cowboys speedily picking up the worst language and imitating the wildest follies of their companions and they would have been an unmitigated nuisance in the camps had they not been frequently sternly called to order by men with whom they knew there was no trifling it was not until nightfall that the work ceased and the cowboys returned to their waggons they had been working without a break since daylight contenting themselves with eating a piece of bread and cold meat standing at their work in the middle of the day well boys come in for a spell one of them asked as they came up to the fire where the new arrivals were seated we have had a week of it and it has been a pretty tough job the cattle are wonderful wild i suppose the thunder has scared them and we are pretty sure the injuns have been chasing them lately by the foothills did you see anything of the reds no there were no signs of them in the part we searched there were signs further south the other went on we came on two places where they had slaughtered a lot of cattle and we hear they have been making raids down into mexico and the troops have been out after them down by the frontier line anyhow the cattle are wilder than usual you have heard i suppose that new york john has been rubbed out yes we heard that and i have been talking to irish he seems getting on all right irish is a blamed fool i told him over and over again he would get into trouble if he didnt mind but nothing could persuade him that there was any difference between the ways of a kerry cow and a texas steer and of course he came to grief i should have thought that new york john would have known better than to get himself hooked like that but it were not altogether his fault he wur holding a calf and he had his eye on the old cow who had got her dander up pretty considerable one of the men had roped her and new york john naturally thought that she was safe so he downed the calf and the brand was clapped to it and the young un bawls out and of course the cow made a fresh rush to get at it and the rope breaks and she was on new york john afore he could look round but how came the rope to break a man must be a fool and worse to come down to roundup with a rotten old rope well the rope was a new un you may guess there was a lot of talk over it and it put our backs up a bit that new york john should get killed that way the rope wur a new one there warnt no doubt about that but it had been cut half through who had done it in course no one knew the men were mad over it and ef they could have found out who had done it he would have swung from the limb of a tree in a squirrels jump there were two or three men who had had musses with the chap as the rope belonged to but no one could say as any of them had cut his rope of course it might have been an accident but no one thought that very likely however there it wur somebody cut the fellows rope to spite him and it cost new york john his life which was pretty rough on him what is the work for tomorrow well your lot and the men of the other two outfits are to be in the yard we have got a spell off except of course that we have got to look after our own bunch of cattle how many are there of them about i should say i expect some of us will start driving them up north day after tomorrow the next morning hugh went down to the cattleyard as soon as they had finished breakfast day had just broken and while they were waiting for the herd to be brought up he looked round at the yard the paling was composed of very strong posts six feet high placed at intervals of two or three inches apart it had been built three or four years before as this place was the most convenient and central upon the plains a few waggon loads of timber had been taken out there a fortnight before the arrival of the teams with a gang of men who took up any posts that showed signs of rottenness and replaced them by others the various ranches in the roundup performing this duty by turns the fence inclosed a space of upwards of an acre beside the contingent from the brand circle triangle ranche some forty or fifty cowboys from the other ranches were gathered within it several fires were lighted for heating the brands and the overseer who was in charge of the work for the day divided the men into parties each group consisting of representatives of four or five different ranches in a short time a great herd was seen approaching driven in by a number of mounted cowboys the crossbars were removed from the opening that served as a gate at the upper end of the yard and the reluctant animals unable to withstand the pressure of those behind poured in several hundreds entered the bars were dropped again and the animals inclosed stood in a dense group stamping the ground and threatening an attack as the cowboys approached them illustration branding the calves at the round up these all carried their ropes some holding them in their hands ready for throwing while others had them coiled over their left shoulder while in their right hands they held their heavy whips those who were to fetch out the calves first approached half a dozen ropes were thrown and the calves were dragged out struggling and calling or as the cowboys called it bawling to their mothers for assistance the call was not in vain the cows rushed out furiously to the assistance of their calves as each did so the cowboy whose comrade was dragging the calf towards one of the fires shouted out the brand on the cow and then cracking their whips and if necessary using them they drove the animal back into the mass and kept her there while the calf was thrown down and branded with the same mark as its mother hugh was among those told off to fetch out the calves he had had some practice as many of the mavericks found had calves by their side and these as well as the cows had been branded with the brand circle triangle another cowboy assisted him to haul the calf by main force towards the fire and held the rope while hugh ran up to it placing himself beside it he leaned over it grasped it by the flank with both hands and then lifted it and flung it down on its side his comrade then ran up and pinned its head to the ground while hugh knelt on its haunches and the brander came up with a hot iron and marked it the iron was held on long enough only to burn off the hair and slightly singe the hide and the mark so made was almost indelible in addition to this the calfs ears were cut each ranche having its particular mark such as two long slits and a short one a square piece cut out and a notch on either side of it a semicircular piece and two notches a semicircle and a square c these marks were very durable but even these often became confused owing to the ears getting torn by a rush through thorns or by the action of a neighbours horn in a close press or during a stampede it required but small exercise of strength to throw a calf of three months old but many of them were eight or nine months and nearly full grown and it needed a great exertion of strength and a good deal of knack to throw down animals of this size once or twice hugh had narrow escapes for some of the cows in spite of the cowboys whips burst through them and rushed to the assistance of their calves but each time the ropes descended over their heads or caught them by their legs and threw them to the ground before they reached him after an hour of this work he was relieved by one of the other men and took his turn of the lighter work of keeping back the cows when every calf in the yard had been branded the gate at the lower end was opened and the animals driven out while a fresh mob was admitted from the herd so the work went on until the herd had all passed through the yard and the calves been branded then there was a quarter of an hours rest while another herd was driven up and the work recommenced by nightfall some nine thousand animals had passed through the yard and nearly four thousand calves had been branded begrimed with sweat and dust the cowboys went down to the stream where most of them bathed and all had a thorough wash and then went up to their waggons to supper how do you feel now broncho harry asked hugh when he threw himself down by the fire i feel broken up altogether harry my back and loins feel as if i had been beaten to a pulp i believe i have strained every muscle of my arms and my hands and wrists are so stiff that i cant close my fingers yes calfchucking is pretty hard work until you get accustomed to it the cowboy said it is knack more than strength though it needs a lot of strength too when you have got a rampagious tenmonths calf in your hands i have not got the knack yet hugh said and anything over six months i had to have roped by the legs and thrown but i suppose i shall be able to tackle them in time in the case of the cows that had been branded only a year or two before there was no difficulty in recognizing the brand and so to decide upon the ownership of the calf but in the case of older cows the brand and earmarks had in some instances both become so far obliterated that it was difficult to decide what they had originally been over these brands there were sharp and sometimes angry disputes among the cowboys belonging to the different ranches the case was generally settled by the overseer in charge of the days operations calling upon three cowboys belonging to ranches unconnected with the dispute to give their opinion as to what the marks had originally been their decision was accepted by all parties as final and the cow rebranded as well as the calf what do you do when the brand is so far gone as to make it altogether impossible to say what it was hugh asked it would not get here at all in that state the cowboy replied it would have been rebranded at once by the outfit that first found it just as if it had been a maverick but in that case of course any cowboy could claim the cow as belonging to his ranche if he could convince the others that the old brand was the one used by it they never brand over the old mark that must be left as an evidence the next day happened to be sunday and hugh felt glad indeed that he had a day on which to recover from his stiffness sundays were always kept except in cases of great emergency as a day of rest cowboys taking the opportunity to wash and mend their clothes to practise shooting with their revolvers or to run races with their horses at roundsup these races afford one of the chief interests to the cowboy for rivalry between the various ranches runs high and the men are ready to bet their bottom dollar upon the representative of their own ranche have you ever tried that horse of yours against anything fast hugh one of his comrades asked no i am sure he is very fast but i have never really tried him we were fools not to think of that before broncho harry put in we ought to have raced him against some of the others and have found out what he can do and then we might have made a soft thing of it i suppose you wouldnt mind trying him hugh not at all but if he is to race you had better ride him instead of me i shouldnt say you were much above nine stone and a half i dont know what you mean by your stone harry said we dont reckon that way out here i was a hundred and thirtyfive pounds last time i weighed at the headstation that is two pounds more than i said well i am certainly twenty pounds heavieri should say twentyfive and that makes a lot of difference i should think so still we had best have a trial hugh before we try to make a match that is a good horse of yours i mean the one you first mounted and who played such tricks with you i should like some day to try him against my best and see how they go i daresay you will get him again before the roundup is over what length do you run your races here broncho in general they are short dashes not above half a mile at the outside but sometimes a match is made for some distance well when we have had dinner we will trot out into the plain we must go off a goodish bit and make sure that none of the boys of the other ranches are within sight accordingly when dinner was over broncho harry and hugh went out to the horses prince come trotting out as soon as he heard hughs whistle and broncho harry soon dropped his noose over the neck of his own horse they then put on the saddles and bridles which they had brought with them and went off at a canter across the plains they ran three or four trials the result showed that bronchos horse was quicker in getting off and that in a quarter of a mile dash there was little to choose between them but at longer distances than this prince was in spite of the greater weight he carried much the faster that horse can go the cowboy said admiringly i shouldnt mind if there were a pack of redskins coming behind me if i was on his back the worst of him is he is so goodlooking if he was ugly to look at we might clean out all the camps but he looks so good that i am afraid we shant be able to get much money out of him well now we wont race him this evening there are sure to be some matches on and i will ride my horse that way i shall find what there is in the camp and whether there is anything that can beat him as much as your horse can do dont you go cavorting about on him just let him run with the rest of the mob then he wont be noticed there is too much to be got through in this camp for men to take stock of the horses then if we keep him dark we can get someone to set up his horse against the best of ours we will put the boys up to it when we get back or someone may be blowing about your horse there were as the cowboy anticipated a number of races run that evening broncho harry beat two other horses but lost his winnings and more in the third race when he was beaten somewhat easily by an animal which in point of looks was greatly the inferior of his own that is just what i told you hugh he said when after unsaddling his horse and sending it off to join its companions on the plains he returned to the waggon i am a blessed fool for i ought to have known that when that cross ts man offered to back that uglylooking brute against mine he wur a sight better than he looked he just shot off like an arrow at starting i didnt loose anything afterwards but i couldnt pick up them three lengths he got in the first forty yards if we make a match against him we must see that it aint less than half a mile the next morning the work in the stockyards was resumed and continued throughout the week illustration chapter x a race i dont think broncho hugh said one evening that i should do anything more about that race if i were you or if you do dont lay out any money on it there is just as much interest in a race if it is for a dollar or two as if all the boys in the outfit piled their money upon it that horse beat yours pretty easily quite as easy i should say as prince could beat him for that distance and i really dont think that prince would have any pull of him in races of the length you have on here in a twentymile gallop i feel sure he would leave anything in camp behind easily but i certainly would not race him any long distance of that sort if i had a troop of indians after me prince would have to do his best whether it was twenty miles or fifty but i would not press him when it was merely a question of making money on him your horse was beaten and of course we none of us like to own that the cross ts men have got a better horse than we have i am quite willing that prince should run for the honour of the ranche but i dont feel at all sure about his winning and should be sorry to see the boys plank their dollars down heavily upon him all right hugh it is your horse and i will do as you want but i should like to take that fellow down a bit he is one of those fellows as is always blowing he rather likes to be thought a bad man and is said to be very handy with his sixshooter on sunday morning after breakfast was over the cowboy in question with two or three men of the same ranche came across from their waggon to that of the brand circle triangle men have you got anything else that can go in this crowd he said addressing broncho harry there dont seem any horses worth talking about in the whole roundup some of our boys say as how they have seen one of your lot on a likelylooking bay well i dont deny he is a goodlooking horse broncho harry said and can go a bit but he is slow at starting and that critter of yours is too speedy for the bay to have a chance of catching him up in a quarter of a mile make it a bit over and i will ride him myself against you if you like i dont care about a halfmile the man said but i will split the difference if you like or if you fancy your critter for a long journey i am open to make a match ten miles out and back each side to put down two hundred dollars what do you say to that mate broncho harry said turning to hugh hugh shook his head decidedly i wouldnt have him ridden at racing speed twenty miles if there were a thousand dollars at stake he said but if you like to take up the other offer you can ride him oh it is your horse is it the cowboy said why dont you ride him yourself because i ride something like two stone heavier than you do hugh said and if the horse is going to race he may as well have a fair chance well how much shall it be for the cowboy said turning again to broncho harry i suppose we may as well say the same stake a hundred dollars a side i suppose that wont hurt you if you fancy the horse two or three of the brand circle triangle men broke in together take him up broncho we will all chip in very well then that is settled broncho harry said shall we say five oclock i suppose we shall ride the same course as last time i will go out now and step the distance if you will go on with me all right the man said and they at once proceeded to mark out a distance of seven hundred paces which they both agreed was somewhere about halfway between a quarter and half a mile a wand to which broncho attached his neckerchief was stuck up as the winningpost while a low bush marked the point from which they had started to measure the news soon spread through the camp and many of the cowboys of the other ranches strolled in to find out what the brand circle triangle men thought of their chances and to see whether they were disposed to back their horse hugh however persuaded them not to risk their money you see he said my horse didnt beat bronchos by much no more did the other chap hugh he just jumped two lengths ahead and after that broncho held him yes i know that hugh replied but we dont know that he was doing his best that is so broncho agreed he knew he had got me and there was no use in giving his horse away i expect he had got a bit in hand i dont think it is good enough to bet on now let us get this money together twenty of the men put down their five dollars at once and as the others wished also to have a share broncho harry said well you three put in your five dollars each and hugh and i will make it up to fifty like enough they will be laying odds on their horse especially when they find we wont bet so that at the last moment i will take them up for this fifty and if we win we will put it to the stakes and divide up all round the proposal was at once agreed to towards the afternoon they found that the brand x men were offering three and four to one upon their horse for the odds had run up rapidly as none of the other cowboys were disposed to back the brand circle triangle seeing that the men of that ranche would not bet on their horse at the appointed hour the two competitors went to the post there had been several minor races but these had attracted comparatively little interest every man in camp however had assembled for the purpose of seeing this contest and they were now gathered near the winningpost a cowboy belonging to a neutral ranche was to act as starter the two riders had divested themselves of their heavy boots you must shake him up to begin with broncho hugh had said to him before he mounted he will do his best afterwards he hates being passed and when he sees the other ahead of him he will go all he knows now the starter said when the two horses stood side by side in a line with him i shall walk on twenty or thirty yards ahead so that you can both see me then i shall hold up my sixshooter and fire dont either of you start till i do i may fire straight off i may wait a minute after i have got my hand up you have got to keep your eyes on me and when you see the flash then you let them go both men fastened their spurs on to their stockinged feet and as the pistol went off struck their heels into their mounts while at the same moment broncho harry brought down his whip smartly on princes quarter astonished at this treatment the animal gave a bound forward and started at full gallop there was no occasion for the other man to use his whip his horse knew what was expected of it and with its hind legs gathered under it had been expecting the signal and was even more quickly away than prince it did not however gain more than a length for the first three hundred yards the horses maintained their relative position but prince was tugging at his bridle and his rider though shouting and yelling as if to urge him to his fullest speed was yet holding him in then the leading horseman thinking that prince was doing his best and feeling certain that he had the race in hand dug his spurs into his horse and the animal in a few bounds had added another length to his lead but broncho harry loosened his pull at the reins and let prince go and before another hundred yards had been passed his head was level with the others stirrup the brand x man whipped and spurred while broncho harry sat quiet on his horse and contented himself by maintaining his present position when a hundred yards from home he shook his horse up and slightly touched him with his spur almost instantaneously prince was level with his opponent and then dashing on ahead passed the flagpost three lengths in advance amidst a loud cheer from the brand circle triangle men and from most of the other cowboys for although few had ventured to back the horse there was a general feeling of satisfaction at seeing the brand x man beaten the latter without a word circled round and rode straight back to his waggon and the stakeholder handed over the stake and bets which had both been deposited with him to broncho harry two hundred and fifty dollars he said as he put the roll of notes in his pocket for the bets had been made at three to one i call that an easier way of making money than cowpunching i cant stand treat boys because there is no liquor in camp but remember i owe you one all round the first time we meet in a saloon returning to camp the division was made and each of the twentyfive men received his share of ten dollars together with the money he had staked i shouldnt be surprised hugh broncho harry said as they sat round the fire if we have trouble with that skunk he is a badtempered lot at best and he dropped his money heavy for i hear he put in all the stake himself and he bet some besides he took twenty off me last week but he has dropped pretty well half his seasons money you see if he dont try and get up trouble if he does leave him to me harry i dont want to leave him to you hugh i rode the race and if he wants fighting he will get it here but i am afraid it is likely enough he will try and make trouble with you he knows that i am a pretty tough hand but he thinks you nothing but a tenderfoot and that sort of fellow always fixes a quarrel on a soft if he gets the chance well as you know harry i can take care of myself and i would much rather it was me than you i know that you are a good deal better shot than i am but you know you are not nearly so quick with your weapon there would be no occasion to shoot i fancy you are right there lad if you get the drop on him you will see he will weaken directly the evening however passed off without the defeated cowboy making his appearance he reckons it wouldnt do long tom said you see the hull crowd would be agin him if he were to come and get up a muss because he has been beat in a race a fellow who runs his horse is bound to look pleasant whether he wins or whether he loses and a good many of the boys was saying as they never see a worse thing than the way he galloped off after broncho came in ahead of him if he was to come down here and make a muss he knows that for sure the crowd wouldnt stand it and that if everything wasnt perfectly square they would come judge lynch on him in no time now a man may take the chance of being shot in a quarrel but when if he aint shot by one man he is likely to get hung by a crowd it takes a pretty hard man to run the chances only look out for him broncho i believe he has got a touch of mexican blood in him although i dare say he would shoot the man who ventured to say so only it is there for all that and you know a mexican dont mind waiting months so that he gets even at last thats so broncho harry agreed a greaser is about the worst sort of white that is if you can call them white i dont know but i hate them more than injuns on the following morning half no outfit started north with a herd of cattle that had been picked out from those driven in and branded and hugh with his four mates now took their turn at driving in the herds to the yard this was much more to hughs taste than the previous work had been he did not mind the work of hauling out and throwing the calves nor of keeping back the cows but he hated seeing the calves branded and still more the operation of cutting their ears it was of course necessary work but it was painful to him to share in and indeed he had generally managed to get bill royce to exchange work with him when he was told off to perform these operations the herding on the other hand was good fun the animals seemed to have an instinctive repulsion for the stockyard many of them had been branded there the previous year and probably recognized the spot at any rate there were constant attempts to break away and it needed all the energy and vigilance of their guard to drive them down to the yard and still more to keep them there while awaiting their turn to enter it but more exciting still and much more dangerous was the work of those who kept guard at the lower end of the yard as the animals came out the calves were half mad with terror and pain and the cows furious at the defeat of their efforts to succour their offspring so that it was dangerous work for the men of the various ranches to pick out the animals bearing their brand and to drive them off to the knot of animals gathered at some little distance away under the guard of two of their comrades sometimes the cows made furious charges which it needed all the agility of horse and rider to avoid then as the animal rushed past a rope would be thrown over its head or under its leg and an instant later it would come to the ground with a crash this generally proved sufficient the cow when the rope was slackened rose to its feet in a half dazed way and walked heavily off with the evident impression upon its mind that an earthquake had taken place hugh was glad when he heard in the middle of the day that the rest of the outfit had arrived with the waggon and all the horsesfor he felt that prince had had enough of itand he at once galloped off roped one of his own horses shifted the saddle on to him and went back to work one or two of the bulls gave a great deal of trouble charging hither and thither furiously as they came out from the yard in these cases three or four of the cowboys united and while one attracted his attention the others threw their ropes some of the bulls had to be thrown half a dozen times before they were subdued a few days later the brand x man who went by the name of flash bill walked up to the fire round which the cowboys of no outfit were sitting i have just come across to say i am sorry i rode off that day you beat me broncho i allow it was a mean trick of me but i was riled pretty considerable still i oughtnt ter have done it it wurnt the right thing it wurnt harry said but now you own up there is an end of it sit right down and have a smoke for some time the conversation turned upon horses two or three other men of the brand x ranche sauntered up and joined in presently flash bill turned to hugh who had taken no part in the conversation and said have you a mind to trade that horse no i wouldnt sell it at any price hugh said it exactly suits me and i should find difficulty in getting another as good seems to me as i have seen that horse before the man said had him long i have had him about eight months hugh replied curious i seem to know him cant think where i have seen him somewhere out west i bought him at mkinney hugh said oh you bought him did you how do you suppose i got him hugh asked shortly oh there are plenty of horses out on these plains as never was paid for flash bill said i dont say there are not hugh replied at any rate i expect you are a better authority about that than i am what do you mean by that i mean exactly what i say hugh said quietly do you mean to say as i have been a horsethief the man exclaimed furiously i mean to say exactly what i did say hugh replied then you are a liar and the mans hand went to his hip to his astonishment before his finger had closed on the butt of his pistol he was looking down the barrel of hughs revolver drop that hugh exclaimed or i fire flash bill threw up his hand now you will take that back hugh said i take it back flash bill said sullenly youve got the drop on me though how you did it i dont know there aint nothing more to be said i take it back there is an end of it then hugh said replacing his pistol in his belt you thought you had got a soft thing you see youve made a mistake you had better git flash bill broncho harry said you aint wanted here you came over to make a muss and only i knowed as hugh could hold his own with you i would have put a bullet into you myself when i saw your hand go to your pistol you git and if you will take my advice you will git altogether you cant play the bad man in this camp any longer after weakening before a young chap as is little more than a tenderfoot with a muttered execration flash bill got up and followed by the men of his own ranche walked off you did mighty well considering that it is the first trouble youve been in hugh but you did wrong in not shooting the rule on the plains is if one man calls another either a liar or a coward that fellow has a right to shoot him down if he can get his gun out first thats the rule aint it boys there was a chorus of assent you may call a man pretty nigh everything else and it dont go for much we aint chice as to our words here but them two words liar and coward is death and you would have done well to have shot him you bet youll have trouble with that fellow some day youll see he will go now but youll hear of him again i could no more have shot him than i could have flown hugh said for he was really unarmed he would have shot you if he had been heeled first long tom said and there aint a man in the camp but would have said that you had been perfectly right if you had shot him for it is sartin he came over here bound to kill you i agree with broncho you have done a mighty soft thing and maybe you will be sorry for it some day i have heard say that flash bill has been a mighty hard man in his time and i guess as stealing horses aint been the worse thing he has done and i reckon he has come back here to work for a bit because he has made it too hot for himself in the settlements well its a pity you didnt shoot the next morning as they were saddling their horses flash bill rode past he had his blankets and kit strapped behind his saddle he checked his horse as he came up to them i give you warning he said to hugh that ill shoot at sight when we meet again you too broncho harry all right broncho harry replied we shall both be ready for you without another word flash bill put spurs to his horse and galloped away this was the regular form of challenge among the cowboys sometimes after a quarrel in which one had got the drop of the other and the latter had been obliged to take back what he had said mutual friends would interfere and if the row had taken place when one or other of the men had been drinking or when there was no previous malice or dislike between the men the matter would be made up and things go on as before if however the quarrel had been a deliberate one and one or other considered himself still aggrieved he would take his discharge and leave the camp on the following morning giving his antagonist notice that he should shoot at sight when they next met and whether the meeting was alone on the plains in a drinking saloon or in a street both parties would draw and fire the moment their eyes fell on each other that flash bill should have been forced to take back his words by this young hand of the brand circle triangle ranch was a matter of the deepest astonishment to the camp and hugh found himself quite a popular character for flash bill had made himself very obnoxious and with the exception of two or three men of his own stamp in the brand x outfit the men of that body were more pleased than anyone else that the bully had had to leave none were more astonished than the men of the other outfits of the brand circle triangle ranche they had heard hugh addressed as lightning but curiosity is not a cowboy failing and few had given a thought as to how he had come by the appellation one or two had asked the question but broncho harry had the night before his party started to the roundup said to the others look here boys if anyone asks how lightning hugh came by his name dont you give him away they will larn one of these days and it will be as good as a theyater when he does that gun trick of his so keep it dark from the other boys the few questions asked therefore had been met with a laugh it is a sort of joke of ours broncho harry had said to one of the questioners you will see one of these days why it fits him hugh was not sorry when the time came for his outfit to start they had charge of a herd of eight or nine thousand animals all belonging to the brand circle triangle it was customary for most of the ranches to drive their own cattle after a roundup towards the neighbourhood of their station for the convenience of cutting out the steers that were to be sent down to market or herds principally of cows and calves for purchasers who intended to establish ranches in the still unoccupied territory in new mexico colorado dakota and montana some of these herds would have thousands of miles to travel and be many months upon the journey many of the cowboys looked forward to taking service with these herds and trying life under new conditions in the northern territories when the beef herds and such cow herds as the manager of the ranche wished to sell had been picked out and sent off the rest of the cattle would be free to wander anywhere they liked over the whole country until they were again swept together for the roundup unless other sales were effected in the meantime in which case parties of cowboys would go out to cut out and drive in the number required the number of cattle collected at the roundsup was enormous many of the ranches owning from forty to eighty thousand cattle a considerable number were not driven in at the roundup as the greater portion of the beefcattle which had already been branded were cut out and left behind by the various outfits and only the cows and calves with a few bulls to serve as leaders were driven in nevertheless at these great roundsup in texas the number of the animals collected mounted up to between two and three hundred thousand twothirds of the work was over when no outfit of the brand circle triangle ranche started well i am glad that is over bill hugh said as they halted at the end of the first days march i am not sorry bill royce replied it is desperate hard work all day at the stockyard and half ones time at night on guard with the herds is a little too much for anyone yes it has been hard work hugh said but i dont think i meant that so much as that it was not so pleasant in other ways as usual the men are too tired to talk or sing of an evening one breakfasted or rather swallowed ones food half asleep before daylight took ones dinner standing while at work and was too tired to enjoy ones supper i reckon it has been a good roundup broncho harry said there have been only four men killed by the cattle and there havent been more than five or six shooting scrapes let me think yes only five men have been shot that is five too many broncho hugh said well that is so in one way hugh but you see we should never get on out here without shooting why shouldnt we because we are an allfired rough lot out here there aint no law and no sheriffs and no police and no troops how in thunder would you keep order if it werent for the sixshooter thar would be no peace and the men would be always quarrelling and wrangling how would you work it anyhow it is just because a quarrel means a shooting scrape that men dont quarrel and that every one keeps a civil tongue in his head there aint nowhere in the world where there is so little quarrelling as out here on the plains you see if we didnt all carry sixshooters and were ready to use them the badtempered men and the hard men would have it their own way big fellows like you would be able to bully little fellows like me we should get all the bad men from the towns whenever they found the settlements too hot for them we should have murderers and gamblers and horsethieves coming and mixing themselves up with us i tell you hugh that without the revolver there would be no living out here no sirree the sixshooter puts us all on a level and each man has got to respect another i dont say as there aint a lot wiped out every year because there is but i say that it is better so than it would be without it when these plains get settled up and the grangers have their farms on them and the great cattle ranches go and you get sheriffs and judges and all that the sixshooter will go too but you cant do without it till then the revolver is our sheriff and judge and executioner all rolled in one no one who is quiet and peaceable has got much occasion to use it i nearly had to use it the other day broncho and i reckon i am quiet and peaceable waal i dont altogether know about that hugh i dont say as you want to quarrel quite the contrary but you made up your mind before you came here that if you got into trouble you were going to fight and you practised and practised until you got so quick that you are sure you can get the drop on anyone you get into a muss with so though you dont want to get in a quarrel if anyone wants to quarrel with you you are ready to take him up now if it hadnt been so there wouldnt have been any shootingirons out the other night flash bill came over to get up a quarrel he was pretty well bound to get up a quarrel with some one but if you had been a downright peaceable chap he could not have got up a quarrel with you if you had said quietly when he kinder said as how you hadnt come by that horse honest that bill here had been with you when you bought him and that you got a document in your pocket signed by a sheriff and a judge to prove that you had paid for it there would have been no words with you i dont say as flash bill who was just spoiling for a fight wouldnt have gone at somebody else likely enough he would have gone at me waal if i had been a quiet and peaceable chap i should have weakened too and so it would have gone on until he got hold of somebody as wasnt going to weaken to no one and then the trouble would have begun i dont say as this is the place for your downright peaceable man but i say if such a one comes here he can manage to go through without mixing himself up in shooting scrapes but in that way a man like flash bill let us say who is known to be ready to use his pistol might bully a whole camp yas if they wur all peaceable people but then you see they aint this sort of life aint good for peaceable people we take our chances pretty well every day of getting our necks broke one way or another and when that is so one dont think much more of the chance of being shot than of other chances besides a man aint allowed to carry on too bad if he forces a fight on another and shoots him shoots him fair mind you the boys get together and say this cant go on and that man is told to git and when he is told that he has got to if he dont he knows what he has got to expect no sirree i dont say as everything out in the plains is just arranged as it might be in new york but i say that take the life as it is i dont see as it could be arranged better there was a chap out here for a bit as had read up no end of books and he said it was just the same sort of thing way back in europe when every man carried his sword by his side and was always fighting duels till at last the kings got strong enough to make laws to put it down and managed things without it and thats the way it will be in this country once the law is strong enough to punish bad men and make it so that there aint no occasion for a fellow to carry about a sixshooter to protect his life then the sixshooter will go but that wont be for a long time yet why if it wasnt for us cowboys there wouldnt be no living in the border settlements the horsethieves and the outlaws would just rampage about as they pleased and who would follow them out on the plains and into the mountains but they know we wont have them out here and that there would be no more marcy shown to them if they fell into our hands than there would be to a rattler then again who is it keeps the injuns in order do you think it is uncle sams troops why the redskins just laugh at them its the cowboys it aint so long ago long tom put in as a boss commissioner came out to talk with the natives and make them presents and get them to live peaceful people out in the east who dont know nothing about injuns are always doing some foolish thing like that the big chief he listens to the commissioner and when he has done talking to him and asks what presents he should like the chief said as the thing that would most tickle him would be half a dozen cannons with plenty of ammunition but says the commissioner we cant give you cannon to fight our troops with troops says the chief who cares about the troops we can just drive them whenever we like we want the cannon to fight the cowboys that chief knew what was what it is the cowboys as keep back the redskins its the cowboys as prevent these plains getting filled up with outlaws and horsethieves and the cowboys can do it cause each man has got six lives pretty sartin at his belt and as many more as he has time to slip in fresh cartridges for and because we dont place much valley on our lives seeing as we risk them every day we know they aint likely to be long anyhow what with death among the herds shooting scrapes broken limbs and one thing and another and the work which wears out the strongest in a few years a cowboys life is bound to be a short one you wont meet one in ten who is over thirty it aint like other jobs we dont go away and take up with another trade what should we be fit for a man that has lived on horseback and spent his life galloping over the plains what is he going to do when he aint no longer fit for this work he aint going to hoe a cornpatch or wear a biled shirt and work in a store he aint going to turn lawyer or set up to make boots or breeches no sirree he knows as ten years is about as much as he can reckon on if his chances are good and that being so he dont hold nothing particular to his life we aint got no wives and no children we works hard for our money and when we gets it we spend it mostly in a spree we are ready to share it with any mate as comes along hard up it might be better and it might be worse anyway i dont see no chance of changing it as long as there is room out west for cattle ranches another hundred years and the grangers will have got the land and the cowboys will be gone but it will last our time anyhow hugh was much struck with this estimate of a cowboys life by one of themselves but on thinking it over he saw that it was a true one these men were the adventurous spirits of the united states had they been born in england they would have probably either enlisted or run away as boys and gone to sea they were men to whom a life of action was a necessity their life resembled rather that of the arab or the red indian than that of civilized men their senses had become preternaturally acute their eyesight was wonderful they could hear the slightest sound and pronounce unhesitatingly how it was caused there was not an ounce of unnecessary flesh upon them their muscles seemed to have hardened into whipcord they were capable of standing the most prolonged fatigue and hardship and just as a wild stag will run for a considerable distance after receiving a wound that would be instantly fatal to a domestic animal these men could as he had seen for himself and still more as he had heard many anecdotes to prove sustain wounds and injuries of the most terrible kind and yet survive seeming in many cases almost insensible to pain they were in fact a race apart and had very many good qualities and comparatively few bad ones they were indeed as long tom had said reckless of their lives and they spent their earnings in foolish dissipation but they knew of no better way the little bordertowns or mexican villages they frequented offered no other amusements and except for clothes and ammunition for their pistols they had literally no other need for their money nothing could exceed the kindness with which they nursed each other in illness or their generosity to men in distress they were devoted to the interests of their employers undergoing as a matter of course the most prolonged and most prodigious exertions they were frank goodtempered and kindly in their intercourse with each other as addicted to practical jokes as so many schoolboys and joining as heartily in the laugh when they happened to be the victims as when they were the perpetrators of the joke their code of honour was perhaps a primitive one but they lived up to it strictly and in spite of its hardships and its dangers there was an irresistible fascination in the wild life that they led illustration chapter xi a fire on the plains after the hard work at the roundup the journey north seemed almost a holiday of an evening the cooks accordion was again brought out and the men sang and to hughs amusement danced he thought the proposal was a joke when it was first made but he soon saw that it was quite serious he had declined to take part in it saying that he had never danced since he was a little boy but it was as much as he could do to restrain his laughter upon seeing the gravity with which eight of the cowboys went through a quadrille to the music of the accordion then followed waltzes and then some mexican dances the entertainment being kept up for a couple of hours dancing indeed is one of the favourite amusements of cowboys and there being no females to dance with they dance with each other and are so accustomed to do so that it comes to them as naturally as if dancing with women when however they are camped within thirty or forty miles of a mexican village it is no unusual thing for a party of half a dozen to ride over to it perhaps one has preceded them to make the arrangements these are simple the mexicans are very musical and there is not a village where men capable of playing upon the mandoline and perhaps other instruments cannot be found an arrangement is made with these and with the landlord of the little inn the preparations are not expensivespirits for the men and a supply of cakes and syrups for the women the news spreads like lightning and in the evening mexican villagers male and female in their best attire from miles round arrive some in carts and some on horseback the music strikes up and the dance is kept up until morning occasionally these entertainments end with a fray arising generally from the jealousy of some young mexican at the complacency with which his sweetheart receives the attentions of a cowboy admirer but these are quite the exceptions the mexicans know that their hosts will be off in the morning and that they shall probably never see them again and they therefore put up philosophically with the temporary inconstancy of the damsels of their village to the mexican girls indeed these cowboys are veritable heroes they have heard endless tales of their courage they know that the indians who hold their countrymen in absolute contempt fear to meet these terrible herdsmen the careless way in which they spend their money their readiness to bestow their gorgeous silk handkerchiefs their really handsome and valuable sashes or the gold cord of their hats upon their favourite partner for the evening fills them with admiration they know too that when as occasionally happens a cowboy does marry a mexican girl and settles down upon some little ranche among them the lot of his wife is greatly easier than that of those who marry mexicans and that she will be treated with an amount of consideration and courtesy undreamt of by the mexican peasant who although an humble adorer before marriage is a despotic master afterwards it is not surprising then that upon occasions like these the cowboy hosts have a monopoly of the prettiest girls at the ball round the camp fires in the evening hugh heard many tales of such evenings spent in the villages of new mexico i had a very narrow escape once a cowboy known as straight charley said there were six of us went up together to a mexican village and we gave a firstrate hop there was a big crowd there find things went on well until there was a muss between one of our fellows and a mexican jake was rather a hard man and we hadnt much fancied his being of our party for he was fonder of drink than of dancing and was quarrelsome when the drink was in him i dont know how the muss began for i was dancing with as pretty a little mexican girl as i ever came across however i havent any doubt as jake was in the wrong the first i knowed about it was that the music stopped and then i heard loud voices i saw a knife flash and dropped my partner and was going to run in to stop it but i hadnt more than thought about it when there was the crack of a pistol then knives were out all round and there was a pretty lively fight it seemed as i heard afterwards that when jake shot the mexicanand i dont say he had no right to do so when the mexican had drawn his knife first for if he had not shot he would have been killed himselftwo or three other mexicans went for him and as a matter of course two of our fellows went for the mexicans if they hadnt been all mixed up together the six of us could have cleared the hull lot out but mixed up like that and with girls about our fellows hadnt much show i was just breaking through to take a hand in the game when a fellow who had been looking pretty sour at me for some time jumped on my back like a wild cat so down i went and in half a minute my legs and arms were tied tight with their sashes i didnt try to struggle after i had fallen for i knew well enough that our fellows had got the worst of it when matters cleared up a bit i found that four mexicans had been killed and five or six others pretty badly hurt jake and another of our boys were dead two others had broke out run to their horses and ridden away another of the boys had been taken prisoner but he had got two or three knifecuts before he was knocked down there was a big hubbub for some time as you may guess and then they told us we should be taken to the town in the morning well they took off the sashes and marched us away to a house at the end of the village it was a plank house and built in the same fashion as their adobe huts with one room behind the other of course they had taken our sixshooters and knives away from us and they shoved us into the inner room and then a dozen of them sat down to play cards and keep watch in the other the place had been built as a sort of lockup and there were heavy bars to the window just as you see in a good many mexican houses they had left our legs free but had put some ropes round our arms but we knew that we could shift them easy enough the mexicans had shut the door between the two rooms but we could hear their talk through it and we heard that though the thing had been brought on by jake there would have been a muss anyhow sooner or later two white men had come into the village a fortnight before they were dressed like cowboys but i reckon they were horsestealers or outlaws anyhow they had kicked up a row and shot three men and rode away and the mexicans had seemed to make up their minds that they would take revenge on the next party that came in whoever they were well things looked pretty bad for us if we had once got inside one of their prisons the mexican judges would have made short work of us the greasers would of course have sworn that we had begun the row and shot down four or five of their people without the least cause and it would have been a case of hanging as sure as a gun so dave and i agreed that we had got to git somehow it wur no use talking of fighting for there was a dozen fellows in the next room and they had all got their guns along with them we hadnt got our knives and there was no chance of cutting our way out we were talking it over when someone said are you there charley at the window it was one of the boys who had got away you bet i was there pretty sharp here i am ginger i said how goes it pretty bad he said jeffries is cut pretty near to pieces and i am wounded in halfadozen places and can scarce crawl jeffries is with the horses a mile away he is too bad to stand i made a shift to crawl back to see what had become of you i have been creeping round and heard the two of you were shut up here and that you was going to be taken off tomorrow and would be hung sure so i came round to see what could be done here is my sixshooter if it will be any good to you no that wont be any good i said there are twelve of them and they have all got guns but give me your knife these planks are pretty thick but we can cut our way through i havent got it says ginger it was knocked out of my belt in the fight and worse luck jeffries has lost his too a fellow got hold of his wrist so he couldnt use his pistol and he drew his knife and he was fighting with it when he got a slice across his fingers which pretty nigh cut them off and he dropped his knife and as luck would have it just wrenched himself free and bolted well we must do what we can i said but it is hard luck on us look here ginger you bring the two horses up to that clump of trees over there dave is pretty badly cut about and cannot run far but he can make a shift to get over there if we dont come by an hour before daylight it aint no use your waiting no longer you go and pick up jeffries and make tracks but i reckon that somehow we shall manage to come all right says he and went now dave i said you turn over and let me get my teeth at your knots it is hard if i dont manage to undo them sure enough in five minutes i had loosed a knot and then the rest was easy dave untied me and we were free so far what next says dave we will have a look round says i luckily there was a moon and there was plenty of light to see what was in the room there was some bits of furniture and bedding just as they had been left by the people they had turned out to make room for us but nothing that i could find as would help us to cut our way out now dave says i you get to that corner and i will get to this and just shove against the planks and see if we cant push the hull side of this shanty out well it wur too strong for us it was made of rough boards pretty strongly nailed i thought it gave a little but nothing as would be any good if we could throw ourselves against it both together it might go i said but it mightnt and if it didnt we should have them inside in a moment and there would be an end to it what do you say to our burning ourselves out dave how are we to do that charley he said well i have got my box of matches in my boot and i suppose you have yours too let us pile up some of these wooden things against the two corners there is plenty of straw in this bed before we begin we will hang one of these blankets over the doorway so as to keep the smoke from going through the cracks i reckon they are all smoking in there and they wont smell it very quick so we made a pile moving as quiet as we could standing still when they were not talking much in the next room and moving whenever they made a row which was pretty often these things are as dry as chips i said and what smoke there is will mostly go out through the window but i expect there will be more than we shall like here is a big pitcher of water we will soak these two blankets and then lie down close to the floor you cover your head over with one and i will do it with the other now then we lit a couple of matches and touched off the straw and in half a minute there was a blaze up to the roof then we lay down by the other wall one on each side of the door and waited in about two minutes there was a shout in the next room and a rush then the door was flung open and the blanket torn down and such a yelling and cussing as you never heard the smoke was pretty bad where we was lying and i reckon that up higher it was as thick as a wall the cursed americans have lighted the house and smothered themselves one of them shouted then they rushed out coughing and choking and we heard them shouting for water and there wur as much row as if the village had been attacked by injuns illustration a couple of kicks sent out the planks and then we bolted we waited another three or four minutes and then dave shouted i cant stand this no longer i had hoped they would have left the outer door open and that we could have got out that way but we had heard it shut i expect someone more cute than the rest suspected we wur inside biding our time take a long breath dave says i and dont breathe again until you are out now jump up and join me we joined hands and made a run and threw ourselves against one corner of the end of the hut several of the planks fell and a couple of kicks sent the rest out then off we bolted there wur a yell outside for by this time half the village were there luckily the men with guns was mostly round by the door and when the yells fetched them there was too many women and children about for them to shoot we went straight on as you may guess and we were halfway to the woods before the shooting began and it wur pretty wild at that dave gave out afore he got to the trees and i had to carry him this way ginger shouted i lifted dave on to a horse and jumped up behind him and we wur off just as the mexicans came running up after that it wur easy enough we rode to where jeffries had been left got him on to gingers horse and made tracks for the camp jeffries died next day but dave got over it that wur a pretty near touch i reckon it was indeed hugh said that was a very lucky idea of yours of burning out the corners of the house some of them mexicans is cusses another cowboy put in i had a smart affair with them in one of their villages last year i had rid in with baltimore rube we had been searching some of the gullies for cows and had run short of sugar and tea waal i was on a young broncho i had only roped two days before and the critter wur as wild as could be when we rode in a lot of them brutes of dogs that swarms almost as thick as their fleas in all these mexican villages came barking round while one big brute in particular made as if he would pin my broncho by the nose and the pony plunged and kicked till i thought he would have me off there was a lot of their men standing at their doors smoking for it wur late in the afternoon and they wur all back from what they called work i shouted to them to call their dogs off but they just laughed and jeered so i did the only thing as there was to do just pulled out my sixshooter and shot the dog waal if it had been a man there could not have been a worse sort of row the mexicans ran into their houses just as quick as a lot of prairiedogs when they scent danger and in a moment were back with their guns and began to blaze away waal naturally our dander riz a bullet chipped the bark off my cheek and by the way my broncho jumped i knew one had hit him so baltimore and i blazed away in return and neither of us didnt shoot to miss you bet we just emptied our sixshooters and then rode for it baltimore got a shot in his shoulder i had one in the leg and there was two in the saddle we talked it over and agreed it wur best to say nothing about it them mexicans will swear black is white and when there is a whole village swearing one way and only two men swearing the other way them two has got but a poor show of being believed so we concluded to leave those parts altogether and we rode a hundred and fifty miles in the next two days and then camped for a week till our wounds healed up a bit a fortnight after that we went into the station and there i happened to light upon one of them rags the mexicans calls papers and there sure enough was the account of that business two cowboys unknown rode last week into the quiet village of puserey and without the slightest provocation commenced a murderous attack upon its inhabitants and after killing four and wounding eight men they galloped off before the inhabitants had time to betake themselves to their arms to defend themselves a reward of five hundred dollars is offered for their apprehension now that wur a pretty tall piece of lying but baltimore and i agreed it wur best to keep dark about it altogether for if it wur talked about it might get to the ears of some of the halfcaste mexicans about the station and some day or other when we went into a village we might find ourselves roped in that is the way broncho harry said indignantly us cowboys get a bad name now i dare say that air article wur copied in half the newspapers in the states and folks as know nothing about it would say them cowboys is a cuss they ought to be wiped off the arth right away it is always so whenever there is a row between any of us and the mexicans they give thar account of it and we goes away and thinks no more about it one way or the other and there is no one to show it up as a lie from beginning to end and i know theres people think we are as bad as the injuns if not worse and that we ride about shooting down people just for amusement then all these outlaws and horsethieves and bad men near the settlements dress as much as they can like us and every murder as they commits every horse that gits stolen every man that gits held up and robbed it is just put down to the cowboys while if the truth wur known for every one of these fellows caught or wiped out by the sheriff and their posse there is twenty gets wiped out by us there was a cordial that is so broncho all round the fire for the injustice connected with their reputation was a very sore point among the cowboys well some day broncho hugh said when i get away from here for as you know i havent come here to stay i will take pen in hand and try to give a true account of you and your doings so that people may see that there are two sides to the question bully for you hugh long tom said just you put it in hot and strong i tell you it aint nice if one does go down to the settlements in the winter when work is slack to see people look at you as if you wur a wild beast who is only waiting his chance to hold up the hull town why i have seen women pull their children indoors as i came along as if i wur a mountain lion and was meaning to draw my sixshooter on them just for amusement well hugh said i must say i heard stories at mkinney of cowboys coming down to a town and riding about shooting off the hats of the inhabitants making targets of the bottles in the saloons and generally turning the place topsyturvy of course i didnt believe it all there was silence round the fire and then straight charley said well lightning i wont say as you have been altogether deceived as to that and i wont deny as i have taken part in sprees myself but you see it dont hurt no one it is just fun if we do shoot the heads off the bottles we pays for them and it makes one laugh till one can scarcely sit in a saddle to see an old cuss jump when you put a bullet through his stovepipe hat it is his fault for wearing such a thing which is an unnatural invention altogether and should be discouraged we do carry on broncho harry agreed thar aint no denying it when a man has been out in these plains for six months working worse than a nigger and that without a drop of liquor it is natural as he should go in for a high old time when he gits down to a town with money in his pockets but thar aint no real harm in it we know how we can shoot and that if we fire at a hat there aint no chance of our hitting the head inside it just makes things lively for them for a bit and there is never no trouble unless anyone is fool enough to take the matter up and make a muss about it i am not saying you do any real harm broncho only you see the people in the towns dont know how well you shoot if you knock a pipe out of my mouth as you have done once or twice i only laugh because i know there was no chance in the world of your hitting me but you see they dont all know that and so when a man finds there are two holes in his hat an inch above his head he thinks he has had a marvellous escape of being murdered i dont deny as there is something in that broncho harry said reflectively but you see it is in their ignorance that the mistake comes in not in our shooting anyhow you see we have got to do something to amuse ourselves and we might do worse than just skeer a few storemen who take it out of us by charging us about double the price they charge anyone else hugh was not convinced by the argument but he felt that it was of no use to pursue the subject further how do the cows know their calves he asked one day as at the end of a march some of the cows were loudly lowing for their offspring to come to them by smell broncho harry replied promptly you dont see much of their ways here for the calves are pretty well grown up but when you are driving a herd as i have done many a time made up altogether of cows and young calves you see a lot of it ten or twelve miles a day is as much as you can do with a herd of that sort what steers there are always go ahead grazing as they go the cows will come straggling along next and then the calves strung out all over the place and the rearguard have pretty hard work to hurry them up you see calves have got no sense and run anywhereunder your horses legs or anywhere else while the cows dont pay much attention to them till they get to the end of the march then they begin to bawl for their calves to come to them and the calves begin to bawl for their mothers and i tell you that for a bit there is such a row going on that you would think the end of the world had come two thousand cows and as many calves can kick up a row you bet that will wellnigh scare you but dont the calves know their mothers voices not a bit of it it is just smell and nothing else that brings them together you would think the cows would know something about the colour of their young uns but they dont i have seen a cow that i knew had a white calf run up to a black calf and smell it then to a brown one and then to a spotted one while her own white calf stood bawling fit to kill herself a dozen yards away it is wonderful how they do find each other at all and the job often takes them two or three hours some of the cows concludes at last that their calves have been left behind and then off they set and would go all the way back to the place they had started from in the morning if you didnt stop them sometimes they dont find them at all that night but what happens to the calves then the calves shift for themselves they run up to other cows which have got their own calves sucking each cow will generally let them have a suck or two and then drive them off and in that way they get enough to last them on till they find their mothers in the morning there is a good deal of trouble in keeping nightwatch over a herd like that it isnt that there is any risk of a stampede a cow herd will never stampede if there are a lot of young calves in it but they dont settle themselves comfortable to sleep the calves want to wander about and the cows who havent found their young ones keep trying to slip off to take the back track and you have got to be always on the watch for them take it altogether i would rather drive a beef herd than a cow herd after a weeks travel they reached the spot that had been fixed upon for the herd to graze the cowboys work was now much lighter parties of twos and threes could often be spared for a days excursion up to some mexican village among the hills or they would go off for three or four days hunt among the valleys to pick up any cattle that had evaded search during the roundup one day when there were but four of them in camp two of the party who had been absent a couple of days rode in at full speed and reported to the head of the outfit that they had seen the light of a fire up north then there is no time to be lost colley said will you two men stop here and look after things i will ride off with the other four and fight the fire when the others come back do you start out after us the last two who come in must stop here give us what food you have got darkey we may be away four or five days directly we have gone set to and cook something for the others hugh and bill royce had returned the day before from an expedition among the foothills broncho harry and another cowboy were also in camp in five minutes the horses were saddled and they dashed off at full speed it is lucky that the wind is not blowing strong colley said or we should have the fire down here before we got news of it and there is no place handy where we could drive the herd i expects those blessed injuns lit the fire hugh was very pleased that he was in camp when the news came he had heard many stories from the cowboys of these terrible fires and knew that at times they had wrought havoc among the herds whose only hope of escape lay in reaching a stream wide enough to check the progress of the flames after riding twenty miles they could distinguish a faint odour of smoke in the air and as they gained a crest soon after sunset could see a long line of light in the distance it is a big un broncho harry said and no mistake they lost no time in getting to work for the wind was rising and there was but little time to spare they had on their way picked out a steer from a bunch they came upon and had driven it before them and had also stopped and cut faggots of wood from a clump of bushes in a hollow a shot from broncho harrys revolver brought the bullock dead to the ground and while royce lit a fire the others with their long knives proceeded to split the bullock into two portions dividing it from its head down to its tail now broncho will you go east with lightning while royce and jake go west keep on until you meet some fellows from the other outfits they are sure to be at work all along the line if you dont meet any by the time you get to the end of the flames then work back and fight the fire as you come i expect the other four man will be up in an hour or two broncho harry and royce at once lit two of the long faggots and fastened the others to their saddles they then tied the ends of their ropes to the blazing faggots and started hugh having been already instructed in his part fastened his rope to a leg of the half bullock and mounted his horsehe had not brought prince this time as he feared that he might get burned he waited until broncho harry was a quarter of a mile ahead already a line of fire was rising in his track the dried grass catching like tinder as the blazing faggot passed over it it had already run along a width of twenty feet or so burning fiercely on the leeward side and making its way in a thin red line to windward it was the leeward side that hugh had to attend to and galloping his horse along the ground over which the flame had just passed he dragged the half carcass of the bullock behind him so that in its course it passed over the line of flame which its weight and the raw undersurface instantly crushed out for ten miles he rode on and then found that harry had stopped we are beyond the edge of the fire the latter said it is the other side where there is most danger unless smiths outfit have got news in time waal we have done our part of the job so far looking back hugh saw a sea of fire approaching across the plains the wind was blowing stronger now and the air was full of smoke and ashes far along the track they had come a thin line of fire was advancing against the wind to meet the great wave that was sweeping down towards it we passed some bushes half a mile back harry said we will ride back to them and then let the horses go we shant want them any more and they are pretty well mad with fright now as soon as they reached the bushes they leapt off and letting the horses go cut as many boughs as they could carry then retiring from the strip of burnt ground already forty or fifty yards wide they awaited the flames their approach was heralded by burning fragments and they were both soon at work beating out the flames as fast as they were kindled to leeward of the burnt strip singlehanded they would not have succeeded but other cowboys speedily arrived and along the whole line parties were at work fighting the fire at times it got such hold that it was only checked by lighting fresh fires to leeward and crushing them out as had been done at first and it was thirty hours before the fire was extinguished along that part of the line then the news came that further west it had burst through and the cowboys mounting fresh horses that had been brought up rode off and joined in the fight there and it was not until after three days unremitting effort that the danger was finally subdued during all this time the men had not a moments rest their food and water had been sent up from the waggons and a hasty meal was snatched occasionally when all was done they were blackened with smoke and ashes their hair and clothes were singed and they were utterly exhausted with their efforts however they had saved the herds and were well content with their work but as soon as it was over each man threw himself down where he stood and slept for many hours watch being kept by some of the last arrivals for it was by no means improbable that the indians would swoop down to take advantage of the confusion and drive off cattle as soon as the cowboys were roused next morning they rode off to their respective outfits and hughs party on their arrival enjoyed the luxury of a bathe in the stream near which the waggon of no outfit was placed then after their change of clothes they gathered for a comfortable meal waal lightning that has been a fresh experience for you broncho harry said i am glad i have seen it hugh replied but i dont want to repeat it this was nothing hugh four years ago there was a fire here that swept right across the plains there was a strong wind and no stopping it and there were over cattle burned i suppose some day or other they will be passing laws for putting up fences if they do i tell you it will be something like ruin to a good many ranches for it will prevent cattle from running before the flames as it is now their instinct takes them either to a stream or to some high bluff but if there was fences they would never get away in the north they lose whole herds in the same way from snowstorms a herd will drift before snow and wind for hundreds of miles but if there is anything that stops them they just get snowed up and die ranchmen have troubles enough but if they was obliged to fence it would go far to break up the business look out lads here comes someone galloping into camp i expect he has got news of the redskins i reckoned they would be out on the track of the fire oh its tom newport he said as the man approached waal what he says you may take for gospel he is not one of them fellows who gets hold of the tailend of a story and then scares the whole country waal tom what is it just mount up broncho and get all your crowd together there aint no time for talking now i will tell you all about it when we get on the track in an incredibly short time the men had all saddled and were ready for a start filling their waterskins and getting from the cook what bread and cold meat remained over from breakfast now which way tom northeast i will tell you about it the injuns have come down and attacked gainsford they have killed five or six men and most of the women and children they have carried off five or six girls and old man rutherfords rose is among them an exclamation of fury broke from several of the cowboys where is gainsford and who is rutherfords rose hugh asked gainsford is a small place just among the foothills south of the injun country there are about twenty houses rutherford he wur the first to settle there we told him over and over agin that it wur too close to the injuns and that there would sure be trouble sooner or later but steve that is rutherford is one of those pesky obstinate cusses who just go their own way and wont listen to reason from no one he got a little herd of cattle up in the valley there and a patch of cultivated land and he reckoned he wouldnt be solitary long he was right enough there for as i told you the place grew and there are pretty nigh twenty houses there now that is there wur twenty houses i dont suppose one is standing now rutherford he war a cowboy once and married and settled down there and rose is his daughter and as good a lass as there is west of missouri rutherfords house is free quarters for those of us who likes to drop in in course we makes it up to him by taking in a deer or a bears ham or maybe a few bottles of whisky if we have been down to the settlement and laid hands on them and if we come across any mavericks when we are alone we just brand them rr and i reckon rosie has got cattle out here and they will come in mighty handy for her when she chooses a husband is that often done hugh asked you bet there are a score and more girls whose fathers shanties lie up in the foothills and who are friends of ours have got a nice little clump of cattle out on these plains of course any man living near the plains can turn his cattle out and there are dozens of private marks waal you see if a girl only gets twenty branded for her it increases every year because the calves running with the cows get the same brand put on them and i have known many a girl when she was married have a little herd of three or four hundred so i tell you it hits us all that rose rutherford has been carried away and we are bound to get her back if it air to be done when was it tom that it happened yesterday evening bout ten oclock i wur riding that way and intended to sleep at steves when i saw a light burst up and then two or three others i galloped pretty hard you may guess but before i got thar it wur over and the injuns had gone but i larned from a boy who had been hiding among the bushes but who came out when he saw me how it wur he said he had seen rose and five or six other girls carried off whether old steve wur rubbed out i dont know i didnt stop to ask no questions i knew whereabout your outfit was and rode straight for it then the skunks have got sixteen or seventeen hours start broncho said there is no chance of our catching them till they are right back into their own country i reckon we shall have a pretty sharp fight of it before we get them gals back illustration chapter xii an indian raid the cowboys were all mounted on horses that had not been worked for some days hugh was on prince and they got over the ground at great speed arriving before sunset at the ruined village there were three or four men seven or eight women and as many children gathered when they rode in the men had been absent when the attack took place the women had escaped by seizing their children and rushing out at the backs of the houses and hiding among the rocks and bushes as soon as the yells of the indians and the explosion of the firearms burst upon their ears we heard you was coming one of the men said but i fear it is too late they have got too far a start altogether we didnt waste a minute broncho harry said we wur in the saddle three minutes after tom brought us the news and we have rode seventy miles since tom has done a hundred and forty since last night where is steve rutherford has he been wiped out no he wur away after a bunch of horses that had strayed he wur camping out twenty mile away when he saw the light and guessed what it wur he drove the horses in before him feeling sure as he would be too late to do any good but reckoning that they might be useful good man broncho said but where is he he went on alone after them the man said some of us would have gone with him but he reckoned he had best go alone thar wurnt enough of us to fight he allowed that you boys would be here presently for the young un here told us as tom had ridden off with the news rube garston and jim gattling rid off an hour later and i reckon they will bring a few more up before morning may be sooner how many horses are there fifteen of the old mans i reckon they are in that corral behind his house and i guess we have got as many more between us then there are enough to mount us ten and as many more broncho harry said ours aint good for no more travel tonight waal we will just eat a bit and then we shall be ready to go on how many air there of you six here waal that makes sixteen i see three of you have got rifles and four of us have brought rifles along with us the only question is which way have the red devils ridden it air no use our following them if we havent a clue of some sort i reckon steve will be here before long that is what he has gone for he would know he couldnt do any good himself and he would be pretty well sure as we couldnt gather here in any such force as could enter the injun country afore this evening he took a lantern with him one of the boys said yes that is it i guess he followed on foot till daylight then he mounted and went on their trail until he could give a pretty good guess as to where they was heading then i allow he will come back to tell us that is how i read it i expect you are right broncho he didnt say much when he started but when we talked of going with him he said just you stop where you are there aint anything you can do we cant fight them till we get help you just wait right here boys it wur rather rough on us when our gals are being carried off and our wives have been killed and the hull place ruined but we knew as steve knew a sight more about injuns than we did and had been many a time into the heart of the injun country afore they broke out so we waited but i tell you harry it wur hard work to sit quiet and know that them murdering villains was getting further away every hour we will have them yet harry said confidently if the old man dont ride up in another halfhour we will start we will follow the trail as far as we can with lanterns if we get to any place where the trail branches then there will be nothing to do but to wait for steve have yer eaten because if not yer had best fill up it air no use starting on such a job as this fasting we shall have need of all our strength afore we have done you can bet your boots none of the men had in fact eaten anything since the preceding night but they saw the justice of the advice there is some sheep up behind my place one of them said like enough they was up on the hills when the injuns came but i saw some of them go in there this morning there aint no time for cooking now so we will share your grub and i will shoot three or four of the sheep and cut them up they will last us for two or three days that is a good idee and if there is any flour as hasnt been carried off you had best make up a few lots of five or six pounds each and tie them up in cloths they will come in mighty handy hello here are some more of the boys a minute later eight more cowboys rode up hello broncho i thought we should find your crowd here we have ridden all we knew to be here in time to go on with youthat is if you are going on we are going on as far as we can ike we are just changing horses i think there are about enough left to give you one each have you any news which way the redskins have gone not yet old man rutherford followed em up i expect he will be here soon if not we shall meet him they have got twenty hours startthat is the worst of it no there aint no chance of overtaking them that is sartin what we have got to do is to wipe some of them out and to give them a lesson and get the girls back again if we can and we have got to do it quick else we shall have the hull injun country up agin us i did not think that they would have done it another man said the old man wur always good friends with the injuns and made them welcome when they came along it aint no good being kind to injuns another put in there aint no gratitude in them injuns air pison broncho said and a general murmur of agreement expressed that in the opinion of the cowboys this summed up the characteristics of the redskins in a few minutes the newcomers were provided with fresh horses a spare horse was taken on for rutherford and then headed by the survivors of the raid the party started threeandtwenty strong they travelled fast not that there was any occasion for speed but because every man was burning with the desire to get at the enemy after riding about twenty miles they checked their horses for a fire was seen a short distance ahead thats all right one of the settlers said that will be rutherford sure enough it is just there where the valley forks he is waiting there for us he would know we shouldnt want a guide as far as this as they came up a tall figure rose from beside the fire well steve have you tracked them jim gattling the youngest of the party from the village asked eagerly they have gone over the divide into the springer valley have followed that some way and then through the little canyon and up towards the headwaters of the pequinah creek i only went through the canyon to see which way they turned and then made back here i guessed some of you would be coming along about this time was they riding fast no they halted here for some hours i reckon they had ridden a long way afore they attacked our place i saw their fires some time afore i got to them or i might have walked into them for i didnt think they would have halted so soon i tied the hoss up and scouted round em and when they started this morning before daylight took up the trail after them they werent travelling very fast you see they had got about a hundred head of cattle with them and i reckon they have three or four days journey before them as far as i could make out from what i seed of them they dont belong to this part at all sartin they was going easy and didnt reckon on being followed it aint often they get chased when they are once in the hills waal boys i am glad to see you and i thank ye all it is what i expected from yer for i felt sure that when you got the news you would muster up we have brought a fresh horse for you steve jim gattling said we druv in a herd this afternoon and they all changed back there so we are ready to ride at once thats good jim i was wondering over that and thinking that if yours had come in from the plains they wouldnt be fit for any more travel tonight for i knew they was a long way out where wur you broncho we wur on little creek ah thats about sixty miles away from our place waal boys we may as well go on over the divide and down into the valley there we had best camp you will have done a hundred miles by then and will want sleep besides we mustnt knock the hosses up they have got their work before them and maybe we shall have to ride on our way back how many of the skunks are there over forty we shant have much trouble with that lot broncho harry said not if we catch them before they git to their village broncho but i doubt whether we shall do that waal we will fight them steve if there was four hundred of them harry said we have come to get your rosie and the others back and we are going to do it you bet rutherford held out his hand and gripped that of the cowboy then mounting the horse that had been brought for him he took his place at the head of the party and led the way it was a toilsome journey over the shoulder that divided the two valleys the pace was necessarily confined to a walk and it was five hours before they reached the stream upon which they were to camp here the horses were turned loose to graze and the men threw themselves down upon the ground and were soon asleep for it was now past midnight with the dawn of day they were on their feet again a great fire lighted and some of the mutton cut up and cooked and some cakes baked as soon as the meal was eaten they again started hugh had not changed his horse at the village broncho harry told him that it was not likely they would travel for many hours that evening and he knew that prince who had had an easy time of it lately could easily do this and he greatly preferred keeping him for he felt that upon such an expedition as this his speed might be of the greatest utility a rapid ride of ten miles up the valley took them to the mouth of the canyon which came into the main valley at a sharp angle it was wide at the entrance but soon narrowed down into a gorge from ten to twenty feet wide with rocks rising precipitously on both sides it was evident by the smoothlyworn face that in the wet season a tremendous torrent rushed down filling it thirty or forty feet deep but it was perfectly dry now and for the most part they were able to ride at a fair pace here and there however masses of rock had fallen down from above since the last rains and here they had to dismount and allow the horses to clamber over by themselves as best they could at such spots scratches upon the face of the stones showed where the party they were pursuing had passed on the previous day the canyon was upwards of a mile in length and the valley into which it led was some hundreds of feet higher than that which they had left as soon as they emerged from the pass they put their horses into a gallop the track of the party before them being plainly visible as they got deeper among the mountains the scenery became very wild forests clothed the hills great masses of rock towered above the valley and huge blocks of stone encumbered the route they had to pursue sometimes the track left the bottom and wound up the hillside passing at times along the ledges with precipices above and below anxious as they were to press forward much of the journey had to be performed at a footpace for many of the horses having been brought up on the plains all their lives were fidgety and nervous on such unaccustomed ground and required coaxing and care to get them along the passes they travelled until late in the afternoon and then halted the next days work was of the same character they were now high up among the hills and steve told them that they were near the crest of the range we had better stop here rutherford said about three oclock in the afternoon as they arrived at a little stream we mustnt knock the critters up they have done a good days work already we have gained upon them steve broncho harry said the traces have been getting fresher yes we have gained a bit but not very much their horses would go faster than ours because they are accustomed to the mountains but the cattle will have kept them back why i stop here is because there is a sort of wall of rock with a passage up through it a mile or two ahead and though i dont expect they have any idea they are followed they are like enough to have left a sentry on the top of that wall it ud never do for them to attack us here we should have no show at all i want to get my girl back but throwing away our lives aint the way to do it be careful how you pick the wood for the fires boys we mustnt let any smoke go curling up you have got to see that every bit you put on is as dry as a chip how on earth do the indians manage to live among these hills hugh asked after the meal had been cooked and eaten the country is different on the other side jim gattling said we are pretty nearly up to the top of the divide now and on the other side the slopes are much more gradual they have plenty of ranges where they have got cattle and sheep but i dont know nothing about the country here steve has been over but there aint many as has yes rutherford said it is as jim says there is a wide sort of plateau with big valleys down to the canadian we aint very far now from the frontier of new mexico and from the top of the hills here you can see the spanish peaks a hundred and fifty miles away i reckon we may have to go down that side there are a heap of injun villages up here and though we may thrash the lot ahead of us they would gather pretty thick in a short time and like enough cut us off going back for they know the tracks better than we do and their horses would go at a gallop along places where we should have to drag ours going down the other way we can ride as fast as they can and when we once get down in the valley of the canadian we shall get help at the ranches there that will certainly be the best way steve broncho harry said we are all ready to fight any number of them on the plains but it wouldnt be good to be hemmed up among these hills with no chance of help we could keep them off i reckon till we had eaten our boots but they would make an end of us at last sure have you often been along this line before steve once i came across here with a party of redskins just after the last peace wur made with them when it was sure that they wouldnt break out again until they had got their presents i had got a stock of beads and lookingglasses and cottons and such like and went up with a couple of mules and traded among them for skins and worked robes and moccasins and indian trumpery i sent them back east and did a pretty good trade with them but i know the other side well i was ranching two years down on the canadian and we had two or three fights with the redskins who was pretty troublesome about that time there werent many ranches down there then and we had to look pretty spry to keep the har on our heads and how do you propose to work it now steve well i reckon that if they have got a sentry on them rocks i spoke of he wont stay there after dark and that the danger will be at the other end of the pass like enough there will be one or two of them there i reckon the best plan will be for me and jim gattling and a kipple of others to go on ahead quiet if we find any of the skunks there in course we shall wipe them out when we have done that the rest can come up the pass it aint no place for anyone as doesnt know every foot of the way to come up in the dark and you must make torches ready to light up when one of us goes back with the news that the pass is clear as soon as we have done with the redskins jim and i will go off scouting you see we dont know yet what band this is or how far their village is away we will follow on the trail and when the rest get up through the pass they must just wait till we bring them word i reckon from their coming by this road as their place is about fifteen mile from the top of the pass there is a big village there and i expect they belong to it i reckon they are just getting there now and they will be feasting pretty considerable tonight it air a pity we aint handy however it cannot be helped we should risk it all if we was to try to push on afore it got dark your plan seems to pan out all right steve who will you take with you waal you and long tom may as well come broncho though i reckon it dont make much difference for you all means fighting as soon as it became dusk the party again moved forward thats the rock rutherford said pointing to a long dark line that rose up before them they cant see us here and i reckon if there wur a scout there he has moved off before this now do you other fellows take our critters and just move on slowly you see that point sticking up above the line waal that is on one side of the pass so you just make for that and stop when you get there till one of us comes back the torches had been prepared during the halt two or three young pitchpines having been cut down and split up for the purpose the four scouts moved off at a quick walk and the rest of the party picked their way along slowly and cautiously towards the point steve had indicated they had some little trouble in finding the entrance to the pass but when they discovered it they threw the bridles on their horses necks and dismounted the time went slowly but it was not more than two hours before they heard a slight noise up the pass and a minute or two later a footfall is that you broncho hugh asked no it air me but it is all the same thing i reckon jehoshaphat but i have knocked myself pretty nigh to pieces among them blessed rocks it air just as dark as a cave there aint no seeing your hand well is it all right tom no it aint gone off right when we got to the top of the pass there wur two redskins sitting at a fire we come along as quiet as we could but just as we got in sight of them i suppose they heard something for they both jumped on to their feet and wur out of sight like a streak of lightning we waited without moving for half an hour and then they came back again we could have shot but steve reckoned it was too great a risk so he and jim undertook to crawl forward while broncho and me wur to keep ready to shoot if the redskins made a bolt it wur a long time or at least seemed so the redskins was restless and we could see they was on the listen waal at last up they both jumped but it wur too late steve and jim fired and down they both went and we came on the wust of the business wur that one of their hosses broke loose and bolted steve fired after him he may have hit him or he may not anyhow he went off so now you have got to hurry up all you know the torches were at once lit and leading their horses the party made their way up the gorge it was steep and narrow and encumbered with boulders but in half an hour they reached the other end broncho harry was awaiting them we have got to move away to the right for about half a mile and stop there there is a clump of trees and that is where we are to wait it air a tarnal bad business that air hoss getting away he is pretty sure to bring the injuns down on us steve aint going very far he sez there is another village about three miles from the one he thinks most likely and when he gets about four miles away from here he will be able to see which way the tracks go and then he will come straight back to the trees do you think you hit the horse harry hugh asked as they made their way to the clump of trees you dont suppose i could miss a horse if i tried hugh i hit him sure enough worse luck if i had missed him it wouldnt have mattered so much if he came galloping in by himself they might have thought he had got scared at somethingby a bar perhapsand had just made tracks for the camp like enough they would have sent off four men to see if it wur all right but when the blessed thing turns up with a bullet in his hide they will know there has been a fight what do you think they will do then harry are they likely to ride out in force to the gap they may and they may not i should say they wont i should guess theyll just throw out scouts all round their village and wait till morning they wont know how strong our party is and wouldnt take the risk of being ambushed in the dark perhaps when the horse goes in they wont notice it especially as they will be feasting and dancing i dont reckon that worth a cent hugh there are safe to be one or two of their boys out looking after the horses besides those varmints ears are always open they would hear a horse coming at a gallop across the plain half a mile away aye and more than that directly the boy sees the horse is saddled he will run in and tell them then they will take it in by the fire and look at it when they see the mark i have made on it there will be a nice rumpus you bet they will know what it means just as if it wur all writ down for them two hours passed and then the sound of an approaching horse was heard well steve what news the horse has gone on straight for the villagethe one we thoughtand all the other tracks go in that direction there aint no chance of taking them by surprise now what do you think they will do steve they will just watch all night that is sartin and in the morning two or three will be sent out to scout there aint many trees about here and they will reckon that they can see us as soon as we see them and those they send out are safe to be on the best horses they have got in course we could lie down there by the gap and shoot them when they come up but i dont see as that would do us any good when they didnt get back it would only put the others more on their guard than ever if we dont shoot them they will find our tracks here and take back news how many we are i tell you lads look at it as i will i dont see no way out of it and what makes it wuss is when they take back news that the scouts they left here have both been shot it will go mighty hard with the captives in the village i cant see no way out of the kink anyhow i am ready to give my life cheerful for rosie but i aint going to ask you to give your lives when i dont see as there is any chance of getting her do you see any way out of the job broncho i dont steve as you say there was about forty or fifty of these varmint in the expedition and we may reckon there will be as many more able to draw a trigger in the village that makes eighty four to one is pretty long odds if they was out in the plain we might be a match for them but to attack an injun camp thats waiting and ready aint the same thing as fighting in the plains half of us would go down before we got in and there would not be no more chance of the rest of us getting the captives away than there would if they was in the moon if it hadnt been for this affair of the hoss we might have carried out your plans and you might have made your way into the village and there wur just the chance that yer might have got them out and brought them along to some likely place where we was handy but there aint no need to talk about that now they will be guarded that strict that a bird couldnt get to them with a message that aint to be thought of can any of you boys think of anything no one spoke then hugh said i am only a young hand yet and i dont know that my ideas are worth anything but i will tell you what they are and then you can improve upon them perhaps it seems to me that in the first place we ought to leave say four men at the gap if four indian scouts come out they ought to shoot or rope three of them and let the fourth escape if there were only two of them i would let one get away what should they do that for hugh broncho harry asked in surprise i will tell you directly broncho all the rest of us except the four who are left on watch should start at once and make a big circuit and come round to the other side of the village and stop a mile or so away in hiding at any rate as near as we can get why i propose letting one go is this suppose three or four scouts go out and none return the indians will be sure that they have fallen in a trap somewhere they wont know how strong we are or whether we think of making an attack on their village and they will stop there expecting us for days perhaps and then send out scouts again now if one gets back with the news that they saw no signs of us until they got close to the gap and then three or four shots were fired and his comrades were killed but he got off without being pursued it seems to me that they would naturally imagine that there was only a small party at the gapperhaps three or four men from the village they attacked who had come out to revenge themselvesand would send out a strong party of their braves at once to attack them of course the four men left at the gap would directly they had done their work and the indian was out of sight mount their horses and make the same circuit as we had done and join us as quickly as they could we should be keeping watch and after seeing the war party ride off we could dash straight down into the village half and perhaps more than half of their fighting men will have gone and the others making sure that we were still at the gap and that there was no fear of attack will be careless and we should be pretty well into the village before a shot was fired shake young fellow steve rutherford said holding out his hand to hugh that air a judgematical plan and if it dont succeed it ought ter there was a general chorus of assent it beats me altogether steve went on how yer should have hit on a plan like that when i who have been fighting injuns off and on for the last twenty years couldnt see my way no more than if i had been a mole you may be young on the plains lightning fur so i have heard them call yer but yer couldnt have reasoned it out better if yer had been at it fifty years i tell you young fellow if i get my rosie back agin it will be thanks to you and if the time comes as yer want a man to stand by yer to the death yer can count steve rutherford in and jim gattling the young settler said rosie and me wur going to get hitched next month and it dont need no talk to tell yer what i feels about it which of us shall stay and which of us shall go broncho harry said you are the only man as knows the country steve so you must go sartin long tom and me will stay here if you like you can give me the general direction of the village and i expect i can make shift to come round and join you besides there will be your trail to follow i dont reckon they will send out those scouts till daylight anyhow we wont start before that and we are safe to be able to follow your trail then who will stop with us will you stay hugh no hugh said decidedly i will go with steve i am not a very sure shot with the rifle you can shoot straight enough broncho harry said well perhaps it isnt that harry but so far i have had no indian fighting and though i am quite ready to go in and do my share in a fight i tell you fairly that i couldnt shoot men down however hostile in cold blood all right hugh you shant stay with us when you know the injuns as well as we do and know that mercy aint a thing as ever enters their minds and that they murders women and children in cold blood and that if they do take a prisoner it is just to torture him until he dies you wont feel that way i will stay with you broncho jim gattling said i have just seen my house burnt and the best part of my stock carried away and a dozen or more of my friends killed or scalped and you bet i would kill a redskin at sight just as i would put my heel on a rattlesnake another of the party also volunteered to stay at the gap no further words were necessary the party mounted that is where the village lies broncho just about under that star it is about fifteen mile as i told you on a straight line we shall keep over there to the right and in a couple of miles we shall get to where the ground falls and will travel along there you cant be wrong if you keep down on the slope there air no chance then of your being seen i dont know just where we shall turn off there are several dips run down from above and we shall follow one of them up when i reckon we have got a mile or two beyond the village so keep a sharp lookout for our trail there you neednt bother much about it before because you cant miss the way but look sharp at the turnings i would drop something to show you where we turn off but if any injun happened to come along he would be safe to notice it when you guess you have ridden far enough keep a sharp lookout for the place when we turn off and then follow the trail careful it is rolling ground that side of the village and i reckon we kin get within half a mile of it there aint much fear of their wandering about and any scouts they have out wont be on that side so long steve rutherford led the way there aint no need to hurry he said we have got plenty of time and i reckon that when we get a bit further we will dismount and lead the horses they have had pretty hard work coming up the hills and i tell you they are likely to want all their speed tomorrow and some of them will have to carry double if we cant manage to get hold of a few of the injun ponies accordingly after riding for half an hour the party dismounted and led their horses for a long distance this was a novel exercise to the cowboys for it is rare for one of them to walk a hundred yards a horse stands ever ready at hand and if it be only to go down to the stream hard by to fetch a bucket of water the cowboy will always throw his leg over his horse but all felt the justice of steves remarks they knew that they had at least a hundredmile ride before they could hope to meet friends and that the pursuit would be hot it was therefore of vital importance that the horses should start as fresh as possible after three hours walking they mounted again and continued their way until steve rutherford said that he thought they had gone far enough now the moon had risen at two oclock and its light had enabled them to travel fast since they had remounted turning up a hollow they followed it for about two miles and then found they were entering a hilly and rugged country here we are steve said the village lies at the foot of these rocks i dont know how far along it may be but i am right sure that we have got beyond it now boys you can sleep till daylight i will keep watch and see that none of the horses stray in a very few minutes all was quiet in the little valley save for the sound of the horses cropping the short grass at the first gleam of daylight rutherford stirred up one of the sleepers i am going to scout he said when the others wake tell them to be sure not to stir out of this dip and to mind that the horses dont show on the skyline the injuns will be keeping their eyes open this morning and if they caught sight of one of them critters it would just spoil the hull plan rutherford was gone two hours long before his return all the men were up and about bill royce had gone a little farther up the valley which narrowed to a ravine and climbing the rocks cautiously had taken a survey of the country no signs of the village he said when he returned and no signs of injuns as far as i can see so i think if we go up to the head of this gulch itll be safe to make a fire and cook the rest of our meat there aint more than enough for one more feed after that i reckon we shall have to take to horseflesh now half of us will go up and cook and the other half keep watch here we may have steve coming back with twenty redskins on his track just as they had fried their meat steve returned we are about three miles from the village he said but keeping along at the foot of the hills we can get to within half a mile of it safe beyond that it is a chance what are you doing cooking well one must eat but the sooner we get on the better we want to watch how things go as soon as the meal was finished the party mounted and keeping close to the foot of the hill rode on till steve said we cannot go beyond that next bluff so turn up this gulch i looked in and there is good feed for the horses there you had better look round when you get in to see as there aint no bar or nothing to scare the horses and two of yer had best stay on guard here at the mouth ef one of them critters wur to get loose and to scoot out below there our lives wouldnt be worth a red cent now stumpy you and owen and me will go up over there from among them bushes just at the foot of the rock we can see the camp and we will take it by turns to keep watch if you others will take my advice you will all get as much sleep as you can till we come for you but mind keep two on guard here can i come with you steve hugh asked i dont feel like sleep at all you can take my place lightning royce said i aint in no hurry to look at the injuns i expect i shall see plenty of them afore we have done illustration illustration chapter xiii rescued steve rutherford the settler owen and hugh made their way along at the foot of the steep rocks keeping among the fallen boulders stopping at times and making a close survey of the plains to be sure that no indians were in sight before moving further that is the point steve said presently from among those rocks we can get a view of the village you must keep your head low lightning and not show it above the rocks they will be keeping a sharp lookout and like enough they would make out a lizard moving at this distance when they reached the point they made their way with extreme care to the highest boulders and then lying down looked through the interstices between them hugh started as he did so for although the indian village was nearly half a mile away the mountain air was so clear that it did not seem a quarter of that distance its position was well chosen the hill rose almost perpendicularly behind it defending it from an attack on that side while in front and on both sides the ground sloped away and was clear of brushwood or inequalities that would afford shelter to assailants trees stood in and around it affording shade during the heat of the day a number of horses were grazing close to the village with half a dozen indian boys round them in readiness to drive them in at the shortest notice smoke was curling up from the top of the wigwams and through the trees many figures of men and women could be seen moving about how long do you think it will be steve before their scouts get back again another hour i should guess i expect they started at daybreak anyhow they had gone before i got here i reckon they wouldnt travel fast going there in the first place they would scout about and look for signs of an enemy and in the second they wouldnt want to blow their horses for they might have to ride for their lives any moment i should give them four hours a good two and a half to get there and something over an hour for one of them to get back again he may be here in half an hour he may not be here for an hour it will be somewhere between one and the other twenty minutes passed and then steve exclaimed here he comes the other two caught sight of the indian at the same moment as first his head and shoulders then the whole rider and horse appeared on the crest of a rise some four miles away he was as yet invisible from the village but in a few minutes they could perceive a stir there and three or four warriors ran out from the village leaped on to their horses and galloped out to meet the returning scout they saw them join him and sweeping round without a check accompany him and in ten minutes they reached the village a minute later a mournful wail sounded in the air they know it now steve said they are just about beginning to feel as we do it is all very well as long as they go out and murder and burn and come back with scalps but they dont like it when the game is played on them when will they start out again do you think steve not yet awhile they are going to talk indians never do anything without that there do you see there aint a man among the trees there are some women and children but nary a warrior you may be sure that they are gathering for a great council first of all the scout will tell his story then the chiefs will talk it will be another hour at least before there is a move made oh i do hope our plan wont fail hugh said i dont think that there is much chance of it owen put in they are bound to do something their scout can only report that so far as he saw there was not more than four men and as they did not chase him he expects they have no horses they never can leave it like that they are bound to go out and see about it otherwise they know they couldnt go in twos or threes without the risk of being ambushed just as the scouts were besides they lost the two men they left behind and maybe one maybe three this morning and they are bound to have vengeance oh they air safe to go an hour later a sudden succession of wild yells were heard thars their warcry steve said the thing is settled and they air going a few minutes later the indian boys were seen driving the horses in towards the village and then a number of warriors ran out there air a good lot of them steve said in a tone of satisfaction they was sure to go the question wur how many of them it will be a strong party anyhow the indians were soon seen to be mounting now we can count them steve said fiveandthirty i couldnt tell within four or five hugh said they keep moving about so but i should say that was about it yes fiveandthirty owen agreed you have the youngest legs lightning you scoot across as hard as you can run and tell them to get ready steve and i will see them fairly off and then we will come in dont let them move out of the hollow till we join you there aint no special hurry for we mustnt attack till the band have got four or five miles away if they heard the guns they would be back agin like a torrent hugh did as he was told as he ran down over the crest into the dip he gave a shout of satisfaction at seeing broncho harry and the three men who had remained with him they had arrived a few minutes before well harry we saw all had gone right as only one of their scouts came back has it drawn them harry asked yes a band of fiveandthirty started five minutes ago bully for us harry said then we have got them all right now i expect there aint above thirty fighting men left in the village and catching them as we shall they wont have a show against us how did you get on harry it wur just as you reckoned lad three of em came out they were very scarey about coming close they yelled to their mates and in course got no answer then they galloped round one at a time getting nearer and nearer but at last they concluded that the place was deserted and rode up we let them get so close that there wur no fear of our missing and then we shot two of them the other rode for it we fired after him but took good care not to hit him and as soon as he had gone we ran to the wood where we had left our ponies and came on here pretty slick there wur no difficulty in following your trail we reckoned that we should have to come pretty fast to be here in time as it wur three or four miles further for us to go than the injun would have and he wouldnt spare his horseflesh still we was sure it would be an hour at least before they was ready to start more likely two jim gattling wur flurried a bit natural he wouldnt like not to be with the others when they went in to rescue rosie so it seems we air just in time with nothing to spare but here comes steve by this time all had been got ready for a start horses had been brought up saddles looked to girths tightened and blankets strapped on a hearty greeting was exchanged between steve and the party just arrived we will give them another ten minutes afore we start steve said now we had better settle broncho as to what we should each do when we get in else there may be confusion and they may tomahawk the prisoners before we find them yes that is best broncho agreed now look here our crowd will do the fighting and you and your fellows jump off as soon as you get in and search the wigwams you will know just where to go the prisoners are safe to be in a wigwam close by that of the principal chief he will keep them close under his eye you may bet your life and mind boys let us have no shooting at squaws or kids we have come out to rescue the women they have carried off and to pay out the men for the work they did but dont let us be as bad as they are there was a general assent from the cowboys but two or three of the men who had come with them grumbled they have killed our wives and children why shouldnt we pay them back in the same coin because we are whites and not redskins broncho harry said look here steve we have come here to help you and we are risking our lives pretty considerable in this business but afore we ride into that village we are going to have your word that there aint going to be a shot fired at squaw or child those are our terms and i dont think they are onreasonable as a chorus of approval went up from the rest of the cowboys and as the others were well aware that what they said they meant they unwillingly assented that is right and square broncho harry said you have all given your promise and if anyone breaks it i begin shooting that is all now its about time to be moving steve the men swung themselves up into their saddles now boys quietly until we get in sight of the village and then as fast as we can go but all were eager for the fight and the pace gradually quickened till they came within sight of the village then they charged down upon it at full gallop they had gone but a short distance when they heard the cry of alarm the yells of the indians shouts and orders screams of women and children and the barking of the village dogs shots were fired but to hughs surprise these ceased before the cowboys reached the village the skunks are bolting broncho harry exclaimed keep round the trees no outfit and straight across the plain after them they may have got some of the girls it was however less than two minutes from the moment the assailants had been seen to that when they burst into the village the indians taken altogether by surprise at the appearance of a foe from a quarter from which no danger had been apprehended and seeing a band of the dreaded cowboys dashing down at a gallop caught up their arms and then in obedience to the orders of the chief left behind in charge of the village dashed out to their horses mounted and rode off their leader had seen at once that there was no hope of resistance the assailants were nearly equal in number to the fighting men left in the village they would be armed with those terrible pistols that were the dread of the indians and they had all the advantage of a surprise there was nothing to do but to ride off to the main body for a moment the thought of killing the prisoners before starting had crossed his mind but there was no time to run to the wigwam in which they had been placed and he saw too that their death would entail that of the indian women and children these had been no less speedy in their movements than the men and at the first cry of danger the women had seized their infants and followed by the boys and girls of the village had fled along the foot of the cliff till they reached a spot where although steep it was accessible here a path winding among boulders and hidden by bushes led up to the top of the cliff this had been constructed by the boys of the village at the time the indians first established themselves there for the purpose of enabling its occupants to make their escape in case of a sudden attack by superior forces steve and his party were astonished when as they dashed into the village they found the place almost deserted a few old men stood at the entrances of their wigwams and four or five aged women were assembled in front of one standing near the centre of the place and as the cowboys and settlers galloped up five white women ran out from the wigwam to meet them with cries of joy all safe rosie steve rutherford shouted as he rode up all safe father and a cheer burst from the rescuers as they leapt from their horses and crowded round the girls these had all friends or relations among the party three of you let off your rifles one after the other steve said the instant he had embraced his daughter i told broncho as he rode off that should be the signal that we had got them all then some of you had better ride as hard as you can after them you may be wanted though i dont expect the indians will stop tell broncho he had best come back again there aint no time to lose the rest of you scatter and put a light to these wigwams there is all the things they stole from us scattered among them and all their skins and things not worth much perhaps but a lot to them look into the huts and see there aint no babies left in them where are all the women and children rosie but rosie was at that moment much too occupied with jim gattling to hear him never mind that now gal steve said striding up to them there will be time enough for fooling when we get out of this whar are the women and children i dont know father we know nothing about it we were in the wigwam and suddenly heard shouts and screams and then almost directly everything became quiet and then these old women opened the door and made signs to us to come out and as we did we saw you charging in among the trees illustration all safe father cried rosie where are the squaws and children steve asked one of the old women in her own language she looked vacantly at him as if she did not understand bah thats no use he said i might have known that scatter about boys see if you cant find some of them they cant have gone out on to the plain that is sartin they cant have got up this cliffnot here perhaps thars a cave somewhere scatter along and sarch go right along some distance each way thar may be some path up somewhere what does it matter about them steve one of the settlers asked we agreed there wurnt to be no killing of squaws or kids i dont want to kill them steve said i am just so pleased at getting my girl and the others back that i dont feel like hurting anything what broncho and me reckoned on was to take some of the chiefs wives and children along with us as hostages if we had them with us we reckoned they would not attack us on our way back i tell you boys it may just make the difference of our scalps to us not another word was needed and all with the exception of a few of the friends of the rescued women scattered on the search it was ten minutes before they found the concealed path the man who discovered it ran back to rutherford i have found the place steve it is away three or four hundred yards to the left there just at the end of the clump of trees there are some bushes against the face of the hill it didnt look as if there could be any way up but i pushed through them and sure enough there was some steps cut in the rock i went up them and round a sharp angle there was a sort of gap in the cliff you couldnt see it from the plain and a path went straight up there that air bad news owen they have got a quarter of an hours start and it aint no sort of use our going after them waal there is nothing to do but to ride for it i wish bronchos party was back they air just coming back a man said i have been to the edge of the wood to look after them they are galloping back and will be here in a few minutes by the time broncho harry and his party rode into the village the wigwams were all in flames the men who had set fire to them had brought out the meat they had found inside there were several quarters of deer and a quantity of beef doubtless the produce of animals belonging to the herd they had driven off they were satisfied that the burning of the wigwams would be a heavy loss to the indians for they had found many piles of skins and robes stored up to be used in barter for guns and horses indeed the whole belongings of the tribe except their cattle were destroyed together with what perhaps would be even more severely felt the scalps taken from their enemies in many a fight and massacre a few words acquainted the newcomers with what had taken place and they were delighted to find that they had arrived in time to save the women from the fate that awaited them did you hear the rifleshots broncho nary one we was having a skirmish with the redskins they showed fight at first till they saw the rest of the boys coming out we chased them two miles and killed six of them then we thought it best to come back for we could see that a couple of the best mounted had been sent straight off as hard as they could go after the first lot we should not have chased them as far as we did but we wanted to rope five of their horses for the women as soon as we had done that we took the back track have you caught some of the squaws steve no worse luck they had all cleared out afore we got here there was nary a soul in the village except these old men and women but where on earth did they get to it took us a quarter of an hour to find out and then one of the men lit on it pretty nigh by accident right along the cliff thar is some steps cut in the rock they are hidden by bushes and up above them is a sort of gap in the rock with a path up it you cant see it from the plain at all no doubt that is the principal reason why they fixed their village here it gave them a means of escape if they were attacked waal if you havent got no hostages steve there aint another minute to waste here you see we had figured on them hostages i see you have got some meat that is good waal are you all ready because if so lets git three minutes later the party rode away from the burning village the women mounted on the indian horses thars our cattle steve said pointing to a herd out on the plain but it aint any use thinking of them now you bet broncho harry replied there aint no thinking about horns or hides at present it is our own har we have got to think of you think they will catch us up broncho said steve i dont think nothing at all about it they are just as sure to catch us up as the sun is to rise we have got every foot of a hundred miles to go and the horses have been travelling hard for the last three days by this time those fellows as have galloped on ahead are pretty nigh their main party if they havent overtook them before this they had no call for speed and would be taking it easy you cant reckon much more than ten miles start still when they catch us they wont be more than three to one there was thirtyfive went out you said steve and another twentyfive in the second lot that brings them up to sixty which is pretty nigh three to one well three to one aint such great odds even if they wur to come down and fight us in a body but i reckon they would not do that they are more likely to make a surround of it they would know that we should have to leave pretty near half our number to guard the women and the rest wouldnt be strong enough to charge them besides it aint only sixty we have got to reckon with like enough half a dozen of them started as soon as we turned back to the other villages of the tribe you may reckon we shall have two or three hundred of them coming along in our track in an hour or two dont you make any mistake about it steve we shant get away and we have got to fight now you know the country and what you have got to reckon up is where shall we fight you cant calkilate on above fifty miles and if you say forty it will be safer a few of the horses might get a bit further than that but taking them all round and reckoning they have been going hard for the last few days forty is the longest we can calkilate on afore we hear the redskin yells behind us the two brothers are about forty miles from here steve rutherford said ah i have heard of them they are two buttes close together aint they yes we should be safe enough there if all the redskins in creation was attacking us they might starve us out but they could never climb up one of the brothers there aint no climbing up at all it stands straight up all round but the other has got a track up i have seen cattle on the top do you know the way up steve yes i was with a party that came out from the canadian looking up cattle that had strayed we didnt find many of the cattle the injuns had got them you may be sure but we stopped at the foot of the buttes and did some hunting for a day or two three or four of us climbed up it aint a road you would choose to drive a team down and i should not have thought that cattle would have climbed it if i hadnt been told they did so still it is good enough for us there was no attempt to gallop at full speed the horses being kept at a canter the pace to which they are most accustomed there steve said pointing to the lower country ahead of them for they had since starting been gradually descending there are the brothers they dont look far away hugh who was riding beside him remarked i guess they are near fifteen miles lightning i should have said five if i had been asked hugh said i wish they was only five i expect before we get half way to them we shall hear the injuns behind us yes broncho has been telling me what you think of it well there is one thing if we get to those buttes first we can keep the whole tribe at bay yes lad as far as fighting goes but there is one thing agin us water hugh asked you have hit it i dont say as there maynt be some water up there i reckon there is for they told me the cattle would stay up there for some time without coming down there werent no cattle when i was there and i didnt see no water but it may be at times there is some the top of the place seemed to me lowest in the centrenot a great deal perhaps maybe not more than three or four feetand if there is any hole in the middle there may be water there i wurnt thinking of it at the time and didnt look for it maybe in the rains it gets filled up and there is enough to last the cattle some time everything depends on that i have been thinking hugh said that if i were to ride straight on i might get through to the next ranche my horse is a firstrate one and i am sure he could do the distance if he had started after a couple of days rest he could carry you a hundred miles i dont doubt there aint nothing out of the way in that i have ridden as much a score of times but you see lad he has not had much rest and not much time to eat since we started you rode him out from your camp and then on to the first halting place that made eighty or ninety mile next day we made sixty i reckon then he was going all yesterday till we halted before we went up through the pass and he kept on going till a good bit past midnight we may not have done more than fifty or sixty mile but he got no feeding till we got into that dip about two oclock this morning if you only had the horses after you that the indians rode down to gainsford i should say your horse would carry you as well as theirs would but it wont be so you bet your life that mob we saw outside the village was a fresh one the fust thing they would do when they got to camp in the afternoon would be to send some of the lads off to the grazing grounds with the horses they had ridden and to fetch in a fresh lot besides that as i told you there will be others of the tribe coming up and jining in the chase scores of them they will all be on fresh mounts and they will be just on the best ponies they have got for they will guess that we are heading for the canadian no no lad itll never do they would ride you down sartin another thing is whoever goes has got to know every foot of the country to travel at night and to be able to find his way to the nearest ranche that job will be mine i reckon i know more of the injun ways than anyone here and if anyone can do the job i can besides it is my place you have all gone into this affair to get my rosie out of the hands of the redskins and it is my duty to get you out of the scrape listen the whole party checked their horses simultaneously as the air brought to their ears a long quavering yell and looking back they saw against the distant skyline a confused body of horsemen two miles good aint it broncho about that i should say steve and we have got twelve to ride now then let the ponies know they have got to do some work the shouts of the riders the tightening of the reins and a touch of the spur told the horses what was required of them and they sped along at a very different pace to that at which they had hitherto travelled we are all right i think long tom said to hugh they have been riding a good deal faster than we have and i dont think they will gain on us nownot anything to speak of we shall be at the buttes long before they catch us though you see when one party is chasing another they have got a great advantage how do you mean tom i dont see what advantage they have they have this advantage lightning all horses aint the same some can go a lot faster than others some can keep on ever so much longer than others there are some good and some bad of course there are tom but that is the same with both parties sartin it is lad but you see the party that is chasing go at the speed of their fastest horses waal not of their fastest but the speed that the most of them can keep up those who are badly mounted drop in the rear and are left behind the others dont consarn themselves about them now it is just the contrairy with the party that is chased they have got to go at the pace of the slowest horse among them they cant leave one or two of their mates to the marcy of the redskins they have got to keep together and to fight together and if must be to die together there is a lot of difference among the horses in this crowd we just took what we could git when we started thar wurnt no picking and choosing thar wur one apiece for us good or bad the pace we are going aint nothing to that horse of yours but youll soon see that some of the others cant keep it up and then we shall have to slow down to their pace i didnt think of that tom yes i see a party that pursues has an immense advantage over one that flies providing of course they are greatly superior in numbers if not there will be a time when the best mounted men could no longer ride at full speed because if they did they would be inferior in numbers to those they chased when they came up to them that is reasonable lad and if those redskins behind us are only the lot from the village that will bring them up a bit they know well enough they cant lick us if they aint pretty nigh three to one and so they will want their whole crowd up and they wont be able to travel at the speed of their best horses that is why i said that we shall beat them easy it aint really them it is the bands from the other villages that we have got to fear i dont know this kintry and i dont know where the other villages are but i shouldnt be surprised any moment to see bands cutting in from the right or left some of the injuns would ride straight off there and they will have heard the news as soon or sooner than the band that went after us to the rocks they will guess the line we should take and will all be on fresh horses that is what i am thinking of all the time i suppose steve knows hugh said he knows he aint said much but he dropt behind an hour ago and said to me keep a sharp lookout on both sides tom that is where the danger comes in for the next five miles the pursuers did not appear to gain cant we take it easy steve jim gattling asked some of the horses are beginning to blow a bit there aint more than seven miles now between us and the buttes we might let them walk for five minutes now to get their wind again steve turned in his saddle and looked round at the horses wiry little animals as they were many of them were showing signs of distress we will go a little bit easier he said just a little when we get to that brow a mile ahead we shall get a better view then we will see about it the horses were pulled in a little but still kept at a gallop until they got to the top of the ascent from this point there was a smooth and regular fall right down to the valley from which rose the buttes six miles away now you have got to ride for it and no mistake steve said sharply there they come both ways that is just what i was afeard of an exclamation of something like dismay broke from many of the men for two bands of indians were seen one on each hand riding like themselves for the buttes the one to the left was perhaps a mile away but considerably in advance of them that on the right was perhaps twice as far and was like themselves just beginning to descend the long incline we shall pass the crowd to the right broncho harry said but the others will cut us off sure that is so harry steve said quietly but there is one thing there aint above forty or fifty of them while that crowd to the right are twice as strong if they had been first it would have been all over with us well dont travel too fast lads we cant pass ahead of that lot to the left but there is no fear of the crowd to the right just go at the pace we are going now look here what has got to be done is this we have got to keep together with the women in the middle of us we have got to go right through them now nine of you have got rifles you keep next to the gals the moment we have got through the injuns you ride with them straight on to the foot of the butte i must go with you because i know just where the path starts and no one else does the moment you get there you jump off the ponies take post among the rocks and open fire on the injuns you broncho with the rest of them directly we are through you turn again and charge them just check them for about a minute that will be enough then you ride in and we will cover you with our rifles that is about it harry replied now boys you all hear you with the rifles go straight on and look here empty your sixshooters into them as you chargethe more you wipe out the better then the rest of you with me just give a yell to scare them and then close with them again dont you empty your sixshooters at first but keep your fire till we are through them it is mighty hard if the others with six shots apiece dont clear the way for us you must bear in mind that you will want every shot after we are through so dont throw away one dont you bother about the advance crowd with the women i will keep my eye on them and when i see they are ready i will give a yell and then we will ride for it together the indians saw that they had it in their power to cut off the whites from the buttes and they no longer rode at the headlong speed at which they were going when first perceived but slackened down their pace they could if they had chosen have brought on the fight at some distance from the buttes but they had no motive for doing so they saw the large party coming from the other side and preferred to delay the contest till the last moment in order that their friends should be near at hand steve remarked with satisfaction that they did not attempt to outride his party the fools he said to broncho harry they wont be there above a hundred yards before us and wont get above one shot each before we are on them if they had known their business they would have ridden fit to kill their horses till they got there and then jumped off and run up that path and held it we should have lost half our number at least fighting our way up in fact with the women with us we couldnt have done it scarce another word was spoken as the party galloped on mile after mile had been passed and the buttes were now towering up in front of them when within half a mile of the foot the riders gradually fell in to the places assigned to them those with rifles went in front then the women then the men with revolvers only the small party of indians kept on until within a hundred and fifty yards of the foot of the buttes then they halted and turned the whites were at the moment some two hundred yards behind them the great party of indians on the right were about half a mile away the indians in front did not await the shock of the whites knowing that the impetus of the latter would give them an advantage but raising their warcry dashed forward to meet them discharging their rifles as they came not a shot was fired by the whites until the two lines were within twenty paces of each other then the revolvers of the ten men in front cracked out sharply several of the indians fell then there was a crash as the lines met and then for a moment a confused medleythe indians fighting with tomahawk and spear the whites with their deadly revolvers the conditions were too unequal there was not one among the band of whites who could not rely with certainty upon his aim and as in a close line boot touching boot they pressed on the indians melted like snow before them it seemed to hugh but a moment from the time the fight began till the path before them to the buttes was open forward shouted steve we are through them boys as hugh dashed on he heard broncho harrys shout the cracking of the revolvers and the yell of the indians the women were riding abreast with them now never mind the gals steve shouted all tumble off together it was but a few seconds before the first band threw themselves from their horses and took up their post behind boulders and bushes as they dismounted steve gave a loud shout and almost at the same moment the party that had fought under the leadership of broncho harry wheeled round and rode towards them had there been only the indians that had tried to bar their way to reckon with there would have been no need for them to seek refuge at the buttes half their number had fallen under the bullets of the front line of the whites as they fell upon them the charge of broncho harrys detachment had completed the effect of the blow the whole conflict had only lasted half a minute but in that time the deadly sixshooters had wrought terrible havoc with the band of indians less than half of them went galloping back to meet their advancing friends and several of these were leaning over their saddles evidently badly wounded over twenty lay together at the spot where the two parties had met a few of the horses stood quietly beside their dead owners the rest were careering wildly over the plain a loud cheer broke from both parties of the whites as broncho harrys band rode in and dismounted that has been a pretty tight race long tom said but we beat them handsome tom do you all stow away your horses and ours as snug as you can among the rocks and trees then take your places down here we will get a bit higher up so as to get a wider range for our rifles but we havent time for that now we must just give this other crowd a hint that we have got rifles and can use them now boys take steady aim at that clump of redskins dont throw away a shot there is nothing like straight shooting for skeering a red here goes and steve taking a steady aim fired while his companions followed his example illustration chapter xiv surrounded by redskins the large band of indians had checked their horses some five hundred yards from the foot of the buttes as they saw the survivors of the party in front galloping back to them and realized that the whites had gained shelter some of the more impetuous spirits had however ridden on and were some distance in advance when the rifles of the defenders cracked out four of the indians fell from their horses three others were wounded and these with their companions wheeled round and rejoined the main body who now at the order of their chief fell back and were a few minutes later reinforced by the band that had followed on the footsteps of the fugitives now boys we can go up to the top but first let us see how we stand has any gone down yes there are two missing long tom said i saw two of the first line go down as we charged them john spencer wur killed jim gattling said he wur riding next to me boston wur the other broncho harry said i wur riding in a line with him behind and saw him go back kerplumb i knew he wur hit through the head by the way he fell four other men were it was now found wounded and one of the women had been hit in the shoulder with a rifle ball the redskins aint no account with their rifles on horseback long tom said let them lie down and get their piece on a log and they can shoot pretty straight but its just throwing away lead to try to shoot with a rifle from a horse i never knew more than two or three whites who was anyway sartin with their pieces when their horses was on the move a sixshooters worth ten rifles on horseback a fellow kin gallop and keep his arm straight but when it comes to holding out a long tube with both arms and your pony going on the jump it stands to reason there aint no keeping the thing straight if those redskins had hurried up and dismounted and steadied their rifles on their saddles i reckon they might have wiped out half of us before we reached them waal steve you and the women and best part of the others may as well get up to the top but broncho and me and two or three of the boys will stop down here and look after the horses lightning you may as well stop down here with a kipple of other fellows with rifles so as just to give them a hint to keep at a distance otherwise they will be sending their lead up while the others are getting to the top but the indians showed no signs of any intention of harassing them for the present they knew that the rifles in the hands of the defenders carried farther and straighter than their own they had suffered heavy losses already and were in no way disposed to do anything rash they knew that there was no occasion for haste and no fear of the fugitives attempting to make their escape after some consultation they drew further off into the plain and in a short time smoke could be seen ascending at several points there aint no occasion to wait down here no longer long tom said the injuns know well enough that they cant take this place not at least without losing a hundred men and it aint redskin fashion to throw away lives special when they know they have only got to wait to do the job without any fighting at all so let us go up the path was comparatively easy for threequarters of the way to the summit of the buttes it seemed that on this side either the rock had crumbled away in past ages so as to make a gradual slope or else water or wind had thrown up a bank against it the height of the butte above the broad valley would be about three hundred feet and the slope was covered with trees and undergrowth until it terminated abruptly at the face of a wall of rock fifty feet from the summit at one point only this wall was broken by a sort of gap or cleft some three feet wide at the bottom and slanting as steeply as the roof of a house the bottom was worn almost smooth by the rains of centuries and by the feet of cattle and hugh had to sling his gun behind him and use both hands to grasp the irregularities of the rock on either side to get up on reaching the top he found that the summit was almost flat a couple of hundred yards in length and as many feet in width it was covered with grass and several trees some of considerable size were scattered about over the surface well bill he said as royce came up to him have you found any water yes there is a rock pool in the centre there by that big tree there is water enough for us and the horses for maybe a week enough for us without the horses for a month or more what are you going to do bring the horses up here we havent settled that yet i reckon we shall bring the best of them up anyhow i suppose there is no possible place the indians can get up except by that gap nary one everywhere else the rock goes straight down to the plain there aint no way except by flying to get up here if you dont come by this gap anyhow we shall bring the horses a good long way up the slope it is a long line along the bottom there and the redskins might crawl up in the night and we should pretty nigh all have to keep guard steve says that though where we came up the ground wur smooth enough it aint so over the rest of the slope but that what with the boulders and the undergrowth and thorns it is pretty nigh impossible to get up through the trees anywhere else he expects that its been water washing down the earth and sand through that gap that has filled up between the boulders and made it smooth going where we came up so we will bring up the horses and get the best of them up here and tie the others just below the gap we can take them down water in our hats if we decide to keep them or get them up tomorrow if we like anyhow all we shall want will be to keep four men at watch down below them i should have thought it best to bring them all up at once bill what is the use of leaving them below waal hugh there aint grass enough to bring them all up here and every morning we can take them down and let them graze below there air no fear of the injuns coming close to drive them off and if they tried it the critturs would come up the path again of their own accord except those we took from the indians they can get a good lot of sweet grass under the trees down thar and as long as they get that they can do pretty well without water thar do you see thar are two or three more lots of indians coming down to join the others theyll have three hundred of them down thar before long it dont make much difference how many of them there are if they dare not attack us hugh said thats where you are wrong hugh broncho harry who had now joined them said the more thar are of them the closer watch they can keep to see that none of us gets away and the more thar are of them the bigger the party must be that comes to rescue us you may be sure that they have scouts for miles and miles off and if they get news that there is a party coming up they will just leave a guard to keep us here and go down and fall on them i didnt think of that harry yes it will need a very strong party to bring us off but perhaps they will get tired and go dont you bet on that hugh ef thar air one thing an injun never gets tired of its waiting time aint nothing to them them chaps can send out parties to hunt just as if they wur in their own villages the boys will bring them down corn and gather their firewood for them and as long as we are up here they will stop down thar if it was six months they know how many of us thar are here lots of them must have been up here at one time or another and knowing the time of year and how much rain has fallen lately there aint no doubt they can calkilate pretty well how much water there is in this pool they will know that we shall keep our horses as long as we can and they will reckon that three weeks at the outside will see the end of the water as for food of course we are all right we have got the horses to eat and horse is pretty nigh as good as cowbeef i would just as soon have one as the other a young bronchos a sight tenderer than an old cow any day hugh now took a turn round the edge of the butte it was as royce had said a mass of rock rising perpendicularly from the plain it was separated from the other butte by a gap a hundred and fifty feet wide it was clear that they had once formed one mass for between them was a rocky shoulder connecting them this was very steep on both sides narrowing almost to a razor edge at the top where it joined the butte on which they were standing this edge was fifty feet below the top but it rose as it retreated from it and on the opposite side reached up to a level with the plateau a fire had already been lighted on the top of the butte and over this the women were cooking some of the meat they had brought from the indian village and in a short time the whole party except two who were placed on sentry to watch the movements of the indians gathered round it waal boys steve said when the meal was finished i reckon that thar aint no time to lose and that i had best start tonight there aint no denying that we air in a pretty tight fix here and it wont be easy to get a force as can fight their way through that crowd i reckon i shall not be able to gather over fifty cowboys on the canadian and so ill have to ride to the nearest fort and get the troops to help that air about two hundred miles from the canadian it ull take me three days to get there after i leave the ranches it ull take four at the very least before the troops will get down there you cant reckon less than a week i shall be two days getting down to the ranches as there wont be any travelling by day so you see if i start tonight you cant reckon on seeing us back afore ten days at the earliest that will be about it steve i dont see as you can do without the troops noway waal we can hold out a fortnight easy we must put the horses on mighty short allowance of water so as to make it last a fortnight if we find it running out quickern we expect we must kill off half the animals it dont matter about them a bit ef you come up strong enough to thrash the redskins without our help yes i think you had better go tonight you are as likely to get out tonight as any night but youll have to look mighty sharp steve for you may bet your life them injuns will be as thick as bees round the butte how do you mean to go steve hugh asked tie the ropes together lightning and get lowered down over the edge i have been looking at the ridge that runs from this butte to the other hugh said and it struck me that if you were lowered down on to it you might get along on to the other butte of course two others would be lowered with you and then you could be let down from the farthest side of the other butte you said nobody had ever been on it and anyhow the indians are not likely to be as thick over there as they would be round this one thunder you are right again lightning i will go and have a look at it at once it will soon be getting dark broncho do you and long tom go along with me we will lie down afore we get to the edge you may be sure that there are plenty of sharp eyes watching all round and if they was to see us standing there and looking at that ledge of rock they might guess what we had in our minds while we are away the rest of you might go down and get up the ponies it took some time to lead all the horses up the slope prince and four others were brought up to the plateau but it was necessary to tie strips of blanket under their feet to enable them to get sufficient footing to climb up through the gap i shouldnt have thought that cattle could have come where horses cant hugh said cattle can climb pretty nigh anywhere the cowboy he addressed replied i have seen cattle climb places where you would have thought that nothing but a goat could get to you see their hoofs are softer than horses and get a better hold on rocks but horses could get up here easy enough if they werent shod they dont have a fair show with shoes on by the time the horses had been brought up night had fallen four men were told off as a guard two of them took up their post halfway down the slope two went down to its foot no attack was anticipated for the indians would be sure that a sharp watch would be kept and there would be no chance whatever of their making their way up to the summit unobserved hugh was not with the first party on watch and joined the crowd round the fire what time are you going to start steve as soon as it gets quite dark thar aint no good in waiting they air on watch now and they will be on watch all night so thar is no difference that way and the sooner i goes the farther i will git afore morning it is settled that if i am caught tonight jim gattling will try next ef he goes down too broncho harry will try after that you can settle among yourselves i will volunteer to be next hugh said another couple of days and prince will be ready to do anything if i was to try i should start on his back and take my chance the indians cannot have many horses as fast as he is and if i can get through safely they may ride as hard as they like there wont be many who can catch me anyhow and if they came up one at a time i have my revolver and can hold my own i shouldnt like to try tonight for many of their horses are fresh and prince wants at least twentyfour hours before he is fit for work again but if you like to give up your attempt tonight steve i will try tomorrow night no no lad we will do as we have planned you might do it and you might not more likely you would not for like enough you would run agin a dozen of them going out and would get a lasso dropped over your shoulders afore you saw or heard them besides you are young lad you have got your life afore you i am getting on and rosie will have jim to look after her so it dont make much matter along of me an hour later it was perfectly dark steve had left his hat lying on the edge of the rock exactly above the ridge when he had visited it with harry and long tom several of the ropes were knotted together while this was being done steve withdrew with his daughter and jim gattling from the fire and was absent five or six minutes he came back by himself i am ready he said goodbye to you all i hope as ill see you all agin afore long he shook hands with them all round and then taking up his rifle walked away without looking round followed by broncho harry and long tom the latter saying to hugh and two others you come too we shall want you to lower the last of us down and to hoist us up again the hat was soon found all three men took off their boots broncho harry tied those of steve together by a short piece of rope and slung them over his shoulder and he and tom left their revolvers and belts behind them now we are ready harry said mind steve as you go down you keep your face to the rock so that that gun of yours shant strike it you cant be too keerful you know a loop was placed round steves shoulder under the arm you lie down hugh with your face over the edge then steve can tell you if we are one side or other of the ledge it looked plumb down from here but it maynt be harry had rather to hughs surprise taken up his blanket as he left the fire but he now saw the object it was partly folded and laid over the edge so as to prevent any chance of the rope touching a rock and being cut by it now tom and i will hold it out a bit beyond the face harry said and you two do the lowering away now steve steve knelt down at the edge and lowered himself until the strain came on the rope this broncho and tom held out as far as they could and the other two steadily lowered it it was so dark that hugh could not see the ridge and presently lost sight of steve soon however he heard his voice about a foot more to the right a few seconds later the strain on the rope ceased are you all right steve hugh asked yes i am astride of it it is wider than i thought it was now i will move on you can let broncho down as soon as you like the other two men were lowered and then there was a long silence it was no easy matter hugh knew to crawl along the ridge for it was by no means even the great danger was that there might be loose pieces which would be dislodged and go clattering down below when however ten minutes had passed without any sound being heard the watchers felt sure that the three men must have gained the opposite summit there was nothing now to do but to sit down and wait at the end of an hour and a half hugh who was again leaning over listening intently heard a voice below him lower down that other rope hugh we are both here the short rope was lowered for the long one had been taken by them to lower steve from the other butte and in a short time broncho and long tom stood beside them i think the old man has got safe off broncho harry said we have stood over there listening all this time and aint heard a sound there are plenty of the varmint about you hear that barking of prairiedogs and hooting of owls thats them letting each other know where they are they are thick everywhere i guess round the foot of this butte but we didnt hear them on the other side and i reckon there aint many of them there anyhow steve must have got beyond them by this time that wur a firstrate idea of yours hugh he never would have got through if we had lowered him off here but it wasnt no joke getting along that ridge in the dark i can tell you we air all accustomed to balance ourselves in the saddle and so made a shift to get across but in some places the rock wur pretty nigh as sharp as a knife do you think that there is any chance of a night attack broncho one never can answer for the varmint but i dont reckon as they are like to try it they know they couldnt get up to the top and all they could hope for would be to kill some of the horses and cut off the men on watch it wouldnt be worth risking many lives to do that besides it aint a nice place to climb in the dark they can crawl along out on the plain without making more noise than a snake would do but that is a different thing to climbing up among bush and rock in the dark they couldnt reckon on doing it without being heard no hugh it may be that one or two of the young bucks wanting to distinguish themselves and thirsting for scalps may crawl up and see if they can catch any one napping down below there but i reckon that is all and that aint likely to be tried tonight they are all out there trying to make sure that no one gets away that is their first consarn besides like enough the chiefs will try in the morning to get us to surrender and it wouldnt do for any young brave to make a venture on his own account until it is sartin that they aint going to get us without fighting still i wouldnt say that when it comes to your turn to be on guard lightning it would be altogether safe for you to put your rifle down and take an hours sleep well i am not likely to try that experiment anyhow broncho no i didnt guess as you was i only said as it wouldnt be safe i dont think steve put enough men on guard i am going to talk to the others about it i reckon we ought to divide into two guards say ten on each watch four down below four up with the horses two up here at the top of the path we shant have much to do all day and can sleep as much as we like steve is an old injun fighter and he knows better than we do what the chances air still there aint no good taking risks i quite agree with you broncho now that steve has got safe away we know we shall get help before very long and it would be foolish to run any risk merely from want of care i would go even farther and let fifteen men be on watch at night and let five sleep and keep lookout during the day that would be no better lad that would be worse for it is difficult to keep awake the whole night especially if night after night passes without an alarm by this time they had reached the others and there was much rejoicing when it was heard that steve rutherford had got safe away do you feel sure harry that they might not have caught him and killed him without any noise rosie asked anxiously sartin steves last words was i shall keep my sixshooter in my hand and if they riddle me with arrows broncho i will fire a shot or two before i drop dont you fear about that and he would do it besides it aint in injun nature to kill an enemy without setting up a yell over it a redskins like a hen laying an egg he has got to boast of it loud enough for all the world to hear no you neednt be a bit afeard gal your father has got off safe and by this time i reckon he is ten miles away harry then made the proposal that half the men should be always on guard to which they at once agreed and six of them taking up their arms left the fire without further words and started to take up their post on the slope now rosie you shall give us a pan of tea and a bit of meat and then the sooner we are all asleep the better we shall want to use our eyes when it is our turn on watch at twelve oclock they were on their feet again and went down the hill now harry said long tom lightning and you and me will go along to the bottom three others keep about fifty yards behind us two up below the horses and two on the top here as they took their places and the men they relieved returned to the summit long tom said listen to the calls lightning the redskins have heard us moving and are warning each other to look sharp i reckon they are as thick as peas all round here for they know that if one of us tries to make a bolt on horseback it is here he must start but they can hardly suppose that we are such fools as that comes to now you move away five or six yards to the right and post yourself behind a rock you have got to keep your eyes in front of you to see if you can see anything moving in the grass and you have got to listen for any sound over there to the right in case any of the redskins should try to crawl up through the bushes to circumvent us ill go to the left and broncho kin take the middle of the path hugh took up his post and maintained a vigilant watch he was much more afraid of an attempt on the part of the indians to crawl up on the right than of an attack in front and listened intently for the slightest sound of moving leaves on that side for he knew that the indians would not be likely to break the smallest twig in their progress in front of him he could discern the expanse of the plain stretching out there were a few low bushes here and there and at times to his straining eyes it seemed that some of the dark masses moved but he knew that this might be only fancy hour after hour passed presently harry stole up to his side day will be breaking in an hour hugh keep a sharp lookout now they will try it if they try it at all just as the sky begins to lighten all however remained quiet and hugh felt in no slight degree relieved as the light stole gradually up the eastern sky and he felt that harrys anticipations were incorrect and that no attack would be made as soon as the sun rose the sentries were relieved and the party on watch retired to the crest for from there a view over the whole of the plain was obtainable and it was impossible for the indians to crawl up towards the buttes without being seen two hours later a party were seen approaching from the main indian camp they stopped five hundred yards away then two indians advanced and held up their arms to show they had left their rifles behind them i thought they would be wanting to have a talk this morning broncho harry said i suppose two of us had better go down to meet them you and jim gattling had better go broncho no jim said rason had better go with you broncho he speaks a little of their language and i dont it is not likely either of the chiefs speak english all right broncho said it is as well to understand what they say though we know well enough that nothing will come of it put your sixshooter in your pocket rason they will have their tomahawks and knives hidden about them somewhere half a dozen of the rest had better come down the slope it aint likely they will make a rush but when they find we wont agree to their terms they may turn nasty hugh watched the meeting from the top of the butte it lasted about ten minutes and then the envoys separated and returned to their respective parties the result was clear enough for when the indian chiefs reached their followers they raised a defiant warcry which was taken up all over the plain just as i expected harry said the redskins always like to have a talk before they begin to fight even when they know well enough that nothing can come of it what were their proposals they said that they knew we could hold out for a time but that the water would soon be finished and we must give in then we had stolen the white women out of their camp and had killed their young men but if we would give up the women and surrender our arms and ammunition they would let us depart free what did you say broncho in return i said that we was very comfortable up here and that if we had taken the women they had stolen them away from us as to our arms we thought they was more useful in our hands than they would be in theirs but that if they would go back to their villages we would promise to do them no farther harm until they troubled us again who were the chiefs harry one was the eagle he is a big chief i have often heard of him the other was the owl i fancy the eagle is the fighting chief and the owl the counsellor he is a craftylooking beggar the eagle is a fine tall redskin a sort of chap i shouldnt care about having a handtohand fight with with knives and tomahawks he told us it wur no use our hoping for assistance for that none could come to us and unless we could fly we could not get through his young men and that even if we could our scalps would be hanging in their lodges long before we could get down to the ranches i said he might have our scalps if he could take them but that if he did it would be off dead bodies for as long as one of us had strength to draw trigger he would not get up on to the butte that was all he knew well enough what the answer would be he wanted to see i fancy how we took it and whether we were in good heart it wur just a game of bluff and neither of us wur going to show our hands that night broncho harrys party went first on watch and were relieved at twelve oclock the indians had remained quiet all the day and harry said to hugh as they returned up the hill after being relieved i shouldnt be surprised if they try and attack before morning in the first place they have been wonderful quiet all day and in the next place i reckon that when the chief said he acknowledged that we could hold the place he just meant to give us the idee that he didnt mean to attack and wur only going to starve us out in course they will do that afterwards but i think they will try one rush first i tell you what hugh we will set to work now and get the rest of the horses to the top they cant pick up much where they are now and they may as well be out of the way if there is a fight the ten men soon got the horses up on to the plateau and then lay down to sleep the morning was just breaking when the crack of a rifle was heard and it was followed instantly by a score of others and an outburst of fierce yelling every man sprang to his feet and ran to the top of the path hugh do you and two others take your place on the edge of the rock on the right of the gap tom you and stumpy and rason take your places on the left and kiver us as we fall back if we have to as is like enough come on with me the rest of you standing on the edge of the cliff hugh saw the flashes bursting out rapidly among the rocks and trees at the foot of the slope and soon perceived that they were mounting upwards a crowd of indians must have thrown themselves suddenly forward and established themselves in cover and they were now fighting their way up the defenders had fallen back for the answering flashes were halfway up the slope the rattle of musketry was incessant but far above it rose the yells of the indians the whites fought silently it was still too dark to make out the figures and hugh and his companions remained inactive our men are falling back bill he said presently to royce who was standing a few yards away on the other side of the gap they are sure to do that royce replied i guess there are two hundred injuns down there and though it is difficult for them to make their way through the bushes they will do it you will see our fellows will soon be up here five minutes later indeed three or four figures were seen coming up the path who are you hugh shouted it is all right one of them called out there air too many for us and broncho has ordered us to fall back and help you cover the rest gradually the flashes of the defenders rifles ceased to spurt out from among the rocks and died away altogether then at full speed the men dashed up the pathway followed closely by a number of leaping figures then the rifles of those along the edge of the rock cracked out there was a chorus of cries and yells and the pursuers bounded in among the rocks and bushes again and their rifles flashed out angrily rason fell backwards shot through the head and a cry on the other side of the gap showed that at least one was hit there lie down hugh shouted and fire over the edge in a minute the whole party were gathered on the crest the daylight was now broadening rapidly but not one of the assailants could be seen though the puffs of smoke from behind rock and bush showed how thickly they were gathered will they try a rush do you think hugh asked broncho who had taken his post beside him i dont think so harry said i expect they didnt reckon on finding so many men on guard on the slope and thought they might carry it with a rush and get here afore we was ready for them and before it wur light enough for us to shoot straight they cant gather thick enough among the rocks down thar to give them a chance of making a big rush apparently this was also the opinion of the indians who soon learned that it was dangerous to show their position by firing for every shot was answered instantly and several were killed as they raised their heads to fire from behind the rocks the firing therefore gradually ceased now we are just as we was before harry said it wur sartin we couldnt hold the slope if they made an attack the only thing is they are nearer for a rush in the dark than they was afore there aint no fear of their trying it as long as it is light six will be enough to keep guard at present we will talk over what is best to be done six men were picked out as a guard the rest assembled in council we have got to block up that gap somehow harry said if they make a rush in the dark we may kill a lot of them but the chances are they will get up it seems to me that we had best kill half the horses and pile them up down near the mouth that will make a breastwork and will stop their bullets there was a general chorus of assent then hugh said that seems a very good idea harry but i should think that it would be better if we were to make that breastwork halfway up the gap and to cut off some big arms of these trees and pile them in front of it if we were to pretty well fill up the gap with boughs it would be very difficult to get through and a couple of us behind the breastwork with sixshooters would prevent them from clearing it away especially as the others could fire down from above on them thats it broncho harry said that will make us as safe as if there wur no gap at all bully for you again young un let us set to work about it at once there was not a hatchet among them and it took them the whole day to cut off five or six stout boughs of trees with their bowieknives however it was done at last the boughs were dragged along until near the mouth of the gap and then dropped into it the buttends inwards broncho harry and two or three of the others going down into the gap and arranging them so that a dense screen was formed outwards with the boughs and leaves one or two shots came up from the bottom of the slope but these were harmless and the guard took care that no one was able to fire from a direct line with the gap from anywhere near the summit at last the boughs were all in position and a dense hedge filled the gap twelve feet high we can spare the horses harry said they cant get through that hedge with us above them they will never even try it they see as we are up to something by their firing but i dont suppose they can make out what it is like enough one of them will crawl up after it gets dark to see and when he reports what we have done they will know that the game is up as far as taking the place by storm is concarned from this time forward no attempt was made to renew the attack the indians still held the slope for shots were occasionally fired whenever one of the defenders came near enough to the edge to allow his head to be seen otherwise all was quiet as soon as the meat brought up was finished one of the indian horses was killed and hugh found that its flesh was by no means bad eating the water was carefully husbanded horses as well as men being placed on the smallest possible allowance the horses too were picketed so as to prevent them from grazing at will and the grass was cut and supplied to them in small bundles mixed with leaves from the trees with good management it was agreed that they would be able to hold out for a fortnight without difficulty illustration illustration chapter xv with the waggon teams soon after daybreak on the twelfth day the watch which had now been carefully kept up for some days reported that two indians were galloping at full speed up the valley a cheer broke from the defenders of the butte for they doubted not that these brought news of the approach of a relieving party when the horsemen arrived at the main encampment out on the plain a stir was immediately visible and in two or three minutes the indians were seen running out to the horses grazing on the plain beyond while loud yells rang through the air those who have got rifles had better come to the edge long tom shouted all these fellows who are here will be scooting out on the plain in a minute we must stop a few of them anyhow a minute or two later scores of indians dashed out from the trees at the foot of the buttes and ran towards their encampment the whites at once opened fire but a running man far below is a difficult mark and not a single shot took effect you dont call that shooting broncho harry said indignantly it is all very well harry hugh said but a brown spot three hundred feet below you and as many yards away isnt an easy mark waal harry said it cant be helped now we will get ready to go out to lend a hand to our friends let us have a couple of ropes we will tie them to the branches one by one and haul them up there is no fear of an attack now look here jim you and your lot had best stop here to guard the women and we will sally out there are five of you that will be plenty the man on watch now gave a shout i can see them he said how many of them i guess there is about eighty there is a thick clump in the middle i reckon that they are the soldiers and thirty or forty riding loose i allow they are cowboys that is just about the right number harry said if there was more of them the indians wouldnt fight i dont know as they will now but seeing as there must be three hundred of them i expect they will try it now then up with these branches in a quarter of an hour the branches were all hauled out of the gap while this had been going on the women had given a feed and a good drink of water to the horses for there was no occasion any longer to husband their resources the animals were now saddled and led down through the gap by this time the indians were all mounted and were moving in a close body across the plain to meet the advancing foe now jim broncho harry said you stand on the edge and when you see the fight begin you wave your hand we cant make a start until they are at it and we shant be able to see down below there the cowboys made their way down to the plain and then mounted they sat for ten minutes with their eyes fixed upon jim gattling presently he waved his arm and with a shout they started at a gallop as soon as they were fairly out on the plain they heard the sound of firearms and after galloping half a mile came suddenly in view of the combat the indians had boldly closed with the troops and cowboys who were now driven together a desperate handtohand conflict was raging swords flashing in the sun waving tomahawks and spears could be seen above the mass the cracking of revolvers was incessant and a light smoke hung over the conflict they are hard at it boys long tom exclaimed now dont shout until we are on them they are too busy to notice us keep well together and we shall go through them like a knife not a word was spoken as they galloped down upon the scene of conflict when they were within a hundred yards a cry of warning was raised and some of the indians faced round but in a moment with a loud shout the band of cowboys charged down upon them and cleft their way into the mass horse and rider rolling over under the impetus of the onslaught the deadly sixshooters spoke out while the indians fell thickly around them and in a minute they had joined the whites in the centre of the mass there was a shout of welcome and then the officer commanding the troops cried now is your time lads press them hard give it them hot and the united party attacked the indians with fresh vigour up to this time there had been little advantage on either side many more of the indians had fallen than of the whites owing to the superiority of the latters weapons especially the revolvers of the cowboy section still their great superiority in numbers was telling and when the sixshooters were emptied the cowboys had no weapons to oppose to the spears and tomahawks of the indians the sudden attack from the rear however had shaken the redskins in the momentary pause that had ensued many of the cowboys slipped fresh cartridges into their pistols and in a short time the indians began to give ground while the less courageous of them wheeled about their horses heads illustration the cowboys charged down upon the indians war eagle and some of the chiefs fought desperately but when the former fell cut down by one of the troopers a panic spread among his followers and as if by a sudden impulse they turned and fled the pursuit was a short one for the horses of the rescuing force were jaded with the long journey they had performed those of the party from the butte were weakened by hunger while the ponies of the indians had been doing nothing for days and speedily left them behind after hearty congratulations by the rescuers and sincere thanks by those whom they had relieved from their peril the party returned to the scene of conflict four troopers and two cowboys had fallen and a score had received wounds more or less serious while on the part of the indians over thirty lay dead graves were dug for the fallen whites the wounds of the others were bandaged up and they then proceeded to the butte at whose foot the women and the settlers who had been left to guard them had already gathered they having hurried down as soon as they saw the plain covered with flying indians steve had returned with the rescuing party and had been severely wounded in the fight a blow from a tomahawk having cut off one of his ears wounded his cheek and inflicted a terrible gash on his shoulder he was however in the highest spirits i shant look so purty my dear he said to his daughter who burst into tears at the sight of his injury but then i was not anything uncommon afore and i havent any thought of going courting again waal we have given the injuns a smart lesson when the handshaking and congratulations ceased the captain commanding the cavalry held a consultation with steve and some of the cowboys as to the advisability of following up the victory and attacking the indians in their own villages i should not feel justified in doing it unless i was pretty certain of success the commandant of the fort gave me orders to rescue this party and i have done so but he said nothing about engaging in a regular campaign with the indians i shouldnt try captain steve said i reckon they havent half their force here todayno nor a quarterfor they reckon to put a thousand fighting men in the field they didnt guess as any of us had got off to get help and knew that they had plenty here to keep us caged upon the butte another thing is the cowboys with us air all employed on the ranches and although they came off willing to rescue the women and pay the injuns off for that murdering business at our settlement i reckon they will want to be off again to their work but even with them we aint no match for the forces the redskins can collect so if you will take my advice captain you wont waste a minute for thar is no saying how soon they will be down on us again and if they did come the fight today wouldnt be a sarcumstance to the next you are right the officer said it would be folly to risk anything by waiting here i suppose you are all ready to start i reckon so steve said the horses have all been brought down from the hill the officer at once gave orders to mount while this conversation had been going on hugh who was occupied in giving prince a good feed from the grain the soldiers had brought for their horses saw one of the troopers staring at him hullo luscombe he exclaimed who would have thought of seeing you here i thought i couldnt be mistaken hugh the other exclaimed as they grasped each others hands but you have changed so much and widened out so tremendously in the eighteen months since i left you that for a moment i wasnt sure it was you well this is luck and it is quite a fluke too i was getting heartily sick of doing duty at that wretched fort where one day was just like another and there was nothing in the world to do except cleaning ones traps when a letter arrived from the governor i told you the old boy was sure to give in sooner or later and he sent me money to get my discharge and take me home i was just going to the commanding officer to make my application when rutherford rode into camp it was evidently something very important for his horse fell dead as he drew rein so i waited to hear the news and found that our troop was ordered to mount instantly to ride to the rescue of a party of settlers and cowboys who were besieged by the indians you may guess i dropped my letter into my pocket and said nothing about it we have done a good deal of scouting and had two or three paltry skirmishes with the indians but nothing worth talking about and this seemed from what rutherford said to be likely to be a regular battle and so you see here i am it has been a jolly windup for my soldiering and to think that you should be one of the party we have ridden something like three hundred miles to rescue now tell me all about yourself at this moment the trumpet to saddle sounded i will tell you as we ride along hugh said i dont suppose there will be any particular order kept on our way back five minutes later the whole party were cantering down the valley they did not draw rein until late in the afternoon and then halted on the banks of the canadian a strong cordon of sentries was posted that night but there were no signs of indians and the next day the party reached one of the ranche stations during the two days march and at the camp hugh and luscombe had kept together the latter having obtained permission from his officer to fall out of the ranks upon his telling him that one of the cowboys was an old friend who had come with him from europe i shall be off in a month or two luscombe said when they parted that evening i expect there are formalities to be gone through here just as there are in england you are quite sure there is no chance of your going home with me quite sure i have another three years to stop out here yet and then i can go back and claim my own i wrote to randolph my trustee you know to tell him i am alive and well and very glad that i did not kill that uncle of mine and saying that i shall return when i am of age but not before what do you mean to do luscombe i am going to settle down luscombe said i can tell you a years work as trooper in one of these yankee forts is about enough to make a man sick of soldiering i have eaten the bread of adversity and very hard bread it is too and there is mighty little butter on it i am going in for fatted calf when i go back and am quite prepared to settle down into a traditional squire to look after fat beeves become interested in turnips and to be a father to my people well anyhow hugh you will let me know when you come back to england you know my address and as soon as you have kicked that uncle of yours out and have squared matters generally you must come straight to me you will be sure of the heartiest welcome the governor is a capital old boy and if he did cut up rusty the wonder is he didnt do it long before my mother is a dear old lady and the girlsthere are two of themare firstrate girls and the youngest by the way is just about the right age for you she was fourteen when i came away hugh laughed i shall very likely bring home an indian squaw or a mexican so we wont build on that luscombe but when i go back to england you shall hear of me and i accept the invitation beforehand on the following morning the party broke up the troops started back for the fort steve rutherford and the cowboys rode for a time southwest and then worked their way over the foothills and came down into the plains of texas and after a weeks travel returned to the village from which they had started it had already begun to rise from its ruins waggonloads of lumber had been brought up from below and there was no lack of willing hands from other scattered settlements to aid in the work of rebuilding the houses little attention was paid to the party as they rode up from the plains for it was not on that side that a watch had been kept up for their return and indeed the eyes of the survivors had almost ceased to turn towards the mountains for hope had wellnigh died out and it had been regarded as certain that the whole party had been cut off and massacred by the indians as soon however as the news spread that there were women among the approaching troop axes saws and hammers were thrown down and there was a rush to meet them the scene was an affecting one as mothers clasped daughters and women embraced their husbands whom they had never thought to see again the cowboys were pressed to stay there for the night but they refused as they were anxious to return to the ranche from which they had been absent more than three weeks fortunately the busy season was almost over when they left and they knew that there were enough hands on the ranche to look after the cattle during their absence on the way back broncho harry said to hugh i expect hugh a good many of us will be getting our tickets before long they dont keep on more than half their strength through the winter what are you thinking of doing if you would like to stop on i will speak to the boss i reckon i shall have charge of an outfit this winter and can manage for you and stumpy thank you very much broncho but as i have told you often i dont want to stop i have had a seasons life as a cowboy but i have no idea of sticking to it and mean to have a try at something else i intend to go back to england when i am twentyone i have some property there and have no need to work i got into a scrape at home with the man who is my guardian and dont care about turning up until he has no longer any authority over me waal you know your own business lightning it is a pity for in another year you would make one of the best hands on the plains if i were to stay for another year i expect i should stay for good harry it is a hard life a terribly hard life but it is a grand one for all that there is nothing like it in the way of excitement and i dont wonder that men who once take to it find it very difficult to settle down to anything else afterwards therefore you see it is just as well to stop before one gets too fond of it i know i shall always look back upon this as the jolliest time of my life and i am lucky to have gone through it without having been damaged by a cow or having my neck broken by a broncho or being shot by an indian royce has made up his mind to go with me and as soon as we get our discharge we shall make our way to new mexico and perhaps down into arizona but of course that must depend upon other things upon reaching the station they found that as harry had predicted hands were already being discharged the manager said when they went to him and told him that they wished to leave well i had intended to keep you both on for the winter but of course if you wish to go there is an end of it and there are so many anxious to be kept on that a man in my position feels almost grateful to those who voluntarily afford vacancies there were very hearty adieus between hugh and royce and broncho harry long tom and the others who had been their close companions for months then they mounted and rode off from the station they had heard from a man who had just arrived that a large waggontrain was on the point of starting from decatur for santa fe it was composed of several parties who had been waiting until a sufficient force was collected to venture across the indian country there were several waggontrains going with supplies for the troops stationed at the chain of forts along the line others had goods for santa fe while a third was freighted with machinery and stores for mining enterprises farther south in new mexico it took royce and hugh a week to traverse the country to decatur and on arriving there they heard that the teams had started two days before they waited a day at decatur to buy a packhorse and the necessary stores for their journey and then set out in two days they overtook the train which consisted of forty waggons learning which man had been selected as the leader of the party they rode up to him we are going to santa fe royce said we are both good shots and hunters and we propose to travel with you we are ready to scout and bring in game if you will supply us with other food thats a bargain the man said briefly by no means sorry at the addition of strength to the fighting force i reckon you will earn your grub they say the injuns air on the warpath they are right enough there royce said we have been engaged in a fight with a band of the comanches who made a raid down on a little settlement named gainsford killed a score of settlers and carried off five women we got together a band from the ranche we were working on and went after them and we had some pretty tough fighting before we got through waal you will just suit us the man said i hear pretty near all the tribes are up but i doubt whether they will venture to attack a party like this i dont think they will if we keep together and are cautious royce said you have forty waggons that at two men to a waggon makes eighty thats so the other agreed and what with cooks and bosses and one thing and another we mount up to pretty nigh a hundred and of course every man has got a rifle along with him that makes a strong party royce said and with the advantage you will have of fighting from the cover of the waggons i dont think the redskins would dare to attack you we have got a pack animal along with us as you see with our blankets and things we will hitch him to the tail of one of the waggons the man nodded i have got four teams here of my own he said and a spare man who cooks and so on for my outfit so you may as well jine in with that they air the last four waggons in the line the journey occupied six weeks they kept at first up the west fork of the trinity river crossing a patch of heavily timbered country then they struck the main fork of brazos river and followed it for some distance then took the track across to the rio pecos it led them by a toilsome journey across an elevated and arid country without wood or water save that which they obtained at the headwaters of the double mountain river and from four small streams which united lower down to form the north fork of the colorado river from this point until they reached the pecos a distance of over a hundred miles there was no water at ordinary times caravans would not have followed this route but would have kept far to the north but they would have been exposed to attacks by the comanches and utes so in spite of their strength they thought it prudent to follow the longer and safer route with a view to this journey across the desert each waggon carried an empty hogshead slung behind it these were filled at the last springs and the water doled out sparingly sufficed to enable the men and animals to subsist for the five days the journey occupied although the allowance was so small that the sufferings of the cattle were severe up to this time hugh and royce had succeeded almost daily in bringing a couple of stags into camp but game was scarce in this parched and arid region where not only water was wanting but grass was scanty in the extreme and the only sustenance for deer was the herbage of the scattered bushes they therefore rode with the caravan and aided it as far as they could the waggons which were of great size were generally drawn by twelve oxen or mules and in crossing the deep sand it was sometimes necessary to use the teams of two waggons to drag one over the sandhills sometimes even this failed to move them and the mounted men fastened their ropes to the spokes of the wheels and so helped to get the waggons out of the holes into which they had sunk i would rather run the risks of a fight with the indians hugh said to royce on the last day of their journey across the plain than have to perform this frightful journey the heat is simply awful and i feel as if i could drink a bucket of water you will get plenty of water tonight hugh the pecos is a good big river i believe the animals smell it already look how hard they are pulling the drivers crack their whips and shout as usual but the beasts are doing their best without that we have been very lucky that we have had no sandstorms or anything to delay us and confuse us as to the track waal we are over the worst of the journey now except the guadalupe pass there aint much trouble between the pecos and el paso once there we are on the rio grande all the way up to santa fe towards the afternoon the ground became harder and the animals quickened their pace almost to a trot straining at the ropes with heaving flanks while their tongues hanging out and their bloodshot eyes showed how they were suffering an hour before sunset a shout broke from the men as on ascending a slight rise the river lay before them the instant they reached its bank and the animals were loosed they rushed in a body into the stream and plunged their nostrils deeply into the water while the men ascending the banks a short distance lay down at the edge of the stream and satisfied their thirst five minutes later all had stripped and were enjoying a bath hugh had been much struck with the difference between the teamsters and the cowboys the former did not wear the chaperajos or leather overalls with fringed seams or the bright silk neck handkerchiefs or flatbrimmed hats of the cowboys their attire was sober rather than bright they wore soft hats with slouched brims and great cowhide boots there was none of that dashing reckless air that characterized the cowboys or the quick alertness that showed the readiness to cope with any emergency that might occur nor in the camp at night was there any trace of the lighthearted gaiety which showed itself in song laughter and dance in the gatherings round the cowboys fires they were for the most part silent and moody men as if the dull and monotonous labour in which they were engaged and the months of solitary journeying with nothing to break the silence save the cracking of the whips and the shouts of encouragement to the animals had left their mark upon them hugh and royce agreed cordially that with all its dangers and its unmeasured toil they would infinitely prefer the life of a cowboy short as it might be to that of a teamster even with the prospect of acquiring a competence upon which to settle down in old age two days halt was made on the banks of the pecos to rest the footsore animals then the journey was recommenced the river crossed at a shallow ford and its banks followed until after three days journey a small stream running in from the west was reached hence the route lay due west to el paso the country was flat until they reached the guadalupe range of hills which they crossed by a winding and difficult pass each waggon being taken up by three teams then skirting the alimos hills they crossed the sierra hueco by the pass of the same name which was far easier than that of guadalupe and then one long days march took them down to fort bliss which stands on the rio grande facing the town of el paso they had now arrived at the borders of civilization mexican villages and towns and united states posts were scattered thickly along the course of the river all the way from el paso up to santa fe what air you thinking of doing young fellow the head of the party asked hugh as they sat by the fire of the encampment a short distance out of el paso you see we shall kinder break up here i go with my teams to the forts along the river and then strike out east to the outlying posts about half my freight is ammunition and such like waal then pretty nigh half the waggons go up to the mines they have powder tools and machinery one or two stay here they bring hardware and store goods of all sorts for this town the rest go up to santa fe now what air you thinking of doing you can make up your mind to stay here or you kin go up to santa fe you told me you had a fancy for jinin some prospecting party and going out west into arizona i doubt whether you will find anyone much bent on that job at present seeing as how the injuns is stirring though i dont know that makes much difference seeing they is always agin anyone going into what they calls their country anyhow the miners will all have to work with a pick in one hand and a rifle in the other you have got the apaches here and they air wuss than the comanches the comanches have had to deal with western hunters and pioneers and know that there aint much to be got out of them but lead so beyond stealing cattle theyve got into the way of being mostly quiet though now and agin they break out just as they have at present now the apache has had to deal all along with mexicans and he has pretty good reason for thinking that he is a much better fighter than the white man he has been raiding on the mexican villages for hundreds of years burning and killing and carrying off their women and gals and i guess thar is a pretty good sprinkling of mexican blood in his veins though that dont make him better or wuss as far as i know still take them altogether they air the savagest and hardest tribe of redskins on this continent however if you like to go prospecting among thar hills and to run the risk of losing your scalp that is your business but if you do this is the place to start from and not santa fe there is gold pretty nigh everywhere in the valley of the gila and that lies a bit to the northwest from here at any rate it seems to me that this is the place that you are most likely to fall in with parties starting out but let me give you a warning lad you will find this town is pretty nigh full of goldminers and you wont find one of them who wont tell you that he knows of some place thats a sartin fortune up among the hills now dont you believe them dont you go and put your money into any job like that if you find a party being got up and others think it good enough to jine of course you can chip in but dont you go and find the money for the whole show there is no fear of that hugh laughed i had about fiveandtwenty pounds when i went on to the ranche and i have got that and six months pay in my belt that wont go far towards fitting out an expedition no it wont the teamster agreed it will be enough for you to be able to chip in with the others but as you say not to stand the whole racket waal what do you think i am very much obliged to you for your advice hugh said and i think we cant do better than stay about here for a bit at any rate what do you say royce it is all one to me royce replied but there is no doubt that el paso is as good a place as any if not better for looking round then that is settled bill and to tell you the truth i have had pretty nigh enough riding for the present and shant be sorry for a fortnights rest same here bill said i feel as if i was getting part of the horse and should like to get about on foot for a bit so as to feel that i hadnt quite lost the use of my legs accordingly the next morning they bade goodbye to their comrades of the last two months and mounting rode into el paso it was a town of some size and purely mexican in its features and appearance the inhabitants almost all belonged to that nationality but in the street were a considerable number of redshirted miners and teamsters hugh and his companions rode to one of the principal haciendas and handed over the three horses to a lounging mexican they have been fed this morning royce said we will come in and give them some corn in two hours i will see after prince hugh said patting his horses neck dont you be afraid that i am going to leave you to the care of strangers we have been together too long for that old boy they then went into the hotel and ordered a room and breakfast i dont care much for this mexican stuff with its oil and garlic royce said as they had finished the meal dont you i call it firstrate after living on fried beef and broiled beef for over a year it is a comfort to get hold of vegetables these beans were delicious and the coffee is a treat it isnt bad for one meal royce admitted reluctantly but youll get pretty sick of mexican cookery after a bit and long for a chunk of plain beef hot from the fire perhaps i shall hugh laughed but i think it will be some little time first now let us take a stroll round the town it was all new to hugh he had seen the mexican women in their native dress in the villages among the hills but here they indulged in much more finery than the peasant girls the poblanas were all dressed in gay colours with a scarf or rebozo over their heads with gold pins and ornaments in their glossy black hair and with earrings necklaces and generally bracelets of the same metal no small share of a peasants wealth is exhibited on the persons of his womankind they wore short skirts generally of red or green trimmed with rows of black braid while a snowwhite petticoat below and a white chemisette partly hidden by a gay handkerchief over the shoulders completed the costume they were almost all barefooted but hugh observed that their feet and ankles were exceedingly small and well formed as were their hands and plump brown arms here and there were a good many of the upper class half shrouded in black mantles wearing the spanish mantilla worn so as partly to conceal the face though it needed but the slightest movement to draw it aside when they wished to recognize anyone they met most of these were on their way to a church whose bell was pealing out a summons and carried their massbook in one hand and a fan in the other many a look of admiration was bestowed by the merry peasant girls upon hugh as he walked along he was now eighteen and had attained his full height and his life on horseback gave an easy and lissom appearance to his tall powerful figure his work among the cattle had given to his face something of the keen watchful expression that characterizes the cowboys but not to a sufficient extent to materially affect the frank pleasant look that was his chief characteristic his gray eyes and the lightbrown hair with the slight tinge of gold in it typical of the hardy northcountry race were very attractive to the darkskinned mexicans he and his companions had both donned their best attire before leaving camp and this differed but slightly from that of the mexican vaqueros and though sufficiently gay to attract general attention elsewhere passed unnoticed at el paso the western cowboy was not an unusual figure there for many of those discharged during the winter were in the habit of working down upon the new mexican ranches and taking temporary employment with the native cattleraisers by whom their services were much valued especially where the ranches were in the neighbourhood of those worked by white cowboys these in any disputes as to cattle with the mexican vaqueros were accustomed to carry matters with a high hand but the white cowboys in mexican service were just as ready to fight for their employers rights as were those on the american ranches and the herds were safe from depredation when under their charge there were many priests in the streets and numerous as they were they were always saluted with the deepest respect by the peasant women it is wonderful how much women think of their priests royce observed philosophically back east it used to make me pretty well sick when i was a young chap to hear them go on about their ministers but these mexican women go a lot farther there is nothing they wouldnt do for these fat padres no but they are not all fat royce hugh said i acknowledge they look for the most part plump and wellfed and upon the best of terms with themselves as well they may be seeing how much they are respected they have got a pretty easy life i reckon royce said contemptuously they have to say mass two or three times a day sit in a box listening to the womens confessions and fatten upon their gifts and offerings at any rate royce the people here are religious see there are as many peasants as peasant women going into that church whatever may be said about it religion goes for a good deal more in a catholic country than in a protestant it is a pity there is not more religion among the cowboys how are we to get it royce protested once or twice a year a minister may arrive at a camp and preach but that is about all we always give him a fair show and if any fellow wur to make a muss it would be worse for him i dont say as cowboys dont use pretty hard language among themselves but i will say this that if a minister or a woman comes to camp they will never hear a swear word if they stop there a week no sir cowboys know how to behave when they like and a woman might go through the ranches from end to end in texas without being insulted i know that royce the point is if they can go without using what you call swear words when a woman is among them why cant they always do so it is all very fine to talk hugh but when you get on a bucking broncho that sends you flying about ten yards through the air and you come down kerplump i never seed a man yet as would pick himself up and speak as if he wur in a church no sir its not in human nature when they got back to the hotel hugh observed that questioning glances were cast at them by several men who were lounging about the steps royce observed it also what have those fellows got in their heads i wonder he said do they reckon we are two bad bold men who have been holding up some mexican village or do they take us for horsethieves there is something wrong hugh you bet they certainly didnt look friendly royce though i am sure i dont know what it is about you havent been winking at any of their women have you gar long with yer royce laughed as if any of them would look at a little chap like me while i am walking along of you if there has been any winking its you as has done it i am quite innocent royce i assure you still there is something wrong well let us go and see that the horses are fed there were five or six men in the yard they were talking excitedly together when hugh and his companion came out of the hotel but they were at once silent and stood looking at them as they crossed the yard and went into the stable thars something wrong royce repeated if my horse wur as good as yours hugh i should say lets settle up quietly and ride out and make a bolt but they would overtake me in no time that would never do royce i dont know what their suspicions are but they would be confirmed if we were to try to escape and if they overtook us the chances are they wouldnt give us much time for explanations you are right there hugh the mexicans hates the whites they know that one of us can lick any three of them and it riles them pretty considerable they dont give a white man much show if they get their hands on him well it is no use worrying about it royce i suppose we shall hear sooner or later what it is all about passing through the hotel they took their seats at some tables placed in the shade in front of the house and there sat smoking and talking for some time if those fellows round the door keep on looking at us much longer royce said i shall get up and ask them what they mean dont do that royce it would only bring on a fight that is no use here waal royce said doggedly i havent got to sit here to be stared at and some of them fellows is going to get wiped out if they go on at it we are sure to hear before long royce see there is a knot of four or five fellows in uniform at the other end of the square i suppose that they are a sort of policemen i have seen them looking this way you will see they are going to arrest us presently and then i suppose we shall hear all about it i wish we had broncho harry and the rest of our outfit here royce said we would clear out the whole town half an hour later there was a clatter of horses hoofs and two gentlemen followed by half a dozen mexican vaqueros rode into the square and made straight for the hotel simultaneously the guardians of the peace moved across the square and there was a stir among the loungers at the entrance to the hotel the affair is coming to a crisis royce one of the mexicans was an elderly man the other a lad seventeen or eighteen years old the latter dismounted and entered the hotel in two minutes he reappeared and spoke to the other who also dismounted and after a word or two with one of the men belonging to the hotel and a short conversation with the leader of the party of civil guards advanced to the table at which hugh and royce were sitting he saluted them as they rose to their feet hugh returned the salutation senors he said courteously in very fair english you have i understand just arrived here having accompanied a waggontrain across the deserts from texas it is perfectly true senor hugh replied is there anything unusual in our doing so by no means the mexican said the matter that concerns me is that one of you is riding a horse which belonged to my son don estafan perales you mean the bay the mexican made a gesture of assent i purchased that horse at mkinney a small town in the northeast of texas may i ask who you purchased it from certainly senor it must have passed from the hands of your son before it was offered for sale to me i bought it from two men whom i had never seen before a little crowd had gathered behind the mexican and at this answer there were exclamations of a likely story that and death to the horsethieves two men in mining costume the one a tall powerfullybuilt man some fifty years old the other small and of slight figure with snowwhite hair who had just strolled up separated themselves from the rest and ranged themselves by hughs side the big man saying in mexican softly senores softly you aint neither judges nor jury on this case and me and my mate is going to see fairplay there is no intention senor of doing anything unfair the mexican said the matter is a simple one these strangers have just ridden in here with a horse belonging to my son he started from here with three servants and a party going to texas this was upwards of eighteen months ago he had business at new york his intention was to spend a few weeks in texas hunting then to proceed to the nearest railwaystation and take train to new york from the time he started we have never heard from him some members of the party he accompanied have long since returned it seems that he accompanied them until they had passed the bad lands and then left them to carry out his intention of hunting we have never heard of him since he certainly has never arrived at new york and now that these strangers arrive here with his horse which was recognized as soon as it entered the stables i have a right to inquire how they obtained it surely senor hugh said the men from whom i bought it were as i said strangers they were two very doubtfullooking characters and as they appeared very anxious to sell the horse and were willing to part with it considerably under its value my opinion was that undoubtedly they had not become possessed of it honestly my friend here was with me at the time and the only terms upon which i would purchase it and a packhorse they had also to sell were that they should give me a formal receipt signed in the presence of the sheriff and judge in order that should i at any time come across the owner of the animal i should be in a position to prove that i at least had come by it honestly that receipt i have here and taking a small leather lettercase from his pocket he produced the receipt there are the signatures senor and the official stamps of the writers and you will see that they testify also to their personal knowledge of me as a resident of the town i may add that it is certain that had i been an accomplice of the thieves i should have taken good care not to bring the horse to a locality where he would be at once recognized the mexican glanced through the paper that is perfectly satisfactory senor and i must apologize for having for a moment entertained suspicions of you explain this carlos he said to his son i would have further talk with these gentlemen the young mexican translated in his own language the effect of what had passed and the little crowd speedily dispersed several having walked away as soon as the two miners sided with the accused as a fray with four determined men armed with revolvers was not to be lightly entered upon the miners were also turning away when hugh said to the mexican excuse me a moment senor thank you greatly he went on turning to the miners for siding with us we are strangers here will you let us see you again and have a talk with you at present as you see this gentleman who has lost his son who has most probably been murdered by these horsethieves wants to question me do me the favour to come in this evening and drink a bottle of wine with us when we can again thank you for your aid there are no thanks due the bigger of the two men said me and my mate know nothing of the affair but seeing two of our own colour facing a lot of these mexikins we naturally ranged up alongside of you to see fairplay but as you are strangers and we have nothing particular to do i dont mind if we come in and have a talk this evening eh mate the little man nodded and the two walked off together hugh then turned to the mexican now senor we are at your service senors he said courteously my name is don ramon perales my hacienda lies three miles away this is scarcely a place for quiet conversation i am anxious to learn all particulars that you can give me as to the men from whom you bought the horse may i ask if you would mount your horses and ride back with me with pleasure senor hugh said our time is entirely our own and i can readily understand your anxiety to hear all you can about this matter illustration illustration chapter xvi a mining expedition in a few minutes hugh and royce remounted and joined the two two mexican gentlemen and set out with the party of vaqueros riding behind them you came in with quite a strong force don ramon hugh said smiling it might have been necessary the mexican replied i could not tell with whom i had to deal our guard do not care very much about risking their skins especially when it is a question of texan cowboys who have if you will excuse my saying so a terrible reputation and can use their pistols with a skill that is extraordinary i could not guess that i had to do with gentlemen there is nothing that way about me senor royce said abruptly i am a cowboy or a teamster or a miner or anything that comes to hand but nary a claim to be a gentleman my friend is a good fellow senor in every way hugh said and is my staunch and true friend i myself am an englishman who has come out to enjoy the hunting and the rough life of the plains of the west for a few years before settling down at home and now senor the mexican said with a bow will you let me begin to question you for i am full of anxiety as to my unfortunate son i feared before that he was lost to us i fear now even more than before for i am sure that he would never have parted with his horse which he had reared from a colt and was much attached to these men from whom you bought it were they known in that locality no hugh replied wherever they came from they did not belong to that corner of texas for neither the judge nor the sheriff had ever seen them before had they known that they were bad characters they would have arrested them and held them until an owner was found for the horse but as they knew nothing against them they did not feel justified in doing so will you describe them to me the mexican said they were men of between thirty and forty from their attire they might have been hunters they were dressed a good deal like your vaqueros they wore chaperajos with red sashes around their waist and flannel shirts they had jackets with silver buttons which you dont see much among our cowboys on the plains and broad soft felt hats i should say that one was a halfbreedthat is to say half mexican half american both had black moustaches and what i should call hangdog faces i have no doubt from your description don ramon said they were two men who joined the caravan a day or two before my son left it these men said they were hunters and i was told that my son engaged them to accompany him while he was hunting to act as guides and show him the best places for game they were described to me by some of the party that returned here and i feared at the time that if evil had befallen him it was through them now that you tell me they sold you his horse i feel but too certain this was so they seemed to have ridden fast and far their own horses and the bay were in fair condition senor but the packhorse was very poor the men were evidently in great haste to get away and i should judge from this that if as you fear they murdered your son and his three servants they probably did it at the last camping place before they arrived at mkinney had they done it when far out on the plains there would have been no good reason why they should have been in so much haste but if it had been but a short distance away they might have feared that someone might find the bodies and organize a pursuit at once why should they have delayed so long if their intention was murder the younger mexican asked that i cannot say don carlos they may have fallen in with other hunters after leaving the caravan and these may have kept with them all the time they were out on the plains and they may have had no opportunity of carrying out their designs till the party separated or again your brothers attendants might have been suspicious of them and may have kept up too vigilant a watch for them to venture on an attack before but this watch may have been relaxed when the journey was just at an end and it seemed to them that their fears were unfounded that is the most likely explanation don ramon said they were three picked men two of them were hunters the other my sons bodyservant it is likely enough that the hunters would have kept alternate watch at night had they suspected these fellows those two were to have remained in charge of the horses at the town where my son took rail and to await his return there the other man was to accompany him to new york my son had an ample supply of gold for his expenses and i fear it was that rather than the horse that attracted the scoundrels they were by this time approaching a large and handsome building standing in extensive grounds as they halted before it a number of peons ran out and took the horses prince had quickened his pace as he neared the house and had given a joyful neigh as of recognition when hugh alighted the horse as usual laid his muzzle on his shoulder to receive a caress before turning away and then without waiting for one of the peons to take his rein walked away towards the stables i see he is fond of you senor you have been a kind master to him i love horses hugh said and prince as i have called him has been my companion night and day for eighteen months we have hunted together and ropedin cattle and fought indians and divided out last crust together don ramon led the way into the house and then into a room where an elderly lady and two young ones were sitting they rose as he entered what news ramon the elderly lady asked such news as there is is bad maria these caballeros don hugh tunstall and he hesitated and looked at royce with whose name he was not acquainted bill royce without any don the cowboy put in the mexican repeated the namehave been good enough to ride over here with me in order that you as well as i might question them as to what they know of our son unhappily they know little we were not misinformed don hugh has indeed our sons horse but he bought it as he has proved to me from two strangers who tally exactly with the description we have received of the two hunters who left the caravan with our son i feared all along that these men were at the bottom of whatever might have befallen estafan i fear now that there is no doubt whatever about it caballeros this is my wife donna maria perales these are my two daughters dolores and nina for an hour hugh and his companion remained answering the questions of donna perales then hugh rose feeling that the ladies would be glad to be alone in their grief for the confirmation of their fears respecting don estafan had brought their loss back to them freshly don ramon and his son accompanied them to the door i pray you the former said that if at any time you come upon the villains you give them in custody i and my son will make the journey to appear against them however far it may be you need not trouble on that score royce said if we meet them i warrant you we can manage their business without any bother of judge or jury they will have a cowboy trial and after the evidence hugh and i can give you may be sure that a rope will very soon settle their affair i must ask you don ramon hugh said to lend me a horse back to the town and to send a vaquero with me to bring it back but why sir the mexican asked in surprise you have your own horse no senor prince is not mine he was your sons and is yours a man who buys stolen property is liable to lose it if he meets the proper owner and when i bought prince for half his value i knew that i was running that risk no senor englishman i do not say that a man who has lost his horse has not the right to reclaim it wherever he may find it that is if he happens to be in a place where the law is respected or if not if he happens to be with the strongest party but in the present case i could not think of depriving you of the horse it is evident that he has found a good master and that you stand in his affections just as my son did besides if you will pardon my saying so the horse is more to you than it is to me there are many thousands of horses running wild on my estates and although my son used to assert that there was not one which was equal to his horse there are numbers that are but little inferior for our horses are famous they are mustangs crossed with pure arab blood which my grandfather had selected and sent over to him regardless of cost pray therefore keep the bay may it carry you long and safely it will be a real pleasure to my wife and myself to know that poor estafans favourite horse is in such good hands i have also he said courteously to royce taken the liberty of ordering my peons to change the saddle of the horse you rode to one more worthy of being a companion to the bay it is of no use for one man to be well mounted if his comrade does not bestride a steed of similar swiftness hugh and royce warmly thanked don ramon for his kindness the horses were brought round and that of royce fully bore out the commendation of the mexican we hope to see you again tomorrow don ramon said as they mounted you will always be welcome guests here and you will not forget don carlos said in a low tone if you ever meet those men that has been a fortunate adventure royce said as they rode off i have often wondered whether we should ever fall upon the original owner of your horse and pictured to myself that we might have a bad time of it if we did it isnt everyone who would have accepted that receipt of yours as proof no i always felt that myself royce well that sorrel of yours is a splendid animal and really worthy to go with prince i often wished you had a mount as good as mine for my sake as well as your own for there is no doubt of the truth of what he said when two friends are riding together their pace is only that of the slowest horse that is so royce agreed so there is some arab blood in them i have often talked over the bay in the camps we all agreed we had never seen so good a mustang there are good mustangs but they are never a match for a really firstrate states horse and yet we could not see any signs of such a cross in prince he wur mustang but there seemed more whipcord and wire about him than a mustang has i have heard say that the mustangs are the descendants of spanish barbs and that the barbs were moorish horses yes that is so royce the barb is related to the arab but is not i believe of such pure blood it is a coarser animal and if don ramons grandfather brought over some pure arabs of firstrate strain they would no doubt greatly improve the mustangs waal hugh if we ever do meet those two murdering villains i reckon their chances of getting away from us aint worth mentioning the reception on their return to the hotel was very different to that they had before experienced they had been visitors at don ramons hacienda and don ramon was the richest proprietor in the district of el paso after they had finished supper that evening and were enjoying coffee and cigars at a table placed with others in a garden behind the hotel the two miners who had stood by them in the morning came up and took seats beside them you had a pretty rough welcome this morning at el paso the big man said but by the way i do not know what to call you my own name is sim i am generally known as surly sim my friends name is frank i generally call him the doctor my name is bill royce said and out on the plain the boys call me stumpy which dont need any explanation my mates name is hugh and he has got the name of lightning ah and why is that may i ask the whitehaired little man said well it is because of one of his accomplishments doctor he has got the knack of drawing a pistol that sharp that almost before you see his hand move you are looking down the tube of a pistol a very useful accomplishment the little man remarked always supposing that it is not used too often and that it is only used in selfdefence i am a peaceful man myself he went on and have a horror of the use of firearms his companion laughed now you know that that is so sim the little man said earnestly waal doctor i dont go for to say that you are quarrelsome and ef anyone said so in my hearing i should tell him he wur a liar but for a peaceable man doctor and i dont deny as you are peaceable i dont know as thar is a man in the mining regions who has used his weapon oftener than you have but always on the side of peace sim the little man said earnestly please to remember always on the side of peace yes in the same way that a new york policeman uses his club doctor well i can assure you i dont often use what you call my accomplishment hugh said i practise it so that i may be able to defend my life if i am attacked but except in a fight with a band of comanches i have only once had occasion to draw my pistol and he weakened sim asked yes i had the drop of him there was nothing else for him to do and what are you doing at el paso you are too abrupt sim much too abrupt the little man said deprecatingly not at all doctor if it is anything they dont want to tell they wont tell it if it isnt we may be useful to them we have no particular object in view hugh said i am an englishman but not a rich englishman who comes out to buy ranches or to speculate in mines but i have come rather to pass three or four years in seeing life on the western plains than to make money i worked for six months in mkinney had three or four months hunting and then worked six months as a cowboy and i thought that for a change i should like to come this way and see something of mining adventure in new mexico or arizona my mate here has been with me for nearly two years and has thrown in his fortune with mine there is adventure enough and more than enough in mining down thar in arizona the doctor and i have been at it for some years we havent made a penny but we have saved our scalps so we may be considered lucky i was told hugh went on that el paso was the most central place to come to my idea was that i might find some party setting out on a prospecting expedition and that i might be able to join it it aint a good time for prospecting expeditions sim said even on the upper gila the mining camps is all on guard knowing that any day the apaches may be down on them and it would want a man to be wonderful fond of gold for him to go out prospecting down in arizona i dont care much for gold hugh laughed though i dont say i should object to take my share if we hit on a rich lode i should go for the sake of the excitement and to see the life well at other times you might find any number of people here in el paso who would be glad enough to take you out on such an expedition the doctor said you ask the first man you meet mexican or white and he will tell you that he knows of a mine and will take you to it if you will fit out an expedition you are exceptions to the rule doctor no i dont say that the doctor replied though his companion gave a growling protest oh yes we know of a mine he went on not heeding the growl at least we believe we do which is i suppose as much as anybody can say but we are like the rest we say that it is better to stay at el paso and keep our scalps on even if we are poor than to go and throw away our lives in looking for a mine we have been out working for the last six months on a mine in the gila valley on shares with six others we werent doing so badly but the mexicans who were working for us got scared and wouldnt stay so we have given it up and come down here some day or other when things settle down again i suppose the mine will be worked but it wont be by us we are looking out for someone who will buy our shares but i dont suppose anyone will give five dollars for them and they would be right the thing paid in our hands but it wouldnt pay in mexicans they are poor shiftless creatures and have no idea of hard work we should have given it up anyhow even without these indian troubles which dont make much difference for the apaches are always ready to come down when they see a chance it is always war between them and the whites but we were there six months and six months are about the outside sim and i ever stop anywhere when you go prospecting do you often get any hints from the indians as to where gold is to be found never sim howlett said the injuns are too lazy to work theirselves and they know that when the whites get hold of gold they pour down in numbers i believe they do know often where there are lodes i dont see how they can be off knowing it for a redskin is always keeping his eyes on the move nothing escapes him and it would be strange if wandering about as they do and knowing every foot of their country they didnt notice gold when it is there to see besides they have got tales handed down from father to son in old times they had gold ornaments and such like but you never see them now they know well enough that such things would draw the whites sometimes a redskin will tell a white who has done him some great service where there is a lode gold or silver or copper but it dont happen often besides most times the place lies right in the heart of their country and for all the good it is it might as well be in the middle of the sea of course if it was gold and the metal was found in nuggets and a horseload or two could be got in a month it might be done but not when it comes to settling there and sinking shafts and mining that cant be done until the apaches are wiped out but are there such places as that sim waal there may be but i have never seen them the doctor and me have struck it rich many a time but not as rich as that still i reckon there are places where the first comer might gather a big pile if the redskins would but let him alone for a month i suppose you are absent some time on one of these expeditions do prospectors generally go on foot or horseback they in general takes a critter a piece and two others to carry grub and a pick and shovel sometimes they go two together but more often one goes by hisself in course where two men knows each other and can trust each other two is kind of handier than one we shouldnt like to work alone should we doc but then you see we have been twelve years together sometimes a man finds his own outfit sometimes he goes to a trader in a town and if he is known to be a good miner and a straight man the storekeeper will give him a sack of flour and a side of bacon and such other things as are required and then they go partners in what is found sometimes this goes on for months sometimes for years sometimes the trader loses his money sometimes he makes a fortune you see there are plenty of places as aint in what you may call the indian country but somehow or other it do seem as if the redskins had just been put down where the best places is so as to prevent the gold being dug in arizona some big finds have been made but nobodys any the richer for them the redskins is always on the lookout often an exploring party never comes back sometimes one or two come back with the news that the others have all been wiped out but what with the awful country and the want of water and the sartainty of having to fight and of sooner or later being surprised and scalped there aint many men as cares about following the thing up i suppose you know of such places sim waal maybe we do the miner said cautiously maybe we do eh doctor the little man did not reply but sat looking searchingly at hugh when he did speak it was not in direct answer to the question i like your face young fellow he said it reminds me of one i have seen somewhere though i cant say where you look to me as if you were downright honest i hope i am hugh said with a laugh you may bet your boots on that bill royce said he is as straight a man as you will find in texas and you are out here the other went on part for pleasure part just to see life and part i suppose to make money if you see a chance i have never thought much of making money hugh replied although i should certainly have no objection if i saw a chance but i have never thought of doing more than keeping myself and he has been with you you say nigh two years and he nodded at royce and you can speak for him as he does for you that i can hugh said warmly we have worked together and hunted together we have been mates in the same outfit and we have fought the comanches together and i can answer for him as for myself he gave up his work and went with me not because there was any chance of making more money that way than any other but because we liked each other well sim the little man said it seems to me that these two would make good mates for that job of ours waal doctor you know i leave these things to you i kinder feels that way myself towards them and anyhow i dont see as there cant be no harm in setting it afore them seeing as there aint no need to give them the indications but i reckon there is too many about here to talk on a matter like that waal it comes to this he went on turning to hugh if you air disposed to make a jint expedition with us and aint afeard neither of roughing it nor of redskins you meet us tomorrow three miles outside the town on the south road and we will talk to you straight that is just what would suit me hugh said and you royce it is all the same to me lightning if you are for an expedition you know you can count me in good night then sim howlett said rising we have sat here quite long enough talking together if we mean to do anything i reckon there is a score of these mexikins have been saying to themselves afore now what can those two miners and them cowboys be atalking together about and when a mexikin begins to wonder he begins to try and find out so we are off three miles out on the south road at nine oclock tomorrow morning about half a mile past a village you will see a stone cross by the road there is a path turns off by it you follow that and you will come across us afore you have gone two hundred yards what do you think of it royce hugh asked when they were alone dont think nothing of it one way or the other most of them miners have got some tale or other however they seem to me straight men i feel sure they are hugh said the big one looks an honest fellow i dont so much understand the little one but evidently he is the head of the party he is a curious little fellow with his white hair and gentle voice he doesnt look strong enough for such a life as they lead but i suppose he is able to do his share or they would never have been working twelve years together at any rate i came here to see something of life among the mines and this seems as good a chance as we are likely to have the next morning they breakfasted at seven and at halfpast eight saddled their horses and rode out they found their two companions of the previous night at the appointed place as the miners saw them approaching they turned off the path and preceded them to a mexican hut and there waited for them to come up good morning the doctor said as they dismounted there is no fear of our being overheard here the mexican who lives here has often been up with us among the hills and started for the town a quarter of an hour ago when we told him we had a rendezvous here now if you will hitch your horses up and sit down on these maize stalks we can talk comfortably a year ago when sim and i were working in a gulch among the mountains we heard a call in the distance we went to see what it was and found a man who had dropped down just worn out and famished after he had given the cry that fetched us he had been shot in four or five places and we saw at once that his journey was nearly over we carried him to our fire and brought him round and did all we could for him for three weeks then he died he told us he had been one of a party of six who had been prospecting in the hills west of the lower gila one of them had learned from an indian he had helped in some way of a place where the bed of a stream was full of gold they found it but the next morning they were attacked by the apaches who had i expect been following them all the time two of them were killed at once the others got upon their horses and rode for it three of them were shot down but this man was well mounted and got off though they chased him for three days he lost his way his horse fell dead but he struggled on until he saw the smoke of our fire and made us out to be whites before he died he told us how the place could be found he said there was no doubt about the gold and he had three or four nuggets in his pockets weighing two or three pounds each he said he had had lots of bigger ones but had chucked them all away to lighten his horse well it is a long journey it will take us all a month i reckon to get there we cannot go straightthe apaches would have us to a certaintybut must go north into the moquis country and then down again from that side we have been minded to try it ever since but luck has been bad with us and besides two men wouldnt be enough for such a journey it aint every one sim and i would care about going with but we have both taken a fancy to you we saw you stand up straight before that crowd of mexicans besides we know it wants good grit for that cowboy life now this is the offer we make we have got two horses and we can buy two packhorses but we cant go further than that you have got two outandout horses we saw you ride in yesterday afternoon you will want another packhorse and you will have to provide the outfit say two bags of flour two sides of bacon ten pounds of tea and a couple of gallons of spirits then there will be sugar and some other things we shall also want a small tent now if you like to join us on these terms you can there is plenty of gold for us all but mind you it will be no childs play the journey from the moquis country there will be terrible and there is the chance and a pretty big chance it is i tell you of a fight with the redskins we may never find the place we have got pretty good indications but it is not an easy matter to find a place among those mountains still there it is if you get there and back you will each have a horseload of gold if you dont you will leave your bones there what do you say to it hugh looked at royce i reckon we kin take our chances if you kin the latter said at any rate mates you will find as we can take our share in whatever comes then that is agreed the doctor said now about preparations it will never do for you to be buying the things here for if we were seen to start off together we should be followed sure enough it would be guessed at once we had told you of something good we must not be seen together again we will get our packhorses and load up and go as if we were undertaking a job on our own account and camp up somewhere twenty miles away and stop there a week after we have gone you can get your outfit and move off and join us sim and i have been talking over whether it will be a good thing to take josethat is the man herewith us instead of buying baggage horses he has got four beasts he could ride one himself and the other three with the one you have would make up the number jose can be trusted besides we should not tell him where we were going but we should have to say it would be a long journey and a dangerous one he is a widower with one child and these horses are his only possession and i think he would want their value put down before he started say seventyfive dollars apiece for them and their saddles that is three hundred dollars you wouldnt buy them for less so as far as money goes it would come to the same thing you will get it back again if jose and the animals come back but if we all do come back three hundred dollars would be nothing one way or the other then comes the point would it be worth while to take him there would be one more mouth to feed but that does not go for much there would be one more rifle in case we had to fight and jose has plenty of courage i have seen him in a fix before now he would look after the beasts and leave our hands free and his pay would cost us nothing for if we got there he would help us gather and wash the gold what is the drawback then hugh asked the drawback is that if we have to ride for it he might hinder us there aint much in that doc sim howlett put in our horses are pretty good though they aint much to look at but the horses our mates here have got would leave them standing and i dont know that joses best is much slower than ours besides when you are working among those mountains speed goes for nothing a horse accustomed to them would pick his way among the rocks fastern a racehorse ef we are attacked there running wont be much good to us ef we get fairly out from the hills with the gold and the paches are on our trail why we then must trust to cunning and our mates here can ride clear away we shant do that sim hugh said if we throw in our lot with you we shall share it to the end whatever it is waal that is all right lad but there are times when stopping to fight is just throwing away your life without doing no good the doctor here and me aint men to desart mates but when a time comes where it aint no sort of good in the world to fight and when those mates must get rubbed out whether you stick by them or not then it is downright onreasonable for anyone as can get clear off to throw away his life foolish well anyhow sim hugh said it seems to me that it will be best to take jose and his horses with us it will as you say leave our hands free and it will make the journey much more pleasant and will add one to our strength well that would cost you say three hundred dollars how much will the rest of the outfit cost three hundred at the outside the doctor said we have been reckoning it up of course we have all got kits and its only grub and ammunition we have got to buy and two or three more shovels and some pans for washing the sand and another pick or two and a couple of crowbars three hundred dollars will get as much grub as the four packhorses will carry and make a good proper outfit for us will your money run to that hardly hugh said thats just about what we have got between us we had each six months pay to draw when we left the ranche and i had some before i think we are about twenty dollars short of the six hundred that is plenty the doctor said if you put in four hundred sim and i can chip in another two hundred as we shant have to buy packhorses so we have plenty between us we shall see jose tonight and talk it over with him and if he agrees he will come to you and bring a document for you to sign saying that if he does not return in six months the three hundred dollars are to be paid over for the use of his child then he will go with you to a priest and put the paper and the money in his hands then you can hand him over your packhorse he will take charge of it then if you will give us a hundred dollars we engage to get the outfit all provided when it is all done we will let you know what day you are to meet us and where you see we are asking you to trust us right through that is all right hugh said we are trusting you with our lives and the dollars dont go for much in comparison that is so sim howlett said waal there is nothing more to say now you had best ride back to the town and give yourself no more trouble about it you will hear from us in a few days or it maybe a week we shall buy half the things and send them on by jose and then get the others and follow ourselves it would set them talking here if we was to start with four loads there is some pretty bad men about this place you bet well we shant have much for them to plunder us of hugh said four laden horses wouldnt be a bad haul but it aint that i am afraid of if there wur a suspicion as we was going out to work a rich thing there is plenty of men here would get up a party to track us and fall on us either there or on our way back there are two or three bands of brigands upon the mountains and they are getting worse there have been several haciendas burned and their people killed not many miles from el paso parties have been got up several times to hunt them down but they never find them and there is people here as believe that the officers of the guarda are in their pay they have come across us more than once when we have been prospecting but they dont interfere with men like us because firstly we havent got anything worth taking anyway nothing worth risking half a dozen lives to get and in the next place ef it got known they had touched any of our lot the miners would all join and hunt them down and they know right enough that would be a different thing altogether to having to deal with the mexikins five minutes later hugh and royce were on their way back to el paso illustration illustration chapter xvii carried off the next morning in accordance with the promise they had given don ramon hugh rode out to the hacienda royce saying that they were too great swells for him and he would rather stop quietly at el paso besides he said most likely jose will come this morning and i will stop and fix up that business with him hugh did not try to dissuade him for he had seen that royce was ill at ease on the occasion of his first visit on reaching the hacienda he received a hearty welcome from don ramon and his family and don carlos rode with him over a part of the estate where a large number of peons were engaged in the cultivation of tobacco maize and other grain if you have time senor hugh you must go with me to see our other estates our principal one lies twenty leagues to the south we have five hundred square miles of land there and big herds of cattle and droves of horses but i suppose you have seen enough cattle yes there is no novelty about that hugh replied how many have you there and in other places we have somewhere about head as to the horses we dont know they are quite wild and we drive them in and catch them as they are wanted we have about a score of our best here but these are the only animals we keep here except bullocks for the plough and the teams to take the crops down to market i hear you have been rather troubled with brigands lately have you any fear of them the scoundrels the young man exclaimed passionately it is a disgrace that they are not hunted down yes they have been very daring lately and my father and several of the other hacienderos have written lately to the authorities of santa fe complaining of the inactivity of the police here i have tried to persuade my father to move down to our house at el paso until the bands have been destroyed but he laughs at the idea of danger we have twenty armed peons sleeping in the outhouses and twelve male servants in the house and indeed there is little chance of their attacking us still one cannot but feel uncomfortable with ladies here there are a hundred troops or so stationed in the fort on the other side of the river and they have joined two or three times in the search for the brigands but of course they are too far off to be any protection to us here besides they are not of much use among the mountains the officer in command is fonder of good wine than he is of the saddle it is a difficult thing to rout out these brigands half the peasantry are in alliance with them and they get information of everything that is going on and even if we knew of their hidingplaces there would be little chance of our taking them by surprise however sooner or later i suppose we shall have them there is a large reward offered for their capture someone is sure to prove traitor at last it is always the way with these bands someone thinks himself illused in the division of the booty or takes offence with the leaders or something of that sort or is tempted by the reward and then we get them all if it wasnt for treachery the country would soon become uninhabitable his host would not hear of hugh returning that evening to el paso but sent a peon in to tell royce that he would not return until next day hugh spent a delightful evening the young ladies played on the mandoline and sang with their brother the soft light the luxurious appointments and the ripple of female talk were strange and delightful after so long a time among rough surroundings and it was with great reluctance that he mounted his horse and rode back on the following morning he found on arrival that his comrade had arranged the matter with jose and had deposited the money with the priest as he was standing chatting to him at the door of the hotel a ragged mexican boy ran up placed a scrap of paper in hughs hand and at once darted away it is from the doctor hugh said opening it and then read as follows i have something particular to say to you it must be private when you have received this stroll quietly through the town as if you were only looking at the shops go down to the river and follow it up till you hear three whistles then come to them you had better come alone the doctor i wonder what the little man has got to say royce dunno the other said i suppose you had better go and see you have got your sixshooter anyhow hugh obeyed his instructions and walked along the river bank till he heard the whistles they came from a small clump of bushes standing apart from any others as he approached it he heard the doctors voice look round and see if there is anyone in sight no one that i can see hugh replied then come in hugh pushed his way through the bushes why what is the matter doctor he asked surprised at all these precautions i will tell you sit down there it is just as we fancied it might be i told you that we might be watched these confounded mexicans have nothing to do but watch and they have found out what we are after how did you learn that doctor well the doctor said reluctantly my mate has but one fault he will sometimes go in for a drink its not often but just occasionally once perhaps every few months it has always been so ever since i have known him well last night it came over him he thought it would be a long while before he would have a chance again i suppose he is not quarrelsome when he drinks but you may be sure i always go with him so as to take care of him so yesterday evening seeing that he had made up his mind for it and was not to be turned i went with him to a little wineshop near where we lodge there were halfadozen mexicans in there drinking and talking and as they stopt talking directly we went in i saw we were not wanted but i noticed more than that i saw two of them glance at each other and though i could not recollect i had ever set eyes on them before i saw they knew us we hadnt any money on us beyond what was wanted to pay for the liquor so though i didnt like the look of them i was not uneasy we sat down and called for some liquor and i managed to say to sim these chaps know us sim dont you go drinking he nodded we drank for a bit at least he did i dont touch spirits then talking carelessly out loud we in whispered asides made out a plan we agreed that we should quarrel and i should go out and that he should seem to go on drinking until he got drunk and stupid and then like enough he might hear something so we carried that out as soon as he had drunk his glass he called for another and then another i got up a row with him and told him he was always making a beast of himself he said he would drink if he chose and wouldnt be interfered with by any one then i got nasty and we had a big row and i went out then sim went on drinking he can stand a lot more than would floor most mexicans they got into talk with him and he could see they were trying to pump him as to what we were going to do but you bet he didnt let much out then he got gradually stupid and at last rolled off the seat on to the ground for a bit the mexicans went on talking together and then one of them crept over and felt his pockets and took the few dollars he had in them out that convinced them he was dead off to sleep and they went on talking what he gathered was this the fellows were the spies of one of these bands they had noticed you particularly when you came in because it seems their captain was in the town and recognized your horse and told them he didnt like your being here and they were to watch you sharp they were in the crowd when there was the row about the horse and they saw us having our talk with you they followed you out to the dons and back again and when you rode out in the morning to meet us they sent a boy after you and he kept you in sight and tracked you up to the hut and then crawled up close and overheard what we were saying they sent off word at once to their chief and we are to be followed by two men when they have traced us to the place one is to ride back to some place where a dozen of them will be waiting to attack us on our way back that is bad hugh said what is to be done this has got to be put a stop to the doctor said calmly though i dont see how yet at any rate sim and i think we had better not hurry a few days wont make any difference and something may occur he picked up from their talk that the villains had something else in hand just at present some stroke from which they expect to make a lot of money but they talked low and he couldnt catch much of what they said maybe it will go wrong and the country may be roused and hunt them down and if so you bet we will be in it we have got chances enough to take in this job as it is and we dont want to reckon on brigands not that there is much fear of them now that we know their plans we have only got to ambush the men they send after us still we aint going to take any chances the fellows may follow direct they are sure to choose some one who knows the mountains well and they may judge by our direction the course we are taking and go by other paths they would know pretty well we are not the sort of people to fool with still it is better to wait a little while and see if there is a chance of putting a stop to it here it is not that we are feared of the skunks if we could not throw them off our trail we could fight them anyway but one dont want to have them on ones mind we have got plenty of things to think about without them o yes i think it much better to stay here for a bit doctor there is no hurry about a start on our expedition and i should certainly like to take a share in routing out these bandits especially as from what you say it seems that the men at their head are the fellows who murdered don ramon perales son and sold me his horse i wonder which hacienda it is that they are meaning to attack yes it is a pity sim didnt manage to find that out we would have caught them then have you any idea how strong the band is they are not often over twenty the doctor replied twenty is enough for their work and if there were more the shares of the plunder would be too small but as i said they have got friends everywhere and could probably gather thirty or forty more if they knew the troops were going to attack them a mexican is always ready on principle to join in if there is a chance of getting a shot at an american soldier i suppose you have not the least idea in what direction these fellows have their headquarters well i have some sort of an idea at any rate i know of one place where there is a party who dont care about being interfered with by strangers two or three months ago when sim and i were away about forty miles over to the northwest we were in a village just at the mouth of a bit of a valley and the girl who waited on us at the little wineshop whispered in my ear when the landlords back was turned dont go up the valley well we were not thinking of going up the valley which was only a sort of gulch leading nowhere but after that we thought that we would have a look at it we took a goodish round so as to get above it and looked down and we saw a house lying among some trees and lower down near the mouth of the valley made out two men sitting among some rocks on the shoulder the sun shone on their gun barrels but that didnt go for much for the mexicans out in the country pretty well always go armed we watched them for a couple of hours and as they didnt stir we concluded they were sentries the girl wouldnt have given us that warning unless there had been something wrong and i expect that house was the headquarters of one of these gangs what made her do it i wonder doctor that i cant say lightning it is never easy to say why a woman does a thing she may have thought it a pity that sim and i should get our throats cut though i own that wouldnt be a thing likely to trouble a mexican girl then she may have had a grudge against them perhaps they had shot some lover of hers or one of them may have jilted her anyhow there it was and if we hear of any attack of brigands upon a hacienda we will try that place before going any further and now lad you had better be going back i shall lie here quiet for an hour or two in case there should be anyone watching you as is likely enough hugh returned to the hotel and told royce what he had heard that will suit me bill said i am death on border ruffians and if ever i see two of them it wur them fellows as sold you the horse at mkinney and so its their intention to follow us and wipe us out and get our swag waal maybe it will be the other way if i was you lightning i would ride over to don ramons this evening and give him a hint to be on his guard there is no reason why it should be his place they have got in their mind more than any other but the fact that they stole the sons horse to say nothing of killing him might turn their thoughts that way if you do a fellow one injury i reckon that like as not you will do him another i dont know why it is so but i reckons its human nature i will ride over at once hugh said i wouldnt do that hugh you dont know who may have been watching you and if it is known that you had been meeting the doctor quiet and the doctor is a mate of sims and sim was in that wineshop they will be putting things together and if you ride straight over to don ramon now they will think it is because of something the doctor has been saying to you then if it should chance as that is the place they are thinking of it air long odds that sim and the doctor get a knife atween their shoulders afore bedtime you go quietly off in the cool of the evening just jogging along as if you was going to pay a visit of no particular account they aint got no interest in us except as to this expedition to find gold and they wont concarn themselves in your movements as long as i am here at the hotel and the others aint getting ready to make a start they have learned all they want to learn about our going just as the sun was setting hugh set out it was dark when he reached don ramons hacienda after chatting awhile with don ramon his wife and sonthe two girls their father said being somewhere out in the gardenhugh said quietly to the mexican that he wanted to speak to him for a moment in private don ramon lighted a fresh cigarette and then said carelessly it is a lovely evening we may as well stroll outside and find the girls i dont suppose they know that you are here don carlos followed them into the broad verandah outside the house your son can hear what i have to say hugh said in reply to an inquiring look from don ramon and then reported the conversation that sim had overheard father and son were both much excited at the statement that the horse had been recognized then poor estafans murderers are somewhere in this neighbourhood the don exclaimed that is the part of the story that interests me most senor as to attacking my hacienda i dont believe they would venture upon it they must know that they would meet with a stout resistance and el paso is but three miles away daring as they are they would scarcely venture on such an undertaking but i will of course take every precaution i will order four men to be on guard at night bid the others sleep with their arms ready at hand and see that the shutters and doors are barred at night but the other matter touches us nearly if estafans murderers are in the province we will hunt them down if i have to arm all the vaqueros and peons and have a regular campaign against them you were quite right not to mention this before my wife she and my daughters had better know nothing about it by the way i wonder where the girls are they are not generally as late as this i suppose the evening has tempted them it is full moon tomorrow he raised his voice and called the girls there was no reply carlos do you go and look for them and tell them from me to come up to the house and now senor we will have a cup of coffee in a quarter of an hour carlos returned i cannot find them father i have been all round the garden calling them don ramon rose from his seat and struck a bell on the table they must have gone up to their rooms he said without coming in here when the servant appeared he said rosita go up to the senoritas room and tell them that don hugh tunstall is here they are not there senor i have just come down from their rooms what can have become of them carlos don ramon said i have no idea father they had lion with them he was asleep here when they called him from outside and i saw him get up and dash through the open window i cant understand it the don said anxiously for the evening is cold besides they would scarcely go outside the garden after nightfall they might be down at chaquitas cottage father oh yes i didnt think of that carlos don ramon said yes they are often down at their old nurses rosita tell juan to go down to chaquitas cottage and beg the young ladies to return as i want them in ten minutes the servant came back they are not there senor they left there just as it was getting dark surely there is nothing to be uneasy about ramon his wife said the girls are often out as late as this on a moonlight evening they are sure to be about the garden somewhere but carlos has been round don ramon said well we will go and have another look for them followed by the two young men he stepped out on to the verandah carlos he said go round to the mens quarters and tell them your sisters are missing and that they are all to turn out and search i dont like this he said to hugh after his son had left i should have thought nothing of it at any other time but after what you have just been telling me i feel nervous now let us go round the garden illustration discovering the body of the bloodhound they traversed all the walks don ramon repeatedly calling the girls names they were joined in their search by don carlos and a number of the men they are certainly not in the garden don ramon said at last now let us go down towards chaquitas cottage they may either have followed the road on their way back or have come along a bypath to the garden we will go by the path and return the other way the path lay through a shrubbery just as they entered it a man met them running well what is it juan don ramon asked as he came up and he could see his face by the light of the torches some of the men were carrying i dont know senor but we have just come upon some fresh blood on the path with a cry of alarm don ramon ran forward with his son and hugh fifty yards farther they saw two of the men standing with torches in the middle of the path here is blood senor one of them said we passed it without noticing it on our way to the cottage we were not examining the ground but on our way back the light of the torches fell upon it don ramon stood staring in speechless horror at a large patch of blood on the path there has been a struggle here hugh said examining the ground see there are marks of large feet some of them have trod in the blood see don carlos and he pointed to a line of blood drops leading to one of the bushes search hugh the young man groaned i dare not hugh motioned one of the men with a torch to follow him the father and son stood gazing after them as they entered the bushes a moment later hugh called out it is the dog senors there is nothing else an exclamation of joy broke from the two mexicans they were at least relieved of the overpowering dread that had seized them at the sight of the blood and at once joined hugh the dog a fine cuban bloodhound was lying dead stabbed in a dozen places what can it mean father don carlos said in a low voice i can hardly think the mexican said passing his hand across his forehead i am afraid senor it is too evident hugh put in this is the explanation of what my friend heard the brigands did not intend to attack the hacienda they have carried off your daughters and the hound has died in their defence that must be it don ramon exclaimed in the deepest anguish oh my poor girls how can it have happened i expect they were in hiding here hugh said and sprang up suddenly and seized and gagged the senoritas before they had time to scream the hound doubtless sprang upon them and as you see they killed it with their knives what is to be done don ramon asked hopelessly the first thing is to follow the path down to the road hugh said probably they had horses somewhere will you tell the men to go along cautiously with their torches near the ground don carlos gave the order in mexican one of the party who was the chief hunter at the hacienda went a little ahead of the others with a torch he stopped a short distance before he reached the junction of the path with the road which they could see ahead of them in the moonlight here are fresh marks of horses hoofs he said see and he held the torch above his head and pointed to the bushes twigs have been broken and there are fresh leaves upon the ground the horses must have been hidden here do not move until i examine down to the road he went forward alone and returned in two or three minutes there are faint tracks from the road to this point they came along at a walk there are deep ones down to the road and along it they went off at a gallop there were six of them what is to be done senor don ramon said to hugh my brain seems on fire and i cannot think i should imagine your daughters can be in no immediate danger senor hugh said quietly the brigands have doubtless carried them off in order to wring a heavy ransom from you they must have got two hours start and i fear pursuit would be useless tonight though i would send three of the men accustomed to tracking on at once to follow their traces and to learn the direction they have taken after leaving here of course it will be for you to decide whether you will go down to the town and see the alcalde and obtain a posse of men to join your vaqueros in a search for them and then to cross the river to the fort and get the help of the troops and scour the whole country or whether you will wait until you hear as you doubtless will from the brigands let us go back to the house don ramon replied we must think it over we must not do anything rash or we might endanger their lives the news had reached the house before they arrived there donna maria was completely prostrated with grief the women were crying and wringing their hands and the wildest confusion prevailed don ramon had by this time recovered himself and sternly ordered silence he then proceeded to the room where his wife had been carried and endeavoured to assure her that there was little fear for their daughters lives for the brigands could have no purpose in injuring them and had only carried them off for the purpose of exacting a ransom what do you really think had best be done my friend don carlos asked hugh when they were alone together of course whatever ransom these villains ask must be paid although i have no doubt it will be something enormous but it is terrible to think of the girls being even for an hour in their hands especially when we feel sure that these men are the murderers of my brother i should say hugh replied that whatever they demand must be paid it will not do to risk the senoritas lives by doing anything as long as they are in their hands but i should advise that the moment they are free we should fall upon these scoundrels and exterminate them and recover the ransom i think that i have a clue to the place where they are likely to be taken one of my miner friends was speaking to me of a place that would be likely to be used for such a purpose he could lead a party there but it would never do to attempt it while the ladies are in their hands you may be sure that a careful watch will be kept and at the first alarm the villains might murder them we will hear what your father says when he returns and if he thinks as i do that we can attempt nothing until he receives some communication from the brigands i will ride back to el paso and consult my friends there don ramon on his return said that he was strongly of opinion that it would risk the girls lives were any movement made until he heard of them as he could be of no utility hugh rode over to el paso don carlos saying that he would let him know the instant they received any communication from the brigands but that he should anyhow see him in the morning as he should ride over with his father to report the matter to the authorities it was past ten oclock when hugh reached the hotel it happened to be a festa and the square was full of people and the cafes and wineshops open royce was in the barroom of the hotel royce do you know where sim and the doctor are likely to be found i saw them sitting in front of the wineshop in the corner of the square not more than ten minutes ago come along with me then bill but i thought we werent to be seen with them royce said there can be no reason against it now hugh replied they have learned all they wanted to learn about it and know that we are going together at any rate our meeting would seem to be accidental is anything up hugh royce asked as they made their way through the crowd in the square you look troubled i will tell you directly bill there they are they are still at the same table hugh there were two empty chairs at the table hugh nodded carelessly to the doctor and sim and sat down beside them after what you told me this morning doctor there can be no harm in our being seen together i want to talk to you badly there are too many people about here do you mind both coming down to the river we can talk as we go directly they were out of the square he told the three men what had happened carried off those two young ladies royce exclaimed by thunder that is too bad what is to be done boys let us wait until we know all about it sim replied while the doctor said in his quiet way this has really got to be put a stop to let us wait until we are down by the river we must hear all this quietly lightning four men cant talk as they walk they soon gained a quiet spot away from the houses now tell us how it came about the doctor said and while we are talking each of you keep his eyes and ears open we have behaved like fools once and let ourselves be overheard we wont do it again hugh told the whole story of the girls abduction and stated the determination arrived at by don ramon not to attempt a pursuit but to pay whatever ransom was demanded and then to hunt the brigands down that is all very well the doctor said but when they have once got the money and you may be sure that it will be a very big sum they will divide it and scatter and there wont be one of them in the district twelve hours after the girls are given up but what is he to do doctor sim howlett said he darent move till he gets the gals they would cut their throats sure if he did my idea was sim hugh said that if this is the work of the band in that house the doctor was telling me about this morning we could be in hiding near it and directly the men who take the girls back to their father return with the ransom we could fall upon them destroy the whole band and get back the money we should want a big force to surround the place sim replied and there would be no getting it there without being seen you bet there are a score of them on the lookout and their friends would bring them word long before we got there of such a force being on the way besides there is no surety that it is the place where the gals are and even if it is the hull band may leave when they send the gals away they may scatter all over the country and meet again at night fifty miles off another thing is you may bet your boots there will be a lot of trouble about handing over that ransom and they wont give em up until after they have got the money i see that there are all sorts of difficulties before us sim but i am sure you and the doctor will see some way out of it i am deeply interested in rescuing these poor girls and we are all interested in this band being wiped out before we start have you any plan at all the doctor asked you have had longer time to think this over than we have well doctor my idea was that we could start tonight and get to some place among the hills where we could hide our horses a mile or two from this house where we suppose they are we should lie quiet there tomorrow the next evening we should make our way down and try and ascertain for certain whether they are there and see whether it is possible to carry them off of course that couldnt be attempted unless we are absolutely certain of being able to protect them if we could get them out without being seen we might try to do it if it is not certain we could do that and get off without being seen i should say one of us should ride back next morning to don ramon and get him to bring up twenty or thirty of his men or if not a body of troops from the fort we should guide them at night to a point as near the house as it would be safe for them to get then we four could crawl down to the house the moment we are in a position to protect the girls that is to say if we can get into the room where they are kept we will fire a pistolshot out of the window as a signal then we shall have to make as good a fight of it as we can till the others come up to help us you may be sure that the brigands will be all pretty well occupied with us and the other party will be able to surround the house and then rush in to our assistance that looks a good plan by thunder sim howlett said what do you say doctor well i think it might be worked somehow on those lines the doctor agreed i dont think there is much danger for the ladies because if the brigands did come upon us when we were scouting some of them would attack us and the rest would carry the ladies off to some other hidingplace i dont say if they were surrounded and saw no chance of escape they mightnt kill them out of revenge but they would never do that until the last thing because they would reckon and truly enough that as long as they are in their hands they have got the means of making terms for themselves but to one thing i agree anyhow let us get our horses and start at once dont let us go together we will meet at the first crossroad a mile to the west of the town no one is likely to notice us going out there are plenty of people who have come in from the country to this festa besides just at present they wont be watching us they know what our plans are and that we dont intend to start for another week and they wont be giving a thought to us until this affair of the girls is settled what do you say sim that is right enough sim said but we must be careful about the roads doctor like enough they will have a man on every road going anywhere near the place and perhaps miles away yes we must make a big circuit the doctor agreed strike the hills fifteen or twenty miles away from their place and then work up through them so as to come down right from the other side shall i get some provisions at the hotel hugh asked no we will attend to that there are plenty of places open and we will get what is wanted now do you and bill go back by yourselves we will follow in a minute or two illustration illustration chapter xviii the brigands haunt by daybreak on the following morning hugh and his three companions were far among the hills they had halted an hour before and intended to wait until noon before pursuing their journey they had already been eight hours in the saddle and had travelled over sixty miles they had halted in a little valley where there was plenty of grass for the horses and after cooking some food lay down and slept until the sun was nearly overhead fortunately the two miners had traversed the country several times and were able to lead them across the mountains where otherwise it would have been impossible to find a way after four hours riding on emerging from a valley the doctor said there do you see that village three miles away that is the village where we stopped the gorge in which the house lies runs from the village in this direction you cannot see it here it is a sort of canyon cut out ages ago by the water the sides are nearly perpendicular but at the upper end the bottom rises rapidly and as far as we could see from the spot from which we looked at it there is no difficulty in getting down there as you see there are woods lying back to the left we have got to come down at the back of them and there is no chance of our being seen even if they have got men on the lookout on the high ground above the house they will be looking the other way they can see miles across the plain there of course they have no reason to believe that anyone knows of their haunt still they are always on the lookout against treachery well lets go on at a trot now doctor we shall be in the wood before sunset when they reached the trees they dismounted and led their horses until they perceived daylight through the trunks on the opposite side now we will finish the remainder of our dinner the doctor said and talk matters over we are about half a mile now from the end of the valley and it is another halfmile down to the house now what are we going to do are we all going or only one hugh was silent these men understood matters better than he did only one of course sim howlett said the others can come on to the top of the valley so as to lend a hand if he is chased but it would be just chucking away lives for more than one to go well it is either you or me doc why hugh asked i am quite ready to go and i am sure bill is too besides this question of the young ladies is more my affair than yours since you do not know them and i certainly think i ought to be the one to go there is one reason agin it lightning sim said what you say is true and if it came to running you could leg it a good bit faster than the doc or me but that dont count for much in the dark it is creeping and crawling that is wanted more than running the reason why the doc or i must go is you dont speak mexican and we do it aint likely that the young ladies will be seen out in the verandah and one cant go and look into each of the windows till we find the right one we have got to listen and that way we may find whether they are there and if we are lucky which room they are in so you see it is for one of us to go i shall go sim the doctor said quietly i can walk as lightly as a cat i havent above half as much bulk to hide as you have and i am cunning while you are strong and this is a case where cunning is of more use than strength so it is settled that i go but you may as well give me your sixshooter i may want twelve barrels i shall be sorry for the mexicans if you use them all doc sim howlett said handing over his pistol to the doctor i would rather go myself but i know when you have once made up your mind to anything it aint no sort of use argying thats right the doctor said putting the weapon into his belt well there is just time for a pipe before i start the sun has been down nearly half an hour and the moon wont be up over those hills there for another hour so we shall have it dark till i get well down into the valley and the moon wont be high enough to throw its light down there afore i am back again a wonderful man is the doctor sim howlett said when with noiseless step he had made his way down into the upper end of the ravine you wouldnt think much of him to look at him but you bet he has got as much grit as if he was ten times as big see him going about and you would say he might be one of them missionaries or a scientific chap such as those as comes round looking after birds and snakes and such like he sorter seems most like a woman with his low talk and gentle way and yet i suppose he has killed more downright bad men than any five men on this side of missouri you dont say so hugh said in surprise yes sir he is a hull team and a little dog under the waggon he is he aint a chap to quarrel he dont drink and he dont gamble and he speaks everyone fair and civil it aint that but he has got somethin in him that seems to swell up when he hears of bad goingson when there is a real bad man comes to the camp where he is and takes to bossing the show and to shooting free after a time you can see the doctor gets oncomfortable in his mind but he goes on till that bad man does something out of the wayshoots a fellow just out of pure cussedness or something of that kindthen he just says this must be put down and off he goes and faces that bad man and gives him a fair show and lays him out you mean he doesnt fire until the other man is heeled sim yes i mean that then how is it he hasnt got killed himself that is what we have said a hundred times lightning he has been shot all over but never mortally one thing his looks are enough to scare a man somehow he dont look altogether arthly with that white hair of hisand it has been the same colour ever since i have known himfloating back from his face he goes in general bareheaded when he sets out to shoot and the hair somehow seems to stand out not a bit like it does other times i heard a chap who had been a doctor afore he took to golddigging say his hair looked as if it had been electrified then he gets as white as snow and his eyes just blaze out i tell you sirree it is something frightful to see him and when he comes right into a crowded saloon and says to the man as he always does say in a sort of tone that seems somehow to frizz up the blood of every man that hears it it is time for you to die you bet it makes the very hardest man weaken i tell you i would rather face judge lynch and a hundred regulators than stand up agin the doctor when his fit is on and i have seen men who never missed their mark afore shoot wide of him altogether and he never misses royce asked miss sim repeated the doctor couldnt miss if he tried ive never known his bullet go a hairsbreadth off the mark it always hits plumb in the centre of the forehead if there is more than one of them the doc turns on the others and warns them git out of the camp afore night and you bet they git he gives me a lot of trouble the doc does in the way of nursing i have put it to him over and over again if it is fair on me that he should be on his back three months every year cause that is about what its been since i have known him he allows as it aint fair but as he says it aint me sim i have got to do it i am like a malay running amuckthems chaps out somewhere near china he tells me as gets mad and goes for a hull crowdand i cant help it and i dont think he can and yet you know at other times he is just about the kindest chap that breathes he is always anussing the sick and sitting up nights with them and such like that is why he got the name of doctor he isnt a doctor really then hugh asked waal lightning all thats his secret and ef he thinks to tell you he can do it i know he is the best mate a man ever had and one of the best critters in gods universe and that is good enough for me i reckon he must be somewhere down among them mexikins by this time he went on changing the subject abruptly i almost wish one of us had gone with him royce said so that if he should get found out we might make a better fight of it he aint likely to get found out sim said quietly and ef he does he kin fight his way out i dont know what way the doctor will die but i allowed years ago that it werent going to be by a bullet i aint skeery about him ef i had thought there wur any kind of risk i would have gone with him you bet it was two hours before the doctor suddenly stood in the moonlight before them they had been listening attentively for some time but had not heard the slightest sound until he emerged from the shadow of the ravine well doctor are we on the right scent the girls are there sim sure enough now let us go back to the wood before we talk we have been caught asleep once on this expedition when we thought we were so safe that we neednt be on the watch and i dont propose to throw away a chance again they went back without another word to the wood as soon as they reached it the doctor sat down at the foot of a tree and lighted his pipe the others followed his example well there was no danger about that job he began it seems not to have struck the fools that anyone was likely to come down from this end of the gulch down at the other end they have got two sentries on each side upon the heights i could see them in the moonlight i reckon they have some more at the mouth of the valley down near the village but you may guess i asked no questions about it i saw no one in the gulch until i got down close to the house it is as strong a place as if it had been built for the purpose it stands on a sort of table of rock that juts out from the hillside so that on three sides it goes straight down there is a space round the house forty or fifty feet wide on the side where the rock stands out from the hill they have got a wall twelve feet high with a strong gate in it on that side of the house they have bricked all the windows up so as to prevent their being commanded by a force on the hillside above them and all the windows on the groundfloor all round are bricked up too i expect the rooms are lighted from a courtyard inside so you see it is a pretty difficult sort of place to take all of a sudden i could hear the voices of five or six men sitting smoking and talking outside the door which is not on the side facing the hill but on the other side i guessed that when the house was built there must have been steps up from that side for there is a road that runs along the bottom of the valley so i crawled up and found that it was so there had been a broad flight of steps there they had been broken away and pulled down still they were good enough for me there were one or two blocks still sticking out from the rock and there were holes where other blocks had been let in and i made a shift to climb up without much difficulty till i got my eyes level with the top the moon hadnt risen over the brow still it was lighter than i liked but one had to risk something so i first of all pulled myself up crawled along the edge till i got round the corner and then went up to the house and examined the windows on the other side and then got back to the top of the steps and began to listen i soon heard the girls were there they had brought them straight there after they had carried them off a man had started early the next morning with a letter to don ramon demanding ransom he was expected back some time tonight they had had news that so far the don was taking no steps to raise the country though the news of the girls being carried off was generally known i didnt hear what the sum named for the ransom was but the men were talking over what they should each do with their share of it and they reckoned that each would have seven or eight thousand dollars well there wasnt anything new about this the matter of interest to us was which was the room where the girls were as the journey would have been of no sort of use if i could not find that out there was nothing to do but to get up again and crawl along to the house i had reckoned that i should most likely want my rope and had wound it round my waist there was a guard at the gate so it was one of the sides i had to try i had learned from what the men said that most of the gang were away scattered all over the country down to el paso so as to bring news at once if there was any search for the girls going on the chief and his lieutenant were down in the village and would ride in with the messenger who brought down ramons answer there was a guard inside the house because the men at the fire said it was time for two of them to go and relieve them but i guessed that otherwise the house was empty i threw my rope over a balcony and climbed up opened the fastening of the window with my knife and went in everything was quiet i felt my way across the room to a window on the other side i opened that and looked down into the courtyard two or three lanterns were burning there and i saw two men sitting on a bench that was placed across a door they were smoking cigarettes and had their guns leaning against the wall beside them there was no doubt that was the room where the girls were it was on the opposite side of the courtyard to that where i was standingthat is on the side of the house facing down the valleyand was the corner room i had learned everything i wanted now so i had nothing to do but to shut the window slide down the rope shake it off the balcony and come back again and here i am well done doctor you have succeeded splendidly but what a pity we didnt all go with you we could have cleared out that lot and rescued the girls at once you might not have gone as quietly as i did the doctor said four men make a lot more noise than one and at the slightest noise the seven men at the door would have been inside the door bolted and the first pistol shot would have brought in the guard at the gate the four sentries on the height and i expect as many more from the mouth of the valley it would have been mighty difficult to break into the house with nine men inside and as many out besides it would never do to run risks and even if we had done it and hadnt found the girls with their throats cut we should have had to fight our way up the valley to the horses and a bullet might have hit one of them no no this is a case where we have no right to risk anything its for the don to decide what is to be done now we know all about it and can lay it before him lightning you had better saddle up and ride with me you must go because he knows you and will believe what you tell him i must go because he will want me to guide the force back here so as to avoid any chance of their being seen on the way the horses have done eighty miles since this time yesterday so its no use thinking of starting tonight besides there is no hurry we will be off in the morning after breakfast sim was about to saddle the doctors horse when royce said the doctor had better take my horse he is miles faster than his own the girths were tightened the doctor as he mounted said to sim you will keep a sharp lookout over the house and reckon up how many go in and come out i expect if the don writes to say he will pay the money a good many of those outside will come here we will keep our eyes open doctor it may be two or three days before you hear of us sim there is no hurry doctor there will be a lot of talk about how the ransom is to be paid afore anything is done do you mean to go back the same way we came hugh asked the doctor as they rode off no there is no occasion for that we will ride thirty miles or so along the foot of the hills east and then strike straight by road for el paso it is about nine oclock now we shall be there by five oclock we wont go in together i will wait on the road and come in by some other way after dark or what would be better put up at joses you had better not go up to the dons until tomorrow morning were you to go up directly you returned the scoundrels who are watching both you and the don might suspect that your journey has had a connection with his business next morning hugh arrived at don ramons having obtained another horse at the hotel why where have you been senor hugh don carlos exclaimed as the servant showed him into the room where they were at breakfast when i rode with my father into the town to give the alcalde notice i went to the hotel and found that you were out we sent over there three times yesterday and the day before but they knew nothing of you you had taken your horse and gone out the evening you returned and had left no word when you would come back we have been quite anxious about you and feared that some harm had befallen you also we were quite sure that you would not have left without telling us of your intentions no indeed hugh said i should have been ungrateful indeed for your kindness if i had left you in such terrible trouble but before i tell you what i have been doing please let me know what has happened here about midday the day after my daughters had been stolen don ramon said a horseman rode up i saw him coming and guessed he was the man we were expecting he was shown in here and carlos and myself received him he handed me a letter here it is i will translate it senor don ramon peralesif you wish to see your daughters alive you will as speedily as possible collect dollars in gold and hand them over to the messenger i will send for them when i receive the money your daughters shall be returned to you i give you warning that if any effort is made to discover their whereabouts or if any armed body is collected by you for the purpose of rescue your daughters will at once be put to death signed ignatius guttiero and what did you reply don ramon i wrote that it would take some time to collect so great a sum in gold but that i would send up to santa fe at once and use every effort to get it together in the shortest possible time i demanded however what assurance i could have that after the money was paid my daughters would be returned to me to that i have received no answer no you could hardly get one before this morning hugh said you look surprised senor but we have found out where they are hidden you have found that out the others cried in astonishment my companions and i hugh said indeed beyond riding a good many miles i have had but little to do with the matter the credit lies entirely with the two miners i spoke to you of with whom i was going shortly to start on an expedition to a placer they know of he then related the reason why the miners had suspected where the gang of brigands had their headquarters and the steps by which they had ascertained that the girls were really there and then explained the scheme that he and the doctor had on their ride down arranged for their rescue don ramon his wife and son were greatly moved at the narrative you have indeed rendered us a service that we can never repay don ramon said but the risk is terrible should you fail it would cost you your lives and would ensure the fate of my daughters we are in no way afraid about our own lives don ramon there are not likely to be more than twenty of these scoundrels there and if we were discovered before we could get to your daughters we could fight our way off i think in that case seeing that there were only four of us they certainly would not throw away their prospect of a ransom by injuring their captives they would suppose that we had undertaken it on our own account as a sort of speculation and though no doubt they would remove your daughters at once to some other place they would not injure them you see our plan is that the force we propose shall be at hand shall not advance unless they hear three shots fired at regular intervals that will be the signal that we have succeeded in entering your daughters apartment and that they are safe with us in that case you will push forward at once to assist us if on the other hand you hear an outbreak of firing you will know that we have been discovered before we reached your daughters and will retreat with your force silently and return to el paso by the same route by which you went out and you would then of course continue your negotiations for a ransom at any rate don carlos said i claim the right of accompanying you it is my sisters who are in peril and i will not permit strangers to risk their lives for them when i remain safe at a distance you must agree to that senor i agree to that at once hugh said i thought that it was probable that you would insist upon going with us it is clearly your right to do so it must not be attempted don ramon said gravely if in any way i can recover my daughters by paying the ransom the risk would be terrible and although two hundred thousand dollars is a large sum i would pay it four times over rather than that risk should be run the question is what guarantee the brigands will give that they will return their captives after they have received the money i shall know that soon we will decide nothing until i receive the answer would it not be well senor for you to go over to arrange with the officer in command of the fort for twenty or thirty men to start with you at a moments notice if you decide to make this attempt to rescue your daughters the sooner we set about it the better that is if you intend to take troops instead of a party of your own men i have already seen the commandant don ramon said he is a personal friend and rode over here directly he heard the news and offered to place the whole of his force at my disposal should i think fit to use it at this moment a servant entered and said that a man wished to see don ramon the mexican left the room and returned in a minute with a letter it was brief senor if you want your daughters back again you must trust us we give no guarantees beyond our solemn pledge you will tell my messenger on what day you will have the money ready and do not delay more than a week he will come again to fetch it see that he is not followed for it will cost your daughters their lives if an attempt is made to find out where he goes your daughters will be returned within twentyfour hours of your sending out the money we will try your plan senor don ramon said firmly i would not trust the word of these cutthroats or their oaths even in the smallest matter and assuredly not in one such as this what shall i say in reply to this letter i should write and say that although their conditions are hard you must accept them but that you doubt whether you can raise so large a sum of gold in the course of a week and you beg them to give ten days before the messenger returns for it and you pledge your honour that no attempt whatever shall be made to follow or to ascertain the course he takes don ramon wrote the letter and took it down to the hall where the messenger was waiting surrounded by servants who were regarding him with no friendly aspect there is my answer don ramon said as he handed the letter to the man tell your leader i shall keep my word and that i trust him to keep his now senor hugh will you give me the details of your plan how do you propose that the troops are to be close at hand when required without their presence being suspected the doctors idea was this senor that you should this morning send a letter by a servant to the commandant will you tell him that you believe you have a clue to your daughters hidingplace but that everything depends upon the troops getting near the spot without suspicion being excited will you beg him to maintain an absolute silence as to any movements of the troops until tonight and to issue no orders until the gates are shut and all communication closed will he then order an officer and twenty men to be ready at four oclock in the morning to start under the guidance of a miner who will tonight arrive at the fort bearing your card this will of course be the doctor request the officer to place himself absolutely in his hands our plan is that they shall keep the other side of the river travel some thirty miles up and then halt until nightfall at that point they would be as far off from the brigands hidingplace as they are here and if the fact that a detachment has started becomes known to the friends of the brigands it will not be suspected that there is any connection between their journey and the affair with your daughters after nightfall they will start again cross the river and meet you and myself at one oclock near the village of ajanco thence we shall go up into the hills rest there all day and come down upon the gulch where the brigands haunt lies that sounds an excellent plan senor but how do you propose that we shall get away without being noticed tomorrow evening the doctor and i agreed that the best plan you could adopt would be to ride over and see your banker the first thing in the morning that will seem perfectly natural then in the evening after dark you and don carlos should again ride down to him you will naturally take at least four of your men down with you as a guard you will leave your horses with them when you enter the bankers you will then pass through his house and at once leave by the back entrance wrapped in your cloaks you will then proceed to a spot half a mile out of the town where juan who you say knows the country will be waiting with your horses and i also will be there the people who are watching youand you will certainly be watchedwill naturally suppose that you are at the bankers at ten oclock he will come to the door and tell your men to return home with your horses and to bring them back at ten in the morning as you and your son will sleep there even should anything be suspectedwhich is hardly likelythe scoundrels would have no clue whatever as to the direction you will have taken as at any rate you will have had two hours start before they can begin to think that anything is wrong that is a capital plan senor you keep on adding to our already deep obligations to you everything was carried out in accordance with the arrangements hugh returned at once to el paso and in the evening the doctor mounted his horse and rode to the fort the next day passed quietly and as soon as it became dark hugh went out to the stable saddled his horse without seeing any of the men about the yard and rode off in the direction of don ramons and then making a circuit of the town arrived at the spot where juan was waiting with the horses they had been placed in a thicket a short distance from the road so as to be unobserved by anyone who might happen to pass hugh took his post close to the road and an hour later don ramon and his son came up the horses were at once brought out and they mounted and rode off juan riding ahead to show the way they maintained a fast pace for at one oclock they were to meet the troops at the appointed place they arrived a quarter of an hour before the time and ten minutes after the hour heard the tramping of horses the doctor was riding ahead and halted when he came up to the group has all gone well lightning he asked excellently as far as we know this is lieutenant mason who is in command of the troops the doctor said as a figure rode forward lieutenant mason this is don ramon perales you are punctual senor the officer said i have orders to place myself and my men entirely at your disposal i think we had better have half an hours halt before we go further we have ridden fast and you must have ridden faster as your guide told me you were not to leave el paso until eight oclock and i presume we have a good deal farther to go tonight another twenty miles the doctor said the moon will be getting higher and we shall want all her light it will do no harm if we halt an hour lieutenant and eat our supper while the horses are eating theirs during the halt the doctor had a long talk with juan who came from this part of the country and knew it well when they mounted instead of riding through the town they struck off by a bypath before they reached it three hours later they were deep among the hills and then again halted after turning off from the track they had been following into a ravine the girths were loosened and the horses allowed to graze and the men wrapping themselves in cloaks or blankets were soon asleep a sentry being placed at the entrance to the ravine at ten oclock all were on their feet fires were lighted and breakfast cooked and then following mountain paths they rode until two in the afternoon at which time they reached the valley from which the party had before made their way down to the wood near the ravine at dusk they again mounted and rode on to the wood they were met at the edge of the trees by sim howlett and royce i was expecting you tonight boys sim said we looked out for you last night but didnt reckon as you could possibly do it have you any news of my daughters don ramon asked eagerly nary a word sim replied bill and me have never had our eyes off the house from sunup to sundown lots of fellows have come and gone on horseback of course we cannot answer for what has been done after nightfall but we reckon there is about thirty men there now not counting those they may have in the village and the sentries down by the mouth of the valley i calkilate the best part of the gang is there now the chiefs would like to keep them under their eye they will think the only thing they have got to be afraid of is treachery i suppose matters stand as they did when you left doc just the same we four and don carlos are to go on and get at the ladies when we are in there safe three pistol shots are to be the signal then don ramon and the soldiers are to come down and surround them don ramon had been very anxious to accompany the party but the doctor had positively refused to take him with them it would add greatly to our risks he said and do no good if we can get to your daughters don ramon we five can keep the fellows at bay until you come up easily enough i believe we could thrash the lot but it is no good taking chances but anyhow we can keep them off i would rather have gone without your son but as lightning has passed his word there is nothing more to be said on a job like this the fewer there are the better each man after the first pretty nearly doubles the risk by this time the troopers had dismounted and fastened their horses to the trees meat that had been cooked in the morning and biscuits were produced from their haversacks when the meal had been eaten the soldiers lit their pipes while their officer proceeded with hugh and the others to the lower end of the wood and walked on to the head of the ravine there are the lights hugh said ah i see they have lighted a fire on the terrace bill i expect they are pretty crowded in the house bill said but they go in to sleep sim and i have been down near the house twice and though we were not quite close we were able to make pretty sure that except one sentry there and another at the gate the rest all go in how far are we to go down the officer asked well i would rather you did not go down at all sim howlett said you can get down there from here in ten minutes after you start if you look spry and i am desperately afraid some of your men might make a noise which they would hear certain if everything was quiet there is no fear of their being heard when the firing once begins down there but if one of them fell over a rock and his gun went off before we had done our part of the affair there would be an end of the whole business that is what i think sim the doctor agreed we have said all along we might get the ladies out by ourselves but again we maynt be able to get them off at all but we can defend them easy enough if we can get into their room five minutes wont make any difference about that and it is everything to avoid the risk of noise until we get at them if they discover us before we get there we just fall back fighting they will think that we are only a small party and the ladies will be none the worse if you think that is the best way we must agree to it don ramon said but we shall have a terrible time until we get to you dont you be afeard sim howlett said the doctor me lightning and bill could pretty well wipe them out by ourselves and we reckon on our sixshooters a sight more than we do on the soldiers illustration illustration chapter xix a fight and a rescue soon after sunset the five men started the doctor was of opinion that it was better not to wait until the brigands had retired to rest of course we cannot begin operations he said until all is quiet but as long as the men are sitting round the fires smoking and singing they will keep a very careless guard and any noise we make will pass unobserved when they once get quiet the sentries will begin to listen but until then we might almost walk up to their fires without being observed it was necessary to move slowly and cautiously lest they should fall over a rock or stump but the doctor led the way and the others followed close behind him twenty minutes stealthy walking took them to the spot whence the doctor had before reconnoitred the house a fire blazed on the terrace and some fifteen men were sitting or lying round it the light fell upon bottles and glasses one of the party was playing upon a mandoline and singing but few of the others were attending to him a noisy conversation plentifully sprinkled with spanish oaths being kept up the room where your sisters are confined the doctor said to don carlos is round the other side of the house i did not mean to begin until all were asleep but they are making such a noise down there that i do think it will be best to move at once and if possible to let your sisters know that we are here so we will work quietly round to that side they had no sentry there last time but they may have tonight after twenty minutes of cautious movement they reached the foot of the rock on which the house stood the doctor had brought out from el paso a small grapnel and rope the former had been carefully wrapped round with strips of cloth so as to deaden any sound it was now thrown up and at the second attempt became firmly fixed above do you mount first lightning he said to hugh when you get up lie quiet for a minute or two when you have quite assured yourself that all is clear give the rope a shake we others will come up one by one let each man when he gets to the top lie down don carlos followed hugh and the others soon joined them you see that light there the doctor said to don carlos that is your sisters room as i told you the windows on the ground floor are all blocked up but three or four bricks have been left out just at the top of each for the sake of light and air now sim and you had better go together he will stand against the wall and if you climb on to his shoulders i think you can just about reach that hole pull yourself up and look in i need not tell you to be as silent as possible for there may be someone in with them if they are alone tell them what we are going to do see whether there are any bars inside the brickwork i am afraid there are sure to be the spanish houses most always have bars to the lower windows royce you and i will go to the righthand corner of the house you go to the left lightning if you hear anyone coming give a low hiss as a warning then we must all lie down close to the wall it is so dark now that unless a man kicks against us he wont see us if he does touch one of you he is likely to think that it is one of his own party lying down there for a sleep but if he stoops over to see who it is you have got either to stab him or to grip him by the throat so that he cant shout now i think we all understand the five men crawled cautiously to their respective stations now young fellow sim said to don carlos if when you are mounted on my shoulders you find you cannot reach the hole put your foot on my head you wont hurt me with them moccasins on directly you have got your fingers on the edge give a little pat with your foot to let me know and i will put my hands under your feet and help hoist you up you can put a biggish slice of your weight on me when i am tired i will let you know i will lean right forward against the wallthat will help you to climb up now when he stood up on sims shoulders the young mexican found that he could reach the opening getting his fingers firmly upon it he gave the signal and with sims aid had no difficulty in raising himself so that he could look into the room two candles burned upon the table and by their light he could see the girls stretched on couches hush girls hush he said in a low voice it is i carlos silence for your lives the two girls sprang to their feet did you hear it nina the elder exclaimed in a low voice yes it was the voice of carlos we could not both have been dreaming surely i am up here at the opening carlos said we are here girls a party to rescue you but we must get in beside you before we are discovered or else harm might come to you wait a moment he broke in as the girls in their delight were about to throw themselves upon their knees to return thanks to the virgin i am being held up here and must get down in an instant i can see that there is a grating to the window is it a strong one yes a very strong one very well we will saw through it presently do you keep on talking loudly to each other to drown any noise that we may make that will do sim you can let me down now now young fellow sim said as soon as don carlos reached the ground you go along and tell bill royce to come here and help the doctor will go on keeping watch then go to the other end and send lightning here and you take his place he is better for work than you are sim was soon joined by royce and hugh he had already set to work these bricks are only adobe he said my knife will soon cut through them in a very few minutes he had made a hole through the unbaked bricks senoritas he said in mexican place a chair against this hole and throw something over it so that if any one comes it wont be observed the men worked in turns with their keen bowies and in half an hour the hole was large enough for a head and shoulders to pass through now for the files lightning you may as well take the first spell as you have got them and the oil it took two hours work to file through the bars just as the work was finished sim said you had better fetch the lad lightning send him through first dont you think doctor hugh said when they were gathered round the hole that we might get the girls off without a fight at all i doubt it the doctor said the men have just gone in except two who are left as sentries and the night is very still they would be almost sure to hear some of us and if they did the girls might get shot in the fight still it might be worth trying as soon as you get in don carlos begin to move the furniture quietly against the door all this time the girls had been singing hymns but their prudence left them as their brother entered the room they stopt singing abruptly and threw themselves into his arms with a little cry of joy almost instantly there was a loud knock at the door what are you doing there i am coming in and the door was heard to unlock carlos threw himself against it fire the signal doctor sim exclaimed as he thrust hugh who was in the act of getting through the hole into the room as he did so three shots were fired outside the instant hugh was through he leaped to his feet and ran forward the pressure against the door had ceased the man having in his surprise at the sound of the shots sprung back hugh seized the handle of the door so that it could not be turned pile up the furniture he said to don carlos get into the corner of the room senoritas they will be firing through the door in a moment by this time a tremendous din was heard in the house as yet none of the brigands knew what had happened and their general impulse was to rush out on the terrace to hear the cause of the shots the doctor had followed hugh closely into the room the hole being large enough to admit of his getting through without any difficulty royce followed immediately and as he got through sim howletts pistol cracked out twice as the sentries ran round the corner of the house their figures being visible to him by the light from the fire then he thrust himself through the opening the instant he was through he seized one of the cushions of the couches and placed it across the hole by which he had entered several attempts had been made to turn the handle of the door but hugh held it firmly while the doctor and carlos moved the couches and chairs against it here doctor you watch this hole i will do that work sim said they worked as silently as possible and could hear through the opening at the top of the window the sound of shouts and oaths as a number of men ran past on the terrace then one voice shouted angrily for silence there is no one here he said martinez go in and fetch torches what has happened what have you seen lopez i have seen nothing the voice replied i was lying close to the door when domingo who was on guard at the senoritas door said something then almost directly three shots were fired outside i jumped up and unfastened the door and ran out martos and juan who were on guard outside were just running across i heard two more shots fired and down they both fell i waited a moment until all the others came out and then we ran round the corner together as far as i see there is nobody here mille demonios the first speaker exclaimed it must be some plot to get the girls away perez run in and ask domingo if he heard any sounds within open the door and see that the captives are safe there was a pause for a minute and then perez ran out domingo cannot open the door he said they are moving the furniture against it and the handle wont turn he says there must be something wrong there fool what occasion is there to say that as if anyone could not see there was something wrong ah here come the torches search all round the terrace and ask whoever is on guard at the gate whether he has heard anything we will see about breaking down the door afterwards there was a pause and then the men came back again there is no one on the terrace nobody has been through the gate then there was a sudden sharp exclamation see here vargas there is a hole here the bricks have been cut through a fresh volley of oaths burst out and then the man in authority gave his orders perez do you and martinez take your post here whether there is one or half a dozen inside they can only crawl out one at a time you have only got to fire at the first head you see the rest come inside and break open the door we will soon settle with them that is much better than i expected the doctor said we have gained nearly five minutes now let them come as soon as they like bill will you stop at this end and guard this cushion when the fight begins they may try to push it aside and fire through at us let the upper end lean back a little against this chair yes like that now you see you can look down and if you see a hand trying to push the cushion aside put a bullet through it dont attend to us unless we are badly pressed and call for you there was now a furious onslaught made on the door from the outside heavy blows being struck upon it with axes and crowbars now sim you may as well speak to them a little the doctor said when you have emptied your colt i will have a turn while you are loading the noise of the blows was a sufficient indication to sim where the men wielding the weapons were standing he had already recharged the two chambers he had emptied and now steadily and deliberately he fired six shots through the panels of the door and the yells and oaths told him that some of them had taken effect there was a pause for a moment and then the assault recommenced the wood gave way beneath the axes and the door began to splinter while a number of shots were fired from the outside the doctor however was stooping low and the others stood outside the line of fire while bill at his end was kneeling by the cushion the doctors revolver answered the shots and when he had emptied his pistol hugh took his place by the furious shouts and cries without there was no doubt the fire was doing execution but the door was nearly yielding and just as hugh began to fire one of the panels was burst in the lock too had now given the piece of wood he had jammed into it having fallen out the mexicans however were unable to force their way in owing to the steady fire of the besieged who had extinguished their candles and had the advantage of catching sight of their opponents through the open door by the light of the torches without the besieged shifted their places after each shot so that the mexicans fired almost at random for ten minutes the fight had raged when there was a sudden shout followed by a discharge of firearms without a cheer broke from the defenders of the room and a cry of despair and fury from the mexicans the attack on the door ceased instantly but a desperate struggle raged in the courtyard this went on for three or four minutes when the mexicans shouted for mercy and the firing ceased then don ramons voice was heard to call where are you are you all safe there was a shout in reply then the furniture was pulled away and the splintered door removed and as don ramon entered his daughters who had remained quietly in the corner while the fight went on rushed into his arms the success of the surprise had been complete the man on guard at the gate had left his post to take part in the struggle going on in the house and the officer in command of the troops had gained the terrace unobserved he at once surrounded the house and the two men outside the opening had been shot down at the same moment that he with a dozen of his men rushed into the courtyard and attacked the mexicans none of these had escaped eighteen had fallen in the house four had been killed outside and twelve had thrown down their arms and were now lying bound hand and foot in charge of the troops illustration besieged by brigands no sooner had don ramon assured himself that his daughters were safe and uninjured than he turned to their rescuers and poured out his hearty thanks they were not quite uninjured bill had escaped without a wound don carlos was bleeding from a pistol ball which had grazed his cheek sim howletts right hand was disabled by a ball which had taken off his middle finger and ploughed its way through the flesh of the forearm hugh had a bullet in the shoulder the doctors wound was the only serious one he having been hit just above the hip one of the soldiers had been killed and five wounded while fighting in the courtyard leaving don ramon and his son to question the girls as to what had befallen them and to tell them how their rescue had been brought about the others went outside lets have a blaze lieutenant sim said most of us want dressing a bit and the doctor is hit very hard let us make a good big fire out here on the terrace then we shall see what we are doing we were in a smother of gunpowder smoke inside the officer gave an order and the soldiers fetched out billets of wood from the store and piled them on the fire on the terrace and soon a broad sheet of flame leaped up now then let us look at the wounds sim went on let us lift you up and make you a little comfortable doctor i am afraid that there is no doing anything with you till we get you down to the town all you have got to do is to lie quiet and drink sim ay and drink i am as thirsty myself as if i had been lost on an alkali plain bill will you get us some drink plenty of water with just a drop of spirit in it there is sure to be plenty in the house somewhere royce soon returned with a large jar of cold water and a bottle of spirits only a few drops of spirits sim if you dont want to get inflammation in that hand of yours what had i better do for it doctor well it will be better to have that stump of the middle finger taken out altogether i could do it for you if i could stand and had a knife of the right shape here as it is you cant do better than wrap your hand up in plenty of cloths and keep them wet and then put your arm in a sling whats yours lightning i am hit in the shoulder doctor i dont think that it is bleeding now well you had better get bill to bathe it in hot water then lay a plug of cotton over the hole and bandage it up the doctor at the fort will get the ball out for you as soon as you get down there he is a good man they say and anyhow he gets plenty of practice with pistol wounds at el paso royce did his best for his two friends then they all sat quietly talking until the young officer came out from the house we have been searching it from top to bottom he said there is a lot of booty stored away i want you to have a look at the two leaders of these scoundrels they have both been shot don ramon said that he believed they were the murderers of his son and that two of you might recognize them if they were as you did a horse trade with them hugh and royce followed him to the other side of the house where the bodies of the brigands who had fallen had been brought out and laid down two soldiers brought torches i have no doubt whatever that these are the men hugh said after examining the bodies of the two leaders who were placed at a short distance from the rest thems the fellows royce said positively i could swear to them anywhere they are notorious scoundrels the officer said and have for years been the scourge of new mexico they were away for a time two years ago we had made the place so hot for them that they had to quit we learned that from some of their gang whom we caught they were away nearly a year at least they were quiet i suppose they carried on their games down in texas till they had to leave there too and then thinking the affair had blown over they returned here there has been a reward of ten thousand dollars for their capture anytime for the last five years properly that ought to be divided between you as it is entirely your doing that they have been caught but as the reward says death or capture i suppose my men will have to share it with you that is right enough sim howlett said it will give us three or four hundred dollars apiece and that dont make a bad weeks work anyhow when are you thinking of starting back lieutenant and what are you going to do with this house here i shall set fire to the house after we have got everything out of it i guess it has been a den of brigands for the last ten years i have sent four men down to keep guard at the mouth of the valley and i expect we shall get all their horses in the morning they must be somewhere about here the prisoners will ride their own and that will leave us twenty or more for carrying down the best part of the plunder there is a lot of wine and other things that they have carried off from the haciendas that they plundered i will send those down in carts with an escort of four of my men then i think we had better get a bed in one of the carts and send my mate here down upon it he has got a bullet somewhere in the hip and wont be able to sit a horse we will send him off the first thing in the morning the officer said there is one of my own wounded to send down that way too i will go with them as nurse sim said get the cart to go straight through without a halt lieutenant the sooner my mate is in the hands of your doctor the better i will see about it now the lieutenant said no time shall be lost i will send a sergeant and four men down to the village at once to requisition a cart and bring it here it will be much better for them travelling at night i will tell the men i send as escort to get hold of another cart in the morning and send them straight on thank you lieutenant that will be the best plan by far don ramon now came out from the house and joined the group in the name of my children their mother and myself i thank you most deeply senors for the noble way in which you have risked your lives for their rescue had it not been for you god knows whether i should have seen my daughters again for i know that no oaths would have bound those villains and that when they had obtained the ransom they would never have let my daughters free to give information that would have led to their capture i shall always be your debtor and the only drawback to my pleasure is that three of you have been wounded the doctor here is the only one wounded seriously sim howlett said my hand and arm will soon heal up and the loss of a finger is no great odds anyway i dont suppose lightnings shoulder will turn out worse than my arm as for the doctor he is hit hard but he has been hit hard so many times and has pulled through it that i hope for the best senor hugh don ramon said it was indeed a fortunate day for me when i questioned you concerning my sons horse for it was to your advice and to your enlisting your friends on my behalf that i owe it chiefly that my daughters are with me this evening i must leave it to their mother to thank you as you deserve two hours later the doctor and one of the wounded soldiers were placed on a bed laid at the bottom of a cart and started under the escort of two soldiers sim howlett accompanying them as the girls had expressed the greatest disinclination to remain in the house where they had been prisoners and where so much blood had just been shed they with the rest of the party returned with a sergeant and six soldiers carrying torches up the valley to the wood where the horses had been left here two fires were soon blazing and the girls were not long before they were asleep wrapped in blankets that had been brought up from the house the following morning hugh and royce handed over their horses for the use of the girls who were both accomplished horsewomen and mounting the horses of sim and the doctor they started with don ramon his son and daughters fifteen miles before they got to el paso they passed the cart with the wounded men and hugh said he would ride into the fort to ensure the doctor being there when they arrived royce and he accompanied don ramon and his party to the gate of the hacienda which they reached just at sunset the mexican was warm in his entreaties to hugh to become his guest until his wound was healed but he declined this on the ground that he should be well cared for at the fort and should have the surgeon always at hand i shall be over the first thing in the morning to see you don carlos said i shall want my own face strapped up and i warn you if the doctor says you can be moved i shall bring you back with me royce accompanied hugh to the fort the commandant was highly gratified when he heard of the complete success of the expedition and still more so when he learned that the two notorious brigands for whom he and his troopers had so often searched in vain were among the killed hugh was at once accommodated in the hospital and the surgeon proceeded to examine his wound it was so inflamed and swollen with the long ride he said that no attempt could be made at present to extract the ball and rest and quiet were absolutely necessary two hours later the cart arrived the doctor was laid in a bed near that of hugh the third bed in the ward being allotted to sim howlett the doctors wound was pronounced by the surgeon to be a very serious one it was some days before under the influence of poultices and embrocations the inflammation subsided sufficiently for a search to be made for the bullet in hughs shoulder the surgeon however was then successful in finding it imbedded in the flesh behind the shoulderbone and having found its position he cut it out from behind after this hughs progress was rapid and in a week he was out of bed with his arm in a sling the doctor contrary to the surgeons expectations also made fair progress the bullet could not be found and the surgeon after one or two ineffectual attempts decided that it would be better to allow it to remain where it was the stump of sims finger was removed the morning after he came in and the wound had almost completely healed by the time that hugh was enabled to leave the hospital a month after entering it don ramon and his son had ridden over every day to inquire after the invalids and had seen that they were provided with every possible luxury and he carried off hugh to the hacienda as soon as the surgeon gave his consent to his making a short journey in the carriage donna maria received him as warmly as if he had been a son of her own and he had the greatest difficulty in persuading her that he did not require to be treated as an invalid and was perfectly capable of doing everything for himself for a fortnight he lived a life of luxurious idleness doing absolutely nothing beyond going over in the carriage every day to see how the doctor was going on hugh saw that he was not maintaining the progress that he had at first made he had but little fever or pain but he lay quiet and silent and seemed incapable of making any effort whatever sim howlett was very anxious about his comrade he dont seem to me to try to get well he said to hugh it looks to me like as if he thought he had done about enough and was ready to go if one could rouse him up a bit i believe he would pull round he has gone through a lot has the doctor and i expect he thinks there aint much worth living for he just smiles when i speak to him but he dont take no interest in things do you get talking with me when you go in lightning and asking about what we have been doing and i will tell you some of the things he and i have gone through together maybe that may stir him up a bit how long have you known him sim i came across him in i came round by panama being one of the first lot to leave new york when the news of gold came i had been away logging for some months and had come down at the end of the season with six months money in my pocket i had been saving up for a year or two and was going to put it all in partnership with a cousin of mine who undertook the building of piers and wharves and such like on the hudson well the first news that met me when i came down to new york was that jim had busted up and had gone out west some said others that he had drowned hisself i was sorry for jim but i was mighty glad that i hadnt put my pile in waal i was wondering what to start on next when the talk about gold began and as soon as i larned there were no mistake about it i went down to the wharf and took my passage down to the isthmus i had been working about three months on the yuba when i came across the doctor i had seen him often afore we came to speak if you wur to see the doctor now for the first time when he is just sitting quiet and talking in that woman sort of voice of his and with those big blue eyes you would think maybe that he was a kind of softy wouldnt you i dare say i might sim i saw him for the first time when he came up with you to take my part against that crowd of mexicans there didnt look anything soft about him then and though i was struck with his gentle way of talking when i met him afterwards i knew so well there was lots of fight in him that it didnt strike me he was anything of a softy as you say no waal the doctor has changed since i met him but at that time he did look a softy and most people put him down as being short of wits he used just to go about the camp as if he paid no attention to what wur going on sometimes he would go down to a bit of a claim he had taken up and wash out the gravel just singing to himself not as though it wur to amuse him but as though he did not know as he wur singing in a sort of curious faroff sort of voice but mostly he went about doing odd sorts of jobs if there wur a man down with the fever the doctor would just walk into his tent and take him in hand and look after him and when he got better would just drift away and like enough not seem to know the man the next time he met him waal he got to be called softy but men allowed as he wur a good fellow and was just as chokefull of kindness as his brain would hold and as he walked about any chap who was taking his grub would ask him to share it for it was sartin that what gold he got wouldnt buy enough to keep a cat alive much less a man waal it was this way i got down with fever from working in the water under a hot sun i hadnt any particular mates that time and wur living in a bit of a tent made of a couple of blankets and though the boys looked in and did any job that wur wanted i wur mighty bad and went off my head for a bit and the first thing i seen when i came round was softy in the tent tending me ef he had been a woman and i had been his son he couldnt have looked after me tenderer i found when i began to get round he had been getting meat for me from the boys and making soups but as soon as i got round enough to know what was going on i pointed out to him the place where i had hid my dust and he took charge of it and got me what was wanted till i picked up and got middling strong again as soon as i did softy went off to look after someone else who was bad but i think he took to me more than he had to anyone else for he would come in and sit with me sometimes in the evening and i found that he wurnt really short of wits as people thought but would talk on most things just as straight as anyone he didnt seem to have much interest in the digging which wur about the only thing we thought of but when i asked him what he had come to the mining camps for if it wasnt to get gold he just smiled gently and said he had a mission what the mission wur he never said and i concluded that though he was all there in other things his brain had somehow got mixed on that point onless it wur that his mission was to look after the sick waal we were a rough lot in you bet lynchlaw hadnt begun and there wuz rows and fights of the wust kind our camp had been pretty quiet ontil someone set up a saloon and gambling shop and some pretty tough characters came that was just as i wur getting about agin though not able to work regular it wurnt long before two fellows became the terror of the camp and they went on so bad that the boys began to talk among themselves that they must be put down but no one cared about taking the lead they had shot four fellows in the first week after they came i hadnt seen softy for ten days he had been away nussing a woodman as had his leg broke by the fall of a tree i was sitting outside my tent with a chap they called red sam we had a bottle of brandy between us when them two fellows came along and one of them just stooped and took up the bottle and put it to his lips and drank half of it off and then passed it to the other without saying by your leave or anything red sam said well im blowed when the fellow who had drunk whipped out his bowiesixshooters had hardly come in thenand afore red sam could get fairly to his feet he struck him under the ribs waal i jumped up and drew my bowie for it wur my quarrel you see he made at me i caught his wrist as the knife was coming down and he caught mine but i wur like a child in his arms i thought it wur all over with me when i heard a shout and softy sprang on the man like a wild cat and drove his knife right into him and he went down like a log the other shouted out an oath and drew softy faced him it wur the strangest sight i ever seen his hat had fallen off and his hair which wur just as white then as it is now fell back from his face and his eyes that looked so soft and gentle wur just blazing it came across me then as it have come across me many a time since that he looked like a lion going to spring and i think buckskin as the man called himself who had often boasted as he didnt fear a living thing was frighted they stood facing each other for a moment and then softy sprang at him he was so quick that instead of buckskins knife catching him as he intended just in front of the shoulder and going straight down to the heart it caught him behind the shoulder and laid open his back pretty near down to the waist but there wur no mistake about softys stroke it went fair between the ribs and buckskin fell back dead with softy on the top of him waal after that it wur my turn to nuss the doctor for no one called him softy after that he wur laid up for over a month and i think that letting out of blood did him good and cleared his brain like when he got well he wur just as you see him now just as clear and as sensible a chap as you would see why he has got as much sense as you would find in any man west of missouri and hes the truest mate and the kindest heart i have never seen the doctor out of temper for you cant call it being out of temper when he rises up and goes for a man that is his mission he has never got that out of his head and never will ontil he dies he can put up with a deal the doctor can but when a man gits just too bad for anything then it seems to him as he has got a call to wipe him out and he wipes him out you bet you dont want lynchlaw where the doctor is he is a judge and a posse all to himself and for years he was the terror of hard characters down in california they was just skeered of him and if a downright bad man came to a camp and heard the doctor wur there he would in general clear straight out agin he has been shot and cut all over has the doctor and half a dozen times it seemed to me i should never bring him round agin it aint no use talking to him and asking him why he should take on hisself to be a jedge and jury when its all over he always says in his gentle way that he is sorry about it and i do think he is and he says he will attend to his own business in future but the next time it is just the same thing again there aint no holding him you might just as well try to stop a mountain lion when he smells blood at such times he aint hisself if you had once seen him you would never forget it there wur a british painting fellow who wur travelling about taking pictures for a book he wur in camp once when the doctors dander rose and he went for a man and the britisher said arterwards to me as it were like the bersek rage i never heard tell of the berseks but from what the chap said i guessed they lived in the old time waal if they wur like the doctor i tell you that i shouldnt like to get into a muss with them no sir do you know what the doctors history is sim yes i do know he said but i dont suppose anyone else does maybe he will tell you some day if he gets over this oh i dont want to know if it is a secret sim waal there aint no secret in it lightning but he dont talk about it and in course i dont it is a sort of thing that has happened to other men and maybe after a bit they have got over it but the doctor aint you see he aint a common man he has got the heart of a woman and for a time it pretty nigh crazed him illustration illustration chapter xx the avenger hugh told the coachman to go back to the hacienda and to return for him late in the afternoon and then went in with sim the doctor smiled faintly as hugh sat down beside him and asked how he was getting on i am getting on lad he said i reckon i shall be there before long hugh affected to misunderstand him you must pick up strength he said or we shall never carry out that expedition among the apaches you know if you wait for that you will wait a long time the doctor said quietly i hope not hugh said cheerily by the way sim you told me you would tell me some of your adventures in the early days of california i am interested in that because i had an uncle there he was ten years or so out there what was his name lightning sim asked his name was will tunstall an exclamation burst from both his hearers your uncle sim exclaimed waal that beats all and to think that we should have been all this time together and never known that is your name tunstall too yes hugh tunstall to think now doctor sim said and we never knowed him except as hugh or lightning and he is will tunstalls nephew why lad billenglish bill we called himwas a mate of ours and a better mate men never worked with you are like him lad the doctor said in a voice so different from that in which he had before spoken that hugh quite started i thought you reminded me of someone and now i know it was english bill he was just as tall and as straight as you are and laughed and talked just as you do i wonder sim we didnt notice it at once well well that is strange hugh was greatly surprised it was indeed strange that he should have met these two mates of his uncle stranger still that they should have entertained such evident affection for a man who seemed to him to differ in character so widely from them he was surprised too at the doctors remarks about his resemblance to his uncle for he could see no likeness whatever well he said i should have had no idea that i was like my uncle i think you must have forgotten his figure he is tall and muscular certainly but he is much darker than i am and i think altogether different the doctor and sim looked at each other with astonishment there must be some mistake sim said do you say your uncle is alive now certainly i do hugh replied in turn surprised ah then it isnt the same man sim said our bill tunstall was killed ten years ago it is odd too tunstall aint a common name at least not in these parts if you had ever said your own name before i should have noticed it and asked you about it but royce always called you lightning or hugh and one may know men here for years by the name they have got without ever thinking what name they might be born with is tunstall a common name in england lightning the doctor asked no i dont think so doctor i never met any others we came from the north of england from cumberland so did english bill sim said never heard tell of a chap that came out from there of that name a tall straight strong fellow like you he must have come out before you wur born though of course we didnt know him for years afterwards my uncle came out here before i was born hugh said but i never heard of anyone else of the same name doing so still if your friend is dead of course it isnt the same for my uncle is alive at least he was two years ago he is strong and active and well knit but he is not as tall as i am by two inches i should say lift me up in bed sim the doctor said excitedly how long ago did your uncle return over six years ago hugh replied surprised at this strange excitement upon the part of a man who ten minutes before had seemed to have no further interest in anything six years ago sim you hear that six years ago gently doctor gently what are you driving at sim asked really alarmed at his mates excitement the doctor paid no attention to him and he had been a great many years away went away as a boy and when he came back was so changed they wouldnt have known him yes that was so hugh said more and more surprised you hear that sim you hear that the doctor exclaimed sharply i hear it mate but do you lie down you are not strong enough to be exciting yourself like this though i am blamed if i can see what it is about what did he go home for the doctor asked still unheeding sim he went home because my father had died and he came in for a considerable property and he was one of my guardians do you hear that sim the doctor cried in a loud shrill voice that was almost a scream do you see it all now just you run and call the surgeon lightning the docs going clear off his head stop the doctor said as hugh was about to hurry off if sim wasnt that thickheaded he would see what i see give me a drink hugh handed him a glass of lemonade which he tossed off now then sim havent i told you this young fellow was like someone though i couldnt mind who dont you see it is our mate english bill yes he is like him sim said now you name it he is a bit taller and his figure is loose yet but he will widen out ontil he is just what bill wur like what his uncle was the doctor broke in dont you see sim his uncle was our mate but how can that be doctor dont you hear him say as his uncle is alive in england and didnt we bury poor bill youve heard hugh say what his uncle came home for what was bill going home for sim ah sim exclaimed suddenly as a light flashed across him it was just what lightning has been saying his brother was dead and he was going home to be guardian to his nephew and because he had come into an estate quite so only he never went sim did he no certainly he never went doc there is no doubt about that but somebody did go the doctor said and we know who it was the man who killed him and stole his papers an exclamation of astonishment broke from hugh while sim exclaimed earnestly by thunder doctor but you may be right i reckon it may be as you say though how you came to figure it out beats me that must be it we never could make out why he should have been killed he had money on him but not enough to tempt the man as we suspected suspected no the man we knew did it the doctor broke in you see now lightning how it is it was known in camp that our mate had come into an estate in england he said goodbye to us all and started and his body was found a few miles away we felt pretty sure of the man who had done it for he was missing he was a gambler bill had been pretty thick with him for some time and i allow the fellow had got the whole story out of him and knew the place he was going to and knew where it was and had wormed a whole lot out of him that might be useful to him then he killed him and wasnt seen any more in these parts i searched for him for a year up and down california and nevada and new mexico and down into northern mexico but i never came across his track if i had got as much as a sign which way he had gone i would have hunted him down all over the world but there was not a sign from the day he had left the camp nobody ever heard of him again i found out he had a wife down in southern california a mexican girl and i went down there to hunt her out but she had gone toohad left a few days after he had disappeared now we are on his track again sim i guess in a week i will be up and you and i will go straight off with this young fellow to england and see this thing out lay me down now i must be quiet for a bit take lightning out and talk it over with him and tell the cook to let me have some strong soup for i have got to get out of this as soon as possible can all this be true sim do you think hugh said or is the doctor lightheaded do you think it is possible that the man who murdered my uncle is the one who has taken his place all these years it is gospel truth lightning at least it is gospel truth that your uncle was murdered here for there cant be no doubt that your uncle bill tunstall and our mate is the same man but i cant say whether the one as you thought was your uncle is the one that killed him your description is like enough to him tell me a little more about him he is rather dark with a moustache but no whiskers he has a quiet manner he is slight but gives you the idea of being very strong he has very white wellmade hands he shows his teeth a little when he smiles but even when i first knew him i never liked his smile there was something about it that wasnt honest and he brought over with him a mexican wife thats him sim said in a tone of conviction you have just described him he has a light sort of walk like a cat and a tigerish way with him all over there aint a doubt that is the man and what is the woman like she has always been very kind and good to me hugh said no aunt could have been kinder i am awfully sorry for her but i hated the man that was why i left england i came into the room one day and found that he had knocked his wife down and i seized him then he knocked me down and i caught up the poker i was no match for him then in strength then he drew a pistol but i hit him before he could aim and as he went down his head came against a sharp corner of a piece of furniture and i thought that i had killed him so i bolted at once made my way to hamburg and crossed to new york that is how i came to be here has he got much of the property lad he has got what was my uncles share hugh replied now that i know who he is i can understand things i could not understand before if i had died before i came of age he would have had the whole of the property he used to get the most vicious horses he could find for me to ride and i remember now when we were in switzerland together he wanted to take me up mountains with him but my aunt wouldnt let me go then he offered to teach me pistolshooting but somehow he dropped that and my aunt taught me herself i think she must have stopped him thinking it all over now i feel sure that he must have intended to kill me somehow and that she managed to save my life there were often quarrels between them but she didnt seem to be afraid of him i think that she must have had some sort of hold over him waal there is one thing sim said after a pause i believe this here discovery has saved the doctors life he had made up his mind that he had done with it and wasnt going to try to get better now you see he is all eagerness to get on this fellows scent if he had been a bloodhound he could not have hunted the country closer than he did for that thar tarnal villain he had an idee it wur his business to wipe him out and when the doctor gets set on an idee like that he carries it out it will pull him round now you see if it dont i do hope so indeed sim hugh said warmly the doctor is a wonderful fellow and if it hadnt been for him we should never have arrived at this discovery well i am glad of course i am sorry to hear that my uncle was murdered but as i never saw him that does not affect me so much but i am glad to hear that this man whom i hated a man who illtreated his wife and who spent all his time at horseracing and gambling is not my uncle and has no right to a share in the property that has been in our family for so many years i only hope that this excitement will not do the doctor any harm i am sure that it will do him good sim said confidently but it wur strange to see a man who looked as if he wur just dying out wake up like that but that has always been his way just as quiet as a woman at most times but blazing out when he felt thar wur a great wrong and that it wur his duty to set it right i can tell you now what i know about his story now he knows you are english bills nephew he wont mind your knowing waal his story aint anything much out of the way there are scores who have suffered the like but it didnt have the effect on them like it did on the doctor he is really a doctor trained and edicated he married out east he wur a quiet little fellow and not fit to hustle round in towns and push hisself forward so he and his wife came round and settled in californy somewhere about thar wurnt many americans here then as you may guess he settled down in the south somewhere a hundred miles or so from los angeles he had some money of his own and he bought a place and planted fruit trees and made a sort of little paradise of it that is what he told me he lived on doctoring when it came in his way there wur some rich mexicans about and he looked after most of them but i guess he did more among the poor he had four children and things went on peaceable till then you know gold was discovered and that turned californy upside down it brought pretty nigh all the roughs in creation there they quarrelled with the mexikins and they quarrelled with the injuns and there was trouble of the wust kind there was gangs of fellows as guessed they could make more money by robbing the miners than they could by digging for gold and i reckon they was about right and when they warnt robbing the miners they was plundering the mexikins waal i never heard the rights of it the doctor never could bring hisself to talk about that but one day when he had been twenty miles away to visit a patient he came back and found his place burned down and his wife and the four children murdered he went off his head and some of the people as knew him took him down to los angeles and he wur a year in the madhouse thar he wur very quiet i believe he used ter just sit and cry after a time he changed he never used to speak a word but just sot with those big eyes of his wide open with his face working as if he seen an enemy waal after a year he got better and the mexikins let him out of that madhouse someone had bought his place and the money had been banked for him he took it and went off he never got to hear who the gang wur as had been to his house i think the idee comes to him ever since when he comes across a really bad man that he wur one of that lot and then he goes for him it is either that or he believes he has got a sort of special call to wipe out bad men as i told you he is always ready to do a kindness to anyone and ef he has killed over a score or more of the wust men in californy i guess he has saved five times as many by nussing them when they are ill only he will never give them medicine one of his idees is that if he hadnt gone on doctoring he wouldnt have been away when that gang came to his house and that is why he will never do anything as a doctor again he is just a nuss he says and nothing more now dont you go for to think lightning that the doctor is the least bit mad because he aint and never have been since i first knew him and i should like to see the man as would say that he wur he is just as sensible as i am that aint saying much he is ten times as sensible he always knows the right thing to do does the doctor and does it he air just an ornary man with heaps of good sense and just the kindest heart in the world only when thar is a regular downright bad man in the camp the doctor takes him in hand all to hisself but sim i thought you were going about this gold business this placer directly the doctor was able to move that has got to wait sim said maybe some day or other when this business of yours is over i may come back and see about it maybe i wont ef the doctor is going to england with you i am going that is sartin besides even if i would let him go alone which arent likely maybe his word wouldnt be enough one witness wouldnt do to swear that this man who has stepped into your uncles shoes aint what he pretends to be but if thar is two of us can swear to him as being symonds the gambler itll go a long way but you may have trouble even then anyhow dont you worry yourself about the goldmine like enough we should all have been wiped out by the redskins ef we had tried it now i will just look in and see how the doctor is afore you go sim returned in two minutes saying that the doctor had drank a bowl of soup and had told the orderly who brought it that he was going to sleep as he wanted to get strong being bound to start for a journey in a weeks time as the carriage was not to return until late hugh started to walk over to don ramons as he wanted to think over the strange news he had heard your friend is better i hope the senora said as he entered or you would not have returned so soon he is better senora we have made a strange discovery that has roused him up and given him new life while it has closely affected me with your permission i will tell it to you all is it a story senor hugh the younger girl said i love a story above all things it is a very curious story senorita as i am sure you will agree when you hear it but it is long therefore i pray you to make yourselves comfortable before i begin as soon as they had seated themselves hugh told the story of the flight of his uncle as a boy of his long absence and return of the life at home and the quarrel that had been the cause of his own flight from home and how he had that day discovered that his companions in their late adventure had been his uncles comrades and friends and how comparing notes he had found that his uncle had been murdered and that his assassin had gone over and occupied his place in england many exclamations of surprise were uttered by his auditors and what are you going to do now senor i am going to start for home as soon as the doctor is well enough to travel i should have been willing to have first gone with them upon the expedition upon which we were about to start when your daughters were carried off but sim howlett would not hear of it i intended to have had my say in the matter don ramon said and have only been waiting to complete my arrangements i have not hurried because i knew that until your companion died or recovered you would not be making a move i am as you know senor a very wealthy man wealthy even for a mexican and we have among us fortunes far surpassing those of rich men among the americans in addition to my broad lands my flocks and herds i have some rich silver mines in mexico which alone bring me in far more than we can spend the ransom that these brigands set upon my daughters was as nothing to me and i would have paid it five times over had i been sure of recovering them but you see this was what i was not sure of and the fact that they had not asked more when they knew how wealthy i was in itself assured me that they intended to play me false and that it was their intention to keep them and to continue to extort further sums you and your friends restored my daughters to me now senor hugh you are an english gentleman and i know that you would feel the offer of any reward for your inestimable services as an insult but your three companions are in a different position two are miners and one is a vaquero i know well that in rendering me that service there was no thought of gain in their minds and that they risked their lives as freely as you did and in the same spirit that of a simple desire to rescue women from the hands of scoundrels that however makes no difference whatever in my obligation towards them my banker yesterday received the sum in gold that i directed him to obtain to pay the ransom and i have today given him orders to place three sums of dollars each at their disposal so that they need no longer lead their hard and perilous life but can settle down where they will i know the independence of the americans senor but i rely upon you to convince these three men that they can take this money without feeling that it is a payment for their services they have given me back my daughters at the risk of their lives and they must not refuse to allow me in turn to make them a gift which is but a small token of my gratitude and will leave me still immeasurably their debtor i will indeed do my best to persuade them to accept your gift don ramon and believe that i shall be able to do so the doctor is a man of nearly sixty and howlett is getting on in years and it would be well indeed for them now to give up the hard life they have led for so long as to bill royce i have no doubt whatever i have heard him say many a time that his greatest ambition is to settle down in a big farm and this will enable him to do so in a manner surpassing anything he can ever have dreamt of and now senor about yourself what you have just told us renders it far more difficult than i had hitherto thought we have talked it over i my wife carlos and my daughters i knew that you were a gentleman but i did not know that you were the heir to property i thought you were like others of your countrymen who seeing no opening at home had come out to make your way here what we proposed was this to ask you whether your inclinations had turned most to cattle breeding or to mining in either case we could have helped you on the way had you said ranching i would have put you as manager on one of my largest ranches on such terms that you would in a few years have been its master had you said mining i would have sent you down to my mine in mexico there to have first learned the nature of the work then to have become manager and finally to have been my partner in the affair but now what are we to do you are going home you have an estate awaiting you and our intentions have come to naught i am just as much obliged to you senor as if you had carried them out hugh said warmly and i thank you most deeply for having so kindly proposed to advance my fortunes had i remained here i would indeed have accepted gratefully one or other of your offers as it is i shall want for nothing and i can assure you i feel that the small share i took in the rescue of your daughters is more than repaid by the great kindness that you have shown me the next day hugh explained to two of his friends the gift that don ramon had made them bill royce to whom he first spoke was delighted jehosaphat he exclaimed that is something like i thought when the judge here paid us over our share of the reward for the capture of those brigands that it was about the biggest bit of luck that i had ever heard of but this beats all that don ramon is a prince well no more ranching for me i shall go back east and buy a farm there there was a girl promised to wait for me but as that is eight years ago i dont suppose she has done it still when i get back with dollars in my pocket i reckon i shant be long before i find someone ready to share it with me and you say i can walk right into that bank and draw it in gold yes you can bill but i shouldnt advise you to do it how am i to take the money then lightning the bank will give you an order on some bank in new york and when you get there you can draw the money out as you like sim howlett received the news in silence then he said waal hugh i dont see why we shouldnt take it as don ramon says it isnt much to him and it is a big lump of money to us i would have fought for the gals just as willing if they had been peons but seeing as their fathers got more money than he knows what to do with it is reasonable and natural as he should want to get rid of the obligation to us and anyhow we saved him from having to pay dollars as a beginning and perhaps as much as that over and over again afore he got them back we had best say nothing to the doctor now his mind is set on one thing and he is going to get well so as to carry it out when that job is over it will be time enough to tell him about this i am beginning to feel too stiff for work and the doc was never any good that way and he is getting on now i shall be able to persuade him when the time comes and shall tell him that if he wont keep his money i shall have to send back mine but he is too sensible not to see as i do that it is reasonable on the part of the don and if he dont want it hisself he can give it to a hospital and share mine with me i reckon we shall hang together as long as we both live so you can tell the don it is settled and that though we had no thought of money we wont say no to his offer now that the doctor had made up his mind to live he recovered with wonderful rapidity and in a fortnight was ready to travel hugh took leave of don ramon and his family with great regret they were all much affected at parting with him and he was obliged to promise that if ever he crossed the atlantic again he would come and pay them a visit prince went back to his old stable for the party were going to travel down the rio grande by boat at matamoras the port at its mouth they went by a coasting steamer to galveston and thence by another steamer to new york here royce left them and the other three crossed by a cunarder to liverpool the quiet and seavoyage quite restored the doctor who was by far the most impatient of them to get to the journeys end they had obtained a compete rigout of what sim called storeclothes at new york though hugh had some difficulty in persuading him to adopt the white shirt of civilization on arriving hugh wrote to mr randolph saying that he had news of very great importance to communicate to him but that he did not wish to appear at carlisle until he had seen him and therefore begged him to write and make an appointment to meet him at kendal on the third day after he received the letter the answer came in due time it was short and characteristic my dear hugh i am delighted to hear that you are back in england again you behaved like a fool in going away and an even greater one in staying away so long however i will give you my opinion more fully when i see you i am very glad for many reasons that you have returned i cant think what you want to say to me but will arrive at kendal by the train that gets in at oclock on thursday next when mr randolph got out of the train at kendal hugh was awaiting him on the platform bless me is this you he exclaimed as the young fellow strode up to him you were a big lad when you left but you are a big man now and a tunstall all over well i have been gone nearly three years you see mr randolph and that makes a difference at my age i am past nineteen yes i suppose you are now i think of it well well where are we to go i have got a private sittingroom at the hotel and have two friends there whom i want to introduce you to when i tell you that they have come all the way with me from mexico to do me a service they are you will acknowledge friends worth having well that looks as if there were really something in what you have got to say to me hugh men dont take such a journey as that unless for some strong reason what are your friends for as i have no idea what you have been doing these three years i do not know whether you have been consorting with princes or peasants with a little of both mr randolph one of my friends is a californian miner and as good a specimen of one as you can meet with the other is a doctor or rather as i should say has been a doctor for he has ceased for some years to practise and has been exploring and mining and they have both come over purely for the sake of doing you a service mr randolph asked elevating his eyebrows a little simply that mr randolph strange as it may appear to your legal mind however as this is the hotel where we are putting up you wont be kept much longer in a state of curiosity sim and doctor this is my oldest friend and trustee mr randolph mr randolph these are my two very good friends doctor hunter and mr sim howlett in the states introductions are always performed ceremoniously and the two men shook hands gravely with the lawyer i said mr randolph hugh went on that they were my good friends i may add that they were also the good friends of my late uncle william tunstall of your late uncle hugh what are you thinking about why he is alive and well and mores the pity he muttered to himself i know what i am saying mr randolph they were the dear friends of my late uncle william tunstall who was foully murdered in the town of sacramento in california on his way to san francisco in reply to your summons to return to england mr randolph looked in astonishment from one face to another as if to assure himself that he heard correctly but their gravity showed him that he was not mistaken will tunstall murdered in california he repeated then who is it that the man who murdered him and who having possessed himself of his letters and papers came over here and took his place a gambler of the name of symonds my friend obtained a warrant from the sheriff at sacramento for his arrest on this charge of murder and for upwards of a year dr hunter travelled over california and mexico in search of him it never struck them that it was anything but a case of murder for the money he had on him the idea of the step symonds really took of personating the man he had murdered never occurred to them we met in new mexico and were a considerable time together before they learned that my name was tunstall for out there men are known either by their christian names or by some nickname then at once they said they had years before had a mate of the same name and then gradually on comparing notes the truth came out wellwellwellwell mr randolph murmured seating himself helplessly in a chair this is wonderful you have taken away my breath this is amazing indeed i can hardly take it in yet lad you are sure of what you are saying quite sure that you are making no mistake quite certain however the doctor will tell you the story for himself this the doctor proceeded to do narrating the events at cedar gulch how the murder had been discovered and the body identified how a verdict of wilful murder against some person unknown had been returned by a coroners jury how he and sim howlett had gone down to sacramento and how they had traced the deed to the gambler symonds there can be no doubt mr randolph said when he concluded that it is as you say and that this man is william tunstalls murderer and we shall be able to bring him to justice shall we not hugh asked that was why i wanted you to meet me here so that we could arrange to arrest him before he had any suspicion of my return ah that is a different thing altogether hugh the evidence of your two friends and the confirmation that can doubtless be obtained from sacramento as to the existence of the gravestone erected to william tunstall and of the finding of the coroners court will no doubt enable us to prove to the satisfaction of the courts here that this scoundrel is an impostor but the murder case is different in the first place you would have to bring forward the charge and give your evidence in the united states and obtain an application for his extradition british law has no jurisdiction as to a murder committed in a foreign country having set the united states authorities in action you would return here and aid in obtaining an order from a magistrate here for that extradition the evidence of your friends would doubtless be sufficient to induce a magistrate to grant such an order then he would be taken over to the states and i suppose sent down to california to be tried there your friends here will be best able to judge whether any jury out there would convict a man for a murder committed eight or ten years ago unless the very strongest evidence was forthcoming it would be next to impossible to obtain the evidence of those people the waiters and others from whom your friends gleaned the facts that put them upon the trail of symonds and without that evidence there is no legal proof that would hang a man morally of course there would seem to be no doubt about it he and you were in the mining camp together he knew the object for which will tunstall was leaving for england and that he was entitled to considerable property on arriving here he followed him down to sacramento or at any rate he went down at that time they were together drinking there your uncle was found murdered this man appeared here with the letters that your uncle carried and obtained possession of the estate it is a very strong chain of evidence and were every link proved might suffice to hang him here but at present you have no actual proof that symonds ever was in sacramento with him or was the man he was drinking with and even could you find the waiters and others it is very unlikely that there would be any one to identify him after all this time symonds counsel would argue that there was no proof whatever against his client and he would of course claim that symonds knew nothing about the murder but that he afterwards obtained the papers from the man who really committed the murder and that the idea of coming over to england and personating tunstall then for the first time occurred to him so i think you would find it extremely difficult to get a verdict out in california merely on the evidence of these two gentlemen and of my own that he was possessed of a letter i wrote to tunstall but in any case if you decide to have him arrested on the charge of murder you will have to go back to california to set the law in motion there to get the state authorities to apply to the supreme authorities of the united states to make an application to our government for his arrest and extradition you must do all this before he has any idea that you have returned or at any rate before he knows that you have any idea of his crime otherwise he will of course fly and we shall have no means of stopping him and he might be in fiji before the application for his arrest was received here hugh and his companions looked helplessly at each other this was an altogether unexpected blow they had imagined they had but to give their evidence to ensure the arrest trial and execution of william tunstalls murderer the doctors fingers twitched and the look that sim howlett knew so well came into his eyes he was about to spring to his feet when sim touched him wait doctor he said we will talk about that afterwards then what do you advise mr randolph hugh asked after a long pause i should say that for the present we should content ourselves with arresting him on the charge of impersonation and of obtaining possession of your uncles estate by fraud i think the proof we now have in the evidence of these two gentlemen and in this copy of the finding of the coroners jury will be quite sufficient to ensure his conviction in which case he will get i should say seven years penal servitudeperhaps fourteenfor although he will not be charged with that offence the conviction that he murdered your uncle in order to obtain possession of the estate cannot but be very strong in the mind of the judge yes i should think he would give him fourteen years at least we may of course want some other evidence that can be obtained from sacramento such as an official copy of the record of the proceedings at the coroners inquest but that would be a matter for counsel to decide my own opinion is that the evidence of these two gentlemen that the william tunstall who corresponded with your father received my letter informing him of the will and left the mining camp on his way to england and was murdered on his way to sacramento was the real william tunstall will be quite sufficient it is a very lucky thing for you by the way hugh that there were provisions in your fathers will that if william tunstall died without issue his half of the property came back to you for that clause has effectually prevented him from selling his estate which he would have done long ago had it been possible to do so to my knowledge he has tried over and over again and that clause has always prevented it he has raised a little money on his life interest but that will of course have no claim on the estate now now what do you say it is for you to decide in the one case you will have an enormous amount of trouble and you may finally fail in getting an american jury to find this man guilty of the murder and in any case if they do find him so they will not execute him for a murder committed so long ago and it is probable that he will get off with imprisonment for life and may be acquitted altogether on the other hand if you have him arrested at once here on the charge of impersonation and fraud he is morally certain of getting a sentence which at his age will be pretty nearly equivalent to imprisonment for life i certainly think that is the best plan hugh agreed dont you think so he asked turning to the others i think so sim howlett said at once and even the doctor though less readily agreed since his last illness he had changed a good deal he had no longer fits of abstraction and was brighter and more cheerful than sim howlett had ever seen him before the loss of blood and the low fever that had brought him to deaths door had apparently relieved his brain of a load that had for years oppressed it let it be so he said reluctantly had we met out in the west it would have been different but as it is perhaps it is best late that evening the party proceeded to carlisle and early the next morning mr randolph went with the others to one of the county magistrates and after laying all the facts before him obtained a warrant for the arrest of john symonds alias william tunstall i must congratulate you mr tunstall the magistrate said to hugh after he had signed the warrant upon your discovery this scoundrel has been a disgrace to your name he has been for years a consorter with betting men and blacklegs and stands in the worst odour it is said that he has mortgaged his life interest in the estates and completely ruined himself mr randolph nodded yes i believe he is pretty well at the end of his tether and at any moment he might be turned out of byrneside well there is an end to all that the magistrate said and the men who have proved themselves even sharper rogues than he is will be disappointed i am sorry for the person who has passed as your aunt for i know that she is spoken well of by the people in the neighbourhood and i fancy she has had a very hard time of it with him but of course she must have been his accomplice in this impersonation of your uncle i am sorry for her very sorry hugh said she was always most kind to me and i have reason to believe that she did all in her power to protect me from him you see at my death he would have inherited the whole property and we now know that he was not a man to stick at anything i am sure that she acted in fear of him i have private reasons for believing so too mr randolph said for unless i am greatly mistaken she has deposited a document that in case of her death would have exposed the whole plot in the hands of some legal friends of mine however we will not occupy your time any longer but will start at once with a couple of constables to execute this warrant returning to carlisle mr randolph secured the services of two constables and hiring vehicles they started at once for byrneside on arriving there mr randolph said to the servant announce me to mr tunstall do not say that i am not alone following him closely they went across the hall and as he opened the door and announced mr randolph the others entered the man was standing on the hearthrug the woman looked flushed and excited they were evidently in the midst of a quarrel symonds looked up in angry surprise when the party entered do your duty mr randolph said to one of the constables john symonds i arrest you under a warrant on the charge of impersonation and fraud a deep mexican oath burst from the lips of the man then he stood quiet again who dares bring such a charge against me he asked i do hugh said stepping forward and these are my witnesses men who knew you at cedar gulch and who identified the body of my murdered uncle traitress symonds exclaimed in mexican and in an instant his arm was stretched out and there was a report of a pistol and she sent you out he exclaimed turning to hugh but as he was in the act of again raising his arm there was the report of another pistol and he fell shot through the brain the others stood stupefied at the sudden catastrophe but the doctor said quietly i saw his hand go behind him and knew he was up to mischief i ought not to have waited it is always a mistake to wait in these cases hugh sprang forward towards the woman who had been kind to him but she had fallen back in her chair the gamblers bullet had done its work it had struck her on the temple and death had been instantaneous the excitement in the county when the news spread of what had taken place at byrneside was great indeed and the revelations made before the coroners jury greatly added to it they returned a verdict that lola symonds had been wilfully murdered by john symonds and that the latter had come by his death at the hands of frank hunter who had justifiably shot at and killed him while opposing by armed means the officers of the law and that no blame attaches to the said frank hunter when all was over hugh was warmly congratulated by the gentlemen who had come in to be present at the inquest upon his recovery of the whole of his fathers estate and upon his escape from the danger he had certainly run at the hands of the murderer of his uncle he was much affected by the death of the woman he still thought of as his aunt and the document that she deposited at the lawyers in london showed how completely she had acted under fear of her husband and that she had knowingly risked her life to save his the doctor and sim howlett remained for a fortnight with him at byrneside he had urged upon them to make it their home for a while and to settle near him but at the end of that time the doctor said to him one evening sim and i have talked matters over hugh and we have made up our minds i have heard from him that we are each the owners of dollars i should not have taken it had i known it at the time but i should not like to hurt the dons feelings by sending it back now and perhaps it will do more good in my hands than in his so sim and i are going back to california we shall buy a place near the spot where i lived many years agosim tells me he has told you the storyand there we shall finish our days when we die the money will go to charities that is our plan lad we shall find plenty to help and what with that and a little gardening our time will be well occupied and sim and i will have plenty in the past to look back upon and talk about and so a week later they sailed hugh went with them to liverpool and saw them off and then travelled for a time on the continent for byrneside was repugnant to him after the tragedy that had been enacted there on his return he went down to norfolk and stayed for some time with luscombe and the visit was so pleasant that it was repeated whenever he happened to be in england three years later he crossed the atlantic again he traversed the states more easily now for the railway across was almost completed after spending a month in california with the doctor and sim howlett whom he found well and happy he visited don ramon at el paso there had been changes here for both don carlos and his two sisters were married and all insisted upon his being their guest for a time his first visit after his return to england was again to norfolk it was a short but important one and on its termination he went back to byrneside to give orders for many changes and alterations that were to be made with all speed in view of the coming of a new mistress it had for some time past been apparent to luscombe that the remark he had laughingly made years before on the banks of the canadian was likely to bear fruit and that his sister phillis constituted no small portion of the attraction that brought hugh down to norfolk indeed before leaving for the states hugh had chatted the matter over with him of course you have seen luscombe how it has been i shall be threeandtwenty by the time i get back which is quite young enough for a man to talk about marriage as soon as i do i shall ask phillis just as well to wait hugh it seems to me that you and phillis pretty well understand each other but i dont see any use in engagements till one can fix a date for the marriage and as you have made up your mind to go on this trip it will save you both a lot of trouble in the way of writing to leave it alone until you come back it is a horrid nuisance to keep on writing letters when you are travelling besides you know the governor has strong ideas against early marriages and will think you quite young enough then and so i should say leave it as it stands and so hugh had left it but it is doubtful whether he had left phillis quite in ignorance of what would be said on his return at any rate no time was required by her before giving an answer to the question when it was put and two months later the marriage took place many as were the presents that the bride received they were thrown completely into the shade by that which arrived as a joint gift from don ramon and his family a few days before the wedding being sent by their order from tiffanys the great jeweller of new york it consisted of a case of jewellery of extraordinary value and magnificence and was as mr luscombe senior remarked suitable rather for a princess of royal blood than for the wife of a cumberland squire the return of mr and mrs tunstall after the termination of their honeymoon to byrneside was hailed with great rejoicing by the tenantry who were happy to know that the old state of things had at last returned and that a resident landlord with an english wife would in future be established in the family mansion the end typography by j s cushing co boston presswork by
