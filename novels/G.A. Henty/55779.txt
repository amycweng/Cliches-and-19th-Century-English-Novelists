to herat and cabul illustration angus and pottinger watching the fight from the walls of herat frontispiece to herat and cabul a story of the first afghan war by ga henty author of with buller in natal at the point of the bayonet the bravest of the brave won by the sword c with eight illustrations by charles m sheldon new york charles scribners sons copyright by charles scribners sons published september the caxton press new york preface in the military history of this country there is no darker page than the destruction of a considerable british force in the terrible defiles between cabul and jellalabad in january of all the wars in which our troops have taken part never was one entered upon so recklessly or so unjustifiably the ruler of afghanistan dost mahomed was sincerely anxious for our friendship he was alarmed at the menacing attitude of russia which in conjunction with persia was threatening his dominions and intriguing with the princes at candahar our commissioner at cabul mr burnes was convinced of the ameers honesty of intention and protested most strongly against the course taken by the indian government who determined upon setting up a discredited prince who had for many years been a fugitive in india in place of dost mahomed in spite of his remonstrances the war was undertaken nothing could have been worse than the arrangements for it and the troops suffered terribly from thirst and want of transport however they reached cabul with comparatively little fighting dost mahomed fled and the puppet shah soojah was set up in his place but he was only kept there by british bayonets and for two years he was so protected gradually however the british force was withdrawn until only some five thousand troops remained to support him well led they would have been amply sufficient for the purpose for though the afghan tribesmen were dangerous among their mountains they could not for a moment have stood against them in the open field unhappily the general was old and infirm incapable of decision of any kind and in his imbecile hands the troops who in october could have met the whole forces of afghanistan in fight were kept inactive while the afghans pillaged the stores with the provisions for the winter and insulted and bearded them in every way thus a fine body of fighting men were reduced to such depths of discontent and shame that when the unworthy order for retreat before their exulting enemy was given they had lost all confidence in themselves or their officers and weakened by hunger and hampered by an enormous train of camp followers they went as sheep to the slaughter in the trap the afghans had prepared for them it would almost seem that their fate was a punishment for the injustice of the war misfortunes have befallen our arms but never one so dark and disgraceful as this the shame of the disaster was redeemed only by the heroic garrison of jellalabad which although but onefourth of the strength of that at cabul sallied out after a noble defence and routed the army which dost mahomeds son akbar had assembled for their destruction contents chap page i alone in the world ii an unexpected meeting

his goods to the prisoners map of afghanistan and northwest frontier of india to herat and cabul chapter i alone in the world on the th of september a lad was standing before mr mneill the british minister at the persian court both looked grave for the interview was an important one the former felt that it was the turningpoint of his life the opening of a fresh career the introduction to a service in which he might gain honourable distinction and credit to the british minister it was of scarcely less importance for the interests of great britain were gravely involved in the success of the mission that he was now entrusting to this young clerk in the employment of the embassy it was nothing less than thwarting the designs of persia aided and instigated by russia to capture herat and to conquer at least the western portion of afghanistan the alliance of the princes of candahar having already been secured angus campbell was now about sixteen years old his father was a trader who had for twelve years been settled in tabriz carrying on business on his own account in some branches of trade and as agent for a scotch firm in others the boy had been left with some relations in scotland until he was twelve years old when his parents had paid a short visit to their friends in scotland and had brought him back with them the change of life was not an agreeable one to him in the eight years that had elapsed since he had last seen his parents he had of course almost forgotten them and it would be some time before any real affection for them would spring up it was the companionship of his schoolfellows that he missed rather than that of his aunt a strict woman who made no allowance whatever for a boys restlessness and love of fun and who was continually shocked by the complaints made by members of her chapel as to the conduct of the boys at dr murrays it was the principal school in the little town the teaching was good the application of the rod frequent but neither teaching nor thrashing availed to soften the manners of the healthy and somewhat riotous lads who once out of school threw themselves with all their hearts into their favourite diversions among which the most conspicuous were fishing in forbidden parts of the river birdnesting in woods which were kept strictly private and guarded by keepers playing hareandhounds across the fields of the crustiest of farmers and above all engaging in desperate battles with the boys of other schools in all these pastimes angus campbell took as large a share as his age entitled him to and the state of his clothes and his face when he returned home was a source of continual amazement and irritation to his aunt she had even endeavoured to arrange for a deputation to wait upon dr murray with a list of grievances suffered by the townspeople such as broken windows the yells and shouts of conflict and the destruction of the boys garments caused by the various fights and to propose that the hours of play should be shortened and that some sort of supervision should be exercised at all times over the boys however although there were many who agreed with her that the present state of things was disgraceful nothing came of the movement for the fathers remembering their own boyhood were to a man against the idea we did just the same in our young days they said and are none the worse for it now lads cannot be like lassies and we dont want them to be even if they could if you were to speak to the doctor he would just laugh in your faces and would tell you that he kept a school for boys and not for girls if you have complaints to make against any of his scholars make them and he will punish the lads as they deserve his boys are no worse than others and he does not wish to see them better if they do some mischief occasionally it is because they are in good health and in good spirits and a lad of that kind is far more likely to turn out well than one who spends all his spare time in poring over his books as the doctors opinions on these subjects were known to all the town miss campbells proposal came to nothing she would herself have gone to him to complain of the doings of her nephew but there was a strong feeling in the town that while all things connected with the school were under the doctors charge parents should take other matters into their own hands and maintain discipline by the use of the tawse in their own dwellings and that they had no right to trouble dr murray about private delinquencies he had indeed sufficient on his hands for although no actual supervision was maintained when the lads were once dismissed from school there were bounds set beyond which they were not allowed to go and when they were caught upon any of their frequent forays beyond these limits he had to adjudicate and punish the offenders but it was not often that this happened for while the boys considered it not only justifiable but meritorious to break bounds they looked upon anyone caught in the act of showing a want of craft and of judgment and so having good legs and lungs they were generally able to outdistance their pursuers thus then when his parents returned to scotland they found angus a healthy active and highspirited boy somewhat rough in manners but straightforward and honourable for it was a tradition in the school that no boy should ever try to screen himself by a lie when questioned by his father he acknowledged that he would like to stay at school for a few years longer and i should like you to do so too angus but it is a long long journey and a difficult one from tabriz to scotland and it may be many years before i return home again it is a journey that it is impossible for a boy to make alone but this is not the only reason why i wish to take you back i want to train you to help me in my business and until you speak persian fluently you will be of no use whatever to me at your age you will pick it up rapidly far more rapidly than you could if you did not begin till you were seventeen or eighteen we will generally speak to you in persian and you will have many opportunities for practising it in two years you ought to speak it like a native arabic will also be very useful to you i have constant communications with india with turkey and with herat i buy goods from all these countries and sell persian products to them in afghanistan indeed persian is spoken generally by the trading and upper classes but arabic is essential to trade with constantinople and smyrna with bokhara and the turkomans and it is our chief medium of communication with india traders who although speaking several distinct languages all have more or less knowledge of arabic it has been a great privation to your mother and myself to be so many years without you we have no other children and it would be a great joy and comfort to our lives as well as a great assistance to me in my business to have you with me i understand father the boy said i did not think of these things before i am sure i should be very glad to be able to help you and i wont say another word about being sorry to leave all my friends it is quite natural that you should be sorry angus it would be strange indeed if you were not however i dont think you will dislike the life out there when you get accustomed to it we will certainly do our best to make you happy so angus had returned with them and soon settled down to his new life devoting himself earnestly to acquiring the language at the end of six months he came to speak it fairly and before he had been out a year could have passed as a persian lad at the same time he had made considerable progress in arabic his father had then dressed him in persian fashion there was a good deal of illfeeling among the lower class against foreigners and the pugnacity that had been fostered in angus at school had frequent opportunities of displaying itself for in spite of good resolutions to the contrary he was often goaded into fury by the taunts and abuse with which the boys assailed him when he went out alone and had thrown himself upon them and used his fists with such effect that he had sometimes put to flight half a dozen lads of his own age but in persian costume he could move about the streets unnoticed and although he did not like the change at first he acknowledged that it was useful for his father pointed out to him that it was essential that nothing should take place that could add to the dislike with which foreigners were regarded already several angry complaints had been made by neighbours of the state in which their sons had come home after an encounter with him nearly four years after angus arrived at tabriz the plague made its appearance in persia it spread rapidly and tabriz was one of the cities which suffered most severely one evening mr campbell returned home from a visit to a customer and complained of feeling unwell the next morning it was too evident that he had caught the infection before nightfall his wife also sickened twentyfour hours later both were dead mr campbell had a long talk with his son as soon as the disease manifested itself in the case of his wife angus he said you must prepare for the worst the cases of recovery are few indeed the servants have already fled and even did i wish you to leave us i know that it would be too late now gods will be done my boy and i can only hope that you may be spared however that is in his hands you have been my assistant now for the past three years and know how matters stand i have no debts the books will show you how much is due to me from the house at home and how much by my agent at bombay the stock of goods in the warehouse is worth a considerable sum i am unable to think very clearly now or to advise you what to do should you be left alone but it is clear to me that you are too young yet to manage the business and it is not likely that the firm would entrust their affairs to a lad of your age i should say therefore that you had best dispose of all the goods the books will show you their prices as for yourself i will give you no advice it will be open to you to return to england or to go to bombay and i have no doubt my agent there will obtain employment for you especially as you will have money to embark in any business you may go into but do not invest a penny until you become of age you will by that time be able to judge wisely whether the business you are in is that in which you can best employ your mind whatever you do do not remain in tabriz as is always the case in times of plague or famine there is sedition and trouble and foreigners become the object of hatred for the poor people have some sort of superstitious idea that they are responsible for the scourge the best thing you can do is to consult our armenian friend who is also our viceconsul he will view matters more clearly than i can do at present put your trust always in god my boy my own opinion is that you had better remain in the east your knowledge of languages would be absolutely useless to you at home and you could only hope to obtain a place in a countinghouse i will do as you tell me father angus said trying to speak steadily i will try always to be what you would wish me his grief was terrible when his mother expired two or three hours after his father he roused himself however to see to the simple preparations for their funeral and late that evening buried them in the garden behind the house the next day as he was sitting alone he heard a tumult in the street looking out he saw that several houses which he knew belonged to foreign traders were in flames and a mob of maddened men were rushing down the street towards his house resistance would have been madness he ran to the safe seized the bag containing the cash and had just time to run out at the back of the house and escape by the gate in the garden when the rioters burst in for a few minutes they were engaged in the work of pillage shawls from cashmere native embroidered silks costly goods from india turkish persian turkoman and heratee carpets and british goods of all kinds were scrambled and fought for when the house was sacked from top to bottom it was set on fire and as a volume of smoke rose from it angus turned away from the spot where from a distance he had been watching the scene and made his way to the house of the armenian merchant the loss of the house and the contents of the warehouse affected him littlealthough he knew that it had cost him more than half his inheritancebut this was as nothing to what he had so recently suffered the viceconsul had been an intimate friend of the family on approaching his house angus stood some distance from the door and called a servant looked out will you tell izaac effendi that i desire greatly to speak to him the armenian quickly came to the door my poor lad he said i grieve deeply for you i heard of your losses and the news has just been brought in of the burning of the house and magazine but why do you stand so far away because i would not bring contagion near you effendi i came to tell you what had happened and to say that i shall buy some food and go out into the country and there remain until i die of the plague or can be sure that i have escaped contagion you will come in here at once the armenian said does not one in the street run against persons who may be affected many of my compatriots have come here to ask my advice and some of them have stricken friends in their houses since i came to reside here i have four times seen the plague raging and each time it has passed me over whether it is the will of god that i should thus be spared i know not but i am in his hands come in lad i will take no denial shall i desert my friends when they most need comfort and aid what is my friendship worth if i should now in your hour of need turn my back upon you come in i pray you seeing that the old man was thoroughly in earnest angus too greatly touched by his kindness even to speak silently entered the house i will take you through at once to the pavilion in the garden the merchant said although i have no fear myself there are my servants and clerks tis like enough that some of them may be stricken for they like all of us are liable to be smitten when they go into the streets and should this be so they might blame me for your presence here therefore tis best that you should for three or four days live in the pavilion i will bring you out cushions and pillows but i do not think that you will be attacked had you taken the plague you would probably have shown symptoms of it ere now keep your thoughts from dwelling on it i will bring you out some books try to fix your mind on them and abstain as much as possible from dwelling on the past i will bring your food out to you and we will talk together tomorrow there is much that you will have to consider what are you thinking of doing his host asked him when he came in to see him on the morning after his arrival i have been trying to think but i cannot decide on anything i do not wish to go back to scotland i have an aunt living there but she would not welcome me warmly besides if i were to do so i do not see how i could earn my living for my knowledge of persian and arabic would be of no use to me if i had been ten years older the firm for whom my father was agent might have appointed me in his place but of course i am a great deal too young for that they acted as his agents also and bought for him the goods in which he dealt outside their business and he told me when he was taken suddenly ill that they had about a thousand pounds of his money in their hands that would be of no use to me now and i should very much prefer not to touch it until i am old enough to set up in trade the position is certainly a grave one angus i agree with you that it would be better for you on all accounts to remain out here at any rate for a time your father had correspondents also in bombay had he not yes he made purchases of persian goods for a house there but he did not do much for them as the trade is principally in the hands of the parsees there is one thing that you might do the armenian said after thinking for some time i have heard that mr mneill is on his way to teheran as british minister there you might be able to obtain a post in his embassy you can write both persian and arabic and might be useful in many ways it would not be necessary for you to ask a large salary but however small it might lead the way to better things at present there is much political disturbance the shah is meditating an attack upon herat and has already given orders for an army to be collected certainly the british government will feel jealous of any movement that would extend the power of persia farther towards afghanistan especially as they are i hear about to take steps to interfere in that country by placing a rival of dost mahomed on the throne then too it is no secret that russia is encouraging the shah and it is probable that russian influence will become predominant in persia the conquest of herat would matter little to england were it by persia alone for persia is powerless to damage india but with persia acting as the tool of russia which some day or other will assuredly swallow her up the matter is very much more serious this being so there can be little doubt that the new british minister will be charged with a mission to counteract the designs of russia as much as possible and might be glad to take into his employment one who knows the language well and could gather news for him in the guise of a nativefor there are so many dialects spoken in different parts of the country that any imperfection of speech would pass unnoticed i think that would be an excellent plan sir if it could be carried out i will give you a letter stating the circumstances speaking of the esteem in which your father was held and vouching for your character if you decide to take this course think it would be well for you to leave at once for from what i hear of the new ministers course you would then arrive at teheran within two or three days of his getting there and might have a better chance therefore of obtaining a post in his office as to the money you speak of it seems to me that as your country is a long way off it would be better if it could be sent to the house with which you father had dealings at bombay since there are constantly vessels sailing thither from ports in the persian gulf and whether you saw an opportunity for doing a trade with india or thought of going there yourself it would be an advantage to have your money ready to your hand you must already know a good deal of trade matters having as i know worked as your fathers assistant for the past two years at any rate a year or two at teheran in the service of the british minister would be an advantage to you in many respects there is a caravan starting tomorrow that is why i suggested that you should leave at once a merchant who travels with it is a friend of mine and i can recommend you to his care but it would certainly be best for you to travel as a native i thank you sir very heartily and shall certainly do as you advise me for as an english lad going alone with a caravan i could scarcely hope to escape trouble with cameldrivers and others if i fail to obtain employment at the embassy i shall probably travel down with a caravan to bushire and take ship to bombay i have plenty of money to do that for the expense of travelling with a caravan is very smallnothing is needed except for foodand the passage in a native craft would not be more than a pound or two i have nearly two hundred so that i could live for a long time in bombay if i failed to obtain employment there when it is gone i could at least enlist in one of the british regiments it is a poor trade soldiering lad though in your case it might not do you harm for a few years especially if you turned your attention to learning some of the indian languages with such knowledge you should certainly have no difficulty in making your way with the little capital you will receive from home and so it was settled and angus travelled to teheran the journey did him good he had bought a donkey and trotting along by the side of the merchant to whom his friend had introduced him the novelty of the life the strangeness of passing as a native among the travellers and the conversation of the persian merchant kept him from brooding over his sorrows he felt that suddenly thrown as he was upon his own resources and compelled to think and act for himself when but a fortnight before he had others to think and care for him he must bear himself like a man it was only at night when rolled in a blanket he prepared to sleep that he gave way and lay for hours weeping over his loss the merchant who had been much pleased with his conversation and had made many enquiries as to the ways of his countrymen and to whom he had told his plans invited angus to take up his abode with him at a khan until he found whether he could obtain employment at the british ministers issuing into the town after having seen his animals attended to and his goods stowed away the merchant went to see some friends and on his return told angus that the new british minister had arrived two days before the next morning angus went to the envoys and sent in the letter with which the armenian had furnished him together with the translation which he had made and the viceconsul had signed and stamped he had not waited many minutes when one of the attendants came to him and led him in to the ministers room you are mr campbell the young gentleman of whom our viceconsul at tabriz writes to me yes sir it is a sad story that he has told me and i would willingly do anything in my power for a young countryman thus left so sadly and suddenly on his own resources in a foreign land he tells me that you speak arabic as well as persian and have some acquaintance with armenian colloquially though you cannot write it as you can the two former languages do you know any other language at all i know some kurdish one of my fathers porters was a kurd and i was able to get on fairly with him he tells me that it is your wish to obtain employment of some sort with me as at present you are not old enough to enter upon trade for yourself and that you do not wish to return to scotland no sir i have been away for four years and were i to go back i should lose the advantage that i have gained in learning these eastern languages quite right very sensibly decided the minister said and i suppose that you know something of trade yes sir my father took much pains in instructing me and for the past two years i have acted as his assistant and have learned the value of most articles of trade the minister nodded very good it will doubtless be of value to you hereafter however i can at present utilize your services here i have with me my secretary and i have the dragoman employed by my predecessor who speaks half a dozen languages but in many ways a sharp young fellow like yourself able if necessary to mix with the people as one of themselves and to gather me information as to popular opinion and who can read and write persian fluently would be a welcome addition to my staff of course i cannot offer you high pay as i have an allowance for the expenses of my office upon the same scale as that of my predecessor the pay is quite a secondary matter with me sir even if there were no pay i should be glad to accept a temporary post under you as it would be a great advantage to me afterwards to have been employed by you and i should at least have time to decide what to do next i will think the matter over the minister said at any rate there will be a room assigned to you in the house and for the present thirty shillings a week for your living you had better continue to wear your persian attire have you european clothes with you no sir everything was burnt the next day angus was installed in a small room next to that of the secretary and set to work translating persian proclamations edicts and other matters a fortnight later the minister decided that he should be dressed as a european when in the house and a tailor was sent for and ordered to make him clothes of the same style as a suit of the secretarys which was given him to use as a pattern the minister nodded approvingly when he entered the little office on the day when angus first wore his new suit his work was now changed and while visitors of distinction were ushered in directly to the minister and others of less importance were first interviewed by the secretary people coming in with complaints or petitions were shown in to angus who took down what they had to say and then dismissed them to call the next day for an answer he was amused at the general impression prevailing among these people that if the british minister could be induced to take up their cases he could obtain justice and redress for them and how evidently they disbelieved his assurances that a foreign official could not interfere in such matters six months passed the shah had started with his army towards herat and the evidences that russia was at the bottom of the movement and that he was acting in accordance with her advice became stronger and stronger angus stood high in the ministers good opinion from the steadiness with which he worked the tact and good temper that he showed with the natives he interviewed and the willingness with which he would after the office was closed work until late at night at his translations sometimes he changed his attire again and slightly darkening his face and tucking away his light hair would go out into the streets mingle with the crowd in busy quarters and listen to the talk from the fact that the expedition against herat was seldom spoken of he gathered that the war was not popular except among the trading class who thought that the possession of herat would lead to a large increase of trade with afghanistan and even through candahar to northern india it was however but seldom that he went on these expeditions for it was certain that any private arrangement that had been made between the shah and russia would be known only to two of the formers principal officers one evening mr mneill summoned him to his own apartment and said i have obtained information from a source i can rely upon that russia is encouraging the shah and that there are other russian officers besides their accredited envoy in the shahs camp mr corbould started half an hour ago and will carry the news himself to london it is too important to be trusted to other hands i have no doubt whatever that orders will be sent to me at once to mediate between the parties and to put a certain amount of pressure upon the shah herat is considered the key of afghanistan and although we could do nothing to assist its defenders even were a force to start at once from bombay i fancy that i should be authorized to say to the shah that england would greatly resent the town being permanently occupied and that she might even go so far as to blockade the ports on the persian gulf and so put a stop to the whole trade of persia with india the great question of course is how long herat can hold out against the persians the place has the reputation of being strong but i hear that the fortifications are much dilapidated the afghans are likely to fight well up to a certain point but they might and probably would get disheartened after a time i am anxious to assure them that if they will but hold out england will do all in her power to induce the persians to give up the siege the messenger i send must at once be altogether trustworthy must be able to make his way through the country as a native and must have a sufficient knowledge of arabic to make himself understood there although this is less important as there must be many traders in the town who understand persian if you would entrust me with the message sir i would gladly undertake to carry it to herat that was my purpose in sending for you mr campbell i have the greatest confidence in you and as your persian is good enough to pass in teheran it is certainly good enough for the country districts but it is not only because i should trust you thoroughly and have every faith in your being able to carry out the mission but also because i thought that it would be of great utility to you to be engaged in the performance of such a mission if herat defends itself successfully until relieved either by afghan troops or as a result of our diplomacy it will undoubtedly be a feather in the cap of the gentleman i select to undertake the commission of encouraging the heratees to hold out and with my report of the valuable services that you have rendered here might obtain for you a better position in the diplomatic service than i can offer you or some post in india where your knowledge of persian and arabic would be valuable i thank you very much indeed sir the change to an active life would not only be very pleasant to me but i can quite understand that if good comes of it i might benefit greatly would you wish me to return as soon as i have delivered your message no i think it would be better for you to remain there i myself will shortly join the shah in his camp the office here will be closed on the following day angus started the back of his head having been shaved his hair was completely covered by his turban he wore wide turkish trousers a loosely fitting blue embroidered vest and a long kaftan thickly padded and falling below his knees a coloured sash with two longbarrelled pistols and a curved sword his attire was that of a persian trader he rode on a camel which although not a handsome animal to look at was of good blood and fast slung over his shoulder was a long matchlock he carried behind him a great bale of goods accompanying him was a persian boy whose father was a doorkeeper at the mission the boy himself was a hangeron there he was a brightfaced lad of some fifteen years old who ran messages and made himself generally useful between him and angus a sort of friendship had sprung up and of an evening when the latter went out he often took the boy with him his shrewdness and chatter being a relief after a long days work in the office azim had accepted with delight anguss proposal that he should accompany him as his attendant on a journey that he was about to make the matter was settled in a few minutes a donkey purchased for him suitable clothes for travel and a couple of kurd blankets angus himself had a large furlined coat reaching to his feet and four blankets two of which were of very large size and capable of being made into a tent for he knew that the khans and the houses in the villages swarmed with insects and was determined that unless circumstances prevented it he would always encamp in the open air azims camel carried in addition to a bale of goods two waterskins a sufficient supply of flour for the journey a bag of ground coffee and another of sugar meat would always be procurable it was a long journey but angus enjoyed it the road was a frequented one for a considerable trade was carried on between herat and persia and traders frequently passed along azim turned out a bright and intelligent companion and no suspicion was anywhere entertained that angus was aught but what he seemed some little surprise however was occasionally expressed that he should be making the journey at a time when the persian army was marching against herat to such remarks he always replied that he should probably stay there but a few days and hoped to be well on the road to candahar before the army arrived at herat he was certain that he should arrive in time for the army with its huge baggage train had already taken nearly six months in accomplishing a journey that he had performed in little over as many weeks chapter ii an unexpected meeting when near the frontier angus sold the camels he had already parted with all the goods that he had carried and he now bought peasant dresses such as those worn by the afghan cultivators for himself and azim it was but some seventy miles on to herat but the persian army was on the direct road having just laid siege to ghorian and it was necessary to make a detour to avoid both the plundering parties of the persians and the afghan horsemen who would be hovering round the enemys camp before crossing the frontier he purchased sufficient food to last for four days as it would be dangerous to enter any place where they might be accosted as their ignorance of the language would seem to prove that they were persian spies both carried swords and long knives as a protection rather from the attacks of village dogs than from trouble with men as it was now november and the weather was becoming cold at night they were glad of the long coats lined with sheepskin the country through which they were passing was fertile and when on the afternoon of the third day they came in sight of herat even azim was struck with the richness and fertility of the country it was well watered by several small streams fortified villages were scattered here and there over the plain round these were gardens orchards and vineyards the intervening spaces being in summer covered by wide expanses of corn as they neared the city they saw that numbers of people from the villages were making their way towards it many with bullock waggons carrying stores of grain and household goods while women and men were alike loaded they entered the gate of the city unquestioned and unnoticed in the crowd of horse and footmen cattle bullockcarts sheep and goats striking as was the appearance of the town without inside everything showed signs of neglect and poverty herat contained some fortyfive thousand inhabitants the majority of these were persian sheeahs once the capital of the great empire of tamerlane it had greatly fallen from its former splendour its decline having been rapid since its capture from the persians by the afghans in it had been retaken by the persians and recaptured by the afghans under whose savage rule its prosperity had greatly diminished it was still an important trading centre being situated on the one great thoroughfare between india and russia and being celebrated for the beauty of its carpets and for the temper of its swordblades its trade was principally in the hands of hindoos who numbered no fewer than a thousand some of whom were traders while others were occupied in the various branches of work to which they had been accustomed in india there were several families of armenians and a few jews the city had for years suffered under the horrible tyranny of shah kamran now an old and feeble man and of his wuzeer or minister yar mahomed khan who held the post of governor of the city under these men neither life nor property was respected men and women were seized and sold into slavery under the smallest pretext often without any attempt whatever to justify the action armed bands of ruffians broke into the houses and plundered at their will and the peaceful portion of the population were in a state of utter misery and despair on entering the gate angus proceeded along the bazaar an arched street about a mile long which extended from one side of the city to the other this was crossed at right angles by another bazaar of equal length and the city which was built in the form of a square was thus divided into four quarters round the wall was a wide ditch which was at all times kept full of water from springs rising in the town when he had proceeded some distance angus heard two traders in one of the shops speaking in armenian he at once entered effendi he said in that language i am a stranger here and but newly arrived can you tell me where i can procure a lodging the two men looked in surprise at this afghan peasant who addressed them in their own tongue and one of them after a moments hesitation bade him come into his private apartment behind the shop who are you he said and how come you to speak our language i learned it in conversation with some of your people in tabriz and especially from one who was the british viceconsul there i also speak persian and arabic the traders surprise increased as angus spoke but who are you then who have travelled so far and how is it that having learned so many languages you are now here as a peasant it is a disguise angus said my father was a british merchant at tabriz and i myself am in the service of the british minister at teheran and am the bearer of a letter from him to shah kamran you are young indeed my son to be engaged on so difficult and dangerous a mission surely i can find you a lodging all trade is at a standstill now and we armenians suffer like the rest my brother whom you saw in the shop is a weaver of carpets but none will buy carpets now he has a house larger than his needs and would i am sure gladly take you in he called his brother in from the front and explained to him who this strange visitor was and what he wanted i have money angus said and am prepared to pay well for my accommodation i have a servant with me he is the son of a doorkeeper at the embassy and is altogether faithful and trustworthy unfortunately i do not speak the afghan tongue that will matter little in the town the majority of the people still speak persian although they may know pushtoo it is the same with many of the fugitives who have come in from the plain you will have difficulty in seeing the prince he is old and feeble and for the greater part of his time he is drunk everything is therefore in the hands of the wuzeer who is one of the worst of mencruel avaricious and unscrupulous we have had many tyrants but he is the worst and i can assure you that the success of the persians would fill all but the afghan portion of the population with the deepest joy it will be necessary for you to see him first before you see shah kamran the hour is getting late and i shall close my shop shortly if you will go round with my brother to his house i will join you there presently we all love and respect the english they have always been our good friends and glad indeed should we be were they masters here as they are in india for i have been there and know how just is their rulehow they oppress no one and will not suffer others to do so this would be a happy city indeed if your people were our masters a short walk brought angus and azim to the house of the carpetweaver it was of some size but bore a neglected and povertystricken aspect which was not belied by its appearance when they entered the doors stood open and it could be seen that looms stood idle now in all the rooms the man led the way upstairs and unlocking a door there entered the family apartments the contrast between these and the floor below was great indeed afghan carpets covered the passages and floors wellstuffed divans ran round the rooms and although there were no signs of wealth everything pointed to comfort the armenian led them into a room where his wife and two daughters were seated they rose in some surprise at seeing him enter accompanied by an afghan peasant azim had remained in the passage without do not be surprised the trader said this person is not what he looks but is an english effendi the bearer of a letter from his minister at teheran to shah kamran he is going to do us the honour to lodge here for a time he speaks our language as well as persian he is welcome his wife said courteously and indeed his presence here will afford us a protection which we shall need more than ever when the passions of the people are excited by the siege as you are accustomed to our ways the husband said you will not be surprised at my bringing you in here or at seeing the women unveiled as a rule everywhere in the east we adopt the customs of the country so far that our women veil when they go out and my wife and daughters would do the same here if they were to walk through the streets but my daughters have not left the house since they were children my wife has not done so since we took up our abode here twentythree years ago angus uttered an exclamation of surprise you would not be astonished if you knew the lawlessness that prevails here no young woman can venture safely into the streets for as soon as a report that she was goodlooking reached kamran she would be seized and carried off to his harem even in broad daylight no respectable woman would think of going out save with an armed escort that is indeed a terrible state of things we are accustomed to it now effendi and at any rate we are not molested here i make a present now and then to yar mahomed khan and also to his principal officer and i am let alone by them my brother does the same they know that i am a carpetweaver employing eight or ten men and as they believe i could not be squeezed to any large amount they are satisfied to let us go on so as long as we keep quietly at home we are not molested and we both intend ere long to move from here to teheran or tabriz we have only been waiting until we can manage to get away with our belongings without attracting notice we have done very well since we came here for trade has been good my brother buys up the products of many other looms and we have both made good profits but we take care that we do not keep more money than is necessary here now i will show you the room that will be at your disposal you will i hope join us at our family meals so that we shall not have to cook for you separately certainly it would be very much more pleasant for me the terms were arranged without difficulty for the armenian felt that it might be a great protection for them to have an englishman in the house the merchant then arranged to obtain a dress for angus similar to that worn by himself and his brother this was brought in on the following morning having put it on angus went out accompanied by azim he decided to wait for a day or two before seeing the wuzeer so as to ascertain the state of things in the town and the preparations for defence he was going through one of the narrow streets when a loaded camel came along behind him its paniers nearly touching the houses on each side its rider did not give the usual shout of warning and angus had but just time to jump into a doorway when it brushed past him the afghan driver grinning maliciously at so nearly upsetting one whom he regarded as a sheeah trader a man walking just in front of him who was not quick enough to get out of the camels way was knocked down as he got up angus to his astonishment heard him mutter angrily confound you i wish i had you outside this town i would give you a lesson you would not forget astonished to find another englishman here in afghan costume angus stepped up to him and said i did not expect to find an englishman here sir the other turned sharply round i am as surprised as you can be sir but we had better not be speaking english here i am lodging within fifty yards of this if you will follow me i will take you there and we can then introduce ourselves properly in three minutes they were in the room occupied by the stranger as host i will introduce myself first he said with a smile my name is eldred pottinger i have been travelling through afghanistan on an unofficial mission to explore and report on the country to my uncle colonel pottinger resident in scinde happening to arrive here at the present crisis and thinking that i might be useful if the city is besieged i have declared myself to the wuzeer and although i still retain my disguise there are many who know that i am an englishman my name is angus campbell mr pottinger i am in the employment of the british minister at teheran and am the bearer of a letter from him to shah kamran encouraging him to maintain the defence of the city as long as possible and holding out hopes that the british government which would view the attack upon herat with grave dissatisfaction will endeavour to mediate between him and the shah and may even take measures to put pressure upon the latter to withdraw his forces that is very satisfactory of course i have had no shadow of authority to speak in that way and could only assure him generally that he would have the good will of the english and that as an english officer i would on my own part put any military skill that i possess at his service and being myself an artillery officer might be of considerable assistance to him in the management and working of the guns but your letter will place me in a more favourable position what are your instructions are you going to return to the embassy or remain here mr mneill left it to myself he will join the shahs army as the russian ambassador is also with it as he takes the dragoman of the legation down with him he has no absolute occasion for my services from what i have seen of the place so far though i only arrived yesterday it does not seem to me possible that these mud walls can withstand a battering fire the place will therefore very likely be taken in a few days and as i should not care about being in a town sacked by persian troops i had intended to leave it as soon as i delivered my letter there is no doubt about the weakness of the place a european army would carry it in three days but the persians have never been remarkable for their courage while the afghans are undoubtedly a fighting people i think it is quite possible that the siege may last for months you know the dilatory way in which these eastern people go to work of course i can give no opinion whatever as to what would be your best course it would depend upon so many thingsyour position at the embassy your chances of promotion there and other matters of which i am altogether ignorant i suppose you speak persian well illustration a man walking just in front of him was knocked down yes and also arabic and i can get on in armenian and kurdish as to my position it is scarcely an official one i am the son of a scottish trader who for twelve years carried on business at tabriz he and my mother were carried off eight months ago by an outbreak of plague and his house and store were burned in some street riots i consulted the british viceconsul there an armenian who was a friend of my father and we agreed that from my knowledge of languages i ought to be able to get on better in the east than at home where it would be of no use to me i had acted as my fathers assistant for the last two years of his life and had therefore acquired a knowledge of trading and i have a small capital with which when i get older i can either enter into business myself or join someone already established i was very glad to obtain this place in the embassy as a temporary employment until i could see my way for although mr mneill kindly took me on as an extra assistant of course his successor whoever he may be may not want me i think you have done very wisely how old are you now i am a few months over sixteen you are young indeed pottinger laughed to be engaged in political affairs well i should say that if the afghans really mean to fight as i believe they will they can hold the town for some time and you will therefore be able to learn their language which would be invaluable to you if you go in for commerce or in fact whatever you do out here things are in a disturbed state in afghanistan and i should be surprised if the indian government does not interfere there before long and in that case anyone acquainted with pushtoo and with arabic and persian will have no difficulty in finding employment with the army and through my uncle i might be able to put you in the way of it and now about your mission the wuzeer for some reason or otheri own i dont see whyhas been exceedingly civil to me on my arrival i sent to say that i was a stranger and a traveller and that should it be pleasing to him i would wait upon him he sent down at once to say that he would see me the next day of course on occasions of this sort it is usual to make a present the only thing that i could give him was a brace of detonating pistols he had never seen any but flintlocks before and accepted them graciously finding that i was a british artillery officer he at once asked my opinion on a variety of matters and took me round the walls with him consulting me as to how they had best be strengthened and so on i will go up and see him presently and tell him that you have arrived and are the bearer of a letter from our minister to shah kamran i shall of course mention that you have come in disguise and that you have therefore been unable to bring the customary presents and i shall point out to him that you possess the confidence of the british minister i shall say that for that reason i have persuaded you to remain here during the siege and that i am sure you will act with me and moreover will endeavour to keep mneill well informed of everything going on here and will continually urge him to impress upon the british government the importance of the position and the necessity for interfering to prevent it from falling into the hands of the persians as to its importance there is no doubt especially as russia appears to be making persia a catspaw in the matter that is why i feel that while fighting for these herateeswho between ourselves seem to me to be unmitigated ruffiansi am merely fighting for england for it is of the utmost importance that the gate of india should not be in the hands of persia especially if as you say russian influence is dominant at teheran i am sure i shall be delighted if you will accept me as your assistant though i dont see at present what possible service i can be you will be of use there will be no end of things to see about then he burst out laughing it does seem absurd doesnt it that we two i a young lieutenant and you a lad not yet seventeen should be proposing to take a prominent part in the defence of a city like this against an army commanded by the shah of persia in person angus joined in the laugh it is not ridiculous for you he said because as an artillery officer you must know a great deal more about the defence of towns than these afghans can do but it certainly is absurd my having anything to do in it pottinger went with angus to the house of the armenian in order that he might know where to find him leaving him there he went up to the citadel which stood on rising ground at one corner of the town he returned in an hour and said that the wuzeer would receive him at once he is a good deal impressed he went on with the fact that our minister should have sent a messenger here with the letter at first he did not see why england should be interested in the matter and i had to explain to him about the russian intrigue in persia and that there was no doubt that sooner or later they would invade india and that this would be rendered comparatively easy by herat being in the hands of their friends the persians he enquired of me what rank you held i told him that you were a member of the embassy acting as assistantsecretary to the minister and as was evident by his entrusting you with so important a despatch were deep in his confidence on arriving at the citadel they were at once conducted to the apartment of the wuzeer yar mahomed rose from his seat and greeted them politely angus walked forward bowed and delivered his letter you speak persian your excellency the minister said angus had difficulty in restraining a smile at his new dignity but said gravely yes your highness i speak it and arabic you journeyed here comfortably i hope yes there were a few adventures on the way but not more than i had expected yar mahomed opened and read the letter you are aware of its contents he asked yes i learned them by heart before i left teheran in case i should be robbed of the letter on the way the wuzeer sat in thought for a minute but how he said doubtfully can your country which is as i hear very far distant exercise any influence with the shah surely you could not send an army all that distance not from england your highness but we could send a fleet that could shut up all the ports in the persian gulf and we could send troops from india to occupy those places and so destroy all their trade moreover we could put a stop to all trade passing by land through this town to scinde and send a great army by sea and invade persia and as our soldiers are much better than the persians might even take tabriz and teheran the shah knows that they have done great things in india and will see how they might bring ruin on persia yes what your minister says is true but will he do this at once that i cannot say angus replied at first no doubt the government of england would say herat is very far off it will fall before we can do anything but if they find that it holds out bravely they will say we must help these people who are fighting so well there is another thing it is said that there are already some russian officers with the shahs army the english are very jealous of the russians and when they come to understand that it is russia who has sent the shah to capture herat their anger will speedily be roused and they will bid their minister say to the shah if you continue to fight against herat we shall send our ships and our army against you the shah knows that we have conquered in india people far more warlike than the persians and he will say to himself why should i run the risk of losing my kingdom merely to please the russians who are really much more dangerous neighbours than the english the words of your excellency are wise the wuzeer said you will see that we shall hold out for months or even for years if necessary i can understand now why the british minister has confidence in you though you look so young how many years has your excellency i am not yet thirty angus said calmly the wuzeer looked surprised it is because your face is smooth that you look so young we afghans wear our beards i see that you do not for even this brave officer who has come to fight for us has no hair on his face he has told me that you will stay here and assist with your advice so far as i am able to do so i will but i am not greatly skilled in such matters still i will assist him so far as i can it is good the afghan said it would be better your highness that it should not be known that i am an agent of the british minister though of course you can if you find it necessary cheer your soldiers by telling them if they fight bravely and well the british minister will try and mediate between you and the shah and to persuade him to draw off his army but were the shah to know that the british minister has an agent here he would be wroth with him and might not listen so willingly to his representations let it then i beg you be supposed that like mr pottinger i am but an english traveller who chancing to be here is willing to do all that he can to aid in the defence of the town against the persians your words are good so let it be where are you dwelling now at the house of the armenian carpetweaver kajar the times being bad his looms are at a standstill and he was glad to let me an apartment he is a good man the wuzeer said a good man and honest but not rich angus felt that the last words were rather a question than an assertion and he said surely no his rooms are very simple but they are clean and if a traveller can but find a clean lodging he cares not how poor it is shall you be sending a message to the minister i shall endeavour to do so by a servant lad i have brought with me i will tell him that his mind may be at ease for herat can hold out the persians are cowards the wuzeer said angrily my horsemen have been round them for many days but they give them no chance they keep together like a flock of sheep with their guns and their infantry instead of riding out bravely to bring in plunder and fight with their enemies when they meet them then turning to pottinger he went on i have sent out as you advised me to cut down all the trees within half a mile of the town so that the persians will have no shelter from our guns and as all the granaries are emptied for miles round they will have a long way to go to get food a number of men are also at work at the place where as you showed me the wall was rotten and others are clearing out the ditch and making the bank steeper where it has slipped down so that if they should be so mad as to rush forward and try to cross the moat they will not be able to climb up that is important wuzeer and still more so is it that the little wall at the foot of the mount of earth that surrounds the city wall should be repaired that is of the greatest importance they may manage to fill up the moat and cross it but as long as the lower wall stands they cannot climb up even if a breach was made in the main wall i will go round now with you the wuzeer said and we will see where the worst places are angus accompanied them and found that pottingers statement as to the weakness of the fortifications was well founded from a distance the wall had looked imposing for it was of considerable height and great thickness but it was entirely constructed of dried mud and heavy guns could effect a breach anywhere in the course of a day or two it was evident that if the place was to hold out it must depend upon the bravery of its troops and not upon the strength of its walls for the next week the work went on incessantly every ablebodied man in the town was employed in the repairs of the wall and in cutting down trees while the work of destroying grain and all kinds of necessaries which could not be brought into the town was performed by the troops these were all afghans were in regular pay and formed the fighting army of the ruler of herat their discipline was at all times very lax and the permission to destroy and burn which naturally included looting everything of value for their own benefit rendered them even less amenable to discipline than before eldred pottinger as far as he could venture tried to induce the wuzeer to have the work executed in a more regular manner and under strict supervision by officers told off for the purpose but yar mahomed viewed the matter with indifference what does it matter he said whether the soldiers take things or not it would be all the same to the owners whether they have them or whether they are destroyed or fall into the hands of the persians in a few days the enemy will be here and it would be foolish to cause dissatisfaction among the soldiers over a matter of no consequence whatever the country indeed was now deserted by all its inhabitants immense stores of food had been brought into the city every unoccupied piece of ground between the city walls was crowded with cattle sheep and horses and there was no fear that famine would for a very long period be a serious trouble to the besieged eldred pottingers time was principally occupied in seeing to the repair of the guns and their carriages without any definite rank having been given to him it was understood that all his orders had the support of the wuzeer and were to be obeyed as if they came directly from him and that the young man with him was also an englishman of some importance and possessed similar powers while pottinger looked chiefly after the military work performed by the afghans who had come into the town angus superintended that upon which the sheeahs were engaged these persianspeaking people carried out his instructions cheerfully because they were given in their own language and were not accompanied by the contemptuous haughtiness and animosity which would have characterized the orders of an afghan the hostility between the two great religious sects of islam being even greater than that entertained by both against the infidel pottinger had now taken up his abode at the house of kajar where there were several apartments unoccupied as he did not speak armenian and knew but little persian angus and he arranged to have a mess of their own engaging a man recommended to them by the armenian as a good cook this had been rendered the more necessary as the trader with whom angus had first spoken had also moved with his wife to his brothers house he had taken this step because he foresaw that as the siege went on the position of the sheeahs would become more and more unbearable and that the protection the presence of the two englishmen could afford would be most valuable indeed kajar as soon as he saw that angus had been favourably received by the wuzeer had himself suggested that pottinger might also be offered accommodation at his house there need be no further talk of payment effendi between us your presence here will be of vastly greater importance than any money you could give us no one can say what will happen here it is not only our property but our lives which will be at stake but with you as inmates here no one would dare interfere with us and we all regard the fact that you should almost accidentally have been brought here as a special blessing that has been sent from heaven to us the young englishmen thus strangely thrown together soon became fast friends and it was pleasant indeed to them to enjoy their evenings together after each had been engaged during the whole day at the duties they had undertaken a couple of hours however were always spent by them each in his own room pottinger engaged the services of a mollah or priest of the sheeah sect to give him lessons in persian while angus worked at pushtoo with kajar who spoke the afghan language perfectly chapter iii the siege of herat on nd of november a fortnight after angus arrived at herat the persian army took up its position on the plain to the northwest of the city the inhabitants crowded the walls to watch the advancing hostthe afghan portion of the population with scowling faces and muttered imprecations the sheeahs prudently abstaining from all demonstrations of their feelings but filled with hopes of deliverance from their tyrants pottinger learned that the afghan horse were going to make a sortie and he and angus went together to the northwest angle of the wall a good deal will depend upon this first fight pottinger said if the persians easily repulse the assault it will cause a deep depression among the afghans if on the other hand the heratees obtain a fair amount of success it will so encourage them that they will not fear another time to encounter the enemy and will fight strongly when the walls are attacked in a short time the afghan horse were seen pouring out of the western gate there was but small attempt at anything like military order it was a mob of horsemen individually splendid riders and for skirmishing purposes unsurpassed but as pottinger remarked to his companion quite unfit to stand against a charge of regular cavalry equally endowed with courage keeping near the city wall until facing the persian position where a regiment of cavalry were hastily mounting they wheeled round and rode against the enemy with loud shouts the persians rode to meet them but were unable to withstand the impetuosity of the charge and amidst the exulting shouts of the afghans on the wall wheeled round and fled in disorder the afghans then turning flung themselves upon a strong body of infantry that was advancing against them in good order these however stood firm emptying many saddles by a heavy volley they poured in when the afghans were close and presenting so steady a line of bayonets that the horsemen recoiled as they did so the persian artillery opened upon the afghans who retired until near the wall and then dismounted and opened fire with their long matchlocks upon the persian gunners pottinger ran at once to a couple of guns close to where they were standing and under his directions the afghans in charge of them at once replied to the persian guns a number of the afghan footmen ran out from the gate on that side and joining the dismounted men kept up a hot fire while those on the wall also joined in the conflict as the persian guns could effect little against the infantry lying in shelter they were now directed against the wall causing a rapid dispersal of the peaceable portion of the spectators the effect of their fire showed at once the rottenness of the fortifications although but light guns they knocked down portions of the parapet which crumbled as if it had been made of rotten timber pottinger shook his head as he and angus walked along to watch the effect of the fire if a sixpound shot can effect such damage as this it is clear that when they get their siege guns to work a few hours will effect a breach in the wall itself on their side the persians also sent out skirmishers these pushed forward to a point where they could take the afghans in flank and cause them to retire nearer to the walls the fighting was continued until dark when the persians drew off and the afghans retired into the city no material advantage had been gained by either side but the heratees were well content with the result they had shown themselves superior to the persian cavalry and had maintained themselves against the infantry the persians lost no time and during the night pushed forward and occupied all the gardens and enclosures on the west of the city and placed a strong force among the ruins of a village there in the morning they began to advance against the wall the afghans sallied out horse and foot the cavalry unable to act in such broken ground moved round and hanging on the flanks of the persian camp continually threatened an attack the infantry taking advantage of every wall and bush maintained a heavy fire upon the enemy the artillery on both sides opened fire but at the end of the day neither party had gained any advantage the afghans brought in the heads of several whom they had killed and a few prisoners the heads were placed on pikes and exhibited on the walls the prisoners were bartered as slaves in exchange for horses to the turkomans of whom a considerable party were encamped at a short distance from the walls it is horrible and disgusting pottinger said to his companion that evening as they sat together this custom of cutting off heads but as it is i believe universal in the east it would be worse than useless to protest against it it is the custom always to reward a soldier for bringing in a head as a proof of his valour though in fact it is no proof as he may simply as he advances cut it from the body of a man shot by someone else putting aside the brutality it operates badly for instead of following up an advantage hotly the men stop to collect these miserable trophies and so give time to an enemy to escape or rally i have read in the accounts of the campaigns of the turkish conquerors that the heads were always brought in to the general and piled before his tent and that each soldier was rewarded according to the number he brought in and i fancy it was the same thing with mohammedan conquerors in india well i am afraid that we shall see a number of things that will disgust us before the siege is over if i were fighting solely for the heratees i should certainly retire if they continue these barbarities but i have no interest whatever in them in fact i see that the greater portion of the population would be benefited by living under the persian rule i go into this matter solely because it is one i consider of vital interest to england and therefore as an englishman i am willing to do my utmost to keep not the persians but the russians from seizing this place angus had now completely caught the enthusiasm of the young artilleryman he was perhaps less horrified than his companion for he had seen so much of eastern modes of punishment that he had learned to regard them with less horror than that felt by europeans unaccustomed to oriental methods i have been accustomed to look on at acts of brutality he said for from the time when i first came out my father always impressed upon me that we were strangers in this part of the world and must be very cautious not to show any aversion to its customs it would lead us into endless trouble if we were to show in any way that what to them seems only natural was to us revolting and though i have often been tempted to interfere when i have seen some act of brutality i have always followed my fathers instructions and walked away without showing any anger or disgust i agree with you that it is horrid but it is not like seeing living men tortured at least when one is dead it can make no great difference if one is buried with a head or without one pottinger laughed that is certainly one way of looking at it and i can understand that as the custom has prevailed among these peoples for centuries they can scarcely understand our feelings of abhorrence and indignation however i am determined that whatever i do or feel i will keep my mouth shut and not say a word that would anger the wuzeer and shake my influence with him at present he is well disposed towards me and i have been of real assistance to him when things become critical i may be of vital service from what kajar says there is a strong suspicion that he is not personally brave which i can quite believe as very few thoroughpaced brutes are now old shah kamran is i must own an exception an absolutely greater scoundrel than he has proved himself to be probably never existed but he is known to have been in his earlier days as brave as a lion if he had been some twenty years younger i should have stronger hopes of eventual success than i have now personal bravery in a general is of no extraordinary advantage in a european army where he is not expected to lead men into battle but with irregular troops like these heratees it is of vital importance they will follow their leader anywhere but if he sends them into danger while he himself remains at a distance they lose their enthusiasm directly and are half thrashed before the battle begins do you not think that kamran will be able at any important moment to come forward and show himself among the defenders of the breach i hear that only a month or so ago he returned from a campaign i am afraid not i have seen him twice and although it cannot be said that he is an imbecile he is next door to it he understands what is going on but his nerves are utterly shattered by drink he is in what may be termed the lachrymose condition of drunkenness he works himself into a state of childish passion sometimes he raves then he whimpers certainly his appearance would have no inspiring effect upon these rough afghan soldiers they want a man who would rush sword in hand at their head call upon them to follow him and then dash into the middle of the foe and the miserable old man could scarcely hold a sword in his shaking hand well at any rate the afghans have fought bravely yesterday and today excellently but it is the work they are accustomed to an afghan battle consists of two sets of men snugly hidden away among the rocks firing away at each other until one side loses a few men and then retires so they were quite at home at their skirmishing work and certainly more than a match for the same number of persians what they will do when an attack on a breach is made by a column remains to be seen night and day the heratees worked at their defences while the persians raised batteries and fortified their camp against sudden attacks after four or five days of comparative quiet a heavy cannonade broke out artillery played upon the walls mortars threw shell into the town and rockets whizzed overhead for a time the consternation in the city was prodigious the rockets especially which were altogether new to them appalled the inhabitants who as night came on gathered on the roofs of their houses and watched with affright the sharp trains of light and shuddered at the sound of the fiery missiles the sound of lamentation the cries of fear and the prayers to allah resounded over the city but the panic abated somewhat when it was found that comparatively little injury was effected but while the peaceful inhabitants wailed and prayed the troops and the men who had come in from the afghan villages laboured steadily and silently at the work of repairing the damages effected by the fire of the persian batteries but little could be done to the face of the wall but the crumbling parapets and earth dug up from open spaces were used to construct a fresh wall behind the old one at points against which the persian guns played most fiercely so that when a breach was formed the assailants would find an unlookedfor obstacle to their entrance into the town this work was directed by pottinger who took but little rest remaining constantly at his post and only snatching an hours sleep now and then angus assisted to the best of his power always taking his place when his comrade could no longer battle against sleep and seeing that everything went on well the afghans yielded a willing obedience to the orders of these young strangers they saw the utility of the work upon which they were engaged and laboured well and steadily the persian artillery were fortunately for the besieged badly commanded instead of concentrating their fire upon one spot in which case a breach would have been effected in a few hours each gunner directed his aim as he thought best and the shot which if poured upon a single point would have brought down the crumbling wall effected no material damage scattered as it was over a face a mile in length it was all the less effective inasmuch as the artillerymen generally aimed at the parapet of the wall instead of the solid portion below it it was a delight to them to see a portion of the parapet knocked down by their shot whereas when the wall itself was hit comparatively small show was made many of the shot flew high and passed over the town into the fields beyond it and at the end of four days almost continuous firing herat was stronger and more capable of resistance than it was when the persians first appeared before the walls the absence of any tangible result evidently lowered the spirits of the besiegers while it proportionately raised those of the defenders moreover the immense expenditure of projectiles by the persians showed the shah and his generals that large as was the store of ammunition they had brought with them it might prove insufficient and the labour and time which would be entailed in renewing the supply from the magazines at the capital would be enormous consequently the fire became irregular sometimes for an hour or two all the batteries would play while at other times only a few guns would be discharged in the course of an hour the shells that were thrown into the city did much more damage than the round shot of the batteries many houses were almost destroyed by them and whole families killed these however were for the most part peaceable sheeahs and the matter in no way affected the defenders of the wall whose spirits rose daily as they perceived that the persian artillery was by no means so formidable as they had anticipated the persians made no attempt to blockade the city evidently fearing the sorties the defenders made and confined their operations to that side of the city before which they were encamped this was a great advantage to the besieged three out of the five gates of the city stood open communications were maintained with the surrounding country the cattle and other animals went out to graze and firewood and other commodities passed freely into the town throughout december the persians were harassed by nightly attacks the working parties in their entrenchments were driven out tools carried off the workmen killed and the work performed during the day destroyed the assailants retiring before heavy masses of infantry could be brought up to repel them upon many days scarce a shot was fired then for a few hours there would be a lively cannonade but of the same scattered and wasteful fashion as before on december th all the persian prisoners who had been captured in the sorties were sent off for sale to the frontier of the turkoman country the shah retaliated by putting to death in various cruel manners the afghan prisoners who had fallen into his hands two days later a mine was sprung and a breach effected in the wall the persians advanced to storm it but were met with the greatest resolution by the heratees who repulsed them with considerable loss their leader being severely wounded and a deserter from herat a man of high military reputation among the afghans killeda fact that caused almost as much joy to the defenders as the repulse of the assault the success however of the mine and the knowledge that the persians were engaged in driving several tunnels towards the wall caused a considerable feeling of uneasiness nevertheless the th which was the day of the termination of the long mohammedan fast was celebrated with the usual rejoicings which the besieged were enabled to take part in without fear of an attack as the day was being celebrated with similar festivities in the persian camp shah kamran went with his family in procession to the principal mosque and after the conclusion of the prayers usual to the occasion observed the custom of scattering sweetmeats to be scrambled for by the priests to their disappointment however he did not follow this up by inviting them to a banquet but sent extra provisions to the troops and the workers on the walls there was now a pause in active operations for more than three weeks the persians laboured at their mines but either from ignorance of their work or on account of the water flowing from the moat into their galleries no damage resulted the heratees countermined under the advice of pottinger but beyond proving that the persian galleries were not being driven where they expected nothing came of it but on the th of january the afghans determined to give battle to the persians in the open again the whole population gathered on the walls and the two young englishmen were also there the wuzeer asked me this morning whether i would go out with them pottinger said to angus but i replied that although acquainted with artillery and siege operations i did not know enough of the afghan way of fighting to accept even a small command in the field i am useful here he went on and i should be of no use whatever outside the afghans have their own ideas as to when to advance and when to retreat besides it might offend some of the leaders were i a stranger to interfere in any way there is no jealousy of me at present at least i think not they know nothing of sieges and there is no one who holds any special post in connection with the fortifications no one therefore feels superseded in the next place the work is for the most part carried out by labourers who get paid for their services and not by the troops and it is nothing to them whether they get their orders from an englishman or an afghan in an attack on a breach i should certainly fight in the first place because i consider it my duty and in the second because if the persians get inside the walls you may be sure that there will be something like a general massacre the afghan cavalry and infantry poured out from the gate and spread themselves over the open country to the east of the persian camp the men on foot took possession of a village and established themselves in its houses and the gardens surrounding it from the wall a view could be obtained of the movements in the enemys camp the vedettes had fallen back as soon as the afghans issued out drums were beaten and horns sounded the troops ran hastily together and their general mahomed khan could be seen galloping about issuing orders presently a strong column moved out it was headed by cavalry and as soon as these made their appearance the afghan horse galloped across the plain while the crowd on the walls burst into shouts of encouragement although the troops were too far off to hear them it is a pretty sight angus but about as unlike modern warfare as could well be european cavalry seeing a mob of horsemen coming down upon them in such disorder would ride at them and no irregular horse could withstand the impact of a welldisciplined and compact cavalry charge there the persians are forming line but there is no smartness about it it is done in a halfhearted sort of way as if they did not like the business before them there they are off but they are too slow they wont be fairly in a gallop before the afghans are upon them for a minute or two the contending bodies were mixed in a confused mass then the shouts of the spectators rose high as the persians could be seen flying towards their infantry hotly pursued by the afghans then came the rattle of musketry the quick reports of cannon as the infantry and artillery covered the retreat of their cavalry presently the heratee horse were seen retiring from the village in which the struggle had taken place another body which had not yet been engaged instead of riding forward to support them also turned and for a time all rode off while the persian cavalry were reinforced from the camp and pursued them the heratees soon recovered themselves and again charged but again the leading squadrons were badly supported by those behind these were under another leader who was probably influenced by jealousy or by tribal hostility and the persian horse well supported by their infantry gradually gained the advantage their own infantry coming to the support the afghan footmen also advanced and the fight was maintained during the whole day it is like playing at war pottinger said irritably except in that first charge they have never really come to blows it is skirmishing rather than fighting here there are some ten or twelve thousand men taking both sides cavalry infantry and a few guns i dont think that when our men come in again it will be found that they have lost a hundred and i dont suppose the persians have lost much more it is a fair field for fighting and between two european forces of the same strength a long days battle would probably have caused three or four thousand casualties one would think that neither party was in earnest certainly the heratees are though i dont suppose the persian soldiers have any particular personal interest in the matter the action was altogether indecisive and at the end of the day the persians held no ground beyond the village where their infantry first opened fire while the heratees had gained nothing by their sortie when the afghans reentered the walls it was found that pottingers estimate as to the amount of loss was very near the truth there were between twentyfive and thirty killed and some four times as many wounded more or less seriously they of course claimed a victory and were highly satisfied with their own doings but the operations only tended to show that neither party had any eagerness for real fighting on the th of february pottinger said i have received permission to go into the persian camp tomorrow kamran has given me a message on his part to the persian king it is an appeal to him to retire he says that when khorassan was in rebellion he refused the entreaties of its chief to aid them although at that time he could have raised ten thousand horsemen and might with the rebels of khorassan have marched to teheran he had sent one of his highest officers to congratulate the shah on his succession and now the latter is without provocation marching against him he prays him therefore to retire to aid him with guns and men to recover the dominions he has lost in afghanistan and if he be successful he will hand over herat to him yar mahomed has also given me a message to the persian minister just the sort of message i should have expected from him he declares that he is devoted to the shah and to him but that he is bound to stand by his master that whatever might be his own wish the afghans would never surrender the city and that he dare not propose such a thing to them but that he shall ever remain the faithful servant of the shah and of the minister whom he regards as his father i will take you with me if you wish but that must be a matter for your own consideration i should of course like to go angus said but i do not know that it would be wise for me to do so mr mneill may be in the persian camp it is not probable that i should be recognized still there must be many officials there who came frequently to see him at the embassy and who would know me should one of these declare that i was a member of the mission it might create a very bad impression against mneill as it would seem that he was in secret communication with kamran that is just what i was thinking pottinger said and i must say that i agree with you it certainly would be awkward for him if it were known that one of his suite was in herat yes i think it would be better that you should not go we shall certainly be the centre of curiosity while we are in the camp and there would be no possibility of private communications between you and mneill but should i see him have you any message for him i think we have agreed that when this business is over it will be much better for you to go with me back to india than to return to teheran yes i have quite settled that angus said with the kind offer you have made to present me to your uncle i should think that the prospect of my obtaining advancement there is very much greater than it is in persia where i might be left altogether in the lurch if mneill were recalled i shall be obliged therefore if you will tell him of my intention and thank him for me very heartily for his kindness he will i am sure approve of the step for he has several times told me that he was sorry he could see no chance of my obtaining more than a clerkship at the mission and advised me on no account to think of remaining there if i could see my way to doing better for myself i will be sure to give mneill the message if i see him but i dont expect to be long in the camp i am charged with such a ridiculous message that there is no likelihood of any discussion taking place the minister will of course scoff at yar mahomeds declarations of respect for the shah and affection for himself and the shah after taking the trouble to collect an army and come here himself is not likely to retire at the request of kamran my real hope in going is that i may find a british officer with the persians there is almost certain to be one as the russians have it is said several through him i may send messages to friends at home and to my uncle in scinde they must all begin to feel anxious about me angus saw his companion ride out the next morning with some anxiety as to his reception but with no particular regret that he did not accompany him he had often been in the encampments of the persian troops before the army left teheran and there would therefore be nothing new to him in the scene pottinger as usual wore the dress of an afghan of some standing and was accompanied only by one mounted attendant and a runner to hold his horse a small party of afghans rode with him for some distance beyond the walls and then shouting good wishes for his return in safety left him angus continued to watch the men at their work for two or three hours and then took his place on the walls again and watched for his comrades return it was not however till the th that he came back to herat on the previous day he was prevented from returning by a violent storm which raged from morning till night and considerable anxiety was felt in the town that he had gone on a mission from kamran was generally known but none save the shah and his wuzeer were aware of its nature angus was much alarmed as he thought it too probable that his friend had been shot by the persian outposts as soon as he arrived among them for there was nothing to show that he came as an envoy he was therefore greatly relieved when a native brought the news to him that the englishman was returning as the news spread it caused great excitement when pottinger rode in at the gate a great crowd had assembled there and all thronged round him asking for information he replied that they must enquire of the wuzeer who alone could deliver it as he saw angus in the crowd he shouted to him as i expected nothing has come of it meet me at the house an hour later pottinger arrived there i was getting very anxious about you angus said and was beginning to fear that you had been shot by the persian outposts i was a little uncomfortable myself and i kept a good lookout as you may suppose the roads led through those ruined villages and at any moment i might have a bullet whizzing about my ears presently i saw some persian soldiers running towards the road and i told my man to take off his turban and wave it to show that our intentions were peaceable when they perceived this they came straggling up i told them that i was an english officer and the bearer of messages to the shah and his minister they seemed delighted chiefly perhaps from the fact of my being an englishman but also because they hoped that i had come with an offer of surrender however they shouted welcome welcome the english were always friends of the shah the officer who commanded the picket turned out to be a major who had served under major hart and who knew all the english officers who had of late years been in persia he took me to the majorgeneral commanding the attack who turned out to be a russian in the persian service commanding a corps of russiansmen who had left their own country for doubtless good reasons at any rate he received me courteously we had tea and smoked a pipe together and he then sent me on with an escort to the persian camp illustration afghanistan and north west frontier of india the news that someone had come in from herat to arrange terms for its submission having preceded me almost the whole camp came out to see me and if my escort had not used their iron ramrods most vigorously upon the heads and shoulders of the crowd i should never have got through when i reached the ministers tent he received me graciously but we did not enter into business it was necessary that the shah should first decide whether he would receive me i had learned from the russian general that colonel stoddart was in camp as it was known before i left india that he would accompany the persians i had letters for him and received permission to go to his tent to deliver them his astonishment at finding that i was a british officer was as you may imagine great however i had but little time to talk for in a few minutes a message came that i was to go back at once to the minister or as he is called there as well as here the wuzeer stoddart accompanied me the persian asked me what were the messages that as he had been informed kamran and yar mahomed had sent to the shah and himself i told him that i could only deliver kamrans message to the shah and that i thought his own message had better be given him privately the wuzeer who is a bilious and excitable little man sent everyone out from the tent but stoddart and myself and i then delivered the message we had a long discussion the wuzeer declared that the english themselves had put down herat as forming part of the persian dominions in the map that burnes had made i said that i thought not he produced the map to convince me but to the little mans intense disgust he found that he was altogether wrong he then appealed to stoddart the latter as our military representative at the shahs court replied diplomatically that he had no instructions on the subject and would refer the case to the envoy at teheran mneill by the by has not yet reached the camp stoddart said that he was not aware that the persian government had annexed herat as its ruler had both with the british government and the late shah been acknowledged as sovereign in afghanistan so as i expected nothing came of the interview we went back to stoddarts tent and shortly afterwards were sent for by the shah he received us with courtesy and i delivered kamrans message the shah replied speaking with dignity and calmness and stating his complaints against kamran that he had permitted his soldiers constantly to make incursions into persian dominions robbing and slaying and carrying off persian subjects to sell as slaves then gradually warming up as he recited a number of such forays and depredations he denounced kamran as a treacherous liar and said that he would not rest satisfied until he had planted a persian garrison in the city of herat of course there was nothing more to be said we were formally though courteously dismissed and i went back with stoddart to his tent where i remained till this morning i was by no means sorry that the tremendous storm yesterday afforded an excuse for stopping and i enjoyed my day of quiet talk with stoddart immensely he thinks that if the persians do but make an attack with all their strength the town must be taken in which i entirely agree with him he said however that as the slackness of their fire for some time past has shown the persians are heartily sick of the business and if the shah had some really good excuse for retiring he would gladly do so i said that the best excuse would be some strong action on the part of our government he replied that he had himself urged this upon mneill and that the envoy had already written urgently home in that sense of course i told him of your being there he had already heard from mneill that he had sent you here to encourage kamran to hold out he asked a good deal about you and quite agreed with me that with your knowledge of languagesand i told him that in the three months during which you had been here you had already learned enough pushtoo to converse in it freelyyou would be sure to get an appointment in india as it was extremely probable that an army would shortly be sent into afghanistan to support shah soojah against dost mahomed especially as the latter had received vickovich an aidedecamp to the governor of orenburg as an envoy at cabul of course i had heard about the intention of supporting dost mahomed before i started i know that my uncle and mr burnes who is our agent at cabul are both strongly opposed to this dost mahomed has always defeated shah soojah he is firmly established on his throne and burnes believes that he is very well disposed towards us however that is not our affair but if there should be such an expedition it much increases your chance of obtaining an official post i took the opportunity to write to my uncle and to send my report to the indian government and in both cases i stated that i had received the most valuable assistance from a young gentleman who was temporarily attached to the mission at teheran and who speaking as he did persian pushtoo and arabic would i considered be of great service should any difficulties arise with afghanistan i said that i had seized the opportunity of recommending you as it was possible that i myself might fall in the defence of herat it was awfully kind of you pottinger and i am extremely obliged to you i felt that i was acting in the interest of the indian government as well as of yourself the siege may last for another month yet and by the end of that time you will be able to pass as easily as an afghan as you now can as a persian and may be invaluable for as we have as yet had very little contact with afghanistan there are not i should say half a dozen officers in our service who can speak pushtooprobably not one who could do so well enough to pass as a native i myself knew but little of it when i started so my disguise was that of a cutch horsedealer and i passed through afghanistan as a native of india even now i do not speak pushtoo as well as you do having devoted myself to persian while you have been working at afghan for your sake i hope that the siege may last for some time yet as it may be a great advantage to you when you apply for an official post to be able to say that you can pass anywhere as a native chapter iv a sturdy defence pottingers belief that the shah was anxious to bring the war to a conclusion was confirmed by the arrival of the major he had met when going into the persian camp with instructions from the russian general endorsed by the minister to endeavour to persuade the afghans to consent to the terms offered by the shah it was better he urged for them to settle their differences among themselves than to employ mediation he warned them that as the english had come to india under the pretence of trading and had finally conquered the whole country they should on no account be trusted he assured them that the shah had no desire to interfere in the internal administration of herat the present movement was not an expedition against herat but against hindostan and that all true mohammedans should join the shahs army and that he would lead them to the conquest and plunder of all india and turkestan pottinger was sent for privately and consulted by the kamran and the wuzeer as to what answer should be sent his advice was taken and the next day the envoy returned to his camp with vague assurances of regard and the suggestion that if the persians were really inclined for peace the best proof that they could give of the sincerity of their inclination would be the retirement of the besieging force there was much excitement in the city when the proposals brought by the persian officer became known and many of the older men began to argue that it did not matter much whether kamran was called prince or king or whether the supremacy of the persian shah was or was not acknowledged in herat as long as no persian garrison was placed in the city the wuzeer however remained firm he declared that he had no confidence in the persians that he desired to be guided by the advice and be aided by the mediation of the english and that if the shah would place the conduct of negotiations in the hands of colonel stoddart he on his part would trust everything to lieutenant pottinger and would accept whatever was decided upon by the two english officers that was his own decision and not mine pottinger said when he returned from an interview with the wuzeer there is no doubt that ruffian as he is in many respects he is a clever man you see he shifts all the responsibility for the continuance of the war off his shoulders on to those of the persians for their refusal to accept the decision of the british officer in their camp will convince the afghans that the persians will be satisfied with nothing but their destruction two days later the persian officer returned to herat with a letter stating that the shah had no desire to possess himself of the town but only claimed that his sovereignty should be acknowledged the answer was the same as before kamran was willing to do all that was required if the persian army would but retire the negotiations were carried on for a day or two longer but though both parties desired peace the one would not surrender the other would not retire and acknowledge failure hostilities therefore continued without intermission and a fortnight later the persians gained possession of a fortified place three hundred yards from the northeast angle of the wall the afghans stationed there had made but a poor resistance and upon entering the town their faces were smeared with mud and they were sent through the city accompanied by a crier who proclaimed their cowardice a month passed without any incident of importance and at the end of that time mneill arrived at the persian camp every effort had been made to hinder him on his way from teheran and he was at first coldly received a week later he had an audience with the shah and stated to him that the attack upon herat was an obvious violation of the treaty between great britain and herat and the british government would therefore be justified in taking active measures to enforce its terms the shah upon this consented to accept the british mediation three days later however the persians made a serious attack some new batteries opened against the ramparts near the great mosque their fire was this time concentrated and the wall crumbled so rapidly that by the evening a practicable breach had been made the afghans however did not lose heart declaring that they trusted to themselves and not to their walls to defend the city they had indeed gained an advantage in the middle of the day they blew in a mine that had been carried almost up to the wall and taking advantage of the alarm caused by the explosion rushed out and furiously attacked the besiegers carrying the trenches for some distance before a strong persian force came up and drove them back again so heavy a fire was then opened from the trenches on the musketeers on the walls that these were completely overpowered and were unable to show a head above the parapets as evening came on the persians shouted that an english officer wished to enter the town but the wuzeer shouted back that no one would be allowed to enter at that hour the next day major todd who was attached to the embassy entered the town he was in full regimentals and his appearance excited the most lively admiration of the populace he announced that the shah was ready to accept the mediation of the british government he was received with the greatest courtesy by shah kamran who after the interview took a cloak from his own shoulders and sent it by the wuzeer to major todd who returned to the persian camp with the assurance of kamrans desire to accept the mediation of the british minister but though apparently both parties had at last arrived at an understanding that evening the aspect of affairs became more warlike than ever the persian trenches were filled with men the bodies of horse and foot on the line of investment were strengthened and there were all appearances that an assault would be made that evening and the afghan chiefs were called together and each had his post assigned to him but scarcely had they separated when mr mneill himself arrived he was conducted at once to kamrans palace and the greater part of the night was spent in discussion it was nearly dawn when the minister accompanied pottinger to the latters residence as he had arranged when he arrived that he would sleep at pottingers a room had been prepared for him angus sat up for several hours but then feeling sure that the minister would at once retire to bed on his return had lain down when he awoke it was halfpast six and dressing hastily he went into the sittingroom that he shared with pottinger and to his surprise found mr mneill writing there the minister greeted him cordially i heard all about you from colonel stoddart and approve highly of your remaining here to give pottinger what aid you can during the siege i also think that you have done very wisely in determining as pottinger told stoddart you had done to go to india i myself will write to the english government saying what you have done how intelligently you carried on your work at the mission and recommending you for an appointment on the northern frontier either with the army or the resident at scinde or perhaps better still with mr burnes at cabul at this moment pottinger entered the room and he was as surprised as angus had been at seeing the minister at work after only a couple of hours in bed there was another meeting with kamran who placed himself entirely in the hands of the british envoy and said that he would gladly consent to any terms agreed upon by him at the conclusion of the meeting mr mneill returned at once to the persian camp to the disappointment of all major todd rode in two days later with the surprising news that the shah had entirely changed his attitude and absolutely refused to submit the dispute to british arbitration and that unless the whole people of herat acknowledged themselves his subjects he would take possession of the city by force of arms this sudden change was the result of the arrival of the russian representative count symonwich on the morning of the day of mneills visit to the city the russian party at once became ascendant he himself took the conduct of the operations of the siege the officers with him taught the persian soldiers how to construct batteries and russian money was freely distributed among them pottingers task of explaining to kamran the news brought by major todd was an unpleasant one but the old man took the news quietly and said that he never expected anything else for the persians had always been noted for their treachery and want of faith the news however caused great discouragement in the town and it was determined at a meeting of the chiefs that they would send to the russian ambassador and place themselves under the protection of his master meeting after meeting was held at all of which pottinger was present sometimes he was received and listened to with respect and other times he was treated with marked discourtesy the influence of mr mneill at the persian court declined rapidly while that of the russians became supreme for some months past he had failed to obtain any satisfaction for matters of serious complaint as far back as october a courier bearing despatches from colonel stoddart to him at teheran had been seized by a russian officer stripped and imprisoned by the persians and his despatches taken from him the british resident in the persian gulf had been grossly insulted by the governor of bushire and the persian government had continued to evade its obligations under the commercial treaty between the two nations so marked was the indignity with which mneill was now treated in the persian camp that on the th of june he left it with colonel stoddart and all his suite and attendants a step equivalent to a rupture of the relations between great britain and persia in the meantime the pressure of famine and sickness became more and more intense in herat the city was altogether without drainage and the stench from the bodies of those who had died or been killed and of the dead animals was dreadful but although much depressed the courage of the afghans still sustained them and when on the th of june the persians surprised the outer works they held the connecting passage and defended it until assistance came when the garrison poured out rushed down the slope and dislodged the assailants with much slaughter another attempt on the same day at a fresh point was equally unsuccessful and the storming party were twice repulsed pottinger was now armed with an authority that he had not before possessed for he had been appointed by mneill british envoy at herat the news of the departure of the embassy and pottingers assurances that this was a prelude to war between england and persia had but little effect it was certain that the city could not possibly hold out many weeks and it might be months before the arrival of a british fleet and army could influence the persians happily however lord auckland governorgeneral of india had not waited for instructions from home but at the news of the investment of herat and the outrage upon our resident in the persian gulf had begun to take steps early in the spring and on the th of june two transports and some vessels of war left bombay harbour with detachments of two british regiments and a marine battalion and on the th anchored off the island of karrack in the persian gulf upon the th of june herat went through the most terrible experience of the siege at daybreak a heavy fire opened from the persian batteries on all four sides of the city it ceased suddenly after a time pottinger who was at breakfast exclaimed to angus as he leapt up from his seat they are going to assault the batteries have done their work quick to the wall warning the soldiers they came upon as they ran they made their way to the wall just as they arrived there another gun was fired and at the signal the batteries on all sides again broke into life a storm of rockets carried dismay into the town the mortars dropped their shells into it and most conclusive of all a rattle of musketry broke out growing every moment in power against five points was the assault directed that on the gate of candahar was repulsed and the enemy chased back to their trenches that upon the southwest angle was but a feint and was never pushed home against the western gate the russian regiment under sampson and a strong force under a persian officer pressed up to the breach but the persian was killed and sampson carried off wounded and the troops fled after suffering immense loss the attack on the northwestern face was similarly repulsed but the fifth contest was desperate the storming party gained the fausse braye the afghans defending it fought desperately and all fell at their post the storming party rushed up the slope the officers and leading men were mown down by a heavy musketry fire but after a fierce struggle the upper fausse braye was carried and some of the assailants gained the head of the breach but now the afghan reserves were brought up and the persians on the breach were driven back again and again the persians fighting this time with desperate courage struggled to effect a lodgment only to be repulsed and fell back in confusion on their comrades behind for a long time the issue was doubtful a desperate handtohand conflict raged the assailants and defenders swayed up and down the breach which was covered with corpses and slippery with blood yar mahomed arrived almost at the same time as pottinger and angus for these before coming here had seen that all was going well at the other points attacked they had observed as they came along men leaving the breach by twos and threes under pretence of assisting wounded comrades and pottinger saw to his dismay that the men were losing heart as they came to the breach they found other soldiers coming up the wuzeer was sitting down close by pottinger ran up to him you must encourage your men wuzeer go forward and join them or all will be lost the afghan scarcely seemed to hear what he said you must come pottinger repeated loudly there is no time to be lost then he turned to angus do what you can he said i must rouse the wuzeer evidently his nerves have suddenly given way glad at last to be free to join in the struggle angus drew his sword and ran down thrusting back those who were mounting and pushed his way forward to the front shouting in pushtoo fight men fight for your faith your wives and your children everything is going on well elsewhere are you alone going to fail the bearded afghans astonished at seeing this young englishman rushing forward in advance of them followed him and again the persians were beaten back but although the afghans in front had been animated by the lads example those behind were still dropping off the wuzeer aroused by the vigorous exhortations of pottinger had risen up and neared the breach the persians were renewing their attack and the wuzeer called upon his men to fight the fugitives paused irresolute the wuzeers heart failed him again and he turned back his action still further discouraging the men pottinger in the most vehement language exhorted him to set an example again he turned and advanced but again shrank back pottinger now instead of entreating reviled and threatened him called him opprobrious names and at last seizing him by his arm dragged him forward to the breach this astounding treatment maddened the afghan he shouted to the soldiers to fight and as they continued to fall back seized a large staff and rushing like a madman upon the soldiers drove them forward again with a shower of heavy blows while pottinger sword in hand seconded him cooped up as they were and seeing no other outlet of escape many of them leapt wildly down over the parapet rushed down the slope and fell upon the persian stormers believing that great reinforcements must have arrived these were seized by a panic abandoned their position and fled herat was saved entirely by the energy and courage of the young english lieutenant pottingers first question was as to his companion he had while urging the wuzeer to advance caught sight of him fighting desperately in the midst of the persians and he at once made his way down to that spot he was not long in discovering angus who was lying insensible bleeding from a number of sabre wounds calling four afghans he ordered him to be carried on to the wall there he bandaged his wounds and then had him placed on a stretcher and carried to their lodging taking on himself to send an order to the wuzeers own medical attendant to go there at once and attend to his wounds then he turned his attention to the wuzeer the mind of the minister had been almost unhinged by the terrible events and he was still wandering about in a confused and bewildered way several of the other chiefs were similarly affected and were unable for days afterwards to perform their usual duties the soldiers themselves instead of being excited over their victory were as gloomy and depressed as if they had suffered a defeat the peril had been so great the city had been so nearly lost that there was a general feeling that another such attack would be successful their confidence hitherto had rested upon the wuzeer and on the conviction that their courage was infinitely greater than that of the persians and they had found that the persians could now fight as well and stoutly as they themselves they were humiliated by knowing that it was to a young english officer they owed it that the persians had failed in their object and that another young englishman scarce more than a boy had led their best and bravest into the thick of the fray and had himself penetrated beyond them into the midst of the persians and had fallen there none appreciate bravery more than do the afghans it was not so much that pottinger had exposed himself recklessly to the shower of bullets with which the persians in their trenches swept the spot where he was standing with the wuzeer but that he should have ventured to abuse revile and even forcibly drag their dreaded leader forward astounded them all herat felt that it was he who had saved the city and the fame of the deed spread through the country round and men when they came in sought him out and kissed his hand with enthusiasm a deep gloom however hung over the city even the work of repairing the damaged fortifications was carried on apathetically they had repulsed the persians but it was felt that nothing but a miracle could enable them to withstand another such assault food was all but exhausted the treasury was empty the inhabitants could not be fed the soldiers could not be paid but an equal amount of depression was felt in the persian camp five assaults had all failed and some eighteen hundred of their best troops had fallen the loss of officers had been enormous the russian general berowski had been killed and two of the principal persian generals another russian general sampson and two pashas had been wounded and almost all the field officers of the regiments engaged in the attack were hors de combat pottingers position was a very painful one the need for money to pay the troops was absolute and the wuzeer when he had recovered from the effects of his scare instituted a reign of terror even more terrible than anything the wretched inhabitants had ever before felt the soldiers went from house to house and all suspected of possessing money were seized and tortured even ladies of rank were so treated and the very inmates of kamrans zenana were threatened and had to contribute their jewels pottinger felt that it was solely owing to his influence that the city had so long held out and as he went through the streets starving men reproached him as the author of their sufferings he did all that he could but that was little men of all ranks came to him imploring his aid and protection some he was able to save but for others he could do nothing never was a young soldier placed in so terrible a dilemma as a man he was agonized by the sufferings he saw round himsufferings he could at once bring to an end by advising the wuzeer to surrender as a soldier and an englishman he felt that it was his duty to hold out to the bitter end his position became still more difficult when a fortnight after the assault the persians again opened negotiations demanding however as a first step that he should be expelled from the city pottinger declared that no thought of personal safety should persuade him to stand in the way of any arrangement conducive to the safety of herat and the welfare of his country and that if these could be gained by his departure he would willingly leave the town but yar mahomed was undecided he felt that the dismissal of the man who had saved herat would be a stain on his character and moreover that the persians having obtained his dismissal would become still more exorbitant in their demands he had long expected the arrival of a relieving force of turkomans and pottinger was convinced that ere long the intervention of england would compel the persians to fall back the bombardment of the city had not been renewed since the repulse of the attack and the persians relied now solely upon famine to reduce it and maintained a strict blockade in order to mitigate the horrors he saw around him pottinger undertook that all who voluntarily brought in their money should be reimbursed at his recommendation by the british government this brought some money in though slowly and july passed then a deserter from the persian camp brought in news that there was a report that a great british army had landed in the persian gulf had taken bushire and was advancing this report had fortunately enormously magnified the strength of the british expedition and the news gave fresh life to the defenders of herat the persians again opened negotiations waiving the question of the expulsion of pottinger but the wuzeer was less inclined than before to yield to the persian demands mneill was on his way to the frontier when he was informed of the arrival of the british expedition to the persian gulf and at the same time received instructions from the foreign office in anticipation of the refusal of the shah to retire from before herat fortified by these instructions he despatched colonel stoddart to the persian camp with a message to the shah he arrived there on the th of august and on the next day had an interview with the shah who welcomed him with cordiality and listened to the message from the british government it means then he said that if i do not leave herat there will be war it all depends upon your majestys answer stoddart replied two days later stoddart was again summoned to the royal presence we consent the shah said to the whole of the demands from the british government we will not go to war were it not for the sake of their friendship we should not return from before herat had we known that by our coming here we should risk the loss of their friendship we certainly should not have come at all in reply colonel stoddart said he thanked god that his majesty had taken so wise a view of the real interests of persia but as he left the audience he hinted to the persian minister that although the shahs answer was very satisfactory it would be more satisfactory still to see it at once reduced to practice although rumours reached the city that the persians were about to leave it was not for another week that the rumours became a certainty an effort was made to induce the wuzeer to make some concessions that would give a better grace to the withdrawal of the shah some of the conditions suggested were refused by pottingers advice but on the th of september the persian prisoners in the town were sent into camp and on the th the persian army began their march back to teheran it was time indeed that they did so for they had but three or four days supply of forage remaining and their flour and grain were almost all exhausted their failure to capture so weakly fortified a place was in pottingers opinion due to the fact that there was no union of effort the commanders of the various sections of the army acted independently and except when under the command of the russians they made a simultaneous attack they never acted in concert with each other it was his opinion that the shah might have carried the city by assault the very first day that he reached herat he declared that the persians were equally as brave as and far better soldiers than the afghans and that they had an ample supply of artillery to capture a strong fortress if properly employed for a week after the struggle of the th of june angus campbell lay between life and death he had lost a great quantity of blood and when first carried to his room his armenian friends believed him to be dead pottinger who had hurried back as soon as he saw that there was no chance of a renewal of the assault went to kamrans and obtained some spirits and with the aid of these the action of the heart which had before been so slight that the pulse could not be felt was stimulated and respiration grew stronger kamrans doctor had already declared that none of the wounds were in themselves dangerous but that he despaired of the patient recovering pottinger however by no means despaired he procured some fresh meat and ordered a servant to make the strongest broth possible and to pour a spoonful between the patients lips every few minutes angus was wrapped in warm blankets and a large bottle of hot water placed against his feet the wounds had already been carefully dressed and bandaged by the surgeon for although almost entirely ignorant as to the use of drugs afghan doctors had abundant practice in the treatment of wounds pottinger remained two or three hours and then seeing that angus was breathing regularly though feebly and that the pulse could now be felt at the wrist hurried off to see that the work of repairing the breach had been taken in hand kajars wife undertaking to look after the patient for a week the issue of the struggle was doubtful then the improvement although slow was distinct and day by day some slight advance was made the ladies of kamrans zenana were much interested in the young englishman and frequently sent down presents of fruit and perfumes both were welcome the air of herat was very unfavourable to wounds but a little scent sprinkled on a muslin curtain drawn across the window to some extent neutralized the terrible stenches of the town and a handkerchief steeped in water to which a little of the perfume had been added was laid lightly over the bandages in three weeks angus was able to sit up for a time and a week later he walked across the room his progress was now more rapid and by the end of july he was able to sit on a donkey as far as the city wall where he could breathe a purer air than that of the city and by the end of august he could walk freely about the town but he was listless and without energy it was now certain that in a very short time the persians would draw off you must be out of this as soon as you can angus pottinger said to him one evening what you want is some mountain air you will never get better as long as you remain in this pestilential atmosphere it is enough to kill a healthy dog and i only wonder that the whole population has not been swept away when mneill was here he told me that if our people interfered and herat was saved he should appoint me officially as the british resident envoy he said that he was sure the british government would send money and do all that was possible to alleviate the misery that has been suffered by the inhabitants and although i would infinitely rather have other employment it seems to me that it is clearly my duty to stay here it is largely owing to me that these poor people have suffered for ten months the horrors of the siege and the least i can do is to help them now for if i did not you may be sure that any money sent by england would simply remain in the coffers of kamran and the wuzeer it is said and i quite believe it that a large proportion of the money wrung by torture from these wretched people has been retained by yar mahomed it is therefore absolutely necessary if the people are to be fed their houses rebuilt and matters tided over till trade recovers that a british officer be here to receive and superintend the distribution of british money but the very day the gate is open you had better be off you speak afghan now perfectly and i am glad to see that azim has picked it up too he is a capital fellow and has watched over you since you have been ill as if you had been his father the question is do you feel strong enough to travel through the mountains if not there is nothing for it but for you to return to teheran and stay there till your strength is restored angus shook his head i dont think that i could stand the journey across the plains he said nor that i should pick up much at teheran while i believe that in the hills i should soon get braced up there is nothing really the matter with me now except that i feel lazy if there had been fighting going on and there was something i must do i should soon shake it off but what with the sight of the misery of the people here and the stinks and the heat i feel myself that i am making no progress i believe i shall be a different man as soon as i am once out of this place and on my way to the hills it will soon be getting cold up there and in a fortnight i shall be fit for anything i think you are right angus i would give a good deal myself for a few hours in the fresh mountain air i do think that you are strong enough to travel quietly of course you will have to do so as i did in disguise and indeed this will be much more necessary now than it was a year ago it is well known that the chiefs at candahar have been long negotiating with persia and have offered to place themselves under the shahs protection and that encouraged and pushed on by russia they have meditated an invasion of india the news of the failure here will no doubt moderate their ardour but from all that has been learned from afghans who have come into the town during the siege there is throughout the whole country a feeling of deep excitement at the prospect of another mohammedan invasion of india and a conviction that the whole country would rise and join the persians were they to advance to candahar the afghans consider that russian influence really means persian influence whereas we know that it is just the other way and that russia only uses persia as her catspaw as for the persians we know now what they are worth and that a british division would be sufficient to smash them up but the afghans dont know that they believe that persia is the persia of old and that with her aid they could assuredly drive the british out of india this being the state of feeling your chance of getting through were it discovered that you were british would be small indeed you must pass as a persian who having long traded with herat has learnt the afghan language it would be a natural story that finding that herat is ruined and that there can be no trade between it and persia for a long time you are travelling south with the intention of fixing yourself at candahar and of trading between that town and india on the one side and persia on the other you can account for your not having merchandise with you by saying that owing to the presence of the persian army and marauders from herat and the general disturbance of the country it would not have been safe to travel with merchandise i will certainly carry out your plan angus said i dont think there will be any difficulty in getting through but i do wish that you were coming with me i hope it will not be very long before i follow you for i think there will be some stirring work there soon angus was well provided with money he had received from mr mneill a sum that would not only cover all the expenses of his journey to herat but would enable him either to return to teheran or proceed to india as circumstances might determine in addition to this he had received a years salary in recognition of the risk he incurred he had this sum still in his possession the money he had brought from tabriz he had left at the embassy mr mneill promising to send an order for the amount should he write for it from india chapter v in candahar on the th of september angus started after a tearful farewell from his armenian friends their gratitude to him and pottinger was unbounded the presence and influence of their two english guests had preserved them from the rapacity and cruelty of the wuzeer while all other merchants and traders in the town had been maltreated and robbed and in many cases had died under the tortures inflicted to wring from them treasures it was believed they possessed kajar and his brother and their families alone enjoyed an immunity from persecution both had determined that they would leave herat and taking with them their workmen establish themselves at teheran or tabriz where the profit of their work might be less but they would at least be able to enjoy it in security such as could never be hoped for as long as yar mahomed was the virtual ruler of herat the period that had elapsed since angus left teheran had changed him much he was no longer a boy for he had been doing mans work he was now nearly eighteen years old and had attained his full height of nearly six feet his illness had pulled him down much and sharpened his features and except for his lighter colour he really more closely resembled an afghan than the persian trader he was dressed to represent the pallor caused by his illness had been succeeded by a deep tan caused by his passing so many hours daily in the sun during his convalescence i am glad to be out of herat azim said as he looked back at the walls so am i azim i thought at one time that i was never coming out at all it is a very bad place master in persia the governors squeeze the people a bit and sometimes there is much grumbling but the worst of them are very much better than yar mahomed who is a son of sheitan whom may allah confound he is a scoundrel angus agreed heartily i wonder myself that the people of herat have not long since risen and torn him to pieces i know that if i had been a merchant there i should have tried to stir them up to do it azim shook his head they cannot trust each other effendi there are many who would like to do as you have said but there are many who cannot trust their own neighbours then i would do it myself look how many old men were tortured to death some of them must have had sons had my father been so tortured i would have lain in wait for the wuzeer day after day in some empty housethere are plenty of them in one of the streets by which he usually went from his palace to the wallsand as he rode past i would have put a bullet in his head i would then have escaped from the back of the house if possible no one would have seen who had fired the shot and i should have been safe if once away if i were overtaken i would put a pistol to my head so as to avoid being tortured to death i cannot understand thirty or forty thousand people continuing to support the rule of a tyrant when one bold man could put an end to it once on his way angus felt new life in his veins and in a week he had entirely shaken off the feeling of lassitude that had oppressed him in the poisoned air of herat and felt equal to any ordinary exertion as he had expected he met with no difficulties whatever on his way for on the road between herat and candahar the afghans were accustomed to see persian traders passing and no suspicion whatever was felt that angus and his attendant were other than they represented themselves to be the journey was a long one but angus did not hurry it was pleasant to him after being for a year cooped up in the besieged city to travel quietly in the fresh mountain air the scenery was all new to him and though azim felt the cold a good deal angus enjoyed it immensely he made short stages and never exceeded twenty miles a day and often when he arrived at a village which offered fair accommodation he was content to stay when only fourteen or fifteen had been traversed as this was the great highroad of trade there were khans in almost every village and there was no difficulty in purchasing the necessaries of life everywhere the talk was of war once beyond the territory over which shah mahomed ruled the news that the persians had failed to take herat and had retired had excited regret it had been regarded as certain that the place would fall and all had anticipated the march of a persian and russian army to candahar to be followed by a grand invasion of india the mountaineers had felt sure that the army would gladly pay whatever was demanded for permission to pass unmolested that they would be ready to pay high prices for provisions and the hire of transport animals so that they would enrich themselves in the first place and then have a chance of sharing in the plunder of india and the destruction of the infidels angus was appealed to by all with whom he conversed to explain how it was that the shah with his great army had failed to take herat he was eagerly questioned too with regard to russia a country of which they had heard many strange rumours were they very strong were they really in alliance with persia were they infidels if so how was it that the shah was friendly with them to the first of these questions angus could only reply that not having been in the persian camp he was unable to give them information there were certainly russian generals and officers leading the persians at the siege of herat they were infidels and neighbours of the persians for himself he thought that while no doubt the shah wished to be at peace with such powerful neighbours he would be wise not to trust them very far he could not really wish for them to become more powerful and if they aided him it could only be for their own objects as a peaceful man he himself only desired to trade and left these matters to wiser heads but at the same time he knew that russia was constantly extending its dominions at the expense of its neighbours and that as it was a christian country it certainly could not be thinking of invading india for the benefit of the mohammedans of that country or those of afghanistancertainly not those of persia whatever the shah and the military officers might think the trading classes were uneasy at the influence that russia was gaining and apprehensive of the growing power and proximity of a neighbour possessed of such immense forces and of ambitious views two months after leaving herat angus entered candahar the journey had been wholly without any incident of importance the appearance of candahar somewhat resembled that of herat situated in a fertile plain with a range of craggy hills at no great distance and surrounded by a wall it was incapable of offering any prolonged resistance to the attack of a european force provided with siege artillery the town was a comparatively modern one being founded in on the site of an ancient city it was built on a regular plan the streets all crossing each other at right angles like herat it had four principal streets meeting in the centre each of these feet wide and lined with shops streams of water ran down almost every street the town made a very favourable impression on angus after the ruin and dirt of herat as a persian he felt at home here for persian inscriptions and names met his eye everywhere as throughout afghanistan the whole of the trade is carried on by persians or by natives of india the afghans themselves deeming the profession of arms the only one honourable the upper classes among them all habitually spoke persian which language was generally employed in writing and in all official communications angus put up at a khan which he learned was frequented by traders passing through the city and soon made the acquaintance of several merchants lodging there from them he learned much more of the state of affairs than he had gathered in the afghan villages he had passed through on the journey the english were it was said gathering a great army in scinde with the intention of placing shah soojah on the throne of afghanistan instead of dost mahomed of all the blunders that have been committed from the time of our first arrival in india none is comparable in point of injustice hopeless blundering or misfortune to the policy thus inaugurated in afghanistan shah soojah was the head of the dooranee tribe and had been overthrown by the barukzyes who had gradually attained a power which the dooranee monarch was unable to withstand the four princes of that tribe divided the kingdom between themselves and after waging many wars against each other dost mahomed the youngest of the four brothers became ruler of cabul during these wars peshawur had been captured by the great sikh ruler runjeet sing in shah soojah made an effort to recover his kingdom but was defeated and again became a fugitive in british india dost mahomed alarmed at the preparations made by the sikhs for still further dismembering his country and by the fact that his two brothers who were lords of candahar might at any moment take advantage of his troubles with the sikhs to throw off his authority altogether was anxious to enter into an alliance with the british all the more so as he had learned of the everincreasing influence of russia in persia lord auckland sent captain burnes to cabul nominally his purpose was to arrange for a larger commercial intercourse between the two countries he was received with great honour in cabul but he had come altogether unprovided with the customary presents and dost mahomed reasonably felt this as a studied slight nevertheless he exerted himself to the utmost to obtain the alliance of the british but burnes had no authority whatever to treat with him and could give him no assurances that aid would be forthcoming if on the fall of herat which was considered certain the persians and russians aided by the candahar chiefs who were known to be in correspondence with them were to invade his territory nor could he obtain any promise that the british would use their influence with runjeet sing to restore peshawur burnes saw how sincere was the desire of the ameer for a close friendship with england and wrote strongly to lord auckland in favour of an alliance with him he pointed out that dost mahomed was firmly seated at cabul where he had reigned for ten years that shah soojah had no adherents and even if placed on the throne could not maintain himself there colonel pottinger the resident in scinde also gave the same advice but lord auckland paid no attention whatever to their representations a weak man he was guided chiefly by mr macnaghten his secretary a comparatively young man with great ambition and an unbounded belief in himself but as events proved with few of the qualities required in a man placed in a highly responsible and difficult position in india burnes was instructed to insist upon the ameers binding himself to make no alliances whatever without the consent of england and at the same time he was to refuse to give any pledges in return for such a concession a more preposterous demand was never made upon an independent sovereign for a long time the ameer strove in vain to obtain some sort of conditions and at length finding this hopeless he threw himself into the arms of the russian agent whom he had hitherto treated with great coldness burness position became intolerable and he was recalled and lord auckland at once prepared to place shah soojah on the throne by force runjeet sing was asked to join in the undertaking and at a great durbar held in the punjaub the conditions were arranged under which shah soojah was to pay a large amount to runjeet as well as to the british for the aid they were to give him as if it was not enough to have united all afghanistan against us the people of scinde who had hitherto been on good terms with us were treated as if they were enemies they were ordered to furnish provisions and carriage for the army and to pay large sums of money although they had by the terms of a treaty with us been guaranteed against any claim whatever for money or services it would seem indeed that lord auckland and mr macnaghten had neglected no step whatever that could ensure the failure of their enterprise when after the war the papers relating to the policy that had occasioned it were published in the form of a bluebook it is significant that the passages in the letters of burnes and pottinger remonstrating against the course proposed by lord auckland were suppressed dishonesty being thus added to the terrible blunders of the weakest and most obstinate of the governorgenerals of indiablunders that caused not only the utter destruction of a british army but led to an almost equally unjust war for the conquest of scinde as far as angus could learn the candahar princes were making no preparations whatever to take part in the war the general idea was that they would gladly see dost mahomed overthrown and shah soojah placed on the throne feeling certain that the latter would not be able to retain his position and that they would have a far better chance of becoming masters of the whole of afghanistan then than they could have so long as their brother remained on the throne three days after his arrival an officer from the palace called upon angus and requested him to accompany him there as the princes wished to question him as to the reasons for the persians retiring from before herat on arriving at the palace he was shown into a small chamber where kihurelkhan with two of his brothers was sitting i have heard that you have arrived here and that you passed by herat just as your shah had left with his army that is so prince angus said bowing deeply you have come hither for purposes of trade from what city do you come from tabriz i represent one of the largest merchants there and he mentioned the name of a wellknown trader when i left it was considered certain that herat would speedily be captured and that the shah would move forward here having it was said entered into an alliance with you therefore my patron said to me go you to candahar doubtless in future trade with northern india will go by that route instead of by sea and candahar will be a mighty centre of trade therefore go and see for yourself what are the prospects and the price at which goods can be carried from the present frontier to that city and thence into scinde find out for me whether there are any hindrances to trade along the road what are the charges for permission to travel through the passes held by various tribes and the disposition of the people towards traders how was it that you did not turn back when you found that your army was retiring without having captured herat i thought it best still to go on as i had come so far angus replied the shah it is true was retiring but he might return in the spring and i could not doubt that with your powerful friendship he would the next time succeed and the information that i should gain would enable my patron to send off without delay a large caravan of merchandise if he found it expedient to do so were you in the persian camp no your highness an army when it is retiring is best avoided by peaceful men when all goes well the camp officers see that traders are not meddled with by the soldiers but when things are not going favourably and there is discontent in camp discipline is relaxed and it is useless for those who are robbed or maltreated to make complaints that is no doubt true but doubtless you heard a good deal from those who have been in the camp how did men say it was that they failed to capture herat which is but a weak town some say one thing and some another your highness some declare that had it not been for a british officer who happened to be there the place would have fallen in a very short time others say that it could have been taken easily had all the persian generals been of one mind but that each acted for himself and that only once did all attack at the same time the prince nodded he had seen very many times the evil of divided counsels and knew how necessary it was that there should be a strong leader who could make himself obeyed by all and what do people say about the russians we know that they had officers there we hear that they are a great people and are good friends with persians opinions are divided prince there are those who believe that their friendship will indeed be a great advantage to persia there are others especially among the trading class who think otherwise and believe that russia is too strong to be a real friend and that it would be far better to maintain a close alliance with england which would support them against russia and which lies so far away across the seas that it could gain nothing by meddling in her affairs or taking her territory but it is reported that it is the english who have now interfered and have saved herat and are sending a fleet and an army to compel persia to desist that is what was reported and generally believed prince but i cannot say how truly i merely heard the common talk on the way but why should england have interfered what does it matter to them whether herat belongs to persia or to the suddozye prince kamran according to the opinion of the traders in tabriz england would not have cared at all had persia been strong and been fighting only for the conquest of herat but it was known that england regards with great jealousy the approach of russia to india and considers that as persia was certainly acting under the influence of russia it was the latter who would be the real masters of herat and not the persians then too it was saidthough we know that rumour often liesthat russia and persia had many friends in afghanistan and that the conquest of herat would only be the first step to further advances south kihurelkhan frowned such an undertaking had certainly been made by him and his brothers but the retreat of the persians from herat at the dictation of the english and the fact that the latter were now gathering an army with the avowed purpose of placing shah soojah on the throne of afghanistan gravely altered the position they had no love for their brother and had a british force advanced through the khyber passes to cabul and placed shah soojah on the throne they would certainly have rendered no assistance to dost mahomed for they felt sure that soojah would not be able to maintain himself and saw that there was a good chance that in the confusion which would prevail they themselves might obtain the mastery of cabul but as the english army was evidently intending to advance through the bolan pass it would probably in the first place march on candahar and they themselves would in consequence of their intrigues with persia and russia be regarded as enemies he was therefore silent for a minute or two and then said if the shah has retired because he is afraid of the english he will not venture to send another army to aid us against them i do not think that he could do so his army suffered very heavily i hear that you speak the language of our country how is that the afghan asked suddenly i do not speak it well your highness replied angus who had thought is possible that this question might be asked him having known for some time that i should make this journey hither i studied for a time with a slave who had been bought by a merchant of my employers acquaintance who had himself bought him from the turkomans in a journey that he made in their country but i speak it only well enough to make my way through the country and to obtain such necessaries as may be required on the journey and to converse in some fashion with such travellers as i might meet on the road or in the khans it was reported to me that you spoke so that all could understand you he said it was this that seemed strange to me that you a persian should speak pushtoo i will speak to you further another day as angus returned to the khan he felt that he was an object of suspicion up to the point when the prince had sharply and suddenly asked how he came to speak pushtoo his bland manner had led him to believe that he had been simply desirous of obtaining the last news from the frontier but this showed him unmistakably that the prince had learned something which had excited his suspicions that he was there either as an emissary from kamran or of russia or persia desirous of ascertaining the position of affairs at candahar the forces at the disposal of the princes and the feeling among the people in general with reference to a protectorate or occupation by one or other of those powers angus knew the naturally suspicious character of eastern princes in persia no one ever ventured to discuss any public affairs openly in herat hated as kamran and yar mahomed were no one dared breathe a word of aught but adulation for the slightest suspicion of disloyalty sufficed to bring about the ruin and death of the unfortunate man on whom it fell the last words of the prince were in fact a sentence of imprisonment to the city for an indefinite time the prince might not send for him again for months but the mere intimation that he would do so was sufficient he could not continue his journey without running the risk of being pursued and brought back again in which case he might first be tortured to extract any secret he might possess and then be put to death he might for aught he knew be already spied upon and everything that he said or did reported consequently when he reached the khan he took care to evince no appearance of thoughtfulness or uneasiness but chatted with the traders there upon commercial matters respecting the advantages of cabul and candahar as trading centres the amount of the taxes laid upon goods in the two cities and other topics that would naturally be of interest to a merchant intending to establish himself in afghanistan he was under no uneasiness as to azim he had instructed him carefully in the account he should give of himself the city from which he came the merchants whose agent he was the route he had followed and other similar matters so that their stories should correspond in all respects when all had lain down for the night angus was able to think over quietly what was to be done as to remaining where he was it was clearly out of the question for aught he knew the british force said to be gathering to advance on cabul might be months before it was put in motion or the expedition might be abandoned altogether even if the advance was made it might not pass through candahar and he might be detained in that city for an indefinite time it was evident therefore that he must somehow escape the question was how this could be managed what disguise could he adopt and how could he evade the vigilance of those who were watching him the matter was rendered all the more difficult by the fact that there were practically but two roads open to him that through the kojak pass to quettah and that to the northeast through kelatighilzye and ghuznee to cabul if he moved off either of these regular lines of traffic he would be unable to give any reason for his divergence and in any case would be subject to plunder even on these roads it was only as a travelling merchant he would be respected and as a travelling merchant he would be quickly overtaken by the princes followers think as he would no plan occurred to him and he at last went to sleep determining to consult azim in whose sharpness he had much faith in the morning accordingly as soon as he was up he sauntered across the yard to where the boy was watching the horses feed and preventing other less fortunate animals from robbing them azim he said the princes have their suspicions of me and have as much as ordered me not to leave the town try and think over some manner in which we may get away and if overtaken may not be recognized i do not wish to talk with you now because for aught we know a spy may be at present watching us but at midday i will come out and speak to you again in the meantime think it over now when the horses have done feeding take your basket go into the bazaar and buy food for our dinner so that anyone who may be watching us may suppose that i have merely been giving you orders what to purchase he then went out into the town and spent the morning looking into the shops and asking questions as to the prices of the goods so that he might appear to be ascertaining what profits would be made he also went to several shops which happened to be untenanted asked the rent and made enquiries about the accommodation at dinnertime he went over to where azim was squatting attending to two earthenware pots that were simmering over a small charcoal fire which he was fanning to keep it going i can think of nothing master then tonight azim after everyone is asleep get up quietly and go round to the back of the khan i will join you there and we will talk it over together do not be surprised if i keep you waiting some time some of these people may sit up late talking i cannot move till all are asleep it is quite possible that someone who is lodging at the khan may be watching us it was indeed late before the talk ceased and all lay down to sleep angus waited for another hour and then got up quietly and went out two minutes later he joined azim well lad have you thought of any plan yet nothing master unless we leave our animals and goods behind us that we could do angus said i can get rid of the goods tomorrow why leave the animals because sir they will be looking for a man with a fair complexion and a boy mounted on horses that is so but if we left the horses behind us and walked it would be just as bad i did not think of walking master i thought that perhaps you might buy a camel and go on that that would be better certainly azim we might both darken our faces and in my afghan dress might make our way easily enough if it were not that we should be hotly pursued and then a man and boy however they were dressed or however they were travelling would be sure to be closely examined i have it he said after a pause you might go as a woman well wrapped up little more than your eyes would be seen you might ride on the camel and i might lead it in that way we might pass as natives of some village among the hills the first difficulty however is how to buy a camel i have my afghan dress and if i were sure that i was not watched could get to some quiet spot change my persian dress for it and go boldly into a shop and buy a womans clothes for you i could then go down into the quarter where the tribesmen encamp and buy a camel but if i were caught doing so it would be almost proof positive that i was going to try to leave the city and in that case i should no doubt be arrested and thrown into prison at once we might steal one azim suggested there are many always grazing outside the wall while their masters are here doing their business yes but they have not saddles however i will think it over azim your idea about having a camel has certainly shown me a way in which we can get away if it is managed well and i ought to be able to find some plan by which we can carry it out it is of no use talking any longer over it there is no hurry for a day or two and the longer i appear to be really engaged in looking for a place of business the more careless the watch may become angus did not go to sleep that night but thinking the situation over in every way decided that the first step to be taken was to ascertain for certain whether they were watched if they were not the matter would be comparatively easy but if his every movement were followed he could see no way out of the difficulty when he paid his usual visit to azim in the morning he said i want to find out if i am followed i will walk straight along this street towards the southern gate when i get to the last turning to the left i will turn up it then i shall be out of the crowd do you keep a good long way behind me i shall go on for some distance and then mount the wall and walk along there looking over the country i want you to observe if any man follows me you must be so far off that even if he looks round he will not recognize you i dont want you to find out this time who he is we can do that later on i only want to know if i am followed each time i turn a corner he is likely to look round before he turns so when you see him getting near a corner that i have turned hide yourself if you can i understand master accordingly when half an hour later angus came out the lad waited for a time and then followed him his master was out of sight and azim walked quickly till he saw him looking as usual into one of the shops and then dropped behind again and followed slowly until angus turned off the street that he had named azim walked still more slowly and on reaching the corner saw him a considerable distance ahead there were but a few people about for beyond the four principal streets were many large open spaces dotted here and there with ruined walls of houses that had stood there at the time when the city was far more populous than it was at present angus was walking at a steady pace as if he had some definite object in view and of the various people in sight only one who was about half way between him and azim was walking at anything like the same rate a hundred yards farther angus turned to the right azim kept on until he saw the man he was watching was close to that point he then stepped aside into an empty piece of ground between two houses half a minute later he looked out the man was no longer visible he walked on fast until he reached the corner and saw the man again turn off after angus they were near the wall now and the boy went forward with greater caution than before when he got to where he had last seen his master he caught sight of him on the wall some fifty yards away the man who had been following him had stopped at a low wall and over it was watching angus furtively that settled the point and azim at once returned to the khan it was an hour later before angus came in he did not pay any attention to azim but went in and engaged in talk as usual with some of the occupants it was an hour before he came out to the yard well lad he asked you were watched master a man followed you all the way and hid behind a wall to watch you when you went on the wall i thought at the time that i might have crept up to him and stabbed him if i had wanted to but of course i would not without your orders no that would not have done at all till we are ready to go and i dont like stabbing anyhow still i will think it over come round again to the same meetingplace tonight by that time i shall have decided what to do chapter vi an escape i think azim angus said when they met that night you must buy some clothes for yourself you may be pretty sure that no one is watching you you must not get them at any shop in the main street because there are always passersby who stop and listen to the bargains made but there are some bystreets where there are a few shops of course you will go into a persians if you give a fair pricenot too high you know so as to seem too anxious to buyi dont suppose he will trouble much what you may want them for you must make out some likely storysay for example that your master keeps a sharp lookout over you and that you want to be able to go out sometimes in such a dress that he would not know you if he met you i dont know that that is a good excuse but i am unable to think of a better one all you will want will be a long white robe coming over the head and down to the eyebrows and falling to the feet and a white cloth coming across the face below the eyes and falling down over the throat there is no occasion to buy other garments a rug torn asunder and wrapped round the waist falling to the feet so as to fill up the outside robe is all that will be required but the more i think of it azim the greater appears the difficulty about the camel indeed now that we have ascertained about this spy it seems to me hardly possible to make a start without being pursued at once azim nodded approvingly that is just what i think master but i could put a knife into him and then all trouble would be over i dont like the idea of killing the man azim you killed many men at herat that was in battle which is a very different thing from stabbing a man to enable us to get away azim shook his head this was quite beyond him he is fighting against you now master if the princes find out that you are english they will put you in a dungeon and most likely kill you and kill me too so as to shut my mouth this man is paid to act as a spy on you why not kill him thousands of people were killed or died at herat i cannot understand why one man should not be killed when we can perhaps get free away if he is dead if he found us escaping and attacked us we could kill him azim but it is not an englishmans way to kill men except in fight azim shook his head to his mind this was very foolish perhaps we might make him prisoner azim where could we put him in prison azim enquired with his eyes wide open in surprise i dont mean in a prison azim i mean in some empty house or some outoftheway place we might tie his arms and legs and gag him azims eyes twinkled i see master you do not like to use a knife good we can bind and hide him perhaps no one would come for a long time may be a year and finding only a skeleton would not bother about him he would just say it was some fellow killed by robbers no no azim angus said in a tone of horror i never thought of such a thing no doubt someone would come along and let him out someone might come master he might come a few minutes after we had gone then they would catch us at once if someone did not come in an hour why should he come in a week or a month angus was silent no azim you dont quite understand me i meant that he should be gagged and bound after dark and then be left in some place a little distance from the road where he would not be seen till morning then the first person who came along would turn aside and look at him and he would be loosed but we should have got twelve hours start that would be a good plan master but how should we get the camel in that case we should make a start without it for we might ride fifty miles perhaps a good deal more than that before it would be discovered that we had gone we could do that in our present dress and then i could put on my afghan clothes and go into a village off the road and say that the horses were tired and that i wanted to go on and so buy a camel azim shook his head anyone who wanted to go on fast master would not buy a camel angus uttered an exclamation of disgust and azim struck another blow at his plan by saying how would you get the horses out master the gates are shut at dark you could not tie up the spy till after the gates were shut and in the morning he might be found and we should be caught as we went out i am getting altogether stupid angus said of course you are right the horses could not be sent out beforehand for if the spy saw them going out he would at once inform his employers and i should be arrested ah i have an idea that trader from scinde who arrived here yesterday was saying that as he intended to stay here for some time he would sell his horses if he could get a fair price for them i might say that i would buy two of them as they are better than mine and as i wanted to travel fast i would give him my two and some money for them i dare say he would be willing to do that as our horses would sell more easily than his one can always sell a poor horse while one might have to wait some time before finding a purchaser for a good one i dont suppose really there is much difference in value between his and mine and he would think he was making a good bargain i should say that for certain reasons which it would not be necessary to explain to him it must be a part of the bargain that he should deliver them outside the city and that one of his men should take them out during the day and wait for us at a spot we could agree upon that would be a capital plan master then we will carry it out azim shall i get the womans dress yes you may as well do that we may want all sorts of disguises before we get down we need not talk any longer now at any rate we certainly shall not try the plan tomorrow we must not appear in any hurry with the trader and there are several things we shall have to talk over when i have struck a bargain with him the next night angus was able to inform his follower that he had made his arrangements with the scinde trader i am to buy his horses he said and he will deliver them in the way i want without saying it he evidently understood that i wanted to get quietly out of the city to escape some trouble he asked a very reasonable price but he would have nothing to do with my horses he said that if there should be any trouble about my leaving the change of horses might be noticed if he said he had bought them of me and sold me two of his he might get into trouble too however i afterwards talked to one of the other merchants who was going away in a day or two and told him that i might be kept here for a considerable time and should therefore be glad to get rid of my horses he said he would be glad to buy them as he was taking down a number of heratee carpets and other things so we struck a bargain at once and he paid me the money and i gave him the receipt i said that you would continue to look after the horses as usual until we started so that matter is quite arranged the scinde man will keep the horses i have bought with his others till he sends them out through the gate when he does so he will put our saddles on them now for our plans tomorrow i shall go out as usual in the morning the spy will of course follow me while i am away make up our rugs and disguises and fasten them upon the saddles and take these to the new horses so that the traders servant will put them on with the saddles and take them out with the horses before sunset he is to stop at those three palmtrees that grow by the roadside a quarter of a mile out of the town even if the spy is looking on as they go out of the yard he will have no idea that i have anything to do with the horses when you have seen to that you will buy twenty yards of rope for us to get down over the wall i shall start at about four oclock i shall go exactly the same way as i did the last time you followed me it is a very lonely part there he is sure to watch me very closely as he will wonder why i choose that way for my walks i shall stay there for a bit and shall lean over the wall as if i were calculating its depth and intended to make my escape there he is sure to be intent on watching my movements and will get up as close as he can then is your time to steal up do you think that you can do it without his hearing you if not i should think that a better plan will be for you to hide close to the way we shall come back i shall not return till it is beginning to get dark and he will probably keep closer to me than he would going so as to better watch my movements when he comes along you will spring out and knock him down and i will as you shout run back to your assistance i shall not want any assistance master azim said confidently i am sure i am quite as strong as he is and as i shall take him by surprise i shall have no difficulty in managing him dont use your sword azim no master i will get a thick stick of course you will bring the rope with you azim the twenty yards will be ample to spare a length to tie him up with and to reach to the ground from the top of the wall you may as well put enough food for a couple of days in the saddlebags and a supply of grain for the horses then we shall not have to stop to buy anything the day passed quietly azim bought the heaviest staff that he could find and brought it back and stowed it away during his masters absence as he did not think that the latter would approve of its weight he considered his masters objection to his stabbing the spy to be a weakness which he was quite unable to understand at four oclock angus started and a few minutes later the traders servant led the two horses he had bought through the streets and out at the southern gate azim waited till he saw him go as there was no occasion for him to follow the spy closely and indeed it had been arranged that he should not do so lest the spy should this time notice him and perhaps take alarm he therefore strolled leisurely along until he neared the spot where angus was standing on the wall the spy had taken up his post nearer to him than before and was evidently watching narrowly what he was doing as he might turn round suddenly azim seated himself behind a ruined hut within a couple of yards of the road and there patiently waited until as darkness fell angus came along i am here master azim said take care of yourself angus replied without stopping he will probably have pistols and certainly a knife all right master azim stood up now grasping the heavy staff firmly in both hands listening intently he heard a minute later a soft footstep and the spy passed him keeping his eye fixedly on the figure ahead of him azim sprang out and swinging his staff round his head brought it with all his strength against the back of the mans head just below his turban he fell without a sound he is down master the lad cried angus who had been listening for the sound of a struggle and had heard the blow came running back why it was almost like the sound of a pistol he said as he saw the motionless figure yes master i was obliged to hit him hard because as you said he might have pistols you have stunned him angus went on going up to the prostrate figure now cut off a length of that rope and we will tie him up securely he tied the mans legs and then turned him over the inertness of the body struck him and he placed his ear over his heart he is dead he said he is not breathing and his heart is not beating you have hit him too hard well i did hit him hard master it is a misfortune but perhaps it is all for the best undoubtedly it was allahs will that he should die well it cannot be helped angus said and undoubtedly it will make it safer for us well let us move on do you go on master and i will take his clothes off and drag him into this hut he may lie there for months before anyone comes along and looks in very well i will walk on to the wall dont be long five minutes later azim rejoined him carrying a bundle we do not want to be bothered with the clothes angus said no master but if we left them there they might be found tomorrow morning someone might recognize the man by them so i thought it would be better to carry them away with us for a few miles and then throw them in some bushes i have got his pistols and knife he was well paid master he had ten gold pieces in his sashhere they are put them in your own pocket azim i do not want to have anything to do with them they are your spoil azim who had no compunction in the matter at once put the little bag into his sash the rope was now fastened to the battlement and they slid down the wall was about forty feet high and unprovided with a moat they started at once for the place where the horses were to be waiting for them a quarter of an hours brisk walk took them there angus made a present to the man in charge of them who while they were tightening the girths at once wrapped himself in the blanket he had brought out and lay down to sleep till morning illustration azim surprises the spy we need not press the horses angus said as they rode off we shall certainly have twelve hours start and i hope twentyfour it all depends on how often the man reports to his employer who is no doubt an official at the palace probably he goes once a day though as there has been nothing suspicious about our movements and no signs of any intention of leaving he may have been ordered to go only every two or three days unless he has news to give of course in that case we are all right but if he reports every evening how long a start we shall get depends entirely upon what sort of a man the official is in any case he would hardly give a thought to his spy not coming in this evening but would suppose that i had been out till late when he does not appear in the morning if the official is of a suspicious nature he will enquire for the man and when he is not found will send down to the khan to see if he is there and to ascertain if things are going on as usual when the news is brought him that the man is not there and that we have been out all night he will become alarmed he will go himself and question the traders there and will doubtless ascertain that i have sold our horses i dont suppose he will hear that we have bought others the trader will see that there is going to be trouble about it and is likely to hold his tongue and tell his servant to be silent on the subject and as the official could have no reason for imagining that we should sell our horses and buy others he will conclude that we have made our escape over the wall on foot that is the report which he will probably make to the prince and we may safely calculate that it will be afternoon before parties of horse are sent off in pursuit by the herat ghuznee and quettah roads and will probably be instructed to enquire for two young persians on foot they will lose time by stopping at every village to make enquiries and after going forty or fifty miles will begin to feel sure that we have not come along that road but have gone by one of the others or perhaps hidden up in some village at a distance from the road they may have instructions to go as far as quettah but suppose they get thirty miles before sunsetand they certainly wont get farther than that as they will have to make enquiries and will probably halt as soon as it gets darkwe shall have a start of nearly sixty miles before morning and will hide up and go on as soon as it is dark and shall be another thirty or forty before they start next day so we shall then be some sixty miles ahead of them and within from twenty to thirty from quettah we will skirt round the town without going into it and then make down the bolan pass i dont think there is the least chance of any pursuit being kept up beyond quettah and we can travel at our own pace down the pass we shall have to lay in a good stock of provisions at the last village we pass before beginning to descend and must travel at night for otherwise we may be plundered by the tribesmen who have the worst possible reputation how long is the pass master fiftyfive miles long mr pottinger told me he says that it is a frightful place a river runs through it and in the wet season anyone caught in it would be drowned for in some places the sides are perpendicular and the channel is only sixty or seventy feet wide there are caves along there in which the tribesmen hide and rush out and plunder and often kill travellers we must get through in two nights and must be extremely careful where we stop for the day choosing some place where we can hide ourselves and our horses well master azim said after a pause if it is the will of allah that we are to get through we shall if not not that is it azim i do not think that there is much fear of our lives we know that travellers do use that pass i believe they generally pay so much to one of the chiefs of the tribesmen and we will do the same if on arriving at the top of the pass we find that we can arrange it we shall want money to take us from dadur across the plain to the indus it is a barren and desolate country and we shall have to buy some supplies at dadur coming down without merchandise the tribesmen will make sure that we have money as we should naturally have sold the goods we brought from persia at candahar and must intend buying a fresh stock in india therefore you may be sure that if captured we should be stripped of every penny we have about us they rode for eight hours and reckoned that they had made some fifty miles they gave the horses a good feed and lay down until daylight for they were now at the foot of the kojuk a gorge so steep and difficult that it could not be passed at night just as they were starting three tribesmen rode up and in the name of the local chief demanded two gold tomauns one for each horse and rider as tribute for a free passage as the money was paid without question they rode off without giving further trouble the passage was long and difficult and in many cases they had to lead their horses once through they allowed the animals another hours rest and a feed and then mounting rode on briskly again a few miles farther on they halted in a clump of trees and slept until nightfall and then rode another twenty miles as speed was of less consequence than keeping their horses in fair condition they turned off at a little stream followed it for half a mile up and then halted in a dip through which it ran here there was good grass for the horses they remained for the rest of that day and until within three hours of daybreak next morning as angus had calculated they saw at sunrise the mud fort and town of quettah standing on its rocky eminence they made a detour and came down upon the road again round the town and then rode briskly down the shawl valley the country round was rich and fertile and dotted with villages orchards and vineyards they stopped late in the afternoon at a village near the entrance to the pass two armed men came out from a hut as they drew up the leader said our chief is master of the pass travellers find it wise to pay for right of passage that we are ready to do angus said but does your chief guarantee that we shall go unmolested down to dadur the chief cannot guarantee that he can only guarantee you from hurt or damage from his people he is lord of the eastern side of the pass but there are othersmen of no account and who own no chiefamong the mountains to the west they sometimes waylay travellers our chief punishes them when he can do so but it is seldom that he is able to catch them he does all that he can for he wishes well to traders and others who pass along for when ill happens to them others are afraid to pass and he loses his tribute when a large caravan comes up and is able to pay handsomely he furnishes an escort of twenty men or more but he will not send less than twenty for a smaller party might not be able to defend the caravan and he would suffer loss of honour from failing to give protection to those to whom he guaranteed it we cannot afford to pay for an escort of twenty men and have but little to be robbed of for you see we carry no merchandise having disposed of what we bought at herat and candahar and sent the proceeds by sure hands back to persia as their attire gave no signs of their being men of substance the tribesman said in that case you will only have to pay one tomaun each that is the price for a man and horse and the same for each camel or horseload of goods that is the regular toll that we can pay as to the brigands you speak of we must take our chance he handed the money to the man who in return gave him a little whiteandred flag which he was to show should he encounter any of his tribesmen they stopped here all day and purchased food for their journey i should think it would be a very good thing azim angus said in the afternoon if we could engage a guide we might break our necks making our way down here in the dark i will speak to those two fellows i suppose they are on duty here and cannot go themselves but there may be others of the tribe in the village or if not some of the people here may be accustomed to going down the pass with caravans angus went to the hut occupied by the two tribesmen and called them out we are intending to travel at night he said after offering them a packet of tobacco in that way we may escape being seen by these brigands it will be almost impossible for you to go at nightquite impossible without a guide that is what we came to you about are there any of your tribe who would act as a guide for us how long would it take us it would take you four nights journey you could do it in two stages if your horses are surefooted and you travelled in the day but at night it would take four at least how much would you be willing to pay how much would be charged angus said quietly you should have two men the man answered two men who know the pass well yakoob and i could go with you we have been here six days and two others will come to take our places and collect tolls tomorrow so we shall be free we know every foot of the pass having travelled up and down it scores of times we cannot guarantee your safety but you would have a better chance with us than with others we will take you into dadur we do not promise to fight when twenty attack four fighting is foolish we have our horses there are parts where the pass opens out and the bottom is level well how much would you charge the two men talked together in an undertone and then the one who had before spoken turned again to angus we would take you for three gold pieces each it is a large sum angus said but as i hear in the village that it is not safe to go unless with a large caravan and that it might be three weeks or a month before a sufficiently large number of travellers arrive we will pay you that it is a bargain then the man said we had best start at four oclock the descent here is very steep and it is not overlooked from the hills to the west therefore we can go down there by daylight and then rest our horses for an hour and move forward again when it is quite dark you had better buy four black blankets to cut up and tie round the horses feet so that when we are passing the bad points where the brigands generally lurk no noise will be made in climbing over the boulders or slipping on smooth rocks it will be necessary of course to get food for us all and for the horses i will buy that tomorrow angus said i suppose it would be of no use taking torches you might take some the man said in some places the rocks are so steep that no one could look down from above and at these points there are no caves where the thieves would be hiding and we should certainly get on a good deal faster with torches i will take some then have you ever been through by night before the man shook his head we have not it is seldom attempted but it is because you are willing to travel so that we are ready to accompany you for the brigands would expect no one at that time and will most likely be asleep then if we are attacked we must be taken prisoners no the man said there are many places where the hills can be ascended by men who know them should we be attacked near one of these spots we must leave our horses and fly that is what we should do and what i should advise you to do also a mans life is worth more than a horse and saddle of course in the daytime there would be no escape in that way for they would bring us down with their matchlocks but at night we could elude them and if they did follow us we could defend ourselves taking shelter and shooting them as they came up well it is a satisfaction anyhow angus said that there would be a chance for us our horses are good beasts but we value our lives more i think they are honest fellows he went on after telling azim the substance of his conversation with the tribesmen they say that the afghans have a treacherous disposition but i believe these men can be trusted to keep their engagements they did not exaggerate the difficulties of the journey as some would have done nor did they pretend that they would join in a hopeless fight in fact although of course the actual difficulties of the journey would be very much greater in the dark than in daylight they evidently considered that the danger from the other tribesmen would be by no means great it was however a terrible journey and angus felt that without the guidance of the tribesmen it would have been an impossible one they knew exactly where the river was fordable and on which side the pass was most free from great boulders and obstruction and where torches could be safely used but at times progress was terribly slow their horses having to pick their way among rocks and boulders and taking more than an hour to cover a mile at other times they were able to go at a brisk walk and even break into a trot whenever they neared spots where the caves frequented by the robbers were situated the horses feet were muffled and they were led with the greatest care it was indeed comparatively seldom that the riders mounted where it was dangerous to have torches they walked along by the side of their horses allowing the animals to pick their own way which they were able to do better than they could have done if led the horses angus had bought having made the ascent of the pass were to some extent accustomed to the work and not having to carry the weight of the riders were able save in exceptional places to get along more easily than angus and azim were able to do both of these had many falls and would have had many more had not their guides at such times stood close beside them and rendered them assistance often warning them of obstacles of which they themselves were unable to make out the faintest outline several times they saw the glow of fires burning in the caverns at such points the strictest silence was observed they had purchased afghan shoes at the village and round these had wound strips of thick woollen stuff like felt so that their steps were as noiseless as those of the horses the stirrups were fastened over the animals backs so as to avoid contact with rocks and any slight sound that might be made was to a great extent drowned by the murmur and rattle of the rapid stream the long halts during the daytime were made at points carefully chosen by the guides at the foot of precipitous rocks fragments that had fallen from above formed a bank at a short distance from the foot the greater part of the rocks having bounded outwards with the impetus of their fall between the bank and the cliff there was a depression partly filled with splinters of rock it was however considerably lower than the bank and the men and horses stationed in it were hid alike from observation from above and from the eye of those passing along the valley here they slept on beds composed of their saddles and rugs laid on the rough stones their guides by turn keeping watch as a whole they got on faster than the guides had anticipated and were fairly down at the mouth of the pass at daybreak on the fourth morning after their start here the tribesmen received their pay angus adding another pound to the amount agreed on for the care and assistance given they waited two days at dadur to allow their horses rest here they were fortunate in finding two men well acquainted with the road they had so far guided a party who were proceeding up the pass to quettah and as they were now returning were glad enough to accept the offer of a couple of pounds to act as guides across the desert in accordance with their advice two rough ponies were bought to carry waterskins and provisions while smaller skins were to be taken on their own horses as the country to be traversed was for a considerable distance a waterless desert even this part of the journey would not be accomplished without danger for the belooches of the district were to a man plunderers and cared nothing for the authority of the khan of khelat the distance from dadur to shikarpore is nearly a hundred and fifty miles across a flat and dreary country almost unpopulated but as they were unencumbered by baggage and carried sufficient water for their wants and those of their horses it was performed in seven days at rojhan they came upon captain thompson who was in command of a party which had gone forward to examine the state of the watersupply and if necessary to sink more wells he was surprised when a young persian trader addressed him in english and informed him that he had just come through from herat this was quite enough to assure a warm welcome and the officer put him up for the night in his own tent and made him in all respects comfortable after hearing something of the siege of herat and of his journey he asked anxiously as to the watersupply in the villages on the way to dadur on hearing that few of them were much better supplied than rojhan he threw up his hands in despair two or three thousand natives ought to have been engaged he said and a couple of hundred set to work to dig deep wells in these villages a hundred wells would be little enough for the army its horses and baggage animals and its native followers even when they are dug the water runs into them slowly i have sent down my report from here there are only three wells one of which sir alexander burnes sank when he was here a week ago the others contain such bad water as to be quite unfit for human use i am really frightened at the thought of what will take place before the army gets to dadur however i hear that they will not advance for another month and that some very energetic steps will be made to secure a watersupply before they come along on the following day angus passed several working parties who were engaged under the superintendence of major leech assistant to sir alexander burnesfor captain burnes had been knighted as a reward for his services in cabul with the exception of these parties they scarcely encountered a human being on the way down except in the miserable little villages which were situated where the soil permitted the cultivation of a scanty crop which was for the most part cut when green and sold to passing travellers angus was heartily glad when shikarpore came in sight he had learned from captain thompson that shah soojah had arrived there with a native army which he had raised that the bengal army under general cotton which had marched down by the indus was expected to arrive there in a day or two and that the bombay army under sir john keane was but a few days behind upon entering the town he was glad to see british uniforms in the street and addressing in english the first officer he met he found that the division of general cotton had arrived two days before i have just come from herat angus said i left there after the siege was raised i have some despatches from lieutenant pottinger which should be given either to colonel pottinger or to sir alexander burnes burnes is here i think that colonel pottinger is at sukkar he was there a few days ago you will find burnes at the headquarters he is the political officer and so forth of the army but macnaghten is envoy and commissioner to soojah and generally at the head of all political business the army was encamped round the town and angus had no difficulty in finding the quarters of sir alexander burnes dismounting a short distance away he left azim to look after the horses and went towards the tent he was stopped by a sentry who on learning that he wished to see sir alexander called an attendant the latter coming up took anguss name in and reappearing at the entrance almost immediately signed to him to enter chapter vii in the service i am glad to see you mr campbell sir alexander burnes said as the lad entered his tent colonel pottinger was asking me only three or four days ago to keep a lookout for you he had received a letter from his nephew saying that you were going to travel down via candahar and that he was afraid that you would not manage to get through i myself received a letter from lieutenant pottinger speaking very highly of services that you had rendered and i understand that both he and mr mneill our minister in persia spoke very favourably of you in their despatches to the governorgeneral how have you got through i had very little difficulty sir except that i was detained at candahar and had to effect my escape secretly and he gave a short account of his journey and the manner in which he had escaped from candahar and avoided recapture you managed it very cleverly mr campbell i will take you in at once to macnaghten who is supreme here for shah soojah is at present little more than a puppet i have no doubt that he will be very glad to learn what is the feeling throughout the country as to shah soojah i may tell you in confidence that i am convinced that a terrible blunder has been made in taking up his cause i was as you no doubt know several months at cabul and i am convinced that dost mahomed was sincere in his desire for our friendship and that he can support himself against his brothers at candahar who have as we know been intriguing with persia and russia i have all along urged the indian government to give him warm support and to enter into a firm alliance with him however the governorgeneral and his advisers have taken the other view and i have only to do my best to carry out their orders although i have strongly represented my own opinion i do not think that government has any idea of the difficulties to be encountered so far as fighting goes there is no doubt whatever that the afghans cannot stand against us but the operation of feeding the troops and animals will be a troublesome one indeed the heat will increase every day and even the march up to quettah will present enormous difficulties as you who have just descended the pass will readily understand but the great problem will not be how to place shah soojah on the throne but how to maintain him there i tell you this because macnaghten who really knows nothing of the matter is extremely sanguine i warn you that it will be as well that you should not express any strong opinion against the enterprise it is determined upon and will be carried out and without in any way shaking his opinion you would only set him against you and might seriously injure your own prospects as it is he has much to irritate him there have already been serious troubles with the ameers of scinde who have been treated in a very highhanded manner instead of being conciliated in every possible way this alone has vastly added to the difficulty by rendering it almost impossible to obtain carriage or provisions then he differs greatly from general cotton who since his arrival here two days ago has shown himself an officer who has an immense opinion of his own dignity as general in command he declines to take any orders or indeed to listen to any advice from macnaghten this is certainly not macnaghtens fault who although as i consider mistaken in his opinions is very conciliating in his manner and would willingly avoid all friction which can but be disadvantageous to the enterprise on which he has set his heart cottons transport is really insufficient for his own army shah soojah has hardly any transport at all cotton cares not in the slightest about the shah or the shahs army and to say the truth they are of no great value macnaghten however attaches and reasonably from his point of view great importance to the fact that shah soojah should appear as arriving to claim his throne as an independent prince with his own army supported by his allies the british and not as a mere puppet forced upon the afghans by british bayonets and he is therefore most anxious that he and his force should occupy as prominent a position as possible it is as well for me to give you these hints as to the situation before you see macnaghten and to warn you against speaking to him strongly of any hostile opinions as to shah soojahs chances that you may have gathered on your journey when a man has an open mind it is well to give him both sides of the case but when he has pledged his reputation and thrown himself heart and soul into one side of the case it is worse than useless to endeavour to turn him especially when the die is cast and the day for drawing back is past if my opinion gathered from nine months residence in cabul and almost daily interviews with dost mahomed has been altogether unheeded certainly yours gathered in a passing trip through the country would have no effect whatever beyond setting him against you thank you sir i will be careful and indeed my opinion would in any case be of little value i certainly conversed a good deal with the natives on my way from herat to candahar but at that city i spoke only to persian merchants and had no intercourse whatever on my way down except with my guides in the bolan passes well we will call on him now sir alexander burnes said taking his cap mr macnaghtens tent was next to his own and he at once took angus in with him i have come mr macnaghten to introduce to you mr angus campbell who has just come down through candahar from herat his name was i know very favourably mentioned both by lieutenant pottinger and mr mneill he has brought down letters of introduction to me and colonel pottinger i know your name well sir macnaghten said mr mneill told us that you had been in his service and had gone to herat on a mission to induce shah kamran to hold out to the last and that when the siege was raised you had started from there with the intention of journeying down through afghanistan into scinde in hopes of obtaining employment in some capacity where your knowledge of persian and arabic would be of service i also understand by lieutenant pottingers last despatch that you have learned pushtoo the governorgeneral was very favourably impressed with these reports and authorized me to employ you at once as one of the junior assistants i should think sir alexander that you can employ mr campbell to greater advantage than i can as the work of making the arrangements for the advance of the army is in your hands i shall be very glad of an addition to my staff for as we get on i foresee that the three officers who now assist me will be altogether insufficient and the high terms in which mr mneill and lieutenant pottinger have written about him and the fact that he has been able to travel about the country unsuspected shows his fitness for such work you must understand mr campbell macnaghten said i cannot guarantee that the position will be a permanent one as all such appointments in the service must be confirmed by the court of directors but i shall at once acquaint lord auckland of your arrival here and of your nomination and i have no doubt that he will himself confirm it so far as this expedition continues and will strongly recommend the court of directors that your appointment to the service shall be a permanent one in view of your exceptional knowledge of persian and pushtoo i thank you very much indeed sir and will do my best to merit your good opinion as angus left the tent with sir alexander burnes he said i am indeed obliged to you sir i had hoped that i might obtain an appointment of some sort but i never hoped for one like this it is the work too of all others that i should like and you may rely on me to carry out your orders to the full extent of my power i have no doubt you will mr campbell i am glad to have one of my officers speak pushtoo for although both in scinde and afghanistan persian is the language most spoken by the upper classes it is of no use with the peasants in the work of digging wells bargaining for fodder for the horses and so forth pushtoo will be very useful for although it differs from the language of the belooches it is near enough for them to understand it and of course when we are once through the bolan it is the language of all the countrymen may i ask what dress it will be proper for me to wear as it is a civil appointment you will not wear uniform but either the ordinary civilian dress or if you like a dress of oriental character i generally dress so and it certainly has its advantages and favourably predisposes chiefs you may have to visit a british uniform they understand but a purely civilian dress is too simple for them and does not convey any sense of importance very well sir i am glad that you have decided so i have no civilian clothes with me and should find it very difficult if not impossible to get them here your appointment will be a thousand rupees a month so long as the campaign lasts after that it would of course depend upon the future employment you might have if you would like to draw a months pay in advance you can do so no thank you sir i am fairly provided with money i have four officers employed on similar duty mr campbell i will introduce you to them at once and you will of course mess with our party major leech the chief assistant was away on duty but the other three officers were at once sent for captain jones captain arbuthnot and lieutenant macgregor i wish to introduce to you mr campbell whom i have just appointed as one of my political assistants he has distinguished himself greatly under lieutenant pottinger throughout the siege of herat and was previously an assistant to mr mneill our ambassador at the court of persia he speaks persian arabic and pushtoo and has been specially recommended to the governorgeneral by mr mneill and pottinger he has now made his way from herat through candahar and the fact that he has done so safely shows that he knows how to use these languages to advantage as lieutenant pottingers gallant defence of herat was the theme of general admiration throughout india angus could not have had a better introduction and he was warmly received by the three officers who at once took him away with them you will share my tent with me lieutenant macgregor said i am alone at present you have a horse of course and a servant i suppose i have a very fair horse and an excellent servant who is a young fellow a persian the son of a doorkeeper at the embassy he was with me through the siege and i found him invaluable he is a strong fellow and has plenty of courage and shrewdness i should never have got away out of candahar had it not been for his assistance sir alexander has advised me to get an eastern dress as i cannot wear uniform and i must see about that at once for this persian dress would in any case have been out of place and my journey down the bolan has ruined it altogether but in the first place i shall be obliged if you will tell me where my two horses are to be put up your horse will be picketed with ours in our tents our servants horses are in the line behind them is that your man over there with the two horses i will send an orderly to tell him to take them over and picket them now i suppose you want something to eat we had tiffin an hour ago but the servants can get something for you thank you i will go down into the town i had something before mounting this morning and i own i should not care about going into the messtent till i have got something to wear a little more respectable than these clothes oh that is nonsense besides you need not go into the messtent i will order them to warm something up at once and to bring it into my tent we are all wanting to hear more about herat the official despatches only give us bare facts for the next two hours angus was fully occupied in relating his experiences of the siege to the three officers after that he went down with azim to the town there he bought for himself a dress such as would be worn by a native of some ranka white turban a blue tunic opening at the breast and showing a white cambric shirt several white robes and loose white linen trousers tightened in at the ankle he bought a good supply of underlinen and a couple of pairs of native ridingboots for azim he bought clothes appropriate to a retainer of a mohammedan gentleman as he was unable to procure a camp bed of european make he bought a native charpoy which could be taken to pieces and conveniently carried he had found that his fellowofficers had each three native servantsa butler or body servant a syce for their riding horses and a man who looked after and led on the line of march two baggage animals he had no difficulty in engaging a syce and let the question of the baggage animals stand over until next day azim would of course act as his personal servant the lad who had during the past year become imbued with the spirit of adventure was delighted to hear that his master was to accompany the army he had during his stay in herat picked up the language and could converse in it as fluently as angus himself was able to do and although he had no pleasant recollections of the journey from candahar he felt sure that it would be a very different affair when accompanying a british army he expressed as much to his master who said i should not make so sure of that azim we had no great difficulty in obtaining provisions for ourselves but it will be a very different thing with an army of thousands of men with an even larger number of camp followers and five or six thousand camels except just round one of those little villages we did not see a blade of grass from the time we left the shawl valley and how the animals will exist till we get up to quettah i have no idea once there no doubt we shall do fairly well but we shall have a very bad time on the journey unless i am mistaken if i had the management of affairs i should send off at once the whole of the camels with a sufficient escort as far as dadur there they should leave the provisions and forage they took up and return here to accompany the army with a further supply no doubt it would cause a months delay but it would be better to do that than to lose half our baggage animals and to risk famine for the troops i believe captain arbuthnot said when angus joined the others that ten days supply are ready at dadur and twenty days supply at quettah certainly there were no supplies at dadur when i came through but i know nothing about quettah angus said still i think that if any supplies of consequence had been collected there i should have heard about it from the men who guided us through the pass there were no troops there then no not the slightest sign of them nor did we pass any on the march down from candahar but of course the khan of khelat may have collected a great force of belooches and if he did so he would naturally keep them at khelat until he heard that the army was approaching as it would be an immense deal of trouble to victual them in the pass i know that mr macnaghten received news which induced him to believe that a large force would be likely to march down from candahar and that the attitude of the princes was altogether hostile it is on account of that news that we are going to advance in two or three days time instead of waiting for another three weeks for a larger stock of supplies to be collected it was but ten days ago that the commissarygeneral sent off four thousand camels to bring up supplies from the rear however they will be useful for the bombay column which is coming up as it is arranged that we shall collect transport and supplies for them therefore the decision has been taken to march at once so that we can ascend the pass before the enemy send a sufficient force to hold it against us no doubt the report that we were not going to leave here for another three weeks has been sent up to candahar the prince is sure to have agents and spies here we ought to be at the foot of the bolan before it is known in candahar that we have started as to khelat the khan has sent in assurances of his friendship and i expect he will make himself safe by assuming neutrality but the belooches are a warlike people and born plunderers and his authority is very slight except in khelat and the district near it we are sure to have trouble with the mountaineers but beyond having to protect the convoy strongly i do not suppose we shall have serious fighting with them i expect that we shall be sent off tomorrow or next day to khelat and quettah perhaps one of us may even go to candahar i know that mr macnaghten thinks that possibly the princes may not take an active part on dost mahomeds side everyone knows that they have no great love for their brother which is not surprising for he who is the youngest of the family has managed to secure the sovereignty besides they would see that if they took up arms in his favour the whole brunt of the fighting would fall upon them for cabul could render them no real assistance they are very shifty gentlemen and though they may make a show of force at first it would probably be only for the purpose of securing advantageous terms for themselves i saw them when i was at candahar angus said and they or at least one of them questioned me closely but supposing me to be a persian just arrived from herat he naturally said nothing about a british invasion his great anxiety was to know what the intentions and power of russia and persia were no doubt the plans that were formed were entirely disconcerted by the shahs retreat from before herat i saw no signs whatever of any gatherings of the afghans nor was the subject ever alluded to in the conversations i had with traders at the place where i lodged at this moment a native officer came in and said that sir alexander desired to see captains arbuthnot and jones as they buckled on their swords the latter said you have told us about herat mr campbell and this evening i hope you will tell us about your journey down when the officers returned angus found that arbuthnot was not mistaken as to the probable work they would have to perform for he was to accompany major todd the next morning with an escort of cavalry for khelat they were to see the khan and arrange with him for supplies to be sent to dadur captain jones was to remain there to see that his promises were carried out and arbuthnot unless he learned that a force from candahar had arrived at quettah was to go on there and see to the collection of grain and cattle a squadron of cavalry is going forward tomorrow morning campbell four hundred labourers are going with it and you are to be in special charge of half of them of course they will have eight or ten headmen but they will want looking after all the same they are to dig wells at burshoree the other half under you macgregor are to do the same thing at meerpoor it is a thousand pities it was not done before for the army is to begin its advance the day after tomorrow however you will gain a couple of days on them and that is something if you meet major leech who is at work improving the roads you will of course report yourself to him and he will doubtless be able to advise you as to the best place for the wells angus heard the news with much satisfaction in the first place it meant active work and in the second it would save him from the slow and toilsome march of the army which would he felt sure be accompanied with enormous hardship the four officers dined together sir a burnes was not present as he was dining with general cotton and mr macnaghten after dinner angus related his adventure at candahar how he evaded pursuit and his passage through the pass he had hardly finished when he was sent for to the generals tent i have just been telling general cotton mr campbell said mr macnaghten that you arrived this morning from candahar he wishes to learn as much as you can tell him of the state of the pass at present and of the country between dadur and this place i told him that i had not been able to find time to question you on these points in the first place the general said what is the state of the bolan as i only travelled during the night i cannot tell you very much about it the river is not high and there is no difficulty whatever on that score the ground is generally extremely rough and covered not only with rounded boulders but by rocks that will prove very trying to the feet of the animals we bandaged very thickly the hoofs of our horses to deaden the sound and so saved them from being lamed which they otherwise would certainly have been the bandages were of felt and these were completely cut to pieces the first night after that we cut up one of the waterskins i had with me and we covered the felt with the leather but even this was cut to pieces and had to be renewed the next night although this is the general character of the pass there are places at which by skirting the foot of the hills at points where the pass opens outand the hills are not precipitous although everywhere steepit is possible for mounted men to go along at a fast walk the stones being much smaller and like i should think what i have heard of a seabeach though i never saw one at least that i can remember still there were no insurmountable difficulties mr campbell no sir though there were places where certainly not more than two laden camels could pass abreast well next as to the country between this place and dadur we know about it as far as the edge of beloochee desert what is it beyond that did you suffer from want of water no sir at the villages where we stopped there was always water but there were as far as i saw but a few small wells which would seem to me very insufficient for the supply of an army and its train well we are going to dig more wells mr macnaghten said rather impatiently if the water will run into three or four wells it would run into fifty now about forage there were small patches of cultivation round each of the villages at bhag more than elsewhere as it lies nearer to the foot of the hills but at meerpoor burshoree and rojhan i should not say there were more than twenty or thirty acres of cultivated land at bhag i was strongly advised to take the road at the foot of the hills to dundeaver down to larkhanna and from there to follow the indus up to sukkar but the guides said that i should be more likely to be troubled by the beloochees along that route and as it was also twice as far i took the straight way here thank you we will not detain you any longer mr campbell and we are obliged for the information that you have given us angus bowed and retired he felt that mr macnaghten was vexed that he could not report better upon the chances of obtaining sufficient supplies of forage and water but he felt that it was clearly better that he should give in the plainest terms the true state of affairs for when as he was sure would be the case there was immense suffering of men and animals the blame would fall upon him if he had given a more hopeful account than the facts warranted sir a burnes sent for him on leaving the generals tent you did quite right in not giving a rosecoloured description of the state of things along the line of march mr campbell of course neither mr macnaghten nor general cotton liked it neither of them in fact has the slightest idea of the troubles ahead of them and both were inclined to view me as a pessimist however it will not matter to you very greatly whether macnaghten is pleased with you or not because your reports will be sent in to me this sort of work will not last very long i have only undertaken it because major garden general cottons quartermastergeneral has been taken ill major craikie the adjutantgeneral will go forward with me the day after tomorrow to superintend matters generally i hope by that time to have a thousand more men for welldigging major leech has gone to sebee to cut a dam there on the river naree which it is hoped will fill the small watercourses and greatly assist us i have more fear about forage than water you can dig wells and cut dams but you cant get a crop to grow at a days notice however we must hope for the best the next morning at three oclock angus and lieutenant macgregor started with the labourers and an escort of fifty native cavalry i am very glad to be off campbell macgregor said it has been disheartening work for some time somehow or other nothing has gone smoothly since we started of course i am only a sub but certainly it seems to me that so far there has been an enormous amount of unnecessary friction and that the chiefs have not gone the right way to work i dont believe myself in this shah whom we are going to force upon the afghans dost mahomed is worth a dozen of him and no one who knows anything of the affairs of afghanistan is able to understand why lord auckland and macnaghten and the rest of them should ever have conceived the idea of supplanting a man who has shown himself really desirous of our alliance and friendship and who undoubtedly possesses the support of a majority of his countrymen by one who has never shown any talent who has no party whatever in afghanistan and is a member of a discredited and fallen family still that is their affair but matters have been complicated by the manner in which the emirs of scinde have been treated instead of regarding them as they have always shown themselves as friendly to us we have gone out of our way to render them hostile by the manner in which we have in absolute contradiction of the terms of their treaty with us compelled them to furnish carriage provisions and money had they been a conquered country we could not have carried matters with a higher hand it will be sure to lead to trouble some day and certainly adds immensely to our difficulties now the very fact that in the days when he was for a short time ruler in afghanistan soojah advanced all sorts of preposterous claims of suzerainty over a large portion of scinde was in itself a reason why if we took the absurd step of placing him on the throne of cabul we should have advanced from peshawur through jellalabad direct instead of taking this roundabout journey through scinde of course there would have been great difficulties in the khyber and we should have had to encounter fierce opposition from the hilltribesmen but that will have to be met in any case and after installing soojah at cabul we could have gradually extended his poweror ours for of course he would be but a puppet in our handsthrough ghuznee to candahar of course you wont hear any talk like this among the officers of the bombay or bengal army they know and care nothing about the matter it is just among the men who have been employed here in the north and who know something about it that there is any doubt as to the wisdom of the affair i know burnes considers that the whole thing is a mistake colonel pottinger who as our resident in scinde knows a great deal about the afghans says little but i know that he disapproves of it and so i think do all of us juniors who have worked either under him or with burnes or up in the punjaub and have of course always taken an interest in the affairs of afghanistan especially since russian influence has become so preponderant in persia well we can only hope for the best and do our best in our own little way thank goodness whatever comes of it we have no responsibility in the affair i really know very little about it angus said but i do know that it will be a terrible business getting the army to quettah and that directly it was determined to come this way arrangements should have been made to dig sufficient wells to ensure a supply of water at every wateringplace and to collect stores of forage and grain i really dont see how it is to be done now from all that i could hear as i came down there will be a lot of trouble with the beloochees the difficulties of the advance had already been felt great numbers of camels had died between sukkar and shikarpore and those that accompanied the party of welldiggers were enfeebled and looked as if they had accomplished a long forced march instead of the strong and fresh animals one would expect to see setting out on such an enterprise the first haltingplace was jagan the next day they started at the same early hour and proceeded to janeedera here they had passed beyond the boundary of the scinde ameers and had entered the territory over which the khan of khelat held nominal authority at this place there was a small mud fort outside of which straw had been collected for the use of the cavalry and to guard this a small party of shah soojahs troops had been posted these however had been attacked and driven off by a beloochee band and the straw carried away however there was sufficient water in the wells for the men and animals the next days march was a long one but at rojhan a certain amount of forage had been collected and there was a fair supply of water the country so far had been barren with occasional bushes but beyond rojhan they had nothing but an absolutely flat surface of sand without a blade of grass or a bush to break the level expanse across this desert the party toiled on for twentyseven miles a little water was carried by the camels but this supply was soon exhausted and with parched lips and throats the men plodded on knowing that until the end of the journey no water could be obtained scarce a word was spoken during the painful journey passing over the ground as he came down at a canter angus had thought but little of it he had done it in less than four hours and there was no trouble from the dust it was very different now it was fourteen hours from the time of starting before they reached burshoree the mounted men having to accommodate their pace to that of the labourers and the dust rose in dense clouds a part of the cavalry rode ahead the rest some half a mile behind the main body of the footmen but before half the journey was done these began to straggle and the dust had no time to settle before the horsemen came along fully half the labourers indeed threw themselves down on the sand incapable of going farther and lay there until the cool evening air revived them and it was long after midnight before many of them reached burshoree here a considerable number of wells had already been dug by the party under major leech the water was muddy and trickled in but slowly still it was water and men and horses drank it eagerly as fast as it could be brought up in buckets and emptied into troughs which had been erected although the villagea mere collection of native huts surrounded by a wall as a protection against the plundering beloocheesoffered a most uninviting prospect angus was well pleased that he had arrived at the end of his journey and had not like macgregor another days march to perform the latter started as usual at three oclock and an hour later angus with some difficulty roused his two hundred weary men and set them to work promising them that if they laboured hard he would allow them to rest during the heat of the day cheered by the promise the labourers set to work under their headmen each of these had charge of twenty workmen these were divided into two gangs and worked wells close together angus had nothing to do save to exercise a sort of general superintendence the soil became much more firm a few feet below the surface and as the sides stood satisfactorily it was not necessary to make the wells of any great depth it was found that four men only could be employed on each two working in the bottom and the others bringing up the earth with buckets and ropes consequently the number of the wells was largely increased after three days of prodigious toil water was reached in the majority of the wells and by the end of the fourth day fifty had been added to those already dug the liquid however oozed in but slowly and when a well was emptied it was two or three hours before water could again be drawn from it thus although the amount that could be obtained altogether was considerable it was still wholly insufficient for the supply of an army fiveandtwenty of the native cavalry were kept constantly on the alert for parties of plundering beloochees hovered round and several of the welldiggers who in spite of orders ventured to wander some distance away were robbed and killed the next morning general thackwell with a body of cavalry a small force of infantry and some irregular horse rode into the place he brought with him an order from sir a burnes for angus to accompany him the welldiggers were to remain there and continue their work the general had intended to stop there for two or three days but finding that no forage could be procured he started the next morning early and rode through meerpoor to oostar a distance of twentyseven miles where as had been reported by major leech there was a small reservoir of water and a store of straw and grass had been collected angus stopped for an hour at meerpoor and had a talk with macgregor whose men had also accomplished a great deal of work and who bewailed his fate at having to remain there instead of going forward with general thackwell chapter viii the advance the cutting of the dam of the naree did not afford so much aid as had been hoped for for the thirsty soil absorbed the water almost as fast as it poured out and it was not until many days later that it began to fill the little irrigation canals at the villages through which the army passed after resting two days at oostar the force proceeded to bhag a town of some size here water was found in abundance and grain in considerable quantities and also a supply of carrots which were eagerly purchased by the officers for the use of their horses at the various places where they halted angus acted as interpreter and rode out with a small body of cavalry to villages at which they learned a certain amount of forage could be obtained at bhag to his great satisfaction sir alexander burnes joined the party he had paid a visit to the khan of khelat and obtained from him stringent orders to the headmen of villages and others to do all in their power to aid the army the inhabitants were all to be set to work to dig the holes for which they would receive payments from the british the khan also promised to despatch to dadur what supplies he could gather but explained that unfortunately there was a much greater difficulty than usual in collecting provisions as the previous season had been a very bad one and in many parts of the country the villagers had not been able to gather sufficient for their own needs as angus had heard the same at candahar at the village near quettah and from his guide there could be no doubt that this excuse was a genuine one and indeed the officers who had been engaged in scinde and in the country bordering the indus affirmed that the supplies obtainable there were also vastly smaller than had been anticipated throughout the next week angus was continually employed in riding among the towns in the khanate interviewing headmen and expediting the despatch of convoys he was always accompanied by a troop of cavalry for plundering parties of beloochees were making their way on all sides towards the line followed by the army where they murdered stragglers captured lagging camels and were so bold that they ventured close to the outskirts of the villages occupied by the british camps robbed the natives of the moneys paid them for forage or grain and rendered it necessary that every convoy should be protected by a considerable escort after a week of this work angus received orders to join the force that was gathering at dadur during the last two days march the difficulties with regard to water had disappeared the villages had all been situated on the bolan river and little irrigation canals enabled the cultivation of a considerable tract of country to be carried on which supplied forage in sufficient quantity for the first division of the army which came along dadur a town of some four thousand inhabitants stands on the eastern branch of the bolan river whose banks were fringed with high reeds and groves of dwarf trees the country round was well cultivated and the fields were covered with young crops of wheat and barley close to the town were gardens and the whole presented an agreeable appearance to the troops who had for nearly three weeks been painfully making their way across country which even at its best points was little more than a sandy desert here angus again met sir alexander burnes who had been making the greatest efforts to accumulate supplies at the town his success however had been very small nor had major leech who was also at dadur been more fortunate it had been reckoned that twenty days supplies for the whole army would have been accumulated there but not more than sufficient for two or three days had been gathered and general cotton on arriving there with the bengal army decided that it was necessary for at least a portion of the army to advance without delay sir alexander burnes started at once with major cureton of the th lancers with a troop of that regiment three companies of the native infantry and a strong party of sappers and miners to survey the pass up to quettah major leech was sent to khelat to maintain a strong pressure upon the khan and it was still hoped that stores might be collected by the time the bombay army came along the report sent down was satisfactory inasmuch as the physical difficulties of the journey were concerned in spite of the fact that heavy rains had fallen the river had not risen sufficiently to interfere seriously with the passage of troops and animals and on the th of march the horse artillery nd light cavalry the th regiment of the line and the th native infantry started early in the morning forded by torchlight the bolan river and at eight oclock pitched their camp in the valley where they were to rest for the day the road had so far offered no difficulties except that the river had to be forded no fewer than eight times the baggage animals which started at midnight had already arrived but the tents were pitched with some difficulty owing to the rocky nature of the ground which necessitated the use of iron tentpegs instead of the wooden ones previously used fortunately owing to the pause that had been made by the advance parties at dadur and the abundance of succulent food they had obtained there the animals had recovered to a large extent from their previous fatigues and hardships and the journey through the pass was accomplished with less loss and suffering than had occurred during the march from sukkar vast numbers of animals however died and the troops who had started full of life and strength were sadly changed many of them being utterly worn out and a mere shadow of their former selves the rumour that had precipitated the march by three weeks upset all the transport arrangements and caused so vast an amount of suffering proved to be falseno forward movement had been made by the candahar princes and except for some little trouble with the marauding villagers the march was entirely unopposed once in the shawl valley the fatigues of the army were over for the time but in spite of the efforts of sir a burnes and his assistants only a very small amount of food and forage had been collected in readiness for them so small indeed was the supply that it was necessary to place both the troops and native followers on reduced rations of flour rice and ghee meat however was plentiful the proceedings of the khan of khelat were not of a character to inspire confidence in him while protesting strongly his friendship for us he told our officers frankly that he was certain shah soojah would not retain his position for a day after the british troops marched away that the whole feeling of the country was against him and that although had he advanced with only a native army raised by himself he might have been accepted the people would never submit to a sovereign thrust upon them by british bayonets opinions differed much as to his sincerity those who doubted it pointed to the fact that although he was said to have large stores of provisions at khelat he had scarcely sold any to our troops and had failed in all his promises in that direction on the other hand sir a burnes maintained that the stores of provisions spoken of did not exist and that in any case having no belief in the possibility of shah soojah maintaining himself it was but natural that he should hang back until he saw how matters went for if he were to give any active aid to the british he would be considered a traitor by his countrymen and would imperil his khanate and his life when our protection was withdrawn from him the question was never satisfactorily cleared up some of those who took part in the proceedings and wrote on the subject regarded him as a very illused man while others considered the measures afterwards taken against him as being fully justified by his conduct as it was absolutely necessary that food should be obtained parties were sent into the villages and a rigorous search instituted and in this way a considerable quantity of hidden grain was discovered this was taken and paid for at the market price in quettah itself one very large store was found and taken up for the use of the army the climate was pleasant and in spite of reduced rations the men benefited by the halt which was not without its excitement for large bands of plunderers hovered round attacks were frequently made upon parties going out with camels to graze and expeditions to punish the villages to which the marauders belonged were undertaken at length general sir john keane who was in command of the whole expedition arrived at quettah to the satisfaction of the army for it was thought that some decision must now be arrived at it was evident to all that unless something were done famine would ere long stare them in the face the european troops could indeed exist upon meat but the native troops and camp followers the greater portion of whom were not meateaters were already in sore distress the supply of grain and rice barely sufficing to keep life together the hope was justified as soon as the general arrived the heads of the departments were assembled and arrangements were made for an advance the greater portion of the bombay army arrived soon after their commander and although the men were still weakened by privation the army was in most respects perfectly capable of carrying out the work successfully there was however one serious drawback which threatened to destroy their efficiency the horses of the cavalry and artillery and the animals of the transport were so weakened by want of grain and hay that they were altogether unfit for hard work it was upon the th of april that the army moved forward seven weeks having elapsed since they started from shikarpore the march to candahar was long and painful several passes had to be traversed food became more and more scarce and hundreds of animals died daily beloochee plunderers during the first portion of the journey and afghan raiders during the second hung along the line of march murdering all who straggled capturing camels at times even threatening an attack in force they were able to do this as our cavalry horses were so broken down that they could scarcely proceed beyond a walk the candahar princes with a large following came out to give battle but hajee khan kakur one of the leading chiefs had been bribed by our political officers and deserting came into our camp with a large body of followers and this so disheartened the princes and excited so much fear among them of further treachery that they withdrew at once to candahar and a few hours after their arrival there took the northern road after immense suffering from want of water and food the army entered the city on the th of april shah soojah having gone on with hajee kakur and made a formal entry into the town two days previously angus had had little to do during the march from quettah the chances of obtaining forage or food at the deserted villages near the line of march were so small that sir john keane decided that it would be useless to endeavour to obtain anything there especially as an officer leaving the main body had to be accompanied by a strong escort to protect him from the bands of marauders and it was deemed inadvisable to give the horses any work that could be avoided anguss own animal being accustomed to the country suffered less than those from the plains and in order to spare it as much as possible and keep it in such a condition that it would be fit for work were he ordered to make any expedition he generally walked by its side the greater part of the day preferring this indeed to sitting on horseback and moving at the snails pace necessitated by the difficulties of the road and the slow progress of the weakened animals of the baggage train among these the mortality had been terrible and one writer estimated that no fewer than thirty thousand transport animals died on the road between sukkar and candahar shah soojah had at first established himself in his camp outside the city but two days after the arrival of the army he took up his abode at the palace he was accompanied by his own officials and by macnaghten and burnes and their assistants what are you smiling at campbell lieutenant macgregor who had been his companion and tentfellow since they left dadur asked as they rode together into the city i am thinking of the difference between my position in this procession and the fact that i am going to take up my quarters in the palace and the position i occupied when i was last herea pretended trader suspected and watched and obliged to escape by night yes it is a change certainly macgregor said and one for the better though after what we have gone through and all we may have to go through before we leave this wretched country i dont think it would be safe to assert that it is less dangerous now than it was then from the time we left shikarpore till we arrived here three days ago we have never had a decent meal we have practically never had enough to eat we have suffered horribly from thirst we have never dared to ride a hundred yards beyond the column or camp we have lived in fact dogs livesnot the life of a respectable dog in england but of a starving cur in an indian bazaar we dont know much about the future i dont suppose we shall suffer from hunger and thirst as we have done but our dangers of other kinds will certainly not be abated everything looks smooth enough here i dont think there is any enthusiasm at all for soojah but there is no doubt that the princes were hated and the people heartily glad to be rid of them i fancy that we shall not have much difficulty in reaching cabul they say ghuznee is a strong place but we have taken scores of places in india that the natives considered impregnable still considering the way in which these marauding afghans hover round us i think we shall have a very uncomfortable time of it as the soldiers were not at first allowed to enter the city the merchants there speedily established a temporary bazaar outside the walls here vendors of rosewater of sherbet and of a drink concocted of the juice of fruits took up their stalls people from the country round brought in loads of lucerne wheat barley wood and chopped straw other merchants displayed posteens pelisses made of sheepskins with the wool inside and embroidered outside with blue red and yellow thread fowls sheep onions milk tobacco and spices were also on sale and before long the horsedealers of herat brought down large numbers of good animals which were eagerly bought up by officers who had lost their chargers as soon as the soldiers were allowed to enter the town they poured into it wheaten cakes cooked meat and mulberries tempted their appetite and a little later plums and apricots were brought in in great profusion the scenes in the streets were very amusing the british soldiers and sepoys with their large variety of uniforms mingled with the people of the town and country round some of these wore long cloaks of chintz or woollen cloth with large turbans their hair beards and moustaches being allowed to grow very long and the beards being dyed red others were closely shaven and dressed in jackets and trousers of blue linen and tunics of brown cloth with long hanging sleeves their heads being protected by skullcaps of various colours with may the heat which already had been great became even more oppressive water was abundant but the troops and camp followers were still on short rations of food the price of grain was enormously high and there was no chance of the magazines being replenished until the fields were ripe for harvest it was not until nearly three weeks after possession was taken of the capital that a force was despatched under brigadier sale in pursuit of the princesa grievous mistake for shah soojah had entered candahar on the day they left and as they were greatly encumbered by their baggage train the ladies of the harems and a host of camp followers they might easily have been overtaken whereas after their escape they became the centre of intrigues against the ameer in june the harvest ripened large quantities of grain were bought up by the commissariat and preparations began for the advance to cabul candahar was quiet and apathetic so far no signs were visible of any enthusiasm for their new ruler among the people not only did none of the neighbouring chiefs come in to pay their allegiance but the shahs orders were everywhere disregarded marauding bands harassed and sometimes attacked convoys coming up and even close to the city it was dangerous for the soldiers to move many hundred yards beyond the limits of their camps the health of the troops was far from good the plains of candahar fertile as they are are unhealthy as water can be found everywhere six or seven feet below the surface the native troops suffered comparatively little but the european soldiers were attacked by dysentery jaundice and fever and large numbers were carried off by these diseases at the end of june the necessary amount of grain was accumulated by the arrival of a large caravan from mooltan the army was now to cut itself entirely free from its former lines of supplies and would have to depend solely upon the country for food as the everincreasing boldness of the beloochees in the bolan pass and of the afghan marauders between quettah and candahar had made it impossible for convoys unless very strongly guarded to make their way up the advance began at two oclock on the morning of the th and four hours later after passing through a fertile district the troops encamped at the village of killa azim here they obtained barley for their animals and peasants from other villages brought in an abundance of chopped straw for the camels at midnight the trumpet sounded and an hour later the army moved forward again as far as kheil four days further march brought them to kelatighilzye the chief town of the ghilzye tribes two or three hundred of their horsemen galloped away as the troops approached marching ten miles a day the army followed the valley of the turnak which afforded an ample supply of water for all their needs the country was mountainous and desolate the dreariness being only broken by small villages with their orchards and patches of cultivated ground grain was brought in in abundance the force was now far above the plain the heat ceased to be oppressive even in the middle of the day and the mornings and evenings were delightfully cool nevertheless the number of sick increased owing to the bad quality of the flour and the absence of vegetables the country now became more thickly populated little villages with the fortified dwellings of their chiefs being thickly scattered about the hostile tribesmen followed the march on both flanks and many skirmishes took place on one occasion the ghilzye marauders made an attack on the line of march but were driven off with heavy loss on the th a nephew of the ameer rode in with fifteen followers he had gone to ghuznee with his brother to aid in its defence but suspicions being entertained by mohummed hyder the governor of their fidelity his brother was seized and put to death and he himself only escaped a similar fate by flight as they approached ghuznee sir alexander burnes said to angus mr campbell i shall be glad if you will resume your afghan costume and ride tomorrow at daybreak with a party of six of hajee khan kakurs men and ascertain whether the enemy are in strength outside the fortress and intend to oppose our approach if they do we shall leave the baggage here under a strong guard and proceed to attack them if they retire into the fortress we shall advance as we have been doing for possibly the siege may last some time and it would be as well to take our ammunition and stores with us will you undertake that mission i do not wish you of course to approach the enemy very closely they will naturally take you for a party coming to join them and will pay no attention to you half a mile will be near enough for you to go to the fortress the disguise is only necessary because they too may have parties out and should any come suddenly upon you you would pass without suspicion or question and indeed should you be stopped your knowledge of the language is quite good enough to pass in any case i have requested hajee khan to choose wellmounted men we shall remain here tomorrow and the general will send out a troop of cavalry to meet you on your return halfway between this and ghuznee so that should you be pursued you will know that you will meet with succour before going many miles the fortress itself is some twelve miles from this camp i will undertake it willingly sir alexander accordingly on the following morning angus set out azim asked leave to accompany him but he refused your horse is not a very fast one he said it is a good beast but we may have to ride for our lives and you would soon be left behind it is not a dangerous expedition but in a country like this there is always the possibility of a surprise after riding for two miles the fortress of ghuznee was seen it was situated on a high rock and surrounded by a wall of great height and strength and was regarded by the afghans as absolutely impregnable as they approached and could make out the strength of the fortifications it seemed to angus that except by famine it would be next to impossible to capture it the general had left the few heavy cannon he had brought with him at candahar because of the extreme difficulty of getting transport and the light fieldpieces could make but small impression indeed on these massive walls when he approached within a mile he halted there were no signs of any afghan force in front of it it was of course possible that they might sally out when they saw the army approaching but at present there was nothing to show that they meant to do so he was about to turn when he was suddenly seized from behind and in a moment his hands were bound tightly to his side by the sashes of two of his escort the afghans burst into a shout of triumph infidel dog one said did you think because hajee khan kakur is a traitor that all his men are also you came to see ghuznee you shall see the inside as well as the outside angus was brave but a shudder ran through him as he thought of the fate that awaited him the afghans never spared those who fell into their hands and fortunate were those who were speedily killed for in many cases they were tortured before they were done to death it had never occurred to him to doubt for a moment the good faith of the men who accompanied him and yet now he thought over it such a possibility should have been foreseen since there was no reason why the men should be traitors to their race although for the moment they had obeyed their commanders orders and ridden with him into the british camp they might even have remained faithful to him had not this opportunity of rejoining their countrymen presented itself even in the midst of his own deadly peril he was glad to think that by his refusal to allow azim to accompany him he had saved him from the fate that awaited himself he knew well that no entreaties would avail to soften the heart of the afghan commander and determined that whatever came he would maintain a firm countenance and meet his fate bravely the gate of the fortress stood open the men as they entered said a few words to the guards stationed there we were forced they said to accompany the traitor hajee khan kakur to the camp of the infidel but we have taken the first opportunity to desert and have brought with us this man who is one of their officers as a prisoner why trouble to bring him as a prisoner we thought that mohummed hyder would like to question him and are bringing him here to show that we are true men climbing a steep road they entered a great courtyard here they dismounted and their leader a subofficer went forward to the governors house followed by two others between whom angus walked the leader entered the others remained outside until he returned follow me with the captive he said mohummed hyder will speak to him a minute later angus stood before the governor he was seated on a divan and several other chiefs of importance were standing or sitting round they tell me the governor said that you can speak our tongue i can do so angus said quietly where did you learn it in herat where i fought during the siege against the persians and now you come hither as a spy not as a spy i came here only to view the fortress from a distance is it true that the kafirs are bringing no big guns with them as the governor was doubtless well informed as to the strength of the british army and the number of its guns angus felt that there could be no harm in answering the question they are not he said how do they intend to take ghuznee will they fly over the walls or burrow through the rock the governor said scoffingly are they madmen who think they can tear down the walls of ghuznee with their fingernails i know nothing of the plans of the general angus replied but the british have taken many strong places in india when it seemed that it could not be done they will not take ghuznee when the first shot is fired at its walls we will throw over to them your head and your limbs to show that we despise them and mock their foolish effort take him away yakoob do you see him safely bestowed angus was led to a cell in one of the turrets on the wall his weapons had been taken from him when he was first captured and when he reached the prison his arms were unbound by the leader of the band who carried off the sashes to the men to whom they belonged a massive door was closed behind them and angus heard two heavy bolts shota proof that the tower was often used as a prison listening he heard another door at the foot of the turret closed and bolted the window was a mere loophole but it commanded a view of the road by which he had been brought up the cell was circular in shape and some ten feet in diameter it was absolutely bare angus stood for some little time looking through the loophole it was three feet wide on the inner side but narrowed to six inches at the outlet the wall was more than two feet thick and of solid stone it is evident that there is no possibility of escape he said aloud as he turned away from the loophole even if i could widen the hole so to be able to creep through there is a fall of a hundred feet or so and there is nothing of which a rope could be made i have my knife he said fortunately they did not think of looking in my pockets but though it has a good long blade and i might at the end sell my life as dearly as possible and force them to kill me it can be of no earthly use here for there is nothing to cut except that rough plank in the corner which was i suppose brought up for some purpose or other and forgotten the day passed slowly no one came near him until just as the sun was setting two soldiers came in bringing a jug of water and some bread angus had little sleep that night he dozed off occasionally but the hardness of the stone floor and the cold speedily roused him and he was glad indeed when daylight returned and the sun shone out an hour later when looking from his prison window he perceived a party of horsemen long before he could distinguish their figures he made sure that they were british troops from the fact that two or three rode ahead and the rest evidently an escort in a close body behind them they approached within musketshot as soon as they did so a fire of matchlocks broke out from the walls they drew off a little and then turned and rode off there was no doubt that they were a reconnoitring party who had ridden forward to ascertain the best spot for an attack two hours later three regiments of infantry came up followed by a battery the object of their approach was to discover whether ghuznee was held in force for reports had reached the camp that the greater portion of the garrison had retired it answered its purpose for the guns of the fortress opened fire and for an hour there was an exchange of shot between them and the battery the object of the reconnaissance being fulfilled the british returned to their camp not until five oclock was any further movement perceptible then angus saw a long dark line ascending the pass on reaching its head the column made a wide detour so as to keep beyond the range of the guns of the fortress and then entered a rocky and difficult country to the east as he knew that the gates had all been walled up with masonry with the exception of that through which the road from cabul entered it he had no doubt that it was intended to encamp on that side thus cutting off the fortress from relief by the army assembled under another of the ameers sons and at the same time preventing the flight of the garrison as long as it was light the column was still passing ona long line of baggage waggons and native followers guarded by bodies of troops against any sortie that might be made during the night occasional shots were fired from the fortress and at various points of the plain and on the surrounding hills fires raised gave indications of gatherings of tribesmen it had indeed been a painful and difficult march several streams and watercourses swollen by rain had to be crossed but with enormous exertions the whole force was established and on the following morning tents were erected along the position chosen sir john keane accompanied by general cotton ascended the heights took a survey of the fortress and decided upon the plan of attack at two oclock in the afternoon a body of afghan horse suddenly attacked the camp in the rear but were beaten off by our own cavalry angus heard the outburst of firing and concluded that the governor would ere long carry out his threat he had no idea what the commanderinchiefs plan was but he felt certain that the attack when made would be sudden and sharp and would be in the nature of a surprise for in no other way did it seem possible that a force however strong could without artillery capture the place in that case there was just a possibility that in the excitement of the moment his existence would be forgotten at any rate he said to himself i will do what i can to defer the moment of my execution i dont suppose it will be of the smallest use but as i have nothing else to do i will cut some wedges and as soon as the attack begins in earnest i will jam them in round the door for the rest of the day he occupied himself in cutting strips of wood off the plank and fashioning wedges of which he made about four dozen the work sufficing to keep his thoughts from dwelling upon his probable fate he concealed all these in his clothes then he cut off a stout piece of plank and fashioned it into the form of a short thick bat with which to drive the wedges into their place then he laid the plank in its place again with the freshlycut side against the wall swept up the chips and threw them out of the loophole he thought it probable that sir john keane would attack without any delay as it was allimportant to capture the citadel before the relieving army from cabul and the forces of three or four great chiefs which were also in the neighbourhood could join hands and attack him in the rear while the powerful garrison sallied out and fell upon him in front chapter ix just in time the plan of the british general for the capture of ghuznee was a bold one he knew that his little guns could make no impression upon the walls and that it would take weeks before it would be possible to effect a breach his idea was to blow in the gate and to pour his troops in through the opening his plans were admirably laid at midnight six companies of infantry established themselves in the gardens to the right and left of the spot where the assaulting column were to take up their position ready to advance as soon as the gate was blown in two hours later three companies of a native regiment made a detour and took up a position to the north of the fortress the field artillery took up their post on a height at three oclock in the morning the infantry on the north opened a musketry fire at the same moment the artillery on the hills began a brisk cannonade while a camel battery directed its fire against the walls the guns of the fortress at once replied and the walls were fringed with the musketry fire it was still an hour to daylight when captain thompson of the royal engineers with a party of his men crept forward to the gate carrying with them nine hundred pounds of gunpowder in twelve sacks the movement was altogether unobserved by the garrison who had been taken completely by surprise by the sudden fire the night had been exceptionally favourable for the attempt the wind blew so strongly that the tramp of the columns and the sound of the wheels of the guns failed to reach the ears of the sentries on the walls when the fire broke out the afghans at once burned numbers of blue lights to endeavour to obtain a clear view of the attacking force but the light failed to pierce the darkness and the fireworks burned but fitfully owing to the force of the gale they therefore distributed themselves along the whole circuit of walls instead of concentrating upon the point where the attack was about to take place the engineers had done their work admirably they crept silently along the causeway which afforded a passage across the moat and then up the steep ascent which led to the gate unnoticed by those who manned the loopholes two minutes sufficed to place the sacks in position the fuse was then fired and the party ran back to such cover as they could find at this moment the afghans lit a large and brilliant blue light immediately over the gate but before they could obtain any idea of what was passing below the explosion took place the gate was blown to pieces and masses of masonry and fractured beams fell into the passage beyond then a bugle was sounded by the engineers and the storming party rushed down and crept into the dark blockedup passage here they were fiercely opposed the afghans had rallied almost instantly from their first surprise and rushed down to defend the passage a desperate struggle took place in the dark but british valour was triumphant and the four companies of the nd and th regiments fought their way into the interior of the fortress had they been at once supported by the column behind them commanded by brigadiergeneral sale the capture of ghuznee would have been comparatively bloodless but as he was advancing he met one of the engineer officers who had been terribly bruised and injured by the explosion upon being questioned the latter said that the gate had been blown in but that the passage was blocked with the ruins as in that case it would have been madness to advance the general ordered the retreat to be sounded the call was heard by the leading companies but not obeyed instead of the troops retreating they halted irresolutely rather than carry out an order the most unwelcome that can be given to british soldiers fortunately another engineer officer soon came along and assured the brigadier that although the passage was greatly blocked the storming party had made their way through whereupon the column at once rushed forward the delay however had given the garrison time to rally and large numbers had run down from the wall to take part in the fight many however despairing of successful resistance now that their assailants had won their way into the town allowed the storming party to pass and then attempted to escape through the gateway but as they did so general sale with the head of his column arrived and another desperate fight took place among the ruins of the gate the general himself was cut down and his assailant endeavoured to complete his work sale succeeded in grasping his sword hand but weakened by his wound must have been overpowered had not an officer run up and severely wounded the afghan the struggle continued but the general managed to gain his feet and cut down his assailant the column was a long time in passing over the heap of ruins now further encumbered by wounded and dead as soon as they had entered the reserve who had been suffering from the fire of the afghans still on the walls followed them and while general sales division ascended the steep path that led to the citadel which rose far above the rest of the fortress the reserve began the work of clearing out the afghans from the houses large numbers of afghans had taken refuge here as the troops entered and these rushing out flung themselves upon the troops with the fury of despair many of these who had first entered exhausted by their exertions were with the wounded sitting in the courtyard at the foot of the citadel upon these the fanatics rushed cutting and slashing with their keen tulwars alike at the soldiers who started to their feet the wounded on the ground and their own horses who mad with terror were galloping wildly over the courtyard a series of desperate handtohand conflicts were waged until the last of the afghans were shot or bayoneted the walls were cleared with little difficulty but many soldiers were shot as they passed through the narrow streets of the native town all resistance ceased at a quarter past five thus in two hours and a quarter after the first shot was fired a fortress deemed impregnable and garrisoned by three thousand five hundred men was captured ghuznee had been provisioned for six months and so certain was mohummed hyder of the ability of the place to hold out that he had brought with him all the ladies of his zenana in spite of the desperate nature of the fighting not one of the afghans who surrendered was injured nor was the slightest insult offered to the ladies of the zenana or the women in the native town the troops who had ascended to the citadel found the gates open the afghan prince having lost all hope as soon as he found the lower fortress in possession of the british he was found hiding in disguise and was brought before shah soojah the latter magnanimously said to him what has been has been you have deserved evil at my hands but you have this day behaved like a brave man i forgive thee the past go in peace the young prince was then handed over to sir alexander burnes for safe custody the success had been cheaply purchased only seventeen noncommissioned officers and privates had been killed and eighteen officers and a hundred and fortyseven men wounded of the afghans five hundred and fourteen bodies were buried next day more than a hundred fugitives were killed outside the walls upwards of a thousand horses a great number of camels and mules vast quantities of provisions ammunition and arms fell into the hands of the conquerors together with more than fifteen hundred prisoners over a thousand made their escape at the first outburst of firing angus had sprung to his feet as the fight increased in fury he was certain that a night attack was in progress and he at once proceeded to drive in the wedges he had prepared just as he had completed this he heard the dull roar of the explosion followed by loud and excited shouts but the noise of the gale prevented him from catching the words he had no doubt however that either the gate had been blown in or that a mine had been driven into the wall and that the explosion of an immense charge of powder had effected a breach then came the sound of a heavy and continuous rattle of musketry the cannon of the fortress opened fire while those of the besiegers answered by the occasional fall of masses of masonry and the screams of women he had no doubt that the british artillery were now directing their fire against the citadel in order to add to the confusion among the defenders of the fortress illustration he took down the prop and thrust it suddenly with all his force through the hole presently he heard a rush of feet up the staircase then the bolts of the door were pulled back and a yell of rage and surprise arose as the door did not yield to the push against it the staircase was a very narrow one and but one person could mount at a time as it terminated at the door one man only could use his strength against it and angus felt perfectly sure that it would need a much greater pressure than this to force it open he had already propped the plank against it and stood with his foot at the lower end to prevent it from slipping the man next to the door finding that it did not yield began to hammer with the hilt of his sword but soon desisted finding that his blows did not even shake it there was a confused sound of talking and then silence for a few minutes then there was a renewed noise and a heavy blow was struck at the door evidently a large block of wood had been brought up but this did not greatly alarm angus the staircase was a circular one and at most but two men could work the batteringram which on account of the confined space was necessarily short this proving unsuccessful there was again silence after an interval came blows of a sharper sound an axe of some sort was being used during the lulls of the wind the sounds of the struggle below could be plainly heard and as it was now dawn angus could have seen what was going on had not the loophole been on the opposite side but from the sharpness of the sound he had no doubt that the firing was in the courtyard and that his countrymen had effected an entrance the chopping went on regularly the door was thick and strong and it was half an hour before the edge of the axe first showed through it another five minutes and a hole a foot wide appeared some four feet from the ground at this rate it would be some time before an opening large enough for a man to pass through could be made he took down the prop and thrust it suddenly with all his force through the hole striking the man who was wielding the axe full in the face there was a terrible cry mingled with yells of rage from the others presently a pistol was thrust through the hole and fired he had expected this and had stood back again and again shots were fired it was evident that there was an unwillingness on the part of his assailants to try the axe again presently he heard a shout from below the words came up distinctly mohummed hyders orders are that the attack is to cease and angus felt that he was saved the prince indeed seeing that all was lost had sent an officer in great haste to put a stop to the attack on his prisoners cell he no longer thought of carrying out his former intentions the british army was not after all an impotent enemy to be insulted but a victorious one to be appeased and as soon as he was informed of the attack on his prisoners cell he had sent off to put a stop to it it had not been made by his orders but was the act of the soldiers on the wall near it who seeing that the british had entered had determined to take vengeance upon the captive a few minutes later angus heard the triumphant cheers of the troops as they poured in through the open gate of the citadel it was another hour before the contest in the courtyard below and on the walls of the fortress came to an end shortly afterwards he heard steps approaching and through the hole in the door saw a british officer coming up the stair behind him was azim i am glad indeed to see you campbell the officer said as he caught sight of his face we had all given you up as dead when we found that none of your escort came back but your boy on questioning the prisoners found out that you were confined here and came at once to tell me i see by the state of the door that you have been standing a siege are you uninjured yes my rascally troops seized me suddenly and brought me here i will tell you about it as soon as i have unfastened the door it is the first time i ever heard of a prison door having bolts on the inside they are not bolts as you will see directly it took some minutes to get all the wedges out macgregor then entered and shook angus warmly by the hand while azim threw himself on his knees and seizing his masters hand kissed it again and again tears of joy streaming down his cheeks where in the world did you get these wedges macgregor asked i cut them out of this plank it took me all day yesterday to make them and this mallet how the plank came here i dont know but it certainly saved my life that and your wits campbell it was a capital idea firstrate i see there is blood on the staircase the plank came in useful again i used it as a batteringram on the fellow who was chopping and as i caught him full in the face the blood is accounted for as you see by the opposite wall they fired a few shots through the hole afterwards but of course i took good care to be out of the line of fire well come along sir alexander has been asking about you but could get no information and it might have been some time before you were set free had it not been for your boy on going down into the body of the citadel angus was most warmly greeted by sir alexander burnes and the other officers who knew him for all supposed that he had been murdered he explained to his chief why his life had been spared you had a narrow escape indeed the latter said for i have no doubt whatever that the afghan would have carried out his threat had we attacked in a regular way it is quite in accordance with their barbarous customs but i certainly wonder that they did not kill you when we entered the fortress macgregor then told the manner in which angus had converted his little cell into a fort and had resisted successfully the attacks made upon it a very narrow escape indeed mr campbell sir alexander burnes said it was fortunate indeed that that piece of wood had been left in the cell but the idea of cutting wedges from it and fastening the door would not have occurred to everyone it was a most happy thought and certainly was the means of saving your life it was a treacherous business indeed of hajee khan kakur for i have no doubt that he was the concocter of the plot he has given us the strongest grounds for suspicion ever since we left candahar and has continually been making excuses for lagging behind we have strong reason for believing that if we had failed here he would at once have turned against us i do not think he knew of this sir when i was seized the trooper said do you think that because our chief is a traitor we are traitors too these fellows are very crafty mr campbell and hajee has a special reputation that way having before now turned traitor in spite of promises and vows he may very well have instructed one of his men to say this in order that if contrary to all probability you ever rejoined the army he himself might be shielded by your repeating this speech we have never put any trust in him since he joined us though of course it was politic to seem to do so as other chiefs might follow his example he was questioned very sharply as to the orders he had given his men when you did not return that afternoon of course he swore by the prophet that he had chosen men in whom he had the greatest confidence which was i have no doubt true however as it was possible that you and they might have fallen into an ambush the matter was dropped for the time but our suspicions gained ground when as we came up here no signs of a fight were discovered no bodies either of men or horses and i intended to reopen the matter as soon as things were a little settled down well i can assure you i am heartily glad to see you back again safe and sound and i shall not fail to report the matter to sir john keane and tell him how cleverly you escaped the fate intended for you the army remained for a week at ghuznee while preparations were being made for converting the fortress into a base from which further operations could be carried on it was thought well to pause so that the full effects of the disaster might be felt throughout the country before the advance began again the fall of ghuznee had indeed entirely disarranged the plan of campaign that had been decided upon by dost mahomed the fortress had been provisioned for six months and it was confidently believed that it could resist all attacks for that time with the approach of winter the position of a besieging army would be desperate the cold would be intense they would be surrounded on all sides by swarms of fierce tribesmen would be unable to obtain provisions in the country round and must either retire through the passes they had ascended to candahar or be forced by famine to surrender in the former case the disaster that afterwards occurred in endeavouring to retire from cabul would probably have befallen them this plan was entirely brought to naught by the fall of ghuznee and six days later the brother of dost mahomed arrived in camp with an offer from the ameer to surrender the government to shah soojah on condition that he himself should as the head of the barukzyes fill the hereditary office of wuzeer or prime minister as this would have placed the whole power of the state in his hands the offer was refused and on the st of july the army resumed its march after three days march they learned that the kuzzilbashes had mutinied this body of troops were of persian descent and had for very many years formed an important part of the military power of cabul and held a position similar to that of the janizaries of constantinople and the mamelukes of egypt under but very slight control they were constantly causing trouble by their insolence and exactions and they now showed that they entertained no feeling either of loyalty or gratitude towards the dynasty which they served in spite of the exhortations of the ameer they insisted upon his granting them a discharge from his service and as it was evident that the news from ghuznee had so much dispirited the whole army that no reliance whatever could be placed on their fidelity the unfortunate monarch was obliged to allow the kuzzilbashes to disband and the rest of the army to disperse and to take to the mountains as a fugitive accompanied only by a small party of personal followers a force was at once sent in pursuit of him but as the following of the traitor hajee khan formed the principal part of this force the doublefaced chief who desired to make himself safe whatever turn affairs might take so contrived that dost mahomed and his party were not overtaken in the meantime the main force marched forward to cabul wholly unopposed twentytwo guns were found abandoned at the spot where the ameers army had dispersed these placed in a strong defile and supported by a large force of tribesmen might have long resisted our advance had the kuzzilbashes and other afghan horsemen swept round on our rear and although british valour might have finally succeeded it could only have been after a terrible struggle but now the ameer was a fugitive the guns were in our hands the kuzzilbashes and native tribesmen had come in to salute their new ruler and nothing remained but to enter the capital in triumph the entry took place on the th of august the ceremony was an imposing one shah soojah after an exile of thirty years rode at the head of the cortege on a white charger with golden trappings he wore a jewelled coronet his arms and garments were ornamented with precious stones and his waist encircled with a broad girdle of gold encrusted with rubies and emeralds accompanying him were the commanderinchief and mr macnaghten and sir alexander burnes who were in full diplomatic dress two of the shahs sons and a few of the principal chiefs rode behind him with a number of staff officers in full uniform following him came the army that had performed so long and difficult a march to place him on his throne the surrounding country traversed was rich and fertile in the extreme and almost covered with orchards of peaches and other fruits under these crops of all sorts grew luxuriantly on the eminences commanding the plain immense numbers of tribesmen assembled to witness the martial display on entering the city the victors found the inhabitants clustered in the streets through which they passed to the royal residence in the bala hissar a great citadel situated on a hill commanding the town and so strongly fortified that it would have been difficult to capture it unless by the aid of a regular siege train the aspect of the inhabitants was perfectly peaceful there were no shouts or exclamations of enthusiasm but it was evident from the expression of satisfaction on their faces that the majority were well satisfied with the termination of the rule of the barukzyes whose exactions had pressed heavily upon them dost mahomed himself was popular he was affable and kindly in disposition his decisions on all matters brought before him were just and fair he was accessible to all having complaints to bring before him and had he possessed a body of trustworthy infantry to overawe the marauding kuzzilbashes and the semiindependent chiefs there can be no doubt that his rule would have been a wise and beneficial one shah soojah was the reverse of his rival haughty and arrogant he regarded and treated with contempt his new subjects seldom granted audience or troubled himself in any way with their affairs rarely went abroad and remained in almost constant seclusion in his palace the shops of cabul excited the admiration of the officers and men of the british force probably nowhere else in the world could such a display of fruit have been collected here were piles of peaches equal to the finest product of english hothouses grapes of five varieties rosy apples juicy pears several delicious kinds of melons almonds pistachio nuts walnuts quinces cherries and red and white mulberries and vegetables of all kinds the butchers shops were cleanly and well arranged there were public ovens in which loaves and the cakes of which the afghans are extremely fond were baking when the force entered in the potters shops were jars and drinking vessels of all kinds afghan persian and russian cloths cloaks furs of many kinds sets of china and dresden porcelain in the shops of the wealthier traders and behind these open shops were inner apartments with very fine and costly shawls silks precious stones valuable carpets and tea imported by way of bokhara conspicuous were the shops of manufacturers of swords and daggers and makers of scabbards and belts shields and chain armour and even of bookbinders who manufactured covers for manuscript copies of persian poems and stories unfortunately for the moral of the army there were also manufactories of spirits since leaving candahar no spirit rations had been served out and the troops had greatly benefited in health during their arduous work by the privation but the power to purchase vile spirits at a very low price now tempted many into drinking to intoxication and lowered at once their health and discipline mr macnaghten and his staff had a fine building in the bala hissar allotted to them sir alexander burnes with his assistants occupied a house in the city the position of burnes was an unsatisfactory one he had a right to expect that after his previous residence in cabul he would be appointed british resident there and he had only accepted a secondary position upon the understanding that macnaghtens appointment was a temporary one he had on the way up rendered much valuable assistance but he had no strictly defined duties his opinion was seldom asked and if given was wholly disregarded for this he was himself somewhat to blame his temperament was a changeable one at times he was full of enthusiasm and saw everything in the rosiest light at other times he was depressed and despondent and came to be regarded as a prophet of evil having no serious work to occupy his mind he worried over trifles exaggerated the importance of the bazaar rumours and was often filled with the gloomiest anticipations the war had been undertaken altogether in opposition to his advice he had been most favourably impressed with dost mahomed and his remonstrances against the attempt to force shah soojah on the afghans had been so strong and persistent that the home government in defending themselves from the public indignation excited by subsequent disaster even went the length of suppressing some of his despatches and garbling others after he was no longer alive to proclaim the falsification once at cabul his opportunities for doing useful service came to an end macnaghten who was always sanguine to an extent that in the light of subsequent events seemed to border on insanity was allpowerful with the new ameer the expression of any opinion which ran counter to his own was in the highest degree distasteful to him and it was only in negotiations for the supply of the troops and with the petty chiefs that burnes and his staff found any employment although pushtoo was the language of the countrypeople who came in with goods the inhabitants of cabul almost universally spoke persian and angus campbell and azim found themselves quite at home among them on the rd of september a force under colonel wade which had advanced through the khyber pass arrived at cabul it was a mixed body composed principally of pathans and sikhs it had met with comparatively small resistance but had rendered valuable service as a large force had been detached from dost mahomeds army to oppose its advance and thus greatly weakened the army with which the ameer had intended to meet the british advance from candahar the afghan force had been recalled in haste after the news of the fall of ghuznee but had not arrived until after the disbandment of the ameers army and his flight to the bamian pass when it had also broken up and wade was therefore able to reach cabul without opposition it was now necessary to decide what should be done with the army of occupation macnaghten was pressing by a constant succession of letters that large reinforcements should be sent up in order to win back for shah soojah the territories that had once formed part of the afghan empire he urged that in order to check russian aggression an army should not only occupy herat but should extend its operations until it became paramount at bokhara while on the other hand peshawur and the territory wrested from afghanistan by the sikhs should be reconquered and the sikh nation which was becoming more and more hostile to us should be brought into subjection but fortunately lord auckland now freed from the pernicious influence of macnaghten and surrounded by discreet counsellors was by no means disposed to turn a favourable ear to these fantastic projects the cost of the army of occupation was a heavy drain on the revenue of india and so far from any assistance being rendered by afghanistan shah soojah was constantly clamouring for subsidies to enable him to maintain his position the absence of so many troops was also much felt in india for they were greatly needed on the frontiers of the beloochees as well as those of the sikhs macnaghten had so persistently asserted that shah soojah was personally popular with the afghans that it was decided that only a comparatively small force was needed to uphold his authority in case dost mahomed should make an effort to recover his throne and orders were given that the greater portion of the bombay army should march down through the kojuk and bolan passes and most of the bengal troops through the khyber leaving some six regiments with a proportion of artillery at cabul with garrisons at ghuznee candahar quettah and jellalabad macnaghten in vain remonstrated and entreated it was settled that the movement should begin at the end of september so that the troops could regain the plains before winter set in in earnest september passed quietly the climate at this time was perfect and the troops enjoyed the rest with the abundance of fruit and vegetables there were reviews and races shah soojah established an order of knighthood and held a grand durbar at which the principal officers were invested with great ceremony with the insignia of the new order on the th of the month the bombay column started on its march but news having been brought down from the force that had occupied the bamian pass that dost mahomed was collecting a formidable army the authorities were induced to maintain a great portion of the bengal force round cabul great difficulties arose with reference to provisioning these troops through the winter there was abundant accommodation for them in the bala hissar and its citadel but shah soojah strongly objected to the presence of a large body of troops there macnaghten with his usual weakness gave way on the th of october sir john keane with that portion of the bengal force that was to return set out the ameer left two days later to spend the winter in the more genial climate of jellalabad and macnaghten accompanied him sanguine as he was he could not help feeling uneasy at the situation the british occupation had greatly benefited the merchants and traders the farmers and cultivators of cabul but it had seriously injured the poorer portion of the community the natural result of so large an army well supplied with money being stationed in the city was to raise the price of all articles of consumption prodigiously and to cause widespread discontent the exactions of the native taxcollectors pressed heavily upon all the tribesmen the british officers by the terms of the treaty with shah soojah were unable to interfere in any way with the internal affairs of the country but when the natives revolted against the unjust exactions it was they who were called upon to suppress them consequently the infidel supporters of the ameer became more and more hated by the people and it was soon dangerous for them to go beyond the limits of their camps the ameer himself resented the state of subjection in which he considered that he was held though he could not dispense with british bayonets and british money macnaghten left behind him experienced administrators burnes conolly leech todd and lord had all long acquaintance with the country and if anyone could under such circumstances have reconciled the country to foreign occupation they would have done so chapter x a mission i wish that we had trustworthy news of what dost mahomed is doing sir alexander burnes said one morning when he and his assistants were talking over the work for the day of course one hears from the hindoo merchants what rumours are circulating but these are so contradictory that they are not to be relied upon one day it is said that dost has retired to bokhara another that he has already gathered a formidable force it is certain that if he does not recross the bamian soon he will not give us any trouble till the spring for i doubt whether even the afghans hardy as they are could traverse the passes when winter has fairly set in still it would be very useful to us to obtain some sort of inkling as to what his movements and intentions are he may intend to make a bold stroke to recover his kingdom he may wait until there is a popular rising here in the first case our force here must be maintained at the present strength and it would be well to warn lord auckland as soon as possible that next spring its strength must be increased rather than diminished if on the other hand dost depends upon a rising here rather than upon any force he may himself gather there will be no occasion for more troops than we have for these should suffice to crush any tribal rising i should be happy to undertake the mission if you would confide it to me sir angus said i travelled as a persian without exciting suspicion and i can do the same again i might obtain a couple of horseloads of indian silk and cashmere goods and travel as a persian trader who has been settled here but who fearing that fresh disturbances might occur had decided to make a trip himself to bokhara with a view of establishing himself there i see all trade is at present at a standstill as the northern traders dare not venture down here the fact that i can also speak pushtoo will of course be an advantage and would seem to show that i had as i gave out resided here for some time it would be a dangerous enterprise mr campbell there would be a certain amount of danger in it sir but not it seems to me excessivenot more than i met in my journey from herat there is danger as you have frequently said even here and at any rate i am ready to take all risks if you think that the mission would be of utility that it would certainly be and i admit that no one would be more likely to carry it to a successful conclusion but i fear that it would be impossible for you to return before the spring i do not think that i could return across the mountains but i might dispose of my goods to the turkomans from what we hear dost mahomed is either at balkh or kunduz or possibly tashkurgan halfway between them balkh would of course be more convenient for it is but a couple of days journey to kilif on the other side of the oxus there i might dispose of my goods and buy carpets and shawls of bokhara and then travel across the plains to herat thence by the trade route to candahar and so back through ghuznee that would of course be a long journey but there would be no very lofty passes to traverse i need hardly say that i should not enter herat as i might be recognized there but there would be no fear of recognition elsewhere as my servant is really a persian and has also picked up pushtoo he would greatly aid me in preserving my disguise at any rate i would rather be doing something than remaining here idle through the winter then i accept your offer mr campbell the information you would give as to the feeling of the people on the other side of the mountains would be invaluable i will myself question one or two of the hindoo merchants as to the goods that are generally sent to bokhara i know of course that the bulk of that trade with india is carried on through candahar and herat but it would be natural that a trader residing here and wishing to leave should prefer the direct route however toilsome it might be i should say easy loads for three animals would be sufficient and as the merchandise would be of light materials a considerable value could be carried by three horses you will need a fourth for a small stock of provisions for you will have to depend on yourselves until you are on the other side of the passes you will require two men to look after the four horses i will obtain two soldiers from one of the pathan regiments it would be dangerous for you to hire a man in the city i will get a couple of men of approved fidelity they will of course be in native dress and will pass as peasants hired for the journey by you four of you well armed should be able to give a good account of yourselves if you should fall in with any small party of freebooters though that is more likely to happen on your return journey than on your way across the hills thank you sir well today is monday it will take two or three days to make all the preparations and get the sort of men you require would you be ready to start on thursday certainly sir as far as i and my man are concerned we should be ready to start at a moments notice as there will be no difficulty in buying the clothes we require very well then it shall be settled for thursday i know i need not tell you to warn your servant to maintain absolute secrecy as to the fact that you are leaving the town azim was greatly pleased when angus told him of the intended expedition for having few duties to perform he had found the time hang heavily on his hands and was glad to hear that he was not to spend the long winter at cabul he purchased in the bazaars all the garments for his master and himselfhigh boots lined with fur and cloaks of thick cloth similarly lined and afghan hats of black lambs wool illustration there lying close under a rock was a young afghan on wednesday evening sir alexander burnes said to angus it is just as well that you did not make your start this morning for there has been a sharp skirmish on the road ten miles off between a squadron of our cavalry and a party of afghan horse i hear the fellows fought well but were driven off with considerable loss i have seen the two men who have been selected to accompany you they have both been some time in our service their colonel spoke highly to me of them i explained to them the nature of the duty on which they were going and gave them the option of declining it but said that if they carried it through successfully they would on their return receive a present of six months pay and would at once be promoted they accepted without hesitation and i feel certain that you can rely upon them they were recruited from the border tribes which have ever held themselves independent of the afghan factions and have no sympathy whatever either with the kuzzilbashes or soojah himself and care not a snap who rules over afghanistan if questioned their story will be that they came up as camp followers with colonel wades force and that on arriving at cabul their work with the army was at an end and they took service with the persian trader all the goods and packs have been marked in persian characters with the prices they would fetch in persia and those at which they would probably sell at bokhara so that you will know how to carry on your trading without exciting suspicion either by asking too little or by demanding an unusual price each man will lead two horses and i have provided rough ponies for them to ride i think you will find that no detail has been neglected i have had a thousand rupees sewn up in the saddle of your horse i sent for one of the cavalry saddlers and your man showed him which was your saddle another five hundred are sewn in the saddle of your servant in case of mishap here is a letter to lieutenant mackenzie who commands the troop of horse artillery which is at bamian with the ameers ghoorka regiment you may be questioned there so without giving him any details i have simply requested him to allow the bearer and his party to pass on without question or interference the start was not made from the house of sir alexander burnes but from that of the hindoo merchant from whom goods had been purchased as there was nothing unusual in a trader starting with some horseloads of merchandise no attention was attracted and the party crossed the plain four miles farther up and skirted the foot of the mountains until they reached the gorge through which the trackfor it could not be called a roadled over the mountains to bamian they had decided to camp here but they found that it was the scene of the previous days combat dead horses and men were scattered about and it was evident that the afghans had been lying in ambush here aware that at times parties of our cavalry rode some distance up the pass they determined to go half a mile farther up the gorge as there was no danger of disturbance by the afghans who after their defeat on the previous day were not likely to be in the neighbourhood after proceeding a quarter of a mile angus who was riding ahead suddenly stopped his horse hearing a deep groan as the ground was strewn with rocks on either side of the track he concluded at once that some poor fellow had crawled away to die unnoticed by our cavalry returning from pursuit knowing what tortures he must be suffering from thirst he dismounted and filling a pannikin from one of the skins he bade azim bring some fruit and then made his way to the spot from which the sound proceeded there lying close under a rock was a young afghan whose clothes showed that he was a chief of some rank his eyes were closed his face pallid and drawn his lips black and cracked with thirst angus knelt beside him and poured a few drops of water between his lips this he repeated again and again the wounded man opened his eyes with a deep exclamation of thankfulness then his face darkened and he said you meant kindly good friend but you have done me a cruel service the worst had passed i had sunk into unconsciousness and should have passed into paradise without more pain where are you wounded angus asked perhaps we can do something for you the afghan slightly shook his head nothing can be done for me he said i have a musketball in my shoulder and my right leg is broken above the knee at any rate we can make you comfortable we were going to camp a short way ahead but we will now do so here may allah bless you but it would be better to leave me to die at once that i cannot do now have a good drink of water and then i will cut a melon into pieces for you to suck while we are preparing our camp the horses loads were removed and the animals turned loose to graze on the grass growing among the rocks then the tent was erected and the afghan carried into the shade of a high rock close by by this time he was able to speak more strongly and said you are persian i see by your dress how comes it that you have entered this lonely gorge with your packhorses and your goods we are going to make our road to bokhara there are rumours of disaffection in cabul and if there is fighting the houses of the traders will be looted therefore i resolved to leave while i could and am taking my indian goods for sale there it will be a terrible journey the young chief said there is already snow in the upper passes i wish you success i shall think of your kindness as i lie here and pray allah to protect you before you go i pray you to carry me down to the edge of this stream so that i may drink when i will we will certainly do that and give you a supply of fruit if we can do no better now we must look and see to your wounds i can at least bandage them and make you somewhat easier to his surprise angus found no wounds in the leg i see no bullet mark he said no the leg was broken in my fall my men had fought well but the feringees were too strong for them and we fled i was riding in their rear when a shot struck me in the shoulder i fell from my horse and when i found that my leg was broken i felt my end was at hand but i heard no more shots nor any further sound of galloping horses and i knew that by allahs mercy they had ceased their pursuit my horse had galloped on after the others and my men might not notice that i had fallen until they had gone some distance when they would probably conclude that i had been killed i managed to crawl out of the road to the shelter of that rock where you found me as the infidels might come up in the morning and i would rather die quietly there than be shot down they would not have injured you angus said they kill many in battle but it is a rule with them never to touch an injured man and had they come along they would have taken you back to their camp and have done all they could for you i have heard that they were strange in that respect but i did not think of itmy only wish was to die quietly and alone i tried several times to crawl to the stream but the agony was so great that i could not do it angus while he was speaking was feeling the limb the first thing to do he said is to bring the ends of the bone together the operation will be painful but it will greatly relieve your sufferings do as you will stranger allah has sent you to my side and what you do must be right in the first place i must prepare some splints to keep it in its place leaving the afghan angus searched among the bushes until he found a shrub which was thick enough for the purpose he and azim with their knives cut this down near the root and then divided it into lengths split each of these and smoothed the pieces until they were perfectly even he then tore off several long strips of cloth to form bandages and calling to the two men he returned to the wounded afghan the patient was lifted into another position where he could place his left foot against a rock now chief angus said you must with that leg prevent yourself from being pulled forward my servant will hold you round the body so as to aid you the other two men will take hold of your right leg and pull it while as soon as it is sufficiently stretched i shall press the broken ends into their position i am afraid that the pain will be very severe but you will be much easier afterwards at present the ends of the bones are tearing your flesh an afghan can bear pain the chief said quietly do as you will now angus said to the soldiers take a firm hold above the ankle and draw as steadily and quietly as you can but with all your strength the resistance of the muscles was so great that it was only by exercising their utmost power that the men got them to yield at last angus felt the end of the bone on which he was pressing suddenly slip into its place then for the first time he looked round no sound had escaped the afghans lips but the agony had been so intense that he had fainted now give me a long bandage azim you need not hold him any longer double up a cloak or something and lift him and put it under him so that i can pass the bandage round and round first a wad of thick material soaked in water was placed round the leg at the point of the fracture and then bandage was added to bandage until the limb down to the knee was surrounded by a casing half an inch thick then the splints were applied some reaching only down to the knee others to the ankle these were held in their place by the three assistants while angus again firmly bandaged them the operation being completed he dashed some water on the afghans face the latter soon opened his eyes it is all over chief the bones are in their place again and if all goes well in time the ends may knit firmly together it is easier already the chief said gratefully i no longer feel as if an evil spirit from eblis were torturing me with a hot iron i will now see to your shoulder the wound has ceased bleeding therefore i shall but sponge it with cold water and put a bandage on in case it should break out afresh this was soon done some cloths soaked in water were laid over the bandage then some more fruit was given to the wounded man and he was left in the shade and the men set about cooking a meal angus from time to time went across to see him and had the satisfaction in the evening of finding that he had fallen asleep now azim he said when he returned the next thing to do is to settle what is to be done with him i have been wondering that ever since we found him master there is a choice of two things one is that i mount my horse ride back to cabul report having found a wounded man and ask that a party with a stretcher may be sent out to fetch him in early in the morning the other is to take him on with us azim looked in surprise that would be very difficult master no doubt it would be difficult but i think it might be done there is no doubt that from his dress and appearance and from the fact that he speaks excellent persian he is a chief of considerable standing in that case his friendship might be invaluable to us both on our way down to the frontier and possibly in the future which sir alexander burnes regards as very threatening it would be worth while therefore to make some sacrifice to carry him down to his friends i would not do it if i thought the journey would harm him but i believe the cold air of the mountains would be vastly better for him than the heat of the plains round cabul he may suffer somewhat from jolting but i think that we can obviate that if we cut two strong poles about fifteen feet long attach them to the packsaddles of two horses and by securely fastening a blanket between them make a hammock in which he can ride comfortably the poles would be elastic enough to save sudden jolts we can only go at a foots pace in these passes and these native horses are so surefooted that i think the chance of any accident is extremely slight the horses are but lightly weighted and as the provisions are consumed we can move a portion of the weight they carry to the one who takes our food yes that would be a good plan master another advantage of it would be angus went on that whereas he would chafe at being in a hospital in care of the people he hates his spirits would naturally rise as he felt that he was returning to his friends and this would hasten his recovery however i will put the question to him in the morning if he decides upon being kept in camp i will send you back with a letter to sir alexander burnes for stretcherbearers and you will easily overtake us at our campingplace tomorrow evening in the morning the young chief was better than angus had even hoped for once or twice during the night fresh water had been poured gently over the bandages on the wounded shoulder like all people living chiefly in the open air accustomed to climbing and to hard exercise the afghans suffer less from wounds than europeans do abstemious in their habits comparatively small meateaters lithe and sinewy in their figures they speedily recover from wounds unless of a mortal nature angus found that the chiefs forehead and hands were cool and there were no signs of fever setting in i have been thinking over what would be best for you and decided to leave the choice to yourself i am acquainted with burnes sahib and if i send my servant with a letter i know that he will at once send out a party to carry you into hospital where you will be well cared for i would rather die than accept kindness at their hands the afghan said firmly in that case there seems no other course but for me to construct a litter between two of my packhorses and to carry you over the mountains to kundur and would you thus burden yourself with a stranger the afghan asked in a tone of great surprise certainly i would for a wounded stranger angus said but i do not think that there will be any great trouble and i will try to make the journey as easy for you as possible he then explained how he intended to carry him the face of the wounded man lit up he had permitted angus to set his limb because he believed it was destiny that had sent him to his aid he felt sure that the man who had taken such trouble with him would leave a store of provisions within his reach and that possibly some of the natives might come along and carry him to their village and so tend him until his strength was restored it was but a faint hope for now that winter was approaching the men from the upper villages would have come down into the plain and the chances were but slight that any would enter the gorge his hope rested chiefly in the belief that as he had been so unexpectedly saved from death his final deliverance would also be effected but that this kind trader should offer to carry him up the passes had never entered his mind and his pale cheek flushed with pleasure certainly i will go with you if you will take me he said joyfully nobly indeed do you carry out the precept of the prophet to be compassionate to all those who need it let us say no more about it chief it will be a pleasure to me to see you grow stronger and i doubt not that the mountain air will benefit you greatly and i shall have my reward in seeing you regaining your strength we have meat with us but it will be better for you to take fruit and a little bread two soldiers were sent out and presently returned with poles of the desired length and thickness breakfast was then eaten afterwards the poles a long blanket having been firmly lashed between them were securely fastened against the horses flanks under their burdens in this way a hammock was formed in which while the body and legs were below the level of the poles the head was somewhat above them a cloak was rolled up to make a pillow and the chief was then gently lifted and laid in it they started at daybreak rested in the shade for three or four hours in the middle of the day and then continued their journey till late in the evening after two days travel the halt was no longer necessary for they were now far above the level of the plain the air was fresh during the day and at night all were glad to cover themselves with their long coats lined with sheepskin angus had made no attempt to discover the position of the ball in the shoulder of the wounded chief even if he found it he had neither the instruments nor the skill necessary for its removal the only thing he could do was to keep the cloths bathed with cold water to prevent inflammation setting in the track they were following sometimes disappeared altogether and angus often congratulated himself upon having the young chief with him for the latter had twice before crossed the mountains and was able to tell him which line to take the days journey varied much in length being from fifteen to twentyfive miles according as they found a suitable haltingplace they always camped where there was water emptying the skins and filling them afresh as often as possible at times the ground was covered with snow this they thawed in a pot over a fire of brushwood of which they were careful to gather some at every opportunity on the days march the chief and angus occupied the little tent while azim slept with the two soldiers in a shelter composed of blankets every day there was a visible improvement in the state of the wounded man the cool air acted as a tonic to his system the first two or three days his arm pained him a good deal though he had never once complained of it it was kept bound to his side and by means of splints and bandages the shoulder was held in its natural position more than this angus had not attempted he believed that the shoulder was broken but even of this he was not sure and could only hope that the bone would knit together itself one day however in reply to his questions the afghan admitted that he felt a burning pain just over the left shoulder and feeling angus perceived a hard substance apparently but a short distance under the skin there is no doubt that this is the ball he said a surgeon would cut down upon it and get it out easily enough then why do you not do it you seem very skilful i have had no practice he said my father was a trader of tabriz he was a good man and very much respected the poor often came to him in cases of accidents and i have many a time seen him bandage broken limbs that is why i was able to do it but of bullet wounds i know nothing take my dagger and cut down to it at once the pain of a cut is nothing cut fearlessly and deeply so that you can take hold of the ball with your fingers after some hesitation angus agreed to do so for by the pain it was causing the bullet might set up inflammation it is a mere nothing the afghan said i have frequently cut out bullets from my tribesmen the chiefs dagger was as keen as a razor and seeing that his patient really wished it angus performed the operation he had to cut three times before he could manage to get hold of the bullet the afghan himself did not once flinch that is well he said when the ball was extracted now bring the edges together again put a piece of wet rag over them and then tie a bandage tightly round me by the end of a week there will be nothing but a scar remaining two days later they arrived at bamian as they entered the little town a native officer of a ghoorka regiment came out and demanded their business for the first time angus was unable to give an answer in the language in which he was addressed knowing however the purport of the question he showed his letter to lieutenant mackenzie the native was unable to read english but called to an english artilleryman who at once came up on seeing the letter he motioned to the pretended trader to follow him and conducted him to the house where lieutenant mackenzie lodged there is a man outside who has a letter for you sir he said saluting an englishman no sir one of these traders i think he has some horses with packs and he has a wounded or dead man in a litter show him in angus on entering said in persian my orders are to deliver this letter to you when alone sir the lieutenant signed to two orderlies to whom he had at the time been giving orders and angus then went on in english you do not remember me lieutenant mackenzie i am angus campbell on the staff of sir alexander burnes oh yes i remember you now the officer said rising and shaking him by the hand of course we have met many times but in that persian dress i did not know you again i suppose you have come to see how we are getting on no i am on a mission across the mountains to see what dost mahomed is really doing there as you will see by this letter the officer glanced through it i see you do not want the natives herethere are not many of themto be asking any questions let me see we are pretty closely packed as you may imagine i could give you a room here but that would hardly do no it would not do at all angus said it would appear strange indeed to the natives if you were to so honour a travelling merchant i can do very well without a room for i have a tent that i have used on my journey all i wish is that you give an order that we shall not be in any way interfered with that i can do easily enough and will put a sentry over your encampment with orders that no one is to enter into conversation with your followers thank you that is just what i desire i hear that one of your men is ill can anything be done for him we have a doctor with us and you could leave the man in hospital and he could either make his way back when cured or follow youthough i doubt whether that would be possible as the passes will soon be completely blocked with snow as soon as we are sure of this we shall return to cabul so we are looking forward eagerly as you may imagine for the news that they have become impassable thank you the man met with an accident by falling from his horse but i doctored him as well as i could and i think in another day or two he will be able to sit a horse and as he knows the passes i must keep him with me for already the paths are in many cases obliterated by snow and i should fare badly indeed without him yes i see that how long are you going to stay here i shall start again the day after tomorrow it is most important that i should push on for the passes may be closed any day i will give the horses and men one days rest that is all that i can afford now i will say goodbye for it would not do for you to be seen speaking to me again no i suppose it would not do for you to come here but i will after dark tonight come down and have a chat with you i have had no news from cabul for the last fortnight there would be no harm in that would there no i should be very glad if you would come in that way half an hour later the tents were erected and two sentries were placed near them to warn off all intruders angus went into the little town and made some purchases from three small traders who had remained there and had been well rewarded for doing so by the prices they obtained from the troops for their stores lieutenant mackenzie on his arrival had ordered them to send all the liquor they had to his quarters telling them that unless they agreed to this they would not be allowed to remain and promising that the liquor should be returned to them when the troops left their stores were almost exhausted but angus was able to purchase some rice a pot of ghee and a sack of grain for the horses at eight oclock mackenzie came down sadut khan had been apprised of the intended visit and had willingly consented to be carried for the time into the other tent so that angus had his to himself it is a snug little tent mackenzie said when he entered it not much head room but that is of no consequence as it is only a place for sleeping in i am ashamed to come emptyhanded but i only brought a couple of bottles of spirits with me and they are both empty long ago i cant drink this beastly native stuff and besides the room in which i stored all there was in the place when i got here is locked up i made the traders put their seals to it so that there could be no dispute about the quantities when i handed them over thank you angus said i dont touch spirits whatever may be the case in other places i am convinced that men are better off without them in a country like this certainly they are best avoided in hot weather and i think even in the cold weather coffee is infinitely better and i have brought a good store of that with me now make yourself as comfortable as you can fill your pipe from that jar it is the best persian tobacco then when the coffee comes in i will give you the news from cabul a large jug of coffee with two silver horns which angus had bought before starting was soon brought in and then angus told what had happened at cabul since the last letter mackenzie had received then you dont think things are going on well mackenzie said when he had concluded no there is much disaffection among the lower class in the city the tribesmen are restless and discontented it was a great mistake to allow shah soojah the entire control of all civilian matters the consequence is that the people are grievously oppressed by the taxgatherers the ameer himself is impatient at the slightest attempt to control him he renders himself intensely unpopular by hardly ever appearing in public by his refusal to grant audiences and by his haughtiness and arrogance to those whom he does admit to his presence i am certain that he could not maintain himself for a day if we were to march away and i dont see how we can leave him to his fate altogether the situation is very difficult and i am afraid it will end badly they want a strong man at the head of affairs i do not think that macnaghten is a strong man keane is a good soldier but it is said that he will return to england in the spring and how about burnes burnes is my chief angus said with a smile but i can say this i believe that if he were in macnaghtens place things would go on better at present however he has no authority of any kind he differs from macnaghten on almost every point and any advice he gives is almost contemptuously neglected it is a queer state of affairs mackenzie said however i suppose we shall get out all right in the end it is a way we have we generally make a muddle in the beginning but our fighting power has pulled us through well i will be going now it is eleven oclock i think that it would be better that i should not come again tomorrow i think so too if the afghans here entertained the smallest suspicion that you were visiting me they would feel sure that i was not the trader i pretended to be and would find means of sending a message across the mountains which would result in the failure of my mission and my own certain death after a hearty farewell and an expression of the best wishes for the success of his mission mackenzie said goodbye and left the tent the afghan chief was carried back into it and in a few minutes all in the little camp were asleep chapter xi a dangerous journey angus made every effort to secure the services of a native well acquainted with the passes as guide but was altogether unsuccessful the difficulties were they declared insurmountable the danger overwhelming i must see what i can do sadut khan said when angus informed him that the natives were all of opinion that the snow was too heavy and the danger too great for the pass to be attempted we stayed here for some days when i crossed the hills with dost mahomed there is a petty chief living in a village two miles away if he is still there i think he would accompany you whether or not i am certain he would not divulge the secret of my being here to anyone i will go myself to see him angus said i hope indeed he will accompany us for if not i fear that our journey has come to an end as the offers i have made would have tempted any of the natives here to go with me if they had thought it possible shall i mention your name to him say to him only that a chief of the momunds whom he knew here three months ago desires to speak to him angus at once mounted his horse and rode to the foot of the hill upon which the village with the tower of its chief was perched then fastening the bridle to a stunted shrub he made his way up the steep ascent on foot the place did not contain more than a dozen houses as he passed through these natives wrapped in sheepskin jackets came to the door and gazed at him with angry scowls as he reached the door of the tower four armed men came out what would you here stranger one of them said i would speak a few words with your chief he does not want either to buy or to sell the man said shortly i do not seek to sell angus said i have a message of importance to him one of them went into the tower and returning in a minute motioned to angus to follow him the chief a tall and powerful man of middle age was seated on the floor of a room in the upper story of the tower near him was a large earthenware pan in which a charcoal fire was burning why come you here persian he said and what message can one like you bear to me angus repeated the message that sadut khan had given him the chief rose to his feet suddenly you lie he said fiercely he is dead the news came to us a week since nevertheless he gave me that message and if you will come with me to bamian you will see for yourself that he is not dead though it is true that he has been sorely hurt i go not into bamian the chief said i have not put foot in the town since the accursed infidels came there they have held no communication with me nor i with them this may be a trick to lure me there and make me prisoner if they had desired to do so angus said quietly they would have sent a hundred men with a gun or two and not a mere trader besides how could they have told that a momund chief had been here with dost mahomed when he passed through many could have told you that the chief said seeing that next to the ameer himself he was the most observed of the party well chief if you will not go i have nothing to do but to return and inform him that you refuse to come and see him how can he be there in the midst of the enemy unless indeed he is a prisoner he is not a prisoner he lies in my tent you can see him without entering bamian for my camp is outside the town what motive chief could i have in deceiving you i will go the chief said suddenly it shall not be said that i refused to answer such a call however improbable it might seem he threw on a cloak lined with sheepskins and telling his men that unless something befell him he would be back by noon he led the way down the hill angus mounted his horse when he reached it and rode beside him for some distance the afghan did not speak do you know the name of this chief he asked abruptly when half the distance had been traversed it is sadut khan the fighting chief of the momunds and a nephew by marriage of the ameer the afghan had not expected this reply you must be in his confidence indeed persian or he would not thus have disclosed himself when in the midst of those who would hail his capture as one of the most valuable prizes he has as you say faith in me angus said quietly and will doubtless when you see him give you his reason for that trust in me your story must be true and i believe it forgive me for at first doubting it but having heard that the chief had been killed i thought this was a plot of some kind it was natural that you should not believe me angus said you could scarce credit that he was alive and what was still more strange that he should be in a town occupied by the english and yet not be a prisoner this is a fortunate day for me indeed the afghan said there is no chief whose name is more honoured in the country than that of sadut khan he is as brave as a lion good to his people and faithful to dost mahomed when so many have fallen away from him the ameer regards him as if he were a favourite son and it will gladden his heart indeed and lessen his troubles when he learns that he is still alive avoiding the town they went straight to sadut angus dismounted and led the way to his little white tent and raising the flap said to the chief he is here enter the afghan did so and thinking it best to leave them together for a time angus strolled away and saw that his horse was as usual well wrapped up in a thick felt blanket it was half an hour before the chief made his appearance at the entrance to the tent and looked round angus at once spoke to him my friend said the chief i again ask your pardon for doubting you for a moment allah will surely bless you for the good work you have done sadut khan has told me all and it passes my understanding why a stranger should have cumbered himself with a wounded man of whom he knew nothing does not the koran bid us succour the afflicted that is true my friend but there are surely limits one will do great things for a friend one may do something for a stranger but to hinder ones journey and cumber ones self with a wounded stranger is surely more than can be expected of us angus now entered the tent my trust in the chief was not misplaced sadut khan said he will act as our guide across the mountains though he doubts whether it will be possible to cross the passes if it is the will of allah persian that we should not we can but die that is so angus said but the passes may not be as badly blocked as we expect we can hardly hope that the chief replied shaking his head the last party that came over reported that they had never known it so bad this was a week ago and since then the sky has always been dull to the north and it has surely been snowing there however today it is lighter and maybe no more snow will fall for a time we had best lose not an hour in starting i shall take four of my men with me we have no horses but that matters not at all for the passage will have to be made on foot let us move tomorrow at daybreak and travel as far as we can before it is dark when the arrangements were all settled angus went into the village and bought some more grain cheese and other food also a store of extra blankets and two other native tents these were to be packed on his horse and azims among other things he bought two native lamps for each tent and a good supply of oil a roll of flannel for tearing into strips for winding round the feet and legs and he was then satisfied that he had done all in his power to render the enterprise a success before daybreak next morning hassan the afghan chief arrived with four of his followers all strong and sinewy men the animals were speedily packed saduts litter was placed between two of the horses which were more lightly loaded than the others and they set out just as daylight was spreading over the sky the speed with which the start was effected was in itself a sign that all felt the gravity of the task before them angus had the evening before explained to the two soldiers that the journey before them was one of tremendous difficulty and offered to leave them in charge of lieutenant mackenzie till spring when they could return to cabul and rejoin their regiment but they would not hear of it we are both mountain men one said and if others can get through we can at any rate we will risk anything rather than return with blackened faces and say that we had feared to follow our officer the morning was bitterly cold but the sky was clear we shall do well today hassan said to angus and the horses are fresh as for tomorrow who can say the snow was kneedeep when they got beyond the village the ascent began almost at once and was heavy work both for men and horses they continued their journey till it was too dark to go farther then they halted in a ravine which afforded some shelter from the piercing wind all set to work to clear away the snow where the tents were to be pitched but before raising these the horses were attended to blankets were girded round them from the ears to the tail and they were picketed touching each other for mutual warmth a supply of corn was then laid down before each on some square pieces of felt placed on the snow when the tents were pitched the lamps were lighted and the flaps closed then snow was scraped up outside until the canvas was covered nearly to the top in spite of the intense cold all were thoroughly warmed by their hard work before they turned in angus took azim into his tent the rest divided themselves among the other two at other times it would have been unpleasant to be so closely packed but in such weather it was an advantage before setting to work to pile the snow against the tents a brass kettle filled with water had been suspended from the ridgepole over the lamps and the water was almost boiling by the time the work was finished and in a few minutes coffee was made the frozen carcasses of four sheep had been brought as well as a large quantity of meat that had been cooked on the previous day some slices of the latter were thawed over the lamp and eaten with bread that had been purchased at bamian but few words were spoken after the meal was finished their fatigue and the warmth of the tent rendering it difficult for them to keep awake in a few minutes all were sound asleep the next days march was even more arduous sadut had given up his litter and again mounted his horse as it was found impossible for the two animals linked together by the hammock to make their way up the steep place the work was toilsome in the extreme but all worked cheerfully hassan and his four men laboured with the greatest vigour carrying burdens to places which horses when laden could not have climbed hauling the animals out of deep drifts into which they frequently fell carrying sadut khan in his litter at points where the ascent was so steep that crippled as he still was by his injured leg he could not have retained his seat in the saddle the party worked in almost complete silence but with a stern determination and energy which showed their consciousness that every moment was of importance twelve miles were the result of as many hours of labour no signs of a track had been visible since they left bamian and angus felt how absolutely impossible it would have been to cross the pass had it not been for the intimate knowledge of hassan and his followers even these were sometimes at fault none of them had ever passed over the mountains when so deeply covered with snow and consultations constantly took place between them as to the line to be followed when they arrived at their haltingplace for the night hassan told angus and the momund chief that they were now within two hundred feet of the top of the pass tomorrows work will be the most dangerous the north wind sweeps across the plateau with terrible force moreover i do not like the look of the sky this evening we have been fortunate so far but i think that there will be a change it is well indeed sadut said as they ate their supper that we crossed the highest pass before the snow began in earnest we certainly could not have supported that journey had we been ten days later we have got through the hardest part of the work and everything now depends upon the weather may allah grant that there be no more snow the pass tomorrow is but twelve miles across and if all goes well we shall begin to descend on the following morning if the snow holds off we shall be able to do that distance easily for it is almost a level plain that we have to traverse parts of it will be nearly clear of snow which the fierce blasts sweep away as fast as it falls while in other places the surface will be hard enough to walk on the snow being pressed firmly together by the weight of the wind they were on foot again next morning even earlier than usual all were aware of the importance of haste the tents were pulled down and loaded with the greatest rapidity the cold was intense and but few words were spoken until they reached the summit of the ascent by which time the effort of climbing had restored the heat that had been lost as soon as they left their warm tents the sky was cloudless and angus felt hopeful that the days journey would be accomplished with comparative ease he noticed however that there was an anxious look on the faces of the five tribesmen who although they were travelling more rapidly than they had done since they left bamian were constantly urging horses and men to press forward at a greater speed angus had expected that they would have to face very strong wind but scarce a breath was blowing as sadut had predicted the rock was in many places completely bare the fields of snow were so hard that instead of struggling kneedeep as before they now seldom sank over their feet and sometimes left scarcely a track upon the surface the hills on either side stood up clear and hard and the silence was almost oppressive they were they calculated halfway across the pass three hours after leaving their camp when hassan who was walking beside angus and sadut stopped suddenly and pointed to the sky looking up angus saw two or three little wisps of vapour passing overhead with extraordinary speed the storm hassan exclaimed see others are coming it will soon be upon us we can go no farther but must prepare to meet it instantly or we shall be overwhelmed knowing that hassan would not have spoken thus unless from the direst necessity angus at once ordered a halt the plateau was perfectly flat and nowhere could any shelter be obtained and they were now on an expanse of hard snow urged by the shouts and exclamations of hassan all hastened to unload the animals as soon as this was done angus ordered the tents to be pitched it is useless hassan said they would be blown down in an instant let them lie open on the snow let each man take his two blankets and keep them by him in readiness and when the storm begins let him wrap himself up in these and then let those who are tentfellows lie down together on one side of the tent pull the other over them and roll themselves in it i and my men will be the last to take shelter and we will pile the sacks and saddles over the ends to keep them down but first put all the extra blankets over the horses and fasten them over their heads and let them hang down well behind they will turn their backs to the wind make all those that are accustomed to lie down do so range the others close to them ten minutes of hard work and all was ready then they had time to look round the sky was hidden from view by masses of black clouds streaming along the men took their places on their tents and wrapped their blankets round in readiness lie down at once hassan ordered it will be upon us almost immediately the men did so hassan and his followers pulled the felt covering over them pushing the edge of the upper side under them as far as possible then they piled baggage and saddles on the ends angus with azim and sadut remained standing till the last hassan ran up to them with his men quick he said the storm will be upon us immediately glancing ahead as he lay down angus saw what looked like a white mist in the distance and knew that it must be snow swept up by the force of the wind half a minute and they were tucked up in the thick felt this was weighted at both ends allah preserve you hassan shouted then all was silent a minute later the storm struck them with such force that they felt as if pressed down by a heavy weight had they been inclined to speak they could not have heard each other so loud was the howl of the wind wrapped up in their sheepskin posteens and blankets they did not feel the cold for some time angus lay and wondered how long this would last presently he fell asleep the warmth after the bitterly cold air outside overpowering even the thought of danger he was lying between sadut and azim who like himself lay without moving indeed movement would have been difficult so tightly was the tent wrapped round them he slept for many hours vaguely conscious of the roar and fury of the gale when he awoke at last it was with a sense of suffocation a heavy weight seemed to press upon him and the sound of the storm had ceased are you awake he asked the others but he had to shake them before he obtained an answer something must be done he went on as soon as they were capable of understanding him we shall be suffocated if we dont let some air in that is true sadut said the snow is evidently piled up round us we must let air in or we shall perish but in spite of their efforts they found it impossible to move forward to get to the end of the roll we must cut our way out it is our only chance angus said and turning on to his back he managed to get out his long afghan knife and cut a slit three feet long in the felt as he did so the snow came pouring in through the opening do you both put your hands under my shoulders he said and help me to sit up it was not until he had cut a transverse slit so as to allow the hole to open wider that he was able to do so the snow is not packed very hard he said as he pressed it aside it cant be very deep for i can see light it was not long before he was on his feet and had pushed the snow sufficiently back to enable his companions to get out also the feeling of suffocation was already relieved as a sufficient amount of air made its way through the snow and after five minutes hard work they clambered out the gale was still blowing though not so violently as at first the snow still falling thickly two white mounds marked the position of the other tents elsewhere a wide expanse of level snow was seen it was evident that as it drifted it had first heaped itself against the tent more had settled beyond it and so gradually mounds had risen until they were seven or eight feet high we must rescue the others at once angus said on the windward side the snow was so hard that their hands made no impression upon it but on the sheltered side it was lighter and working with their hands they were soon able to clear it away down to the end of the tent beneath which hassan and three of his followers were lying it was not like the others closed there as its occupants had been unable to place weights on it after they had rolled themselves up as soon as they had cleared the snow and opened the felt out a little sadut called are you awake hassan i am awake he replied but am bound down hand and foot they cleared the snow off until they saw a foot taking hold of this together they pulled and gradually drew one of the men out the other three were extricated more easily they found that these had not suffered so much from a sense of suffocation as the first party had done as the ends of the roll being open a certain amount of air had found its way through the snow half an hours hard work sufficed to rescue the occupants of the other tent the three were unconscious but the cold blast speedily brought them round what is to be done next angus asked hassan the gale is still far too severe for us to move the latter answered we had best clear away the snow over the tents and then take to them again after two hours work the tents were cleared the men had worked from above throwing out the snow over the sides of the mound so that when they had finished the tents lay at the bottoms of sloping holes a meal was then eaten and lifting the upper covering of felt they lay down again and closed it over them the sun was in the east and they knew that some fifteen hours had elapsed since the gale had struck them a mound of snow had marked where the horses were lying they did not interfere with these for hassan said that the horses would be able to breathe through the snow and probably the heat of their bodies had melted it immediately round them and they would be much warmer than if the snow were cleared off before turning in hassan and his men managed to erect the tent of their leaders lying as it did in a crater of snow it was sheltered from the force of the wind holes were made with a dagger on each side of the slit that angus had cut and the edges tied together by a strip of leather a couple of lamps and oil were taken from the sack in which they were carried and also the bag of corn and the little party after filling their vessels with snow and hanging them over the lamps and closing the entrance to the tent soon felt comfortable again it has been a narrow escape sadut said had it not been for your thinking of cutting the tent and so enabling us to make our way out the whole caravan would assuredly have perished now we have only an imprisonment for another day or two at most and can then proceed on our journey the next morning the gale had ceased though the snow continued to fall by midday the sky cleared and all issuing out from their shelters prepared for a start it took them an hours work to extricate the horses one of these a weakly animal had died the others appeared uninjured by their imprisonment all the vessels in the camp had been used for melting snow and a drink of warm water with some flour stirred into it was given to each of the animals and an extra feed of corn as soon as they had eaten this the baggage was packed on their backs and the party moved forward it was heavy work the snow that had fallen since the force of the wind had abated was soft and the animals sank fetlockdeep in it but after three hours travelling they reached the end of the pass and began to descend two hours later they halted at a spot where a wall of rock afforded shelter against the wind from the north allah be praised that we have reached this point hassan said now the worst is over i can see that we shall have another storm before an hour is past they generally follow each other when they once begin but here we are safe and it was for this that i said no when you proposed that we should halt at the mouth of the pass the tents were soon erected great stones being placed on the lower edge to steady them against the gusts of wind then a diligent search was made for wood and enough bushes were found to make a good fire strips of meat from one of the frozen sheep were cooked the kettles were boiled cakes of flour and ghee were baked and the travellers made a hearty meal the horses were each given half a bucket of warm water thickened with flour and a double feed of grain then all sat round the fire smoking and talking until it burned low when in spite of their sheepskin coats the bitter cold soon made itself felt they had scarcely turned into their tents when the storm as hassan had predicted burst except for an occasional gust they felt it but little and slept soundly until morning when they found that light snow had eddied down and was lying two feet deep the day was spent in cooking and attending to their own wants and those of the horses for two days they were prisoners then the gale abated and they continued their journey and late that evening arrived at the village of chol here they were received with hospitality by the natives who were astounded that in such weather the caravan should have made its way over the pass resting here for two days they travelled to kala sarkari sadut now took the lead for the chief of the village seeing three horses loaded with merchandise demanded toll but sadut announcing himself as a nephew of dost mahomed and saying that the whole party were under his protection the threatening attitude that the inhabitants began to assume was at once calmed four days travel with halts at small villages took them to balkh here on declaring himself sadut was received with great honour and was entertained at the governors house where dost mahomed was lying ill no attention was bestowed upon hassan and his followers who walked behind him and were reported as having been the means of his safety angus with his party kept some little distance in the rear and took up their quarters at a khan unnoticed but when sadut was seen to call early the next morning upon the persian trader and remain with him for a considerable time it was understood that they were under his protection and no enquiries were made by the authorities of the town on the third day sadut said to angus i regret that the ameer is ill had it not been for that he would have received you i told him of the services you have rendered me and that but for you a few hours would have ended my life he said that he would like to see so noble a man and to give him a fitting testimonial of gratitude for the service done to his sisters son he requested me to bring you to him as soon as he is able to rise from his couch and when he enters cabul in triumph as he assuredly will do ere long he hopes that you will establish yourself there i can promise you that your business shall flourish i thank you heartily khan for having spoken to the ameer about me angus said gravely but i cannot receive a present from dost mahomed i have intended many times to tell you more about myself and i feel that i must do so now you are my friend and i cannot remain in a false position with you as long as we were travelling together no harm was done it mattered not to you who was the man who had aided you in your extremity but the case is different now you were then a sorely wounded man who needed what aid i could give you now you are a close relation of dost mahomed and a powerful afghan chief so the case is changed dost mahomed and no doubt yourself know what is passing in cabul by means of your friends there who see all that is going on the english general on the other hand knows nothing of what is passing beyond the ground patrolled by his cavalry it was important for him to learn what was passing on this side of the mountains and he selected me an officer in his army on account of my knowledge of persian and pushtoo to cross the mountains and ascertain what prospect there was of dost mahomeds returning with an army to cabul in the spring i confide my secret to you as to a friend you can see that it would be impossible for me to accept presents from dost mahomed in my character of a persian merchant and for the same reason i should abstain from questioning you or even allowing you to give me any information as to the military preparations going on to do so would be to take an unfair advantage of the chances that enabled me to be of service angus had thought the matter over and knew that while such work as he was engaged in would if discovered cost him his life it would be regarded by the afghans as a legitimate means of obtaining information and although if caught he would be killed as an enemy his action would be regarded as showing that he was a man of great bravery thus to place himself in the power of an enemy this was the view indeed in which sadut khan regarded it you have done well to tell me he said gravely it was truly the act of a brave man not only to risk discovery here but to undertake the terrible adventure of crossing the passes when winter had fairly set in in order to obtain information for your general still more do i wonder that you should have burdened yourself with the care of an enemy one who was fighting against your people it was wonderful on the part of a persian trader it is far more so on the part of one against whom i was fighting who is not of my religion who was engaged upon an enterprise of such a nature and to whom speed was a matter of the greatest importance had it not been for the slow pace at which you travelled with me you might have crossed all the passes before they were blocked i shall fight against your people as before but i shall respect them now i see that although our religions differ there are good things in their beliefs as in ours and that even the koran has no lessons in charity and kindliness stronger than those that you have learned from the teaching of your own religion what i thought wonderful on the part of a persian merchant is still more marvellous on the part of an english officer who could have no possible interest in saving a dying man and who indeed might have gained credit by delivering him into the hands of his countrymen since so long as i was a prisoner in their hands i should be a hostage for the quiet behaviour of my people you can do no harm to us by your enquiries here it is known by all on this side of the mountains that the ameer will in the spring endeavour to turn out the usurper it is known already to every sheik from candahar to jellalabad whether he will come with ten thousand or twenty thousand men matters little when he appears all afghanistan will rise your generals might have been sure that it would be so without sending to make enquiries i cannot tell you with what force we shall come it will not be a great army even in summer a large force could scarcely traverse the passes it is not on the force that he will take from here that dost mahomed relies it is on the host he will gather round him when he crosses the mountains we have learned that the disaffection to soojah is everywhere on the increase there were many who did not love the barukzyes but they know now that things are worse instead of better since the change for the man has made himself hated by his arrogance his contempt for the people in general and the extortion exercised by his taxgatherers there is no secret in all this your own officers must know it what you will not learn for the decision will not be made until the spring is the line by which the ameer will advance there are many passes by which he may then cross or he may go round by herat and gather forces as he advances or again he might go east and crossing by the passes there come down through chitral to jellalabad that i can well understand khan of course i have already learned that there is no doubt that dost mahomed is preparing to cross the passes in the spring and that he is sure of the support of the tribesmen on this side of the mountains he could gather a very large army if he chose sadut said but the difficulty of transporting food for so large a body would be very great i think that ten thousand men will be the utmost he could move with i am doing no harm in telling you this because you would soon learn it in the town and it is certain that your people could not prevent his passing the hindoo koosh since he has so many routes to choose from his force is not like your army which moving with great trains of baggage cannon and ammunition could only cross by one or two passes we can move wherever our horses can climb and now i will leave you for i have some business to attend to but i will return this evening chapter xii troubles thicken angus saw that as he could not hope to obtain further information however long he might stay and as he had fulfilled the main object of his mission by discovering that dost mahomed would not be content with remaining master of the northern province but would certainly advance in the spring he could do no good by remaining any longer the information that he could give would enable macnaghten and burnes to show the indian government that their intention of withdrawing more troops in the early spring would be disastrous and it was with this special object in view that he had been sent he had on the two previous days sold a portion of his goods but had held out for the prices with which they were marked he was now more willing to bargain as he wished to travel in future as lightly as possible accordingly before nightfall he had disposed of nearly half the stock with which he had started but he had at the same time purchased a certain amount of goods from turkestan as these would be more appropriate as merchandise when he started from balkh for herat sadut came again in the evening my friend he said i have been thinking over your position doubtless you might stay here for some time without its being suspected that you were other than you seemed to be but a chance word from one of your men might betray you and as you have really learned all that there is to learn it seems to me that there is no use in your tarrying any longer here it is true that dost mahomed for my sake would protect you even were you discovered still you know the nature of our people and were it rumoured that you were an infidel you might be torn to pieces before either the ameer or myself knew aught about it i have come to the same conclusion if i thought i could gain anything by remaining i should do so whatever the risk but as it would be useless to stay i intend to leave tomorrow i have a long journey to make via herat the sooner i am off the better my men are now packing up my goods and preparing for a start at daylight i felt so sure that this would be your course that i have brought with me an order from the ameer to the governor and headmen of all towns and villages through which you may pass enjoining them to give you good treatment as he holds you in high esteem for having rendered most valuable services to me i thank you very heartily angus replied this will greatly facilitate my journey and save me from all small annoyances i trust that we shall meet again i hope so indeed never shall i forget the debt of gratitude that i owe you perhaps some day i may be able to repay that debt to a small extent remember that in case of need you may rely upon me to the utmost at any rate you must not refuse to accept this it is a present from dost mahomed not to an english officer but to a persian merchant who has saved the life of his sisters son he talks continually while with me of the nobility of your action and when i told him that you were going he had his turban brought and took out this gem which was its chief ornament and bade me hand it you in remembrance of the deed i told him you had said that you would receive no present for a simple act of humanity more i could not tell him without revealing your secret though i know that it would be safe with him you cannot refuse to take this as for myself i am here an exile far away from my own people and have but this to give you as a token of my love it is my signet ring if you send it to me i will go through fire and water to come to you my tribesmen will all recognize it and will do anything in their power for its possessor angus saw that offered as it was he should greatly hurt the afghans feelings if he refused the immense ruby surrounded by diamonds that dost mahomed had sent him i will not refuse the gift of the ameer so given to me and shall cherish it as my most valued possession and the gift of a man whom i for one and i may say most british officers consider to be very badly treated by us i know from sir alexander burnes that dost mahomed was most anxious for our alliance shah soojah is as unpopular among us as among his own people of course as soldiers it is not our business to concern ourselves with politics that is a matter for the government only still we cannot but have our feelings and i am sure that should the fortune of war ever place dost mahomed in our hands he would receive honourable treatment your gift i shall prize as highly as a token of our warm friendship and trust that the time may never come when i have to put its virtue to the test though i well know that i could in necessity rely upon any help that you might be able to give me after talking for some time of the best route to follow sadut khan took an affectionate leave and angus started the next morning with his party before setting out he bestowed handsome gifts upon hassan and his followers whom he had learned to like greatly for the devotion they had shown to sadut and the energy and courage with which they had worked during the journey travelling from twenty to fiveandtwenty miles a day with occasional halts he reached cabul after two months of travel his journey had been greatly facilitated by the order that he carried from dost mahomed he had not entered herat as it was probable that he would be recognized there avoiding the city he travelled by the same route as before to girishk and then took a road running a few miles north of candahar and falling into the main road at kelatighilzye his first step was to see sir alexander burnes and to report to him that assuredly dost mahomed would come south with a considerable force as soon as the passes were opened his following would not itself be very formidable but he relied upon being joined by all the tribesmen south of the hills your news is most opportune the agent said and can hardly fail to induce the governorgeneral to alter his determination to withdraw the greater part of our force in the spring already we have not a man too many for contingencies that may arise now tell me about your journey the winter set in so severely directly you left us that i have been seriously uneasy about you i had only one message from mackenzie after you had left it was brought by a native and he told me that you had passed through but that the weather had changed for the worse the day after you started and the universal opinion among the natives was that you and your party had perished angus gave an account of his journey he had thought over the question whether it would be wise to mention the episode of the wounded afghan but he concluded that it would be better to do so as mackenzie when he rejoined the force might casually mention that he had a sick man with him and he therefore told the whole story as it happened i admire your humanity mr campbell though it seems almost quixotic to burden yourself with a wounded man but as you say it was evident that if you could manage to carry him through he might be of great service to you undoubtedly he would have been a valuable prisoner to have in our hands but his gratitude to you may prove valuable to us for the momunds are a powerful tribe and your conduct to him cannot but have inspired him with a better feeling towards us than he has hitherto shown he may have less animosity sir but i fear that he will still be found fighting against us on the way he spoke many times of his determination to continue the struggle until afghanistan was free from the infidel i am convinced that his indignation at the treatment of dost mahomed and his fanaticism are so strong that no private matter is likely to shake them the winter passed quietly and the attention of burnes and macnaghten was turned rather towards the frontier than to the state of things round cabul yar mahomed virtual ruler of herat although he was receiving large sums of money from us was known to be intriguing with persia and trying to form an alliance with the shah to expel the british from afghanistan russia had sent an expedition against khiva and the conquest of this little state would bring her more closely to the frontier of afghanistan dost mahomed however had gone on a visit to the ameer of bokhara and had been detained for the present by that treacherous ruler thus for a time the prospect of an invasion on his part was greatly diminished in the spring macnaghten and shah soojah returned to cabul the former continued to ignore the warnings of sir a burnes as to the evergrowing hostility of the afghans to the british and the man they had forced upon them his advice and that of burnes had been so far followed that the force at cabul had not been diminished but not content with this macnaghten continued to urge on the indian government the necessity of sending a great force to occupy herat and another to cross the mountains and thwart the projects of the russians by carrying our arms into bokhara moreover he was continually applying for money to meet the expenses of shah soojahs government as if the drain that these demands would entail upon the indian treasury and upon the indian army were not sufficient he insisted upon the necessity of conquering the punjaub where since the death of runjeet sing the attitude of the population had been increasingly hostile it is difficult to understand how any perfectly sane man could have made such propositions it would have needed the whole army of india to carry them out to say nothing of an enormous outlay of money although the governorgeneral and his council firmly declined to enter upon the wild schemes proposed to them macnaghten did not cease to send them lengthy communications urging the absolute necessity of his advice being followed as the summer came on there were everywhere signs of unrest in april the ghilzyes cut the communications near candahar but were defeated by a small body of troops sent from that city the beloochees whose country had been annexed were bitterly hostile and convoys were cut off candahar was invested by them quettah besieged and khelat captured with the exception of macnaghten himself there was scarcely an officer in the army but was conscious of the tempest that was gathering round them shah soojah was as unpopular among them as among the native population macnaghten was almost as unpopular as the shah everyone knew that it was his influence that had first induced lord auckland to enter upon this war and the levity with which he replied to every warning and the manner in which he deferred to shah soojah in every respect and allowed him to drive the tribesmen to despair by the greed of the taxgatherers incensed the officers of the army to the utmost in the spring the little garrison of bamian were on the point of being reinforced by a sepoy battalion when dr lord who had been sent as political officer received information that led him to believe that jubbar khan one of dost mahomeds brothers who was in charge of dosts family at khooloom was ready to come in one of his sons had already done so and lord thought that by sending forward a force to the fortress of badjah he would quicken jubbar khans movements it had the desired effect and jubbar khan came into bamian bringing with him dost mahomeds family and a large party of retainers this however in no way improved the position of the little party at badjah for the natives in the vicinity exhibited the greatest hostility the officer in command sent a detachment under sergeant douglas to escort another officer to badjah the party was however attacked and although they made a gallant resistance they would have been destroyed had not two companies of ghoorkas arrived on the spot and beat off the enemy in august the startling news arrived that dost mahomed had escaped from bokhara he was received with open arms by the governor of khooloom and a large force speedily gathered round him early in september he advanced upon bamian with eight thousand men badjah was attacked and although the ghoorka regiment kept back the assailants it was evident that so advanced a post could not be held and the force retreated leaving all their baggage behind them a regiment of afghan infantry had been raised and were stationed at bamian but on hearing of dost mahomeds approach they deserted to a man most of them joining the enemy even macnaghten could no longer shut his eyes to the serious nature of the position cabul was full of sikh emissaries who were stirring up the population to revolt promising them that the sikh nation would join in driving out the infidel reinforcements under colonel dennie reached bamian on the th of september and on the th dost mahomed with his army approached the place ignorant that the whole force was upon him dennie sent mackenzie with two guns and four companies of native infantry and some four hundred afghan horse and himself followed with four more companies in support on joining the advanced party he found that the whole of dost mahomeds force was in front of him in spite of the enormous disparity of numbers he determined to attack a wise resolution for although in our indian wars the natives often fought bravely when they attacked us they seldom offered a vigorous opposition when we took the offensive mackenzies two guns opened fire with shrapnel which had a terrible effect upon the dense masses of the enemy these were unable to withstand the fire and soon began to fall back mackenzie followed them and again opened fire before long dost mahomeds levies broke and fled and dennie launched the afghan horsemen in pursuit these cut down great numbers of the enemy and dispersed them in all directions the effect of this signal defeat was at once apparent the governor of khooloom entered into negotiations without delay and pledged himself not to harbour or assist dost mahomed the country south of khooloom was divided he taking half while the southern portion came under the authority of shah soojah the victory caused great satisfaction in cabul but this feeling was shortlived dost mahomed after his defeat went to kohistan where there was great discontent among the chiefs some of whom were already in revolt general sale sent a force from jellalabad which attacked a fortified position held by them but the assault was repulsed with heavy loss it was about to be renewed when the kohistanees evacuated the fort and fled the fact however that our troops had met with a repulse had a great effect upon the minds of the natives for the first time the afghans had successfully withstood an attack by british soldiers throughout the month of october dost mahomed was busy and at one time approached within forty miles of cabul when guns were hastily mounted on the citadel to overawe the town and orders sent to the force at bamian to return at once dost however moved no nearer sir robert sale was pursuing him and it was not until the th that he moved down again towards cabul and on the th the greater part of the force there marched out to give him battle on the nd of november the two armies came face to face in the valley of purwandurrah the ameer at once moved from the village to the neighbouring heights and the british cavalry galloped to outflank the afghan horse these were comparatively few in number but headed by dost mahomed himself they advanced steadily to meet the indian cavalry gallantly as indian troops have fought on numberless fields on this occasion they disgraced themselves utterly turning rein as the afghans approached they galloped away in headlong flight pursued by the afghans until within range of the british guns their officers in vain attempted to arrest their flight charging alone into the midst of the enemy two of them were killed when surrounded by enemies dr lord was shot and the other two cut their way through their assailants and reached the british line covered with wounds no more disgraceful affair has taken place in the story of our wars in india than this rout of indian cavalry by a third of their number of wild horsemen but even yet the affair might have been retrieved had an officer like dennie been in command had the guns opened and the infantry advanced it might still have been a repetition of the victory of bamian but sir a burnes was in authority and easily discouraged as was his nature he gave no orders but sent off word to macnaghten that there was nothing for it but to fall back to cabul suddenly however the position was changed by dost mahomed himself as he rode back after the victorious charge he thought over his position his imprisonment at bokhara had not broken his spirit but it had affected him by showing him that the mohammedans of central asia could not be trusted to work together or to unite to beat back the everadvancing wave of infidel aggression by the british on the south and the russians on the west but more than this the defection of his brother at khooloom and the surrender by him of his family had convinced him that it would be vain for him to continue to struggle to regain the throne that he had lost the kohistanees had risen before he joined them and he had the satisfaction of showing that his bravery was in no way shaken by his misfortune and of gaining a success of a most striking description now at least he could lay down his sword with honour accordingly without telling anyone of his intention he rode off the field with a single attendant and on the following day reached cabul and rode to the british embassy as he approached it he saw macnaghten returning from his evening ride his attendant galloped forward and asked if the gentleman was the british envoy and on macnaghten saying that he was so he then returned to his master and dost mahomed riding forward dismounted saluted the envoy and handed him his sword saying that he had come to surrender and to place himself under his protection macnaghten returned it to him and told him to remount and they rode together into the residency dost mahomed asking eagerly for news of his family of whom he had not heard since their surrender being assured that they were well and were honourably treated he was greatly relieved a tent was pitched for him and he wrote at once to his son begging him to follow his example he conversed freely with macnaghten gave him the history of his wanderings and adventures and assured him that there was no occasion to place a guard over him as his mind had quite been made up before he came in and nothing short of force would compel him to leave his only anxiety was that he should not be sent to england and on macnaghten assuring him that this would not be the case and that an ample maintenance would be assigned to him in india he became perfectly contented and calm as a result of his letter three days later his eldest son mahomed afzul came into camp and surrendered dost remained two days at cabul where he was visited by many of the british officers all of whom were impressed most strongly by him comparing him very favourably with the man for whom we had dethroned him macnaghten wrote most warmly in his favour to the governorgeneral urging that he should be received with honour and a handsome pension assigned to him he was sent down to india with a strong escort where he was kindly received by the viceroy who settled upon him a pension of two lacs of rupees equivalent to unfortunately just at the time that the exameer returned to cabul a european regiment a battery of horse artillery and a regiment of native infantry were recalled to india and with them went sir willoughby cotton and the command for the time being remained in the hands of sir robert sale angus campbell had not accompanied sir a burnes when he left cabul with the force which marched out to encounter dost mahomed but had been left in charge of the office at cabul he was now his chiefs first civil assistant his temporary appointment to the civil service having been approved and confirmed by the court of directors at home in consequence of the very warm report in his favour sent by eldred pottinger and mr mneill sir a burnes too had in his letters spoken several times of his energy and usefulness and on his return from his expedition through the passes both burnes and macnaghten had reported most highly both of his volunteering to undertake so dangerous a mission and of the manner in which he had carried it out in return the directors had sent out an order for his promotion to a higher grade and had ordered that a present of should be given him in token of their recognition of his conduct your foot is well on the ladder now sir a burnes had said on acquainting him with the decision of the board you will now have your name on their books as one of the most promising of the younger officers of the company and you may be sure that they will keep their eye upon you macnaghten will shortly return to england and i have long been promised the succession to his post i shall certainly request and no doubt my wishes will be acceded to in such a matter that you should hold the position of my chief assistant as such you will have many opportunities of doing good service as you will naturally proceed on missions to the chiefs of neighbouring peoples and will so qualify yourself for some important post in the future macnaghten indeed was extremely anxious to leave bodily and mentally he had suffered from the strain and anxiety he had been promised a high post in india probably the succession to the governorship of bombay but it was considered advisable that he should remain at his present post till the country was more settled the winter passed quietly with the submission of dost mahomed and his sons there was now no rival to shah soojah no head round whom those discontented with the ameers rule could rally he was the less unwilling to remain as he thought that an era of peace had now begun and that his anxieties were at an end he was soon however undeceived on shah soojahs first arrival in india he had naturally looked to the dooranees for aid against the barukzyes who had so long oppressed them and had made many promises of remission of taxation as an incentive to their zeal these promises had so far been kept that no taxes whatever had been exacted from the dooranees but in view of the absolute necessity of raising an income for the expenses of the government and for the personal expenditure of the ameer and his favourites it became necessary that all should contribute to some extent to the revenue although this tax was but a tithe of that which they had paid under barukzye rule the dooranees of the district of the northwest of candahar rose in rebellion and general nott marched out from that city and defeated them in a pitched battle for a time the movement was crushed but the discontent remained this was rendered more formidable by the fact that the heratees had taken up so offensive an attitude that our mission there had been withdrawn and proofs were obtained that its ruler was fomenting the discontent in the western province and was encouraging the disaffected by promising them assistance in may more serious trouble arose this time with the ghilzyes it had been determined to restore the dismantled fort of kelatighilzye the tribesmen viewed the work with hostility and assembled in larger numbers and nott sent a force against them under colonel winder with four hundred british troops a sepoy battalion a battery of horse artillery and a small body of cavalry the ghilzyes advanced to the attack in great force the battle was long and desperate but the volleys of grape from the guns and the steady fire from the infantry at last turned the scale and after five hours fighting the ghilzyes retired the dooranees were again in arms and three thousand men were assembled under their chief at girishk a small force under colonel woodburn marched out against them and defeated them but having no cavalry on which he could rely he could not prevent the rebels from retiring in fair order major rawlinson the political officer at candahar again warned macnaghten that the situation in western afghanistan was extremely threatening but was answered that this was an unwarrantable view of our position and that there were enough difficulties and enough of croakers without adding to the number needlessly but rawlinson was perfectly right and macnaghten was living in a fools paradise the defeated chief of the dooranees was joined by another and in august a force of eight hundred cavalry of whom some were regulars three hundred and fifty infantry and four guns under captain griffin met the insurgents they were strongly posted in a succession of walled gardens and small forts but the fire of the guns and infantry drove them from the enclosure and the cavalry then charged them with great effect and scattered them in all directions another defeat was inflicted upon the ghilzyes in the same month for the moment all was quiet again the only drawback to macnaghtens satisfaction was that akbar khan dost mahomeds favourite son was still in the north and was reported to be gathering troops somewhere near khooloom in september macnaghten received news of his appointment to the governorship of bombay and began his preparations for leaving cabul and burnes looked forward to receiving at last the appointment for which he had so long waited his position had been in every respect irksome his views differed from those of macnaghten he saw the dangers of the position which macnaghten refused to recognize the reports he addressed to the envoy were generally returned with a few lines in pencil of contemptuous dissent but he believed that with power to act in his hands he should be able to remedy the blunders that had been made and to restore peace and contentment in afghanistan the troops were now commanded by general elphinstone who had succeeded cotton he was a brave old officer but almost incapacitated by infirmities he obtained the post simply as senior officer and was wholly unfitted for command in such a critical time and in such a position probably had it not been for the assurances of macnaghten that all was going on well and that the trifling risings had been crushed without difficulty lord auckland would have yielded to the opinion of his military advisers and appointed general nott had he done so the greatest disaster that ever fell upon the british army might have been avoided nothing could be worse than the position in which the british camp and mission were established they were on low ground commanded on every side by hills and surrounded by forts and villages they were nearly a mile in extent defended only by so contemptible a ditch and rampart that an english officer for a bet rode a pony across them the commissariat compound was near the cantonment and occupied an extensive space with the buildings and huts for the officers it too had a rampart but this was even less formidable than that which surrounded the camp things had now settled down many of the officers had sent for their wives and children and lady macnaghten lady sale and others were established in comfortable houses the climate was exhilarating the officers amused themselves with cricket horseracing fishing and shooting and lived as if they had been at a hill station in india instead of in a mountainous country surrounded by bitter foes october came in quietly though pottinger who was now in kohistan sent unfavourable reports of things there but these were as usual poohpoohed by macnaghten the latters troubles with the indian government however continued unabated the expenses of the occupation of afghanistan amounting to a million and a quarter a year were a terrible drain upon the revenues of india and it had become necessary to raise a loan to meet the outlay and the question of a withdrawal from afghanistan was being seriously discussed none of the good results that had been looked for had been achieved nor did it appear likely that the situation would improve for it was evident to all unbiassed observers that the ameer was upheld solely by british bayonets and that when these were withdrawn the whole fabric we had built up at so enormous an expense would collapse the uneasiness of the indian government was increased by the fact that a change of ministry was imminent at home and that the conservatives who had always opposed the invasion of afghanistan would at once take steps for the withdrawal of the troops from the country and the investigation which would be made into the whole affair would create intense dissatisfaction in england and lead to the recall of the indian politicians responsible for it the news stirred macnaghten to fury but he saw that it was necessary to make retrenchments and accordingly he largely cut down the subsidies paid to the chiefs the consequence was that the leaders of the whole of the powerful tribes including those round cabul the kohistanees ghilzyes and momunds at once entered into a hostile federation against the british sales brigade that was about to start on its way to india was ordered to attack the ghilzyes at jellalabad and on the th colonel monteith was sent with a sepoy regiment a squadron of cavalry and a party of sappers and miners to keep the passes clear the force was however attacked at the first haltingplace and sir robert sale marched with the th regiment to clear the pass from his end joined by monteiths force he succeeded in driving the natives from their heights the sepoys and the british soldiers vying with each other in climbing the almost inaccessible crags the th retired down the valley and monteith encamped in the khoord cabul pass he was attacked at night the enemy being aided by the treachery of the afghan horsemen who admitted them within their lines they were however beaten off and monteith was joined by sale on the following day negotiations were then opened with the ghilzyes terms were made but broken by the treacherous tribesmen a few hours after they had been signed on his way back to jellalabad sale was attacked more than once in great force and with difficulty cut his way down macnaghten who had determined to leave on the st of october but had postponed his departure for a short time wrote on that day that he hoped the business just reported was the expiring effort of the rebels angus had remained with burnes at cabul the latter was much depressed by the occurrences that had taken place he had greatly disapproved of macnaghtens wholesale cutting down of the subsidies of the chiefs how unfortunate am i he said many times to angus had macnaghten gone but two months earlier this would never have happened it has been money alone that has kept the tribesmen quiet and the very worst form of retrenchment has been chosen had he gone i should have acted in a very different way in the first place i should have told the ameer frankly that the troubles were solely caused by the rapacity of the men he had appointed to receive the taxes these must be dismissed and honest and faithful ones appointed in their place it is the abominable tyranny with which the taxesof which i believe but a small portion ever get into the treasuryare collected that has brought about the trouble with proper administration the revenue could be doubled and the taxation would press much more lightly upon the people than it does at present now the evil is done and i shall have to take over the administration when everything points to a terrible catastrophe with which my name will ever be associated chapter xiii the murder of sir a burnes october passed quietly and macnaghten arranged to leave on the nd of november burnes had received several warnings as to the formidable nature of the confederacy of the chiefs mohun lal the principal moonshee who had been down to sales camp told him that if the conspiracy was not crushed in its infancy it would become too strong to be suppressed burnes replied that he had no power at present but that as soon as macnaghten left he would conciliate the chiefs by raising their allowances to the former point on the st of november mohun lal again expressed his opinion of the danger burnes replied that he feared the time was coming when the british would have to leave the country he was in one of his moods of depression but from this he recovered in the evening and congratulated macnaghten upon leaving when everything was quiet at the very time he was speaking the hostile chiefs were assembled together and were discussing the methods that were to be taken to overthrow the british power they determined that the first step was to forge a document in the ameers name ordering all the people to rise and at the same time to spread a report that it was the intention to seize all the principal chiefs and send them prisoners to england it was singular that they should not have waited a few days for the indian government had sent peremptory orders that the whole force at cabul with the exception of a single brigade should return with macnaghten to india the chiefs decided that as a first step a tumult should arise in the city and this they at once set about exciting they had no idea that it would succeed and none of them ventured to take any part in it as it was only intended to excite the passions of the rabble of the city early the next morning a friendly afghan brought burnes news that the residency was about to be attacked he did not believe the intelligence as the city had of late been as quiet as usual but on sending out some of his servants into the street they reported that there was certainly an unusual stir and excitement he wrote to macnaghten saying so but stating that he did not think the matter at all serious although at the same time he requested that a military guard should be sent to him in order to overawe any disaffected persons angus had gone out early with azim the latter had for some days past spent his time in the city and each evening had returned with the rumours he had gathered the talk in the lower quarters was all of the understanding at which the chiefs had arrived and the general opinion was that in a few days these would pour down with all their forces and annihilate the infidels angus himself noticed the sullen expression on the faces of the lower class and the manner in which they scowled at him as he passed and quite agreed with his follower that the troubles he had long foreseen were about to come to a head when in the streets too he had an uneasy consciousness that he was being followed several times he turned sharply round but in the throng of natives in the streets he could recognize no face that he knew this morning the feeling was particularly strong although as he had often done before he assured himself that it was pure fancy on his part i am not conscious of feeling nervous he said to azim but i must be getting so it has been a very anxious time all the year and i suppose that without my knowing it it must have told upon me however i will turn down this quiet street and if anyone is following us we shall certainly detect him a hundred yards down another lane crossed the one he had taken azim had looked several times but no one else turned down the lane which was entirely deserted as they passed the corner of the next lane some men suddenly sprang upon them cloths were thrown over their heads and in spite of their struggles they were lifted up and carried along rapidly in a couple of minutes they stopped angus heard a door open they were borne along what he thought was a passage thrust into a room and a door was slammed to and locked behind them they tore off their mufflers and looked around it was a room of no great size with stronglybarred windows there were cushions on a divan that ran along one side on a low table in the middle of the room were two cold chickens a pile of fruit a large jar of water and two bottles of native wine what on earth does this mean angus said and why have we been carried off azim did not attempt to reply we are prisoners that is certain angus went on but it would certainly look as if they meant to make us comfortable and the room must have been prepared in readiness for our reception i see no hope of getting away the windows are very strongly barred and he continued as he walked across and looked out this little yard is surrounded by houses without windows on the ground floor and with no door that i can see i suppose there is one below us anyhow if we could get through these bars we should be no nearer liberty for at best we could only reenter the house and possibly the door is fastened on the inside there are certainly men in the house i heard voices in the passage just now and no doubt one of the fellows is stationed there the only reason i can imagine for their carrying us off is that we are to be kept as hostages of course i am known to be burness chief civilian assistant and they might think that if i were in their hands he would be willing to make some concessions to get me back again it is of no use worrying over it we are not so badly off as we were in that snowstorm in the pass the best thing we can do for the present is to make a meal for we did not take anything before we started illustration as they passed the corner some men sprang on them they had just finished their breakfast when the sound of musketry was plainly heard there is fighting going on angus exclaimed what can it mean there are no troops in the city except the native guards at our house and the treasury next door it is either a fight between two factions in the city or they are attacking our place it is maddening being fastened up here just at this moment the news brought by that afghan this morning that we were to be attacked must be true though sir alexander altogether disbelieved it he was in one of his happiest humours this morning as today he was to obtain the goal of his hopes and to be the resident political officer with all power in his hands when he is in that mood he disbelieves all unpleasant tidings while in his fits of depression he gives credit to every rumour that reaches his ear still the house should be able to hold out against a mob until help arrives from the camp but whether or not my place should be by his side whatever comes of it if there is really a rising in the town sir we are certainly safer here than we should be in the streets or even in the house that may be angus said impatiently but my duty is to be there he paced restlessly up and down the room presently azim said i cant think how the men who seized us knew that we were coming along it was quite by chance that you turned down the lane they must have been close to us when we did so angus said and must at once have run round by another lane and posted themselves at the corner where we were seized we were not walking fast and there would have been time for them to get there before us if they had run but why should they have taken this trouble and why should they have prepared this place beforehand for our reception it beats me altogether after the firing had continued for a few minutes it ceased then they could hear a confused roar of shouting good heavens angus exclaimed they must have taken the house the troops cannot have arrived in time or we should have heard sharp volleys this is maddening well sir azim said philosophically if we had not been carried off we should have been in the house when they attacked it and should have shared the fate of the others whatever it may be that is true enough angus agreed still i ought to have been there ah he broke off suddenly they have not taken either your sword or mine or my pistolsfor although not in military uniform the civilians generally carried swords a necessary precaution when the whole native population always went about armed and angus in addition carried pistols also concealed in his dress it is extraordinary that they should not have disarmed us i do not think that they intended to do us harm azim said they could have cut our throats had they chosen to do so when they brought us here without fear of discovery why should they leave us our swords and provide a good meal for us if they intended to murder us afterwards that is so azim and it makes the affair more incomprehensible i tried to get at my pistols as they carried me along but they held my arms too tightly for me to do so it seems to me possible that this is the work of someone who was aware of the intended attack and who doubted whether the troops would not enter the city and slaughter many of the inhabitants and so thought that by producing us at the right moment he would not only clear himself from any charge of taking part in the affair but would earn a reward for having saved our lives i certainly have no friend in the city who would be likely to seize me for any other object of course i was in communication with most of the important persons here but it has been simply in an official way whoever it is must have been watching you for some days master if as you thought he has been following you whenever you went out i can have no doubt on that subject now azim and angus sat thinking for some time i think he said suddenly it must be sadut khan if so we are safe we know that he was with the ameer and rode with him when he defeated our cavalry and it has been reported that he has since returned to his tribe though we have no certain information about it it is possible that knowing we were about to be attacked by the whole force of the tribesmen he has borne his promise in mind and has employed men to watch me and take steps if necessary to secure my safety that certainly would explain what before it seemed impossible to understand the noise in the town still continued at one time there was sound of heavy musketry firing the troops have entered the city angus exclaimed there will be hard fighting for in the narrow streets an armed mob can offer a desperate resistance even to the best troops but in the end they will put down this tumult and if sir alexander has been murdered exact a heavy penalty for his death in half an hour the firing gradually abated and the musket shots came more faintly through the air our men are falling back azim there can be little doubt about that by the sound there cannot be any great number of troops engaged what on earth can macnaghten and elphinstone be doing the roar of shouting in the streets became louder and there was an occasional sound of firearms it is quite evident that the mob are in entire possession of the city azim they are looting the traders quarter and probably murdering all the whites who have taken up their residence there these fears were fully justified the houses of sir alexander burnes and captain johnson the paymaster of the ameers troops adjoined each other johnson had fortunately for himself slept that night in the camp sir alexander had with him his brother lieutenant burnes and lieutenant broadfoot his military secretary who had just arrived curiously enough it was the anniversary of the disastrous fight at purwandurrah in which fight broadfoots eldest brother had been killed soon after angus had gone out the ameers minister arrived and repeated the warning already given by the friendly afghan burnes could no longer doubt that there was danger but he refused to leave his house saying that as soon as the news that there was a tumult reached the camp the troops would be at once despatched to put it down he however wrote urgently to macnaghten for support and sent messengers to the most powerful native chief in the town begging him to calm the people and assure them that all grievances should be redressed one of the messengers was killed on the way the other managed to return to the house desperately wounded the gathering in the street increased every moment burnes with the two officers went out on to a balcony and from thence harangued the mob his voice was drowned by yells and curses weapons were brandished and an attack was made on the doors of both houses part of the mob were fanatics who thought only of slaying the infidels but a still larger party were animated solely by a desire to share in the sack of the ameers treasury next door the native guards both of sir alexander and the treasury opened fire and for a time maintained themselves with the greatest bravery of the english officers broadfoot was the first to fall shot through the heart the position became more and more desperate a party of the insurgents had set fire to the stables and forced their way into the garden burnes was still attempting to lull the fury of the crowd long ere this troops should have arrived to his rescue but there were no signs that they were approaching at last seeing that all was lost he disguised himself and went out into the garden with a man who had sworn by the koran to convey him and his brother safely into camp no sooner however did they issue out than the traitor shouted this is burnes the mob rushed upon the brothers and hewed them to pieces the defenders of the two houses fought bravely to the last but were finally slaughtered to a man sir alexander burnes owed his death to the faults of others rather than his own having been previously at cabul as the british agent and speaking the language perfectly it was to him the people made their complaints to him they looked for redress they knew nothing of macnaghten when they found their condition growing from bad to worse their taxes increasing their trade at a standstill food extremely dear and employment wanting it was on burnes that they laid the blame and yet he was all the time endeavouring but in vain to persuade macnaghten that it was absolutely necessary to compel the ameer to abandon a course that was exasperating for people of all classes from the most powerful chiefs to the poorest inhabitants of the city burnes was unquestionably a man of great ability and had he been in macnaghtens place with full power and responsibility things would probably have turned out differently the expedition from the first was a gigantic blunder undertaken in the teeth of his remonstrances in any case it was doomed to failure it was impossible that we could maintain on the throne a man hated by the whole of his subjectsa race of fighting men jealous to the last degree of their independence and able to take full advantage of the natural strength of the country but under the administration of an officer at once firm and resolute and anxious to conciliate them in every way the british force might have remained until the indian government could no longer support the expense of the occupation and could then have withdrawn quietly with the puppet who had proved himself so utterly incapable of conciliating the people upon whom we had thrust him the great fault in the character of burnes was instabilityhis alternate fits of sanguine hopefulness and deep depression and his readiness to believe what suited his mood of the moment these characteristics were no doubt heightened by the unfortunate position in which he found himself he had had every reason to expect that in view of his previous residence in cabul and his knowledge of the character of the people he would have the post of political officer of the afghan capital and he only accepted a secondary position upon the understanding that macnaghtens appointment was a temporary one and that he would succeed him when however months and years elapsed and he was still without any recognized position whatever when his advice was never adopted and his opinions contemptuously set aside by a man infinitely his inferior he naturally came to take the worst view of things and his fits of depression became more frequent at last he fell not because his house was isolated for it could have held out until aid had come but because the three men whose duty it was to rescue himmacnaghten the ameer and elphinstonewere alike vacillating undetermined and incompetent the ameer was the only one of these three to take any steps when he heard of the riot he sent down a regiment of hindoostanee troops to rescue burnes instead however of marching outside the town to the end of the street in which burness house was situated they entered the city by the nearest gate and tried to make their way through a maze of narrow lanes their advance was desperately opposed from every house and roof a fire of musketry was kept up and after losing two hundred of their number they fled in utter confusion to the shelter of the citadel elphinstone in his report says that he received the news at halfpast seven that the town was in a ferment and shortly after the envoy came and told him that it was in a state of insurrection but that he did not think much of it and expected the revolt would shortly subside macnaghten suggested that brigadier sheltons force should proceed to the bala hissar to operate as might seem expedient while the remaining force was concentrated in the cantonment and assistance if possible sent to sir alexander burnes it was not however until between nine and ten that shelton received his orders and almost directly afterwards another note arrived telling him not to move as the ameer had objected to this shelton replied that in an insurrection of the city there was no time for indecision and recommended the general at once to resolve upon what measures he would adopt he was then told to march immediately to the bala hissar where he would receive further instructions from macnaghten just as he was marching off a note came from this officer telling him to halt for further orders he sent an engineer to ask the reason for this order but the officer was cut down by an afghan while dismounting just outside the square where the ameer was sitting soon after this the military secretary himself came with orders for him to enter the citadel when he arrived there the ameer asked him who sent him and what he came there for and he was forbidden to enter the town all that he could do was to cover the retreat of the ameers hindoostanee troops in consequence of all these delays it was twelve oclock before shelton moved into the bala hissar by which time burnes and his friends had been murdered and the riot had spread houses were burned shops sacked and the families of several british officers massacred it is certain that had the slightest energy been shown and had a small body of troops been despatched when burness first request for help arrived the riot would have been nipped in the bud for all accounts agree that for a considerable time not more than three hundred men took part in the attack and even when shelton urged the necessity for prompt measures burnes might have been saved except in the case of the rising at meerut in the indian mutiny never did such disastrous effects result from the incompetence of a british general the day passed slowly to angus it was maddening to be helpless when great events were happening until it became quite dark no one came near them but at seven oclock they heard the bolt of the door withdrawn and a man entered with a torch by whose light they at once recognized hassan their guide over the passes you here hassan angus exclaimed i had always thought of you as back again in your tower near bamian is it you who has thus made us prisoners we were sorry to use force effendi but there was no other way sadut khan charged us to look after your safety and we have kept you in sight for some days he was living in this house in disguise he was absent yesterday evening to take part in the conference with the other chiefs and did not return until after midnight then he said there will be a tumult in the city tomorrow hassan and probably the house of the officer burnes will be attacked what will come of it i do not know i myself and the other chiefs are leaving at once so that if things go badly we can disavow any connection with the affair the young officer my friend is as you know at burness house he must be rescued prepare this room for him if he leaves the house before the attack begins you must seize him and carry him in here if his servant is with him bring him also he too must be saved he waited on me kindly and did all in his power for me if he should not leave the house then you and your followers must join the mob and keep together forcing yourselves to the front so that you will be the first to enter the house take long cloaks to throw round them and get them out even at the cost of your lives i told him that it should be done you saved his life and you also saved ours for we should have been suffocated in the snowstorm had you not cut your way out and come to our rescue so it has been done we were glad indeed when we saw you come out had you not turned down that lane i should have come up and accosted you and telling you that i had an important message to deliver to you should have asked you to come with me to a quiet spot where i might deliver it safely as it was directly you turned down we ran round and as you know captured you without noise and without being observed by you you will i trust pardon me for having laid hands on you but i had orders from the khan who told me that i should have to use force as he was sure you would not however great the danger he persuaded to leave burnes what has happened the englishman and two others with him have been killed one of the ameers regiments entered the town but was driven back there is looting going on everywhere many have been killed and many houses burnt but what is our army doing nothing there is a force at the bala hissar the rest are under arms in their camp it seems impossible angus exclaimed however he went on stifling his indignation for the time i have to thank you deeply hassan you and sadut khan for having saved our lives assuredly you took the only way to do so for had you only told me of the danger that threatened sir alexander burnes i should have returned to warn him and share his fate whatever it might be as it was i cannot blame myself that i was absent i thank you with all my heart pray tell the khan when you see him that i am deeply grateful to him he has nobly redeemed his promise and i hope some day to thank him in person now sahib we will start at once hassan said i have clothes for you to put over your own and there is no fear of our being suspected we will take you to within shot of your camp he called out and his four men entered bringing with them afghan disguises when these were put on they sallied out at once the five men were fully armed and long afghan guns were given to angus and azim the streets were full of people for the most part in a state of wild excitement though the better class looked grave at the prospect of the retribution that would probably fall upon the city perhaps tomorrow or certainly in a day or two none paid any attention to the group who differed in no respect from the majority of those around them issuing from one of the gates they made their way to the cantonments when within a few hundred yards the afghans stopped after a hearty farewell and renewed thanks angus and azim left them they had taken off their disguises and offered them to hassan to carry back but he said you had best keep them you may want them again there is no saying what may happen and they accordingly carried them with them in a short time they were challenged by a sentry and halted till the latter had called a sergeant and four men then they went forward angus was recognized at once as he was known by sight to everyone in the camp in a short time they met an officer who told them the news of the massacre of burnes his brother and broadfoot and their guard which was already known as one man had escaped the general slaughter and had after hiding for some hours come into the camp angus went at once to macnaghtens house and sent in his name the envoy came out into the hall i am glad to see that you have escaped mr campbell i thought that all had perished though your name is not specially mentioned as among the victims i was not in the house sir angus replied sir alexander burnes had sent me out to gather information and i and my servant were suddenly seized and carried into a house where we were kept as prisoners all day after it was dark we made our escape having obtained disguises from a friendly afghan well i am glad macnaghten said but you must excuse me now for the general is here and we are holding a council you had better for tonight take up your quarters in poor burness tent i shall have time to attend to matters tomorrow although burnes had his residence in the city he had a large tent not far from the envoys house this he occupied when he had business in camp and it was here that he received natives who brought him news or who had grievances that they wished to report to him here angus lay down for the night with a deep feeling of thankfulness that his life had been spared mingled with a foreboding that the troubles had only begun and that there was yet much peril in store before the army were safely out of afghanistan in the morning angus again went up to the envoys i have been thinking mr campbell macnaghten said when he entered as far as i have been able to think on any one subject how your services can be best utilized temporarily i think that if you would not mind you might be attached to the commissariat and assist captain boyd and captain johnson i will gladly do so sir angus said i will take up the work at once anticipating your consent i have already written a letter for you to take to those officers glad to have work before him angus went at once to the commissariat camp the two officers were at breakfast both rose and congratulated him heartily on his escape how on earth did you manage it he gave as brief an account as he had done to sir william macnaghten and then handed them the letter he had received from the envoy that is good news captain johnson said heartily we shall be glad indeed to have your aid i will have a tent pitched for you at once by the side of ours of course you have not breakfasted sit down with us what do you think of the state of affairs you know a good deal more than we do of the disposition of the afghan chiefs i think things look very bad angus said gravely after what seems to me the imbecility shown yesterday to which the death of my chief is due it is impossible to feel anything like confidence in the general that is the universal feeling in camp captain johnson said if we had sale here i believe everything would go right but poor elphinstone is only fit for a snug armchair in a comfortable club he is no more able to cope with a crisis like this than an old woman would be in fact for choice i would take the average old woman orders have been given for an attack upon the town today but it is more than likely that it will be countermanded if elphinstone can make up his mind to throw his whole force with the exception of a strong camp guard against the city we should certainly carry it no doubt there might be a considerable loss of life but that could not be helped it would certainly be successful then i should say we ought to turn the whole of the afghan population out of the town move all our provisions and stores there and settle down for the winter we could beat off any attack that the afghans could make against us as it is we are terribly anxious about the stores you know that i originally established all the magazines for the ameers army in the bala hissar then macnaghten came up with the ameer from jellalabad and he told me that the ameer objected to the magazines being there that was quite enough for macnaghten he always gives in to the ameers wishes however ridiculous so we had to leave the storehouses i had built and move out bag and baggage the only place that i could get was the camel sheds halfway between this and the town and unless a strong garrison is sent down there the afghans are certain to take possession of them but boyds stores are even more important they are within four hundred yards of the defences of the camp and contain all our grain our hospital stores our wine and beer our sugar and everything else and if his stores and mine are both lost we shall have starvation staring us in the face at the end of a week just look out over the plain since daylight there has been a steady stream of men from the hills and from all the villages round flocking into the city they have heard of the capture of my treasury and are eager to share in the looting if they succeed in capturing the stores and provisions god help us all chapter xiv a series of blunders numerous as had been the blunders and great the mismanagement up to the nd of november matters might yet have been retrieved had the conduct of affairs been in resolute and energetic hands macnaghten was personally a brave and fearless man had he at last felt the necessity for strong measures an attack upon the city would certainly have been attended with success now that the first burst of hate and passion had passed the inhabitants were filled with apprehension at the punishment that would fall upon them and none doubted that the british army would at once attack the town the army itself expected this and furious at the treacherous massacre of sir alexander burnes and his comrades were burning for the order to attack the troops were under arms early but no orders were issued for a forward movement some hours later the th regiment of native infantry with two mountain guns came in from khoord cabul having brushed aside the opposition it had met with on its march with this valuable addition to the fighting strength in the camp all opposition could have been easily overcome and yet until three oclock in the afternoon nothing whatever was done by this time what could have been effected with comparative ease in the early morning had become a far more difficult operation vast numbers of the tribesmen had been pouring into the city since daybreak and the two miles of plain between the camp and the city which earlier in the day could have been traversed without a shot being fired were now covered by a host of fierce enemies and yet after wasting so many valuable hours the general instead of throwing the whole of the force in the cantonments and that of brigadier shelton at the bala hissar against the city sent only three companies of infantry and two guns to the attack naturally this handful of men failed and it was well for them that they did not penetrate into the city for had they done so they would assuredly have been overwhelmed before they had gone fifty yards however the officer in command seeing the impossibility of the task set him withdrew his detachment in good order the result of the days operation if it could be so called was disastrous the troops who had until then been eager to be led against the enemy and confident of success were irritated and dispirited and lost all confidence in their commander while on the other hand the afghans were jubilant over what they considered the cowardice of the enemy the next day the misfortune invited by the passive attitude of our troops happened only eighty men were in charge of the commissariat fort the little party were commanded by lieutenant warren early in the day a threatening force of the enemy approached and warren sent a messenger urgently asking for reinforcements but the afghans had already occupied an old fort that commanded the road between the camp and the commissariat fort considering the enormous importance of the stores an overwhelming force should have been sent out to drive off the assailants and to occupy the fort in such strength that it could be held against any assault instead of doing this two companies only of the th regiment were sent the two captains in command were killed by the fire from the afghan fort other officers were wounded and the men fell so fast that the officer who was senior in command seeing the impossibility of reaching the store drew them off then an order was issuedwhich was practically the deathwarrant of the armyby general elphinstone for a party of cavalry to go out and bring in the little garrison this party suffered even more severely than the preceding one from every wall building and orchard a storm of musketry broke out and the troopers after suffering great loss again retired the news that the general intended to abandon the store struck dismay into the officers of the commissariat captain boyd hurried to headquarters and urged the general to send a force that would sweep away all opposition and to hold the fort at all hazards the general promised to send a reinforcement but no relief was sent as night was coming on captain boyd and captain johnson again went to the general and pointed out in the strongest language the result that would follow the abandonment of the stores the unhappy old man hesitated but on a letter being brought in from lieutenant warren saying that the enemy were mining the walls and some of the sepoys seeing their position was desperate were deserting he promised that a strong detachment should be sent at two oclock in the morning to storm the afghan fort and relieve the guard at the commissariat stores orders were accordingly issued but these were presently countermanded and it was decided that the force should not move until daylight by that time it was too late warren had repulsed an attack on the walls but seeing that the enemy were preparing to fire the gate and renew the attack he retired through a passage that had on the previous day been dug under the wall and reached the camp in safety but this was not the only disaster that happened that day captain johnsons store of provisions for the use of the ameers troops on the outskirts of the city was also attacked captain mackenzie who was in command of the little garrison there defended his post throughout the day with the greatest gallantry but water was scarce and ammunition failing and large numbers of women and children were in the fort with great quantities of baggage urgent letters were sent asking for reinforcements but no reinforcements came had they arrived the situation would have been saved the kuzzilbashes were ready to side with the british several of their commanders were with mackenzie but when they saw that no help was sent they refused to join a cause that seemed to them lost all night the fighting went on and all next day until his men were utterly worn out and the ammunition exhausted no more could be done and when night came on he moved out of the fort and fought his way to the cantonmentsa brilliant action which showed what could be accomplished by a mere handful of men well led while mackenzie was thus fighting for the stores under his charge the troops in the cantonments were condemned to see crowds of afghans looting the stores within four hundred yards of our camp carrying off the supplies that had been garnered for their subsistence through the winter and this without a man being set in motion or a gun brought to bear upon the plunderers furious at the imbecility of their leaders the soldiers clamoured to be led against the enemy unable to resist the demand the general ordered the th native infantry to move out but instead of being led straight against the enemy the officer in command hesitated and halted and soon fell back with the indignant sepoys general elphinstone was already talking of making terms with the enemy and seemed to despair of victory when no attempt had been made to gain a success on the th however a party of the th were again sent out under major griffiths again it was seen what could be done by an energetic officer the afghan fort was stormed the enemy were driven out and were routed by a party of horse who dashed at them gallantly the troops could be no longer restrained and cavalry infantry and artillery poured out but there was no general plan and the consequence was that although desultory fighting went on all day nothing was accomplished had any general plan of operation been laid down and a combined action fought the enemy would have been utterly unable to withstand our troops worked up to fury as these were by the disgraceful inaction that had been forced upon them in the meantime starvation would have already stared the troops in the face had not captains boyd and johnson aided by angus and other officers of their department gone out to the native villages and succeeded in purchasing a certain amount of grain but already the troops were on half rations and even these scanty supplies could not long be available the general while his troops were out fighting wrote to macnaghten urging that negotiations should be opened with the enemy and saying our case is not yet desperate but it is becoming so very fast macnaghten himself was conscious of this conscious that under such leading the situation was fast becoming desperate and he employed the moonshee mohun lal who was still in cabul under the protection of the kuzzilbash chief to endeavour to bribe the chiefs of the ghilzyes two lacs of rupees were offered the chiefs gave a favourable reply and then macnaghten with his usual instability was seized with a suspicion that they were not sincere and abruptly broke off the negotiations thereby mortally offending the ghilzye chiefs fresh danger was threatening in another direction mahomed akbar khan the second son of dost mahomed was on his way with a force from the north and had already advanced as far as bamian mohun lal suggested that an emissary should be sent to offer him a large allowance if he would join the british his suggestion was carried out and money was spent in other quarters lavishly but it was now too late a quarter of the sum would a fortnight earlier have sufficed to satisfy the demands of all the chiefs of the tribesmen now that success had encouraged the assailants of our force and the whole population had taken up arms against us inspired alike by fanaticism and hatred and thirsting for blood it was doubtful whether even the chiefs could restrain them had they chosen to do so in their letters and journals the officers still spoke with kindness and respect of their unfortunate general he had been a brave and able soldier but age and terrible infirmities had rendered him altogether incapacitated for action he had for months been suffering from gout and had almost lost the use of his limbs only once or twice after his arrival to assume the command had he been able to sit on horseback for the most part he was wholly unable to walk sometimes he was confined altogether to his couch at others he was able to be taken out in a palanquin his mind was also enfeebled by suffering on the very day of the first outbreak he had been a little better and had mounted his horse but he had suffered a very severe fall and was carried back to his quarters it was altogether inexcusable that lord auckland against the advice of the commanderinchief and the remonstrances of his other military advisers should have appointed such a man to a command which beyond all others in india demanded the greatest amount of energy and activity there were many men who might have been worthily selected men with a knowledge of the political conditions of afghanistan of the feelings of the people of their language and of their country general elphinstone knew nothing of these things and depended entirely upon the advice of others had he relied solely upon that of macnaghten things might have gone differently but he asked advice from all around him and took the last that was offered only to change his mind again when he heard the opinion of a fresh counsellor he was himself conscious that the position was too onerous for him and sent down a medical certificate of his incapacity for action and requested to be relieved the request had been granted and he was to have returned to india with macnaghten but unhappily no other officer had been appointed to succeed him it is upon lord auckland rather than upon the unfortunate officer who in the teeth of the advice of his counsellors and of all common sense was thrust into a position for which he was wholly unsuited that the blame of the catastrophe of cabul should be laid macnaghten in hopes that brigadier shelton a brave officer but hottempered and obstinate would be able to influence the general and to put an end to the deplorable indecision that paralysed the army persuaded elphinstone to send for him to come in from the bala hissar to the camp and bring in with him a regiment of the ameers troops he came into the cantonment of the th and his arrival was hailed with the greatest satisfaction as it was believed that at last something would be done unfortunately however sheltons energy and the generals weakness were as oil on water no two men were less calculated to pull together shelton enforced his arguments with a vehemence that seemed to the general insubordinate in the extreme while the brigadier on the other hand was unable to make allowance for the physical and mental weakness of the general and was maddened by the manner in which orders that had but an hour before been issued were countermanded on the morning of the th the enemy mustered in great force and occupying a small fort within musketshot of the defences opened a galling fire macnaghten only obtained the generals consent to a party going out to capture the fort by telling him that unless he gave the order he should himself take the responsibility of doing so for that at any risk the fort must be captured thereupon shelton was instructed to take two thousand men and attack it when they were on the point of starting elphinstone countermanded the orders shelton in a fury laid the case before the envoy who was as eager as himself and the general was again persuaded to give the order and the force advanced it was intended to blow open the gate with powder but by some accident only a wicket by the side of the main entrance was blown in led by colonel mackrell the storming party consisting of two companies of europeans and four of native infantry advanced they could with difficulty make their way through the narrow entrance for they were exposed as they did so to a heavy musketry fire but two officers and a few soldiers pushed through and the garrison believing that the whole column was following them fled through the opposite gate but unhappily they were not followed a body of afghan cavalry threatened to attack the storming party outside and these native and british alike were seized with an unaccountable panic and fled in vain their officers endeavoured to arrest their flight the events of the previous week had terribly demoralized them shelton set them a noble example by remaining on horseback alone and at last shamed them into returning again the afghan horse approached and again they fled again sheltons expostulations and example brought them back the guns in the cantonments drove the afghans off and shelton led his men up to the capture of the fort in the meantime the handful of men who had entered the fort had been engaged in a desperate struggle for life the afghans discovering how small was the number of their assailants reentered the fort and fell upon them in overwhelming numbers when sheltons force entered colonel mackrell had fallen mortally wounded and was carried into the cantonments to die lieutenant bird with two sepoys were the sole survivors they had when the enemy poured in taken possession of a stable and barricaded themselves there and had successfully repulsed every attack when they were rescued their ammunition was almost exhausted but they were uninjured and no fewer than thirty dead afghans lying in front of the stable bore mute testimony to the steadiness and accuracy of their aim several small forts were abandoned by the enemy and a quantity of grain was found in them but as no measures were taken to convey it into the camp it was lost again when the troops retired desultory fighting went on all the afternoon without any decisive results and the next two or three days passed quietly in the meantime the moonshee was making every effort to bring over some of the chiefs to our side macnaghten was sending off letter after letter to the political officer with sale urging the necessity for an instant advance of the force at jellalabad on the th the enemy occupied a hill within range of the cantonment and planting two guns there opened a steady fire macnaghten spent hours in endeavouring to persuade the general and brigadier of the absolute necessity for driving the enemy off the hill but without success and it was not until he took the responsibility upon himself that a detachment under shelton was ordered to be sent it was then four oclock in the afternoon the troops advanced in three columns and the infantry rushed forward with such impetuosity that the two guns with them could not arrive in time to herald their attack the detachment poured in a volley within ten yards distance but they were unsteady from their exertions in mounting the hill and their fire took no effect a minute later the afghan cavalry charged down upon them the attack was unexpected the men in confusion and the afghans rode through and through the ranks the british troops retreated down the slope where they reformed behind the reserve the guns opened fire with great effect and the infantry again marched up the hill our cavalry now came into action and drove the enemy before them the infantry carried the height and the enemy fled abandoning their guns it was now getting dark a party of the ameers infantry removed one of the guns but the afghan marksmen were keeping up a heavy musketry fire and the troops british as well as sepoys were so demoralized that they refused to advance and carry off the other it was therefore spiked and rolled down the hill while the smaller gun was brought by the ameers troops into the cantonment the enemy now strongly reinforced attempted to intercept the retreat but were beaten off on the th major pottinger and another officer came in wounded and reported that the ghoorka regiment that had been retiring from kohistan had been entirely destroyed they defended themselves courageously against overwhelming forces and held the barracks they occupied until maddened by thirst then they rushed to a stream where the enemy fell upon them and cut them to pieces the two mounted officers alone escaping after innumerable dangers on the th macnaghten heard that there was no hope whatever of assistance from sale who was himself surrounded with difficulties he now urged that the force should all retire to the bala hissar behind whose strong walls they could have maintained themselves but shelton vehemently opposed the step which would have saved the army from destruction urging that the abandonment of the cantonments would be an acknowledgment of defeat on the rd of november the enemy again appeared on the hill from which they had been driven and a strong force moved out against it strangely enough however they only took one gun with them the day was disgraceful as well as disastrous for the british force was signally defeated and the gun was lost and the troops reentered the cantonment in headlong flight hotly pursued by the afghans till they reached the protection of the earthworks their conduct showed how completely the imbecility and vacillation of their commanders and the effect of the insufficient rations on which they had to subsist had destroyed the moral of the troops the men who a month before could have driven the afghans before them like sheep were now unable to cope with them even when in superior numbers on the th elphinstone addressed a letter to macnaghten stating his opinion that their position could no longer be maintained and that he should at once enter into negotiations with the enemy he accordingly sent a message to the insurgent chiefs inviting them to send in a deputation to discuss the conditions of the treaty two of their leaders came in but as they demanded that the british should surrender at discretion giving themselves up with all their arms ammunition and treasure as prisoners of war macnaghten resolutely rejected the offered terms angus had been constantly employed from the day he reached the cantonments his work was to go out with small parties of the natives employed by the commissariat to bring in the grain that boyd and johnson had purchased there was no slight risk in the work for although the villagers were glad to sell their corn on good terms the party who fetched it ran the risk of being cut off by any band of tribesmen they might encounter of an evening he talked over the situation and prospects with the two officers absorbed in work as they all were they were less influenced by the feeling of hopelessness than those who had nothing to do but to rage over the trap into which they had fallen through the incapacity of their leaders still they did not attempt to disguise from themselves the magnitude of the danger i have no faith in any treaty that could be made boyd said an afghan is only bound by his word as long as it pays him to keep it they will take macnaghtens money and will promise that we shall be allowed to go down the passes without molestation but i am mistaken indeed if we shall not be attacked the moment we enter them if they do so few of us will ever get through the men are weak now from want of sufficient food they are utterly dispirited and demoralized as is shown by their shameful flight yesterday besides they will be encumbered with a host of camp followers women and children i am still of opinion that our only hope is to take refuge in the bala hissar and sheltons vehement opposition has already put a stop to that for myself i would rather that they attacked us here even if the attack meant our annihilation it would be better to die so than cooped up hopelessly in the passes at best the march would be a terrible one the cold is severe already and we hear that the snow is deep in the passes not so deep as to render them impracticable but deep enough to render the passage a terrible one of course we are bound to stay with the rest and do our best to the end were it not for that we three might escape we all speak the language well enough to pass as natives you indeed have already done so however of course that is not to be thought of indeed it would probably amount to the same thing in the end for we could scarcely hope to reach either jellalabad or candahar no it is not to be thought of johnson his companion said we have to do our duty to the last i still hope that the general may yet have an hour of inspiration and deliver battle in good order i believe that the troops would fight well if they did but see that they were properly handled on the following day they learned that akbar khan had arrived he was greeted with great enthusiasm and much firing of guns macnaghten had a faint hope that he would side with us as his father mother and brothers were in our hands in india but on the other hand he had every reason for bitter animosity against the british who had without any ground for complaint invaded the country and dethroned his father the prince bore the reputation of being frank generous and far brighter and more cheerful than the majority of his countrymen at the same time he was passionate and impulsive given to sudden bursts of anger the wrongs that he and his family had suffered were indeed at present predominant in his mind for two years he himself had been an exile from his country his father who had tried so hard to gain the friendship of the british had been dethroned by them and as it was notorious that their captives were always honourably treated he felt that no action upon his part would recoil upon their heads he himself was now the heir to the throne if he could win it he was extremely popular among the people who hailed his advent as giving them a leader whom they could rely upon under whom the chiefs of the tribesmen could lay aside their mutual jealousy and animosity and join in the effort to drive the foe for ever from their country he did not however at once assume the chief authority the nawab mahomed zemaun khan a cousin of dost mahomed had been proclaimed ameer by the tribesmen and all orders were sent forth in his name he was a man of humane and honourable nature of polished manners and affable address as soon as he learned the state of affairs akbar khan took immediate steps to prevent further supplies being taken into camp he burned the villages where grain had been sold and placed bands of men to attack any parties coming out from the camp to purchase grain day after day passed messengers came and went between macnaghten and the nawab but nothing was done the food supply dwindled only three days rations remained in camp the supplies doled out were scarcely sufficient to keep life together the oxen and other baggage animals were in such a state of starvation as to be wholly unfit for service the store of fuel had long been used up some men died of cold and all suffered much macnaghten was still hopeful and early in december again urged a retirement but in vain the enemy had now guns planted in several positions and kept up an almost constant cannonade on the camp on the th there were but three days half rations left and the general informed macnaghten by letter that it was absolutely necessary to surrender upon the best terms that could be obtained and the three senior officers also signed the letter saying that they concurred in it on the th there was but one days food left for the fighting men the camp followers were starving again and again macnaghten urged that a force should sally out and at all costs bring in provisions but the general knew that the men could not be relied upon to fight the time had come when even macnaghten saw that all hope had gone save in surrender he drew out the rough draft of a treaty and met the leading chiefs of the afghans at about a mile from the river by this treaty the british were to evacuate afghanistan they were to be supplied with provisions for the journey shah soojah was to abdicate and to have the option of accompanying them but if he did so his wife and family were to remain as hostages until dost mahomed and his family were released the troops at jellalabad were also to retire as well as those at ghuznee and candahar four british officers were to be left as hostages to return to india on the arrival of dost mahomed and his family on the frontier the conference lasted two hours and its main stipulations were agreed to the meeting then broke up on the understanding that the british troops were to evacuate the cantonments in three days and that provisions should in the meantime be sent in the treaty was a humiliating one but macnaghten was not to blame for it when the three military chiefs had declared that there was nothing for it but surrender he was forced to make the best arrangement he could and the terms of the treaty were as good as could have been expected in the circumstances when the conference broke up captain trevor one of macnaghtens staff accompanied the chief to the city as a hostage for the sincerity of the envoy on the th the bala hissar was evacuated akbar khan pledged himself to conduct the garrison safely to the cantonments and kept his promise succeeding in inducing the crowds of horsemen who gathered round to let the little detachment pass the provisions however were not sent in as agreed and the chiefs refused to send them until the garrisons were withdrawn from the forts they occupied round the cantonments the parties were each suspicious of the others good faith on the th snow began to fall heavily macnaghten tried desperately to win over some of the chiefs lavishing money among them the afghans made fresh demands and demanded more hostages and lieutenants conolly and airey were handed over to them on the nd akbar khan sent in fresh proposals to the effect that the british were to remain in afghanistan till the spring and then to withdraw as if of their own freewill shah soojah was to remain as ameer and akbar as his minister as a reward for these services akbar was to receive an annuity of and a bonus of macnaghten accepted the terms and agreed to meet akbar the offer was so strange that elphinstone and others thought that it was probably a plot macnaghten replied that he did not think that it was so but in any case he would go after breakfast he sent for the officers of his staff lawrence mackenzie and trevor who had returned and begged them to accompany him to the meeting an hour later they set out with a few horsemen as they rode on macnaghten admitted to his officers that he was well aware that it was a dangerous enterprise but that he was playing for a heavy stake and the prize was worth the risk at all events he said a thousand deaths are preferable to the life i have of late been leading the parties met at some hillocks six hundred yards from the cantonments where some horsecloths had been spread upon the snow by akbar khans servants macnaghten presented to akbar a splendid horse he had admired they dismounted and macnaghten took his place on the blankets trevor mackenzie and lawrence sat behind him suddenly the envoy and his companions were violently seized from behind the three officers were dragged away and each compelled to mount horses ridden by afghan chiefs who rode off through the crowd trevor unfortunately slipped from his insecure seat and was instantly cut to pieces while the other two reached mahomed khans fort alive in the meantime the envoy himself was struggling desperately on the ground with akbar khan exasperated by the resistance of his victim whom he had only intended to seize the afghans passion blazed out and drawing from his girdle a pistol which macnaghten had given him the day before he shot him through the body instantly his followers closed round and hacked him to pieces thus died a gentleman who in other circumstances might have made a great reputation for himself possessed of unusual talent his course was marred by his propensity to believe all that he wished to disbelieve all that ran counter to his own sanguine projects during the last month of his life he did all that man could do to avert a catastrophe but he had been unable to instil his spirit into any of the military commanders or to induce them to take the only course to redeem the position by giving battle to the foe that surrounded them he was the author of the illfated expedition to afghanistan he was its noblest victim his peculiar temperament was fatal to him even when there was no longer any ground for hope he still continued to be sanguine he had all along believed in himself and scoffed at the warnings of men who knew the country and peopleof burnes rawlinson pottinger and others he was thoroughly sincere he was always able to convince himself that what he believed must be true and he acted accordingly he was not a strong man had he been so the course of events might have been altered he deferred in every way to shah soojahs wishes however much these might be opposed to his own judgment he allowed him to misgovern the country to drive the natives to desperation by the exactions of his taxgatherers and to excite the bitterest animosity of the chiefs by the arrogance with which he treated them a strong man would have put a stop to all thiswould have intimated to the ameer that he held the throne solely by the assistance of british bayonets and that unless he followed british counsels he would at once yield to the oftrepeated wishes of the indian government and order the retirement of the troops chapter xv a doomed army even the murder of the british envoy within sight of the camp failed to arouse the military authorities from their deadly lethargy sullenly the troops remained in their cantonments not a man was put in motion to avenge the deed or to redeem the honour of the army the only idea was to renew the negotiations that had been broken short by the murder of their political chief the commissariat had nothing to do beleaguered as they were it was impossible to collect provisions unless a strong force was sent out and the military authorities refused to allow a man to be put in motion they had no confidence in their soldiers and the soldiers had none in them it was their leaders who had made them what they were macnaghten in his wrath had spoken of them as miserable cowards but they were not cowards they had at first full confidence in themselves and if ordered would gladly have attacked the afghan forces in the open and have carried cabul by storm but kept in enforced inactivity while fort after fort was wrested from them without an effort being made to relieve the garrisons while the whole of their provisions for the winter were carried off before their eyes by an enemy they despised and feeling that on the few occasions on which they were led from their entrenchments there was neither plan nor orderno opportunity for showing their valour none for engaging in battle they lost heart day by day they were exposed to continual insults from their exultant foes day by day exposed to a heavy cannon and musketry fire while the food served out was insufficient to maintain their strengthalmost insufficient to keep them alive it is not wonderful that their fighting powers were lost and that they had become little more than a rabble in uniform angus had now no official duties to perform and he spent much of his time with his old friend eldred pottinger now a major who after macnaghtens murder took his place by right of seniority as well as of energy and talent as chief political officer he had been employed in the west but had been sent to cabul and very shortly afterwards had proceeded to kohistan returning almost the sole survivor of the little force that was stationed there his counsel since then had always been for energetic measures but his voice like that of macnaghten availed nothing he had however taken no prominent part in affairs having been confined to his bed by the wound he had received he was now recovering from it and took up the work with the same energy as he had displayed at herat as he said to angus it seems to be my fate to have to do with incapable men at herat it was yar mahomed and kamran here it is shelton and elphinstone elphinstone and kamran have both in their younger days been fighting men both are utterly worn out bodily and mentally by disease and age shelton is a brave man a hard fighter but his temper overmasters him when in the field he shows personal gallantry but no military capacity whatever at first he was always in opposition to the general he has given that up as useless and beyond always endeavouring to thwart his chief when the latter was roused to momentary flashes of energy by macnaghten he has sunk into a deep gloom as if he regarded it as absolutely hopeless to struggle further i would that any other than myself had been placed in the position i now hold the terms proposed to macnaghten were hard enough they will be still harder still more disgraceful now but however disgraceful they may be they will be accepted by the military leaders and my name will be associated with the most humiliating treaty a british officer has ever been called upon to sign his previsions were correct negotiations were renewed without the slightest allusion being made to the murder of macnaghten and as if such an event had never happened while these were going on little food was allowed to enter campenough to sustain life but no more at last the terms were settled the afghan chiefs agreed to supply provisions and to send in baggage animals upon payment being made for them six officers were to be handed over as hostages all muskets and ordnance stores in the magazines all money in the treasury and all goods and property belonging to dost mahomed were to be surrendered and dost himself and his family to be returned no provision whatever was made for the safety of the man we had placed upon the throne pottinger endeavoured in vain to obtain better conditions he received no support from the military chiefs and even when at last he agreed to the terms he did so with little hope that they would be observed warnings came from friends in the city that no dependence whatever could be placed upon the chiefs and that in spite of all promises the force would certainly be attacked on its way down through the passes no step was taken by the chiefs to send in either provisions or carriage animals and the escort that was to accompany them did not make its appearance on the th of january the military authorities determined to march out contrary to the advice of pottinger who argued that without carriage and provisions and without the protection of the chiefs as promised the prospects of four thousand troops and twelve thousand followers being able to make their way down through the passes was small indeed angus had come to rely very much upon azim for information as to what was passing outside the cantonment the latter had during the three years come to speak the afghan language perfectly and in the attire of a peasant often went out after dark mixed with the insurgents and entered the city he had each time he went out brought back a less hopeful report than on the previous one and angus was the more impressed since the young fellow was generally cheery and disposed to look on the bright side of things taking indeed comparatively little interest in what was going on around him having absolute confidence that his master would find some way out of any difficulty that might confront him i quite agree with all you say azim but i am powerless to act in any way if i were here as a private person i should certainly disguise myself and endeavour to make my way down to candahar but as an officer i must remain at my post come what may and share the fate of the rest but if you are disposed to try and get down i will not throw any obstacle in your way and will furnish you with money sufficient to pay your way either back to persia or down into india where with your knowledge of languages you will have no difficulty in finding employment azim laughed no master whatever comes i will stay with you just as you are in the employment of government and cannot leave so am i in your employment angus did not attempt to push the matter further for he felt that it would be useless and indeed although he would have done what he could to procure his followers safety he felt that he would be a great loss to him in many ways they had been so long together and had gone through so many dangers in companionship that he regarded azim as a friend rather than as a servant when you have been in the city azim have you ever seen our friend sadut no sir i have heard that he has been in the city many times and that he was with the afghan horsemen who drove our people in but i have not seen him should i speak to him if i do so yes you might thank him in my name and your own for having saved our lives the other day but on no account say anything to him about the future i cannot make any overtures for help to a man who though a friend of my own is fighting against us and indeed however willing he might be to aid me to the best of his power he could not do so if we are really attacked in the pass mixed up as we shall be with the camp followers we could not be found in the crowd and you may be sure that the tribesmen and the ghazee fanatics will be mad with bloodshed and hate and that even a chief would be unable to stand between them and their victims even if he were to send a messenger to me to say that he and his men would again save me if i would let him know in which part of the column i shall ride i should refuse to do so it would be an act of treachery on my part to others weaker and less able to take care of themselves than i am on the afternoon of the day when the force moved out of the cantonments eldred pottinger sent for angus are you ready to undertake a hazardous mission he asked it is so hazardous that i would send no one upon it were it not that i consider that those who stay here are running as great a risk after the murder of burnes and macnaghten i have not the smallest faith in the chiefs keeping to their promises and the manner in which they have failed now to carry out the terms of the treaty heightens my distrust in them i do not believe that any of the messengers that have been sent down of late have succeeded in getting through and indeed until today it was impossible to say whether we should really start or not the messages sent down were necessarily vague and were indeed only requests for aid i know and no doubt sale knows that it is as difficult for him to fight his way up the passes as it is for us to make our way down but now that in spite of my advice elphinstone and shelton and the other officers have decided to wait no longer but to start at once a specific message must be sent i am ready to try to get through angus said i have no doubt that while we have been negotiating here the tribesmen from all the country round have been gathering in the passes the only way would be for me to join some party of men from the villages going that way once fairly in the pass and among the tribesmen i could leave the party and mingle with others of course it would be slow work going on afoot but i should say that it would be quite impossible on horseback i have not much hope that the mission will be of any real use for sale is himself besieged in jellalabad still one must make an attempt i shall enter in my journalstrusting that they will some day be recoveredthat as a last hope i have accepted the offer of mr angus campbell to carry a message to general sale saying that we are starting and begging him if it be possible to make a diversion in our favour by advancing as far as he can to meet us i will not give you any written document you are well known to many of the officers who went down with sale therefore no question can arise as to the message you bear being a genuine one if you were searched and any letter found upon you it would be your deathwarrant still i believe if anyone could get through alive you can i will do my best anyhow angus said and i will start as soon as it becomes dark it is all easy enough as far as khoord cabul after that i shall keep a sharp lookout if i overtake any party of villagers i shall join them i shall come and say goodbye to you before you start campbell angus returned at once to his tent you have my disguise ready and your own azim yes sir i have both ready and have two of their long guns and some daggers and pistols i have my own pistols azim yes master and it will be as well to take them but they would be seen directly if you had them in your girdle no doubt they would azim but there are a good many english pistols among them now there were three pairs they got at sir alexanders house and there have been several officers killed since i can give out that i took part in the fight at sir alexanders and got these pistols as my share of the plunder are you going anywhere master yes i am going to try to get down through the passes to jellalabad we shall start as soon as it is dark it will be a terribly dangerous journey but i hardly think it will be more dangerous than going down with the troops what are we to take master i will get it ready there is not much that we can take i will go down to the store myself and get eight or ten pounds of ground grain there is not much of it for the mills have all been smashed and we have had to serve the grain out whole but i know that there are two or three sacks left in the stores there is no meat to be had nor spiritsnot that i would take spirits if i could get them for if they were found upon me it would excite suspicion at once another thing i must stain myself my face and hands are nearly as brown as those of the afghans but if we were searched and they took our things off they would see in an instant that i was a white i dont know how we are to get stain i should think master that if we were to bake some grain quite black and then pound it and pour boiling water over it so as to make it like very strong coffee it might do a very good idea well i shall not want you for the next two hours i shall go round and see some of my friends and say goodbye to them mind whatever you do dont say a word to anyone about our leaving i will be sure not to do that master azim went out to a little tent of thick native blanket a few yards from that of his master there he sat looking through the entrance until he saw his master leave his tent five minutes later he issued out in his afghan dress long coat lined with sheepskins black lambswool cap high boots and sheepskin breeches and at once set off at a brisk walk there were at all times many afghans in the camp and indeed many of the camp followers had since the cold set in adopted the same dress therefore no attention was paid to him and no questions were asked by the sentries as he passed out at the gates as soon as he got among the gardens and enclosures he broke into a run which he continued until he reached a village a mile and a half away and here he entered one of the cottages have you news for us one of the four men sitting there said yes and good news my master starts as soon as it is dark he will be on foot and he is going to try and make his way down through the passes that is good news indeed the afghan said i was afraid that we should never get a chance which road will he go by i cant say exactly but he is sure to leave by the western gate he would have more chance of getting away unnoticed on that side of course we shall both be in our afghan dress we will be on the lookout i suppose that he will be armed yes he will carry one of your long guns and a brace of pistols you had best choose some spot where you can close on him suddenly for he would certainly fight till the last we will be careful the man said i dont want to get a pistol ball in my body we shall follow at a distance until we find a convenient spot he is sure to keep along at the foot of the hill so as to avoid your people on the plain it will suit us best also as we shall not have far to carry him mind you must make a struggle when you seize me as if i was violently resisting then when we start you must order me to walk and threaten to blow out my brains if i try to escape my master can learn the truth afterwards if he were to know it now he would be furious with me but in a few days when fighting is going on in the passes and a great disaster occurs he will thank me for having prevented him from throwing away his life especially as he knows perfectly well that the english in jellalabad could not come out to assist those here when angus returned to the tent he found azim busy roasting the grain the afghan costume had been laid aside everything is ready master the grain is nearly done and it wont take me long to pound it up i got a few sticks down at the stores and the kettle is just boiling then as soon as it is ready i will stain myself but i shant put on the afghan dress until the last thing have you cooked some of the flour yes sir i have made four cakes they are baking in the ashes now i thought perhaps you would eat one before we started and we can carry the others for tomorrow i wish azim angus said that there was some chance of this journey being useful but i feel convinced that no good can come of it the moonshee has sent in a report that confirms the rumours we heard there can be no doubt that general sale is strongly beleaguered in jellalabad and will have all his work to do to hold the place and therefore it will be absolutely impossible for him to fight his way up the pass then why should you go master because i have been asked to go as a forlorn hope and also because however great the risk i may run i do not think that it is greater than it would be if i went down with the army we have no baggage animals we have food for only three days more and it will only last that time by cutting down the rations still further the unfortunate camp followers are for the most part without warm clothing of any sort and will die by thousands as to the troops i have no doubt that most of them will fight when they know that unless they cut their way through they are doomed but their chance of victory is small here in the open plain they might even now if well led and worked up to enthusiasm by a stirring speech thrash the afghans numerous as these may be but pent up in the passes under a fire from every hillside by a foe they cannot reachfor in their present weak state they could never scale the mountainsi believe it will be a massacre rather than a fight at any rate if we are to be killed i would rather be shot as a spy than go through such awful scenes as there will be before a bullet finishes me i dont want to die at all master but if it be the will of allah so be it but as you say i would rather be killed straight off than struggle on through the snows in the passes and get killed in the end as soon as it became dusk angus and his follower put on their disguises a few minutes later eldred pottinger came in well as far as looks go you will pass anywhere campbell and certainly as regards language there is no fear of your being suspected the real difficulty will be in explaining where you came from every village has sent its contingent of fighting men and if it happened that you met anyone from the place you pretended to come from the consequences would be very awkward i intend to give out that i have come down from arcab which is a little village to the south of ghuznee i went out there once with a detachment to buy some cattle it is hardly likely that any of the men from that place would have come here for they would naturally join the bands that are threatening our garrison there of course i can invent some story to account for my not doing the same pottinger nodded well campbell i hope that you will get well through it as i told you i have not a shadow of hope that sale will be able to lend a hand to us still although it is but one in a thousand chances i feel that it ought to be attempted and in your case i say honestly that i consider there is no greater risk in your going down by yourself and having your own wits to depend upon than in going down with the armyif one can call this broken and dispirited soldiery an armyfor in that case the bravest and clearest head would share the fate whatever that may be of the dullest and most cowardly i quite see that and agree with you that nothing can be slighter than the chances of the army getting down safely be assured that whatever happens so far from blaming you i shall consider that you did the best for me by sending me on this mission i will walk with you to the gate pottinger said in the daytime there is no check upon anyone passing in or out but at night the sentries are on the alert and as you are both armed you would certainly be stopped a minute was spent in packing their scanty stores into the pockets of their coats then they started for the gate here pottinger after seeing them through shook hands cordially not only with angus but with azim whom he had learned to like and value for the devotion he showed to his master in herat they proceeded on their way without meeting any parties of afghans until they neared the foot of the hill then as they were passing along a path through an orchard a party of men suddenly sprang out upon them and they were thrown down on their faces before either had time to offer any resistance angus indeed had repressed the natural impulse to try to draw one of his pistols resistance would have meant death and it seemed to him that these could only be plunderers what are you doing fools he exclaimed do you not see that we are friends no answer was given his captors were binding his hands tightly to his side then before raising him they muffled his head in a blanket he was then lifted to his feet he heard the men say to azim that he was to accompany them and that if he attempted escape he would at once be shot a man on each side of him put his hands on his shoulder and one said you are to walk quietly with us escape is impossible and it were well for you not to attempt it angus indeed felt that escape was out of the question he was unable to conjecture into whose hands he had fallen they were not bent upon plunder for had they been so they would have taken his arms searched him and probably cut his throat afterwards it seemed impossible to him that they could know he was a british officer and the only conceivable explanation he could think of was that men had been scattered all round the cantonment to prevent anyone from leaving or going out with messages to one or other of the chiefs and that they had seen him and azim come out had followed and seized them and were now taking them to some chief to be questioned as to why they were in the british camp after dark and for what purpose they had left certainly the affair reminded him of his friendly capture at cabul but it seemed to him altogether impossible that sadut could have learned that he was about to start on a mission or that had he even learned it he could have known that he and azim would have followed the road on which they had been captured he soon found that the path they were following was an upward one and as it became steeper and steeper he was sure that he was being taken into the hills once or twice he addressed his captors but received no answer he walked as far as he could tell for two hours at last there was a pause he heard a door open and felt that he was being taken into a hut then for the first time the pistols and knives were taken from his sash his captors after addressing a few whispered words to some men who were already in the hut retired closing the door behind them and piling heavy stones against it the blanket was then taken off his head a bright fire was burning in the hut which he saw was some fifteen feet square four men armed to the teeth were standing by the fire there was no door save the one by which they had been brought in and it was evident that the hut consisted only of this room you are unhurt i hope he said to azim yes i was knocked down before i had time to think of doing anything do you know where they have brought us no they threw a cloth over my head how could this have happened azim i cannot understand it at all no more can i sir when we started to fight against the infidels we never thought that we should be attacked by our own countrymen it seems to me that there must be some mistake then he turned to the afghans why are we brought here what harm have we done that i know not the man said you must have done something or our comrades would not have brought you here that is their business it seems to me angus said angrily it is our business too our tribe are not at war with any others and it is a new thing that afghans should attack each other when all are uniting to fight the strangers i know nothing about it i only know that our comrades brought you here and left us to look after you there are plenty of traitors among the men who have taken the infidels gold they will all be reckoned with when we have finished with the white men well they did not tell us to keep you bound and we will take off the cords if you swear by the faith that you will make no attempt to escape angus hesitated it seemed to him that if two of the four men slept he and azim could if unbound snatch at their weapons and at least make a fight for it that chance would be gone if he gave his word no he said i will make no bargain with men who have deprived me of my liberty well just as you like the other said seating himself by the fire it makes no matter to us we may as well sit down too angus said and advancing near the fire he sat down by the side of the afghans azim did the same where did you say you came from the man who had been the spokesman of the party asked angus briefly named the village he had before decided upon and then sat looking silently at the fire he saw that his chance of being able to discover at present any plan for escape was very small presently one of the men said let us have supper and rising he went to a corner of the hut where the carcass of a sheep was hanging from the rafters he cut off a leg divided this into slices which he spitted on a ramrod and then put it over the fire in the meantime another had unceremoniously placed the four cakes that were taken from the captives in the embers to warm up when the meat was done the leader said to angus we do not wish to starve you we will untie the hands of one of you and let him eat when he has done we will fasten him up again and let the other eat in the same way this was done when they were again securely bound angus said in pushtoo you may as well lie down now friend perhaps in the morning the men who have taken us will find out that they have made a mistake and will let us go with apologies for having treated friends so roughly they lay down close together but angus was afraid even to whisper to his follower lest it should excite the suspicion of their guard for an hour he remained watchful then he saw two of the afghans lie down but the other two lighted their pipes and were evidently going to keep watch he had tried quietly once or twice to see if the cords that bound him could be loosened but he found that although they had not been tied unpleasantly tight they were securely fastened and did not yield in the slightest to his efforts he therefore gave up the idea of trying to free himself from them and indeed even if the guards should all sleep the prospect was hopeless for from the noise made in rolling the rocks against the door it was certain that this could not be opened without waking the sleepers it would therefore be necessary as a preliminary to kill all of them and even then he might not be able to break open the door at any rate there was nothing to do at present after trying in vain to discover an explanation of their capture he fell asleep he woke several times in the night but found that two men were always on guard the next morning he heard the stones removed from the door but no one entered the afghans breakfasted and this time permitted their captives to share the meal with them from time to time one or other of the afghans went to the door and looked out and at two oclock one of them said the infidels are moving the others went out have you thought of any way of escape angus whispered in persian to his follower i can think of nothing azim murmured as there seemed no obstacle to their going out angus joined his captors he could see on the snow which covered the plain below the dark masses of the troops surrounded by a host of camp followers while beyond these hovered hordes of afghans from time to time horsemen rode in evidently delivered some message and then went off again the departure of the troops had been fatally delayed it was ordered to begin at eight oclock in the morning and at that hour they stood to their arms the day was clear and bright and although four miles from the camp angus could clearly see what was going on although it was now two in the afternoon only a portion of the troops had left the camp and it was not till six oclock when night had already fallen that the rearguard left it already confusion had set in the ranks of the soldiers were broken up by the terrified camp followers and presented the appearance of a vast mob rather than an organized army had they started at the hour fixed they might have reached khoord cabul in safety but the loss of time was fatal only six miles were accomplished and it was two oclock in the morning before the whole gathered when it was seen that their numbers were already diminished the wretched camp followers accustomed to the heat of the plains of india and thinly clad were the first to succumb hundreds especially of women and children sat down in the snow and were frozen to death already the afghans were hanging on the flanks and sometimes making rushes and cutting down many of the unresisting multitude soon after two oclock a native came up to the hut and delivered an order to the afghans who at once cut up the remainder of the sheep and divided it between them then their leader said we are to move the ropes that bound the prisoners were loosened one end was tied round the wrist of each captive the other being wound round the waist of an afghan allowing a slack of a yard and a half as soon as this was done the party moved off they descended the hill for some distance and then followed the lower slopes in the direction in which the army was moving they kept on till long after midnight and then halted at a deserted hut far behind them they could see the flames of the burning cantonments which had been fired by the afghans as soon as they had removed everything of the slightest value in the morning angus saw that their haltingplace was high up above the entrance of the khoord cabul pass there was as yet no sign of the army but in the afternoon it was seen approaching in a confused mass the night had been a dreadful one soldiers and camp followers horses and baggage and cattle were huddled in a confused mass no warm clothes had been served out to the followers and hundreds were frozen to death during the night while others were so badly frostbitten that they were unable to walk as soon as the troops started again the afghan horsemen attacked the rear seizing the baggage capturing the guns and cutting down all they encountered at noon akbar khan with six hundred horsemen rode up pottinger sent captain skinner with six horsemen to communicate with him akbar said that he had been sent out by the nawab to protect them from the attacks of the ghazees his instructions were to demand other hostages as security for the evacuation of jellalabad and to arrest the progress of the force supplying it in the meantime with everything it required until news of the evacuation of jellalabad by sale was received the troops however did not halt until they reached the entrance of the cabul pass the night was even more dreadful than the preceding day had been the sepoys burned their caps and accoutrements to obtain a little warmth and numbers were frozen to death at daybreak the crowd of soldiers and camp followers began to push forward their only thought now being how to escape death akbar khan spent some hours in negotiations four more hostages were demanded pottinger volunteered to be one of them captain lawrence had been specially named and pottinger chose mackenzie as the third it was agreed that the force should move down through the khoord cabul pass to tezeen there to await tidings of the evacuation of jellalabad chapter xvi annihilation of the army in terrible confusion the crowd of fugitivesthey were now nothing moreall entered the terrible pass the ghilzyes at once commenced their attack in vain did akbar khan and his chiefs endeavour to restrain the fanatics from the hillsides from every rocky crag they opened a murderous fire that day three thousand men fell either from the musket fire or from the knives of the afghans the doolybearers had all deserted on the first day the greater portion of the camels and ponies had been captured so far the ladies had escaped they all rode next to the advanced guard as this was considered the safest point for the soldiers here maintained some sort of order and the afghans therefore devoted their attention to the helpless crowd in the rear again the column halted in the snow in the morning the camp followers made another rush ahead but the troops who were ordered to march at ten oclock did not move for in spite of all the remonstrances of the officers the general countermanded the order believing that akbar khan would send in provisions and troops to protect them another terrible night was passed and then captain skinner rode into camp with a new proposal from akbar khan namely that all the english ladies of the force should be placed under his charge and that they might be accompanied by their husbands pottinger remembering that akbar khans family were in the hands of the british and believing that he was sincere in his wish to save the ladies and children from destruction sanctioned the proposal elphinstone at once accepted it it was the choice of two evils on the one hand akbar khan had proved faithless and on the other certain death awaited the ladies they were insufficiently clad had scarcely tasted food since they left cabul and had passed three terrible nights in the snow undoubtedly it was the wiser course to trust them to akbar khan accordingly a party of afghan horse rode in and lady macnaghten lady sale and ten other ladies some twenty children and eight officers rode away under their escort the next morning the survivors started the sepoys had already lost the greater portion of their numbers the remainder threw away their guns which they could no longer use owing to their hands being frostbitten and joined the disorganized rabble in front they were attacked in a narrow gorge and the pass was soon choked with dead and dying not a single sepoy survived of the sixteen thousand men soldiers and camp followers that had left cabul four days before not more than a quarter were now alive akbar khan watched the slaughter that was going on declaring that he was powerless to restrain the ghilzyes whom even their own chiefs could not control he advised that the remnant of the british army should lay down their arms and place themselves under his protection the general very properly refused the offer for akbar khan had already acknowledged that he was incapable of restraining the tribesmen the march was continued the rearguard was commanded by shelton and nobly they did their work repulsing several attacks of the enemy and giving time for those ahead to pursue their way before daybreak they started again in hopes that they might reach jugduluk that day despair gave the soldiers strength and they moved off quietly in order to obtain a start of the camp followers who paralysed their action the latter however were soon on their feet and as usual endeavoured to push on ahead of the troops for some miles the retreat was uninterrupted but presently a heavy fire opened on the rearguard the camp followers then rushed in a tumultuous crowd past the troops and when a little later the head of the column was attacked they again fled to the rear not only hampering the movements of the soldiers but carrying many of them away by the impetus of their rush steadily until day broke the afghan marksmen maintained their fire soon afterwards the advanced guard reached a village ten miles from jugduluk and halting only till the rearguard came up again pushed forward shelton with a handful of the rearguard kept the afghans at bay and covered the retreat until all arrived in jugduluk where they took their post behind some ruined walls there was however little rest for them the afghans in everincreasing numbers posted themselves on the heights and opened a terrible fire three bullocks were found among the camp followers these were instantly killed and served out to the famishing soldiers who devoured them raw again akbars party approached and captain skinner went out to remonstrate with him for permitting the continued attacks but the afghan prince declared himself incapable of repressing his men as his orders were disregarded a handful of the th regiment issued out and made a gallant rush at the enemy and drove them back but as the main body did not follow their example they again retired behind the ruined walls all night long and through the next day the force remained at jugduluk akbar khan sent in a message inviting the general shelton and captain johnson to a conference and promised to send in provisions this promise he as usual broke and insisted on retaining the three officers as hostages the conference was resumed the next morning akbar now seemed in earnest in his desire to put a stop to the slaughter but the petty chiefs of the tribes between jugduluk and jellalabad were now present and these would listen neither to his entreaties nor commands nor to the offer of large sums of money they thirsted for blood and were determined to extirpate the infidels mahomed shah khan to whose daughter akbar was married then came forward and asked whether the british would pay two lacs of rupees for safeconduct to jellalabad the general agreed to this and it seemed that at last the safety of the survivors was ensured at eight oclock in the evening the survivors who now numbered but a hundred and twenty of the th and twentyfive artillerymen again set forth no provisions had been sent in during the two days halt and all were terribly reduced by famine the afghans rushed down among the camp followers killing them unresistingly the soldiers however held together and bayonet in hand drove off their assailants until they reached the jugduluk pass they struggled up the narrow and terribly steep ascent until when near the summit they came upon a barricade composed of bushes and branches of trees here the column was thrown into great confusion the camp followers crowding upon the soldiers the latter fought with desperation while the afghans massacred the unresisting camp followers twelve officers fell here their number was large in proportion to that of the men they had been no better clothed and had suffered equally from cold and hunger but they did not give way to the depression that during the first two marches had reigned among the troops they were upheld too by the feeling of responsibility and the necessity of keeping up an appearance of cheerfulness and hopefulness in order to encourage the men after desperate fighting some twenty officers and twentyfive soldiers managed to break their way through the barricade and at daybreak reached gundamuck there were but two rounds of ammunition remaining in the mens pouches most of them were already wounded but they were resolute not to lay down their arms and when called upon to do so they refused then the mob of afghans rushed down upon them one officer and a few privates were taken prisoners but seven officers succeeded in cutting their way through and being mounted left the afghans behind them and reached futtehbad but sixteen miles from jellalabad here however they were attacked by the peasantry two were cut down at once the others rode off but were pursued and overtaken four of them were killed and one only dr brydon reached jellalabad alive the sole survivor of four thousand five hundred fighting men and twelve thousand camp followers with the exception only of those who had been taken over by akbar as hostages this the greatest disaster that ever befell a british army was due to the vacillation and weakness that had characterized every action since the murder of sir alexander burnes had the force pressed forward at once on the morning when it left its cantonment the greater portion would probably have reached jellalabad but two days had been lost before the army reached khoord cabul pass about ten miles from the city there were fresh halts fresh delays fresh futile negotiations again and again and during the time thus thrown away the enemy from all the mountains round were gathering in the passes to oppose them and building the fatal barricade in the pass of jugduluk had the force pushed forward with only an occasional halt of a few hours they would not have been enfeebled by hunger by slaying the baggage animals an abundance of food could have been obtained for all the opposition they encountered would have been comparatively feeble and cold would have been their only formidable antagonist truly it seemed that a curse had fallen upon the army that it was divine retribution for a most unjust and iniquitous war each day angus and his followers had been taken along always being halted in positions whence they could see the terrible tragedy that was being enacted angus was half mad with grief and with fury that he was not in his place among the troops azim in vain endeavoured to comfort him by pointing out that it was not his fault that he was not there but that he had been sent away from the army by the order of his superior and that even had he not been taken prisoner he would not be a sharer in what was going on in the pass that is true azim but it is a poor consolation to me i feel sure that pottinger foresaw what would happen and that it was as an act of friendship in giving me a chance of getting through safely that he sent me down it was no doubt kindly meant but i would a thousand times rather have shared the fate of the rest well master for my part i own that i am glad we are up here i have no wish to be killed especially as it would do no good to anyone why should a man throw away his life allah has given it to us and we shall die when our time comes but it would be wicked to throw it away uselessly it is all very well to talk like that azim when one is in safety but when one sees ones comrades being slaughtered a man would not be worthy of the name did he not long to be with them and to die fighting by their side indeed we know not at present whether our lives are to be saved we know not into whose hands we have fallen or why we should thus be taken along to be spectators of this massacre the whole thing is bewildering to me illustration angus was half mad with grief and with fury that he was not in his place among the troops they now generally conversed in persian their guards although keeping as strict a watch as ever on them interfered with them but little fortunately the worst scenes took place at night and were therefore hidden from those on the hill the incessant rattle of musketry alone telling of the relentless pursuit on the night of the th the roar of fire had been louder than ever at last it ceased suddenly angus and his guards alike remained awake angus listening in agony to the sounds of the combat the afghans talking together in low tones what do you think has happened he asked them when some minutes had passed without the sound of a shot being heard either akbar khan has succeeded in persuading the ghilzye chiefs to spare what few there are left of the infidels or the last man has been slain angus felt that the latter was by far the more probable solution and throwing himself down on the ground he burst into tears the eight days of mental suffering had shaken him terribly and now feeling that his worst fears had been realized he broke down altogether before daybreak his captors moved some distance farther up into the mountains and by the cautious manner in which they made their way often pausing to look back and round angus concluded that they were desirous of avoiding all contact with their countrymen he had indeed before observed how careful they were to avoid the afghans scattered on the hillside and he now concluded that they must be taking him to the tower of the chief to be dealt with as he might direct either shot at once or held by him as a hostage for whose delivery he might obtain a handsome sum should the british again advance up the passes all day they travelled among the hills at last they came upon a large village there were no men about doubtless all had gone to take part in the fray the women came out and eagerly questioned them as to the fighting on the night before we know nothing the leader said we believe that the last of the infidels has fallen but we know nothing for certain without pausing they took the two prisoners whose appearance had created no surprise as they were taken for natives to the chiefs tower a much larger building than the abodes of most of the petty chiefs standing upon a crag of rock it overlooked the village entrance was only obtainable by a ladder leading to a door some thirty feet above the rock their coming had been observed an old man stood at the door so you are back suffyd yes as you see has the chief returned no it is two weeks since we saw him last he started then with all the fighting men from here and the other villages but i expect it will not be long before he returns for from what we have heard the work must be nearly done the party ascended the ladder and the leader spoke a word or two with the old man who looked greatly surprised the captives were taken into a room which by its furnishing was evidently one of the chiefs private apartments you are free to move about the house the leader said but you must not leave it in a few minutes a woman entered bringing a dish of boiled grain with portions of mutton in it she gave the usual afghan salutation she was followed by another woman with a jug of water two mugs and a bottle these were placed on a low table and then without another word they left the room a minute later they returned with a large earthenware dish full of burning charcoal this is a good beginning azim angus said his spirits rising at the sight of the hot food for although they had not been actually starved they had been on extremely short rations when their supply of flour was exhausted their captors being like themselves reduced to a handful of unground grain each day this does not look as if they meant to cut our throats evidently our afghan is acting under orders those orders must have been that we were to be well treated they ate a hearty meal then angus said see what there is in that bottle azim the cork had already been taken out and azim poured some of the liquor into a tin and handed it to his master the latter smelt it it is afghan spirits he said the same as they sell in the bazaars in cabul he filled it up with water and drank it off now azim do you do the same azim who was not a very strict mohammedan and had more than once tasted the forbidden drink at cabul needed no pressing well master he said as he put the cup down after all this is better than lying dead and frozen down in the pass angus warmed with the good meal and by the draught that he had taken could not disagree with his follower i begin to think that you are right azim though i did not believe so yesterday it is certain that had i joined my countrymen i should have perished with them and assuredly i have been saved from eight days of awful suffering and from deathif indeed we are saved from death i think we can feel certain of that master this is not the way the afghans treat a man whose throat they intend to cut they certainly do not make a pillau for him or provide him with a bottle of spirits do you know i have been thinking azim angus said after a short silence that if it had been possible for sadut khan to know that we intended to leave camp in disguise this might be his work again but he could not have known it no one but you and i and major pottinger and the three or four officers to whom i said goodbye knew anything about it besides he would have sent the men who captured us before and who knew us by sight and even supposing which seems to be impossible that this was his doing why not have sent us here straight instead of taking eight days to do a journey that could have been made easily in two and forcing me to witness the awful scenes in the passes it is all most extraordinary however there is no question sir that whoever our captor may be he has been the means of saving our lives there can be no doubt of that azim and though i may not feel that at present i shall in the future be very grateful to him even if he were to have us shot directly he comes here i should still be grateful for it would be a sudden death and not a lingering one as it has been to those below well it is of no use puzzling ourselves over the matter i suppose we shall learn how it all came about when the chief whoever he be returns here in the meantime we are certainly a great deal better off than we have been for the past two months in cantonments that we are master to begin with i am warm for the first time since the winter set in and in the next place i have had a good meal and do not feel that i could grumble at anything as to your mission you said yourself that nothing could come of it even if you succeeded in getting through so that in that respect nothing has been lost by our journey being so suddenly brought to an end the next day some of the men who had been away with their chief returned and the old man in charge told angus that only one man out of all who had started from cabul had reached jellalabad but that several officers had been taken as hostages including the two generals major pottinger and captain johnson and two others also that all the ladies and children and the ladies husbands had accepted the protection of akbar it was a relief indeed to angus to find that his friends pottinger and johnson had been saved and as captain boyd was one of the married officers he also must have escaped the massacre as to the fate of elphinstone and shelton he was indifferent it was to them that the misfortune that had befallen the army was largely due but the thought that his three greatest friends had escaped gave him much pleasure with these exceptions that but one man out of sixteen thousand five hundred should have escaped was appalling that the loss had been terrible he was well aware but he was hardly prepared for the total annihilation of the force another two days passed they continued to be well fed and treated and the women who waited upon them seemed to regard them as guests rather than as captives talking freely with them and only being silent when angus endeavoured to find out the name of their chief it was evident that on this point they had orders to keep silent on the third day they heard a stir in the village and shouts of acclamation and welcome the room in which they were confined was at the back of the house and they were therefore unable to obtain a view of what was passing we shall learn our fate now azim angus said i have no fear of its being a bad one master we cannot doubt that orders were given that we should be well treated if we are kept prisoners till the spring for my part i shall not grumble if they continue to treat us as well as they have been doing they heard the sound of many footsteps and loud talking then the door opened and sadut khan entered he advanced with both hands outstretched to angus my dear friend he said how thankful i am that you have been saved where so many have perished and so it is you chief to whom i owe my life angus said returning the warm grasp of saduts hand i did not thank you at first for it seemed to me shameful that an english officer should not share in the fate of his comrades sadut smiled but in no case would you have shared their fate it is not from that i have saved you but from being killed on your way down knowing that the passes were full of our people i was sure that you must have been taken and murdered no story you could have told would have availed you you were not a ghilzye nor a member of any of the tribes there and you would assuredly have been detected and killed had i not saved you that is so sadut and although at first i was halfmad at being unable to join my countrymen i saw before the end came that had i done so my life would have been thrown away uselessly exactly and that was why i ordered that you should be enabled to see all that passed from what i had seen of you i was sure that at first you would bitterly resent being taken prisoner and that even if you knew into whose hands you had fallen you would resist and it was for that reason that i did not this time employ hassan and his followers to seize you though all through your journey they kept close at hand to use my name and authority should any party of tribesmen meet younot that i had much fear of your detection had they done so the men with you had orders that in case they did meet such a party they were to treat you both not as captives but as forming part of their own band still it was as well that hassan should be at hand in case of need i thank you with all my heart sadut i could not have done so at first but i can do so now you have indeed saved my life a few days ago that seemed to me as nothing for i felt that i was dishonoured in looking on at the massacre of my countrymen i have had time to think it over since and i now know that the view i took was exaggerated could i have joined them it was plainly my duty to have done so but if i was a prisoner no blame could attach to me have you chief taken part in this terrible business no with twenty of my own horsemen i rode with akbar who is my friend and relative but i had no intention of drawing my sword against your people i knew that they had been promised protection and i thought that akbar and his force were going to escort them his word had been given and i did not think he would withdraw it i do not think it was his intention to do so he could have done much more than he did but he could not have saved the fugitives the nawab was alone among the afghan chiefs in the sincerity of his assurances akbar had no influence with the ghilzye chiefs and even had he influenced them they could not have restrained their tribesmen and the ghazees the die was cast it was allahs will that those who had invaded the country without any pretext dethroned dost mahomed who had eagerly sought their alliance and forced a man we all hated upon us should meet their fate over and over again we implored akbar for the sake of his pledge and his word to assist your people even if in his efforts to do so he fell then his name would go down as long as our nation existed as one who died in defence of his oath and his honour he was all along irresolute at times he did his best short of attacking the ghilzyes at other times he held aloof altogether from the scene at any rate i can feel that my honour is not soiled i was not one of those who signed the treaty but i have done my best to prevent that treaty from being violated had your people sallied out from the cantonments and given us battle i should have fought against them but even had there been no treaty i would not have taken part in the massacre of men who were practically defenceless and who were in no way responsible for the crime of their government i am glad to hear you say so chief i should have been grieved indeed had you taken part in so treacherous and terrible a massacre but how did you learn that i was going to try to make my way down to jellalabad that i have never been able to understand i kept a watch over you the whole time my friend either hassan or one of his men who knew you was always in the camp dressed as one of the camp followers but even then i cannot imagine how he could have told that i was going i knew it myself but a few hours before i started and only major pottinger and three or four of my friends were aware of it my watch was a good one the chief said and when two afghans issued from your tent you may be sure the news was quickly brought to the men who had for some days been lying in readiness and who were prepared to repeat the adventure in the city suddenly to the astonishment of angus azim threw himself on his knees master he exclaimed you can kill me but i own that it was i who betrayed you i had met hassan in the camp and he told me that assuredly no white man would escape alive that it was settled that all should be attacked and slain in the passes he said that sadut khan had resolved to save you but that to do this with certainty it would be necessary that he should be informed as to your movements and where you would ride when the army started he said that unless i helped them it might be impossible to save you then i agreed to do so and met him or one of his men every day as soon as you had left the tent after telling me of your expedition i ran to the spot where i knew i should find hassan and told him that we were going alone he said at once that it would be certain death were you to try to go down the pass and that you must be carried off as soon as you had left the camp i knew well that you would be greatly angered and that if you suspected me you would kill me for my treachery but that was nothing compared to your life and so i turned traitor to you and am willing now that you should order me to be taken out and beheaded angus held out his hand to his faithful follower i should have been angry at firstgrieved and angry too but i cannot be angry now you did what you believed to be best for me and i acknowledge that it has turned out so your treachery was but an act of fidelity and undoubtedly was the means of saving my life you did wrong but it was with the best intentions you ought to have confided in me but i knew that if i did so you would not have consented that is true enough still i was the best judge of what was consistent with my honour however next to sadut khan i owe you my life and it would be but poor gratitude were i to reproach you let us say no more about it i shall remember always that you saved my life and shall forget that you somewhat betrayed my trust i have for four years past regarded you as my friend rather than as my servant and i shall esteem you even more so in the future azim retired with tears of joy in his eyes sadut and angus had a long talk together as if by mutual consent the subject of the late events was avoided and the conversation was upon their journey across the bamian and saduts doings since that time i stayed at khooloom until the governor whom we had trusted implicitly handed over dost mahomeds family and mine to your people i happened to be away at the time and on my return two days later was warned by hassan of what had taken place when dost returned from captivity among the turkomans of course i joined him and accompanied him to kohistan and fought by his side in the battle of purwandurrah the ameer had said no word even to me of his intention to surrender and i was thunderstruck when i heard that he had given himself up i remained there and took part in the attack on the ghoorka regiment at charekar after that i returned home my fortress as you know lies far to the west among the momunds this place does not belong to me but to the husband of a sister of mine she is at present at my place with her husband who is ill and as i wished to be nearer to the scene of action he begged me to use his fort as a residence i desired to hold myself aloof from the negotiations as i knew that most of the chiefs were open at any moment to betray the cause for british gold still i was often down in the city where i own the house to which you were taken i no longer hated your people as infidelsyour kindness to me showed me that there was goodness in your religion as well as in minebut i was still ready to fight against them as the invaders of my country and now chief what do you propose to do with me that is for you to decide my friend i know what you will say but though i may regret it deeply i shall certainly offer no opposition you are my guest and it is not for me to dictate to you i should be happy if you would stay with me till these troubles have passed but i place myself wholly at your disposal whatever you may decide upon thank you indeed it is clear to me that if it is in my power i should immediately rejoin our forces i was sure that that would be your wish and i will send you down with a strong escort to peshawur i would rather join sale at jellalabad sadut khan shook his head in that case he said i shall have rescued you in vain sales force is already besieged and it will be but a repetition of cabul by orders of akbar khan the ghilzye chiefs have all risen the town is practically without fortifications though i hear that the white soldiers have been labouring hard to put the place in a state of defence but if the army at cabul could not withstand us still less will sales force which is only a third of its strength hold jellalabad you forget chief that they are commanded by a man and not by an utterly incapable person they are not dispirited by forced inaction or want of food i do not say that jellalabad may not be taken but i feel sure that it will offer a sturdy resistance and the news of what has happened in the passes will only fill the soldiers with fury at any rate sales is the only force that remains of the army to which i was attached and it is there that it is my duty with your permission to go i am sure that were you in my place that would also be your decision so be it sadut said after a long pause were you to go to peshawur you might meet your death there also as doubtless a force will endeavour to relieve jellalabad and in that case you would certainly go with them they will never force their way through the khyber pass from what i hear the sepoys at peshawur are almost in a state of mutiny the sikhs have sapped their loyalty and have assured them that they will never be able to force the pass and when they do move forward they cannot be depended upon to stand by the british troops so that your danger may be as great one way as another however jellalabad is your choice and not mine the citadel there is strong and when the town is captured as it certainly will be soon the troops can retire there and may hold out until they make terms and are allowed to return to india i do not think they will make terms sadut they have had a terrible lesson as to the manner in which treaties are respected by the greater portion of your chiefs and are not likely to trust again to any promises but will hold out until they have fired their last cartridge they cannot hope to defend themselves sadut said positively akbar khan will himself head the army i do not think sadut that you know yet what a british soldier can do when well led there has been no great battle fought since we entered afghanistan and you must not judge them by the small fights that took place round cabul the soldiers there had lost heart and confidence in their commander it will be a very different thing when you meet them confident in themselves and in their leaders believe me your hosts however large do not frighten them you know how they have overcome many of the best fighting races in india and that in the teeth of odds as great as can be brought against them here i say not a word against the courage of your people but they want discipline and training and even a host of men fighting each for himself cannot withstand the charge of welldisciplined soldiers why did they not come up the passes then to aid their friends because they were deficient in carriage they were in a country altogether hostile to them they had many sick and must have left a strong force to guard them there may have been other reasons of which i know not but these are sufficient for a force to enter these passes without animals to carry their food and their wounded would have been madness and i believe that sale has not more than twelve hundred bayonets a force sufficient to do wonders in the plains but which could hardly fight their way up the passes against thousands of good marksmen as the afghans assuredly are armed with guns which carry much farther than their own and firing in safety behind inaccessible rocks but whether jellalabad can resist all attacks as i believe or whether the place falls is a matter which does not affect my resolution it is my duty to be there and if you will afford me means of getting there i will assuredly go we will start tomorrow then and the sooner we are off the better the news of what has happened in the passes will spread like flame through the country and every fighting man will turn out to complete the work there is a pathway from here which goes straight down to gundamuck i will ride with you with half a dozen of my followers there are plenty of ponies on the hills certainly no questions will be asked no suspicions can arise when we get near jellalabad we shall see how you can best enter i will ride round the place with you as i am a friend of akbars it will be supposed that i am examining the place to see where an attack had best be made there are many orchards and small villages round when we are as near the town as we can get you can slip from your horse as we go through an orchard keep under cover in the gardens until close to the walls when you get within musketshot you can tie a white cloth to your gun and you will then be safe this plan was carried out and two days later after a grateful parting from his preserver angus stood at the edge of the moat opposite one of the gates chapter xvii jellalabad a sentry had already sent down word that two afghans had approached carrying a white flag and an officer appeared on the wall what do you want he asked we want to come in thompson i am angus campbell and have escaped almost by a miracle there was a shout of pleasure and a minute later the gate was opened and thompson ran out and warmly shook angus by the hand i am delighted to see you he said we all thought you among the slain in the passes what an awful time it has been since we left cabul on our way as we believed to india we can scarcely believe the terrible news even now we have learnt but little from brydon who was he thought the only survivor except the hostages who he tells us were given over a few days before the end came he was desperately wounded and could scarce sit his horse when he arrived and has been too ill to give us any details i can give very little for i was not with the army i started the evening before they left camp on a mission from pottinger to sir robert sale pottinger did not think that any help could possibly come but at the same time he thought it right to make one more effort to communicate with your general and to tell him that they were on the point of starting i had gone but a short distance when i was captured fortunately the men who took me were followers of sadut khan i was taken to his fort he was absent at the time when he returned he at once gave me my liberty and escorted me to within a quarter of a mile of the wall as a return for a service i had rendered him two years ago that was a piece of luck indeed then you saw nothing of it yes i saw a great deal my captors were i suppose anxious to see what was going on and we followed the course of the army keeping on the hill and except for the fighting at night i saw almost the whole of the tragedy while they were talking they were approaching the headquarters of the general angus was well known to sir robert to whom he had often carried messages and notes from burnes or macnaghten when their first greeting was over he repeated the story he had told captain thompson he thought it best to say no word of his escape being the result of a preconcerted plan on the part of sadut khan as he felt that some might suspect that he was privy to the scheme and had taken advantage of the friendship of the momund chief to make his escape i am not so surprised as i might otherwise have been the general said since i received a letter from pottinger yesterday akbar had allowed him to send it down thinking that the information that elphinstone shelton lawrence mackenzie and pottinger himself were all right might induce us to submit to terms he said i trust that before this you will have heard that we are about to start from mr angus campbell who nobly accepted the desperate mission of penetrating through the passes and bringing you word of our intention should he have arrived safely i beg to recommend him most strongly to the authorities for accepting the mission which seemed almost a hopeless one he has rendered great service during the time the troops have been in cantonments by aiding the commissariat officers in bringing in grain as you had not arrived we naturally feared that you had been murdered on your way down i am glad indeed that you have escaped you will now of course give your assistance to macgregor our political officer if he cannot utilize my services sir and he can have but little political work to do now i shall be glad if you will attach me to one of the regiments where you think i may be most useful you had better talk it over with macgregor first you know him of course and if he does not want you i will attach you to my own staff with your knowledge of the afghan language your services might be invaluable in obtaining information or should we make a sortieand we have already made one with effecti should be glad if you wish it to attach you either to the infantry or cavalry whichever you prefer now that you have told us about yourself please give us any details you can of what you saw of the fighting it can hardly be said that there was any fighting sir until the last day the troops were so completely surrounded and i may say overwhelmed by the camp followers that they were practically unable to use their arms general shelton with the rearguard fought nobly and covered the retreat into jugduluk until the time when he was enticed with the general into akbars camp and there held as a hostage by what i heard the handful of men left only about a hundred and fifty all told fought desperately to break their way through a barricade with which the afghans had blocked the top of the pass only ten officers succeeded in breaking through and of these all but one were killed on the road all the soldiers died fighting at the barricade and many officers the last sepoy had fallen two days before it has been a bad business general sale said bad not only in its terrible result but in the manner in which affairs were conducted we here received with astonishment the news that four thousand five hundred british troops were cooped up by a horde of afghans without one single attempt being made to bring on a battle in the open officers and men alike were astounded when pottingers first letter arrived saying that negotiations were continued after the murder of macnaghten however all this is a matter for future investigation and now a personal question can you tell me how it was that my wife lady macnaghten and the other ladies escaped uninjured i only know from pottinger that the ladies and children were handed over to the protection of akbar and that those who had husbands were also accompanied by them the ladies were always kept close behind the advanced guard sir as these showed an unbroken front the afghans allowed them to pass without opposition falling upon the confused mass behind them do you think that akbar was a sharer in this treacherous attack i think his conduct was doubtful in the extreme sir he certainly did try more than once to persuade the ghilyze chiefs to allow the survivors to pass on unmolested but by that time the passions of the afghans were absolutely beyond control i myself have great doubts whether he would have interfered had he not been well aware that his interference would be useless but this is only my opinion based upon the facts that in the first place he himself shot macnaghten whom he had invited to a conference in the second place he took no step whatever to carry out the condition to supply baggage animals and provisions and lastly because i know that long before the column set out on its march he sent out orders to the ghilzye chiefs to attack you the case certainly looks very black against him the general said but at least we may hope that as his family are in our hands in india he will protect the hostages i hope sir that he will hand them over to the nawab who appears to me to be a thoroughly honest man undoubtedly he did his best to persuade the chiefs to agree to the treaty with us he certainly did send in some provisions to the camp and generally we formed a high opinion of his kindness of heart your fortifications are stronger than i expected to find them from what i have heard sir yes the men have worked incessantly at them ever since we came here the mud walls can scarcely be said to have existed when we marched in there was no parapet the ditch was filled in with rubbish and the walls had so crumbled away that carts could cross over them at almost every point fortunately the men were in good heart and all europeans and sepoys have worked with an energy beyond praise the moat has been cleared out and filled with water the walls have been scarped and a parapet twelve feet high erected the bastions have been put in order and though had we been seriously attacked at first we must have retired to the citadel we are now ready to withstand any assault angus next went to macgregor who received him most warmly i am glad indeed to see you campbell pottinger mentioned you in his reports as doing invaluable service with boyd and johnson you will not find much in our line here when the sword is once drawn there is nothing for us to do until it becomes a question of our dictating terms a contingency not likely to arise for some time had you hard fighting to get here angus asked no fighting at all as we marched down from gundamuck the natives all supposed that we were on our way to peshawur and when we suddenly turned and marched towards the city it was too late for them to think of resistance and they simply bolted on one side of the town as we marched in on the other we were bitterly disappointed when we saw the state of the walls and it was a question for some time whether we should not content ourselves with holding the citadel only but it was at last determined for a time at least to hold the town as our retirement to the citadel would look like weakness another consideration was that once in the citadel we should be shut up entirely for as you see it stands in the middle of the town and with the streets crowded with the enemy there would be no getting out to obtain provisions the result has proved the wisdom of the step we took the walls are now strong enough to be obstinately defended and from their extent we have been able to sally out at one gate or another and bring in provisions we had but two days food when we arrived here now we have succeeded in gathering in a sufficient quantity to keep the troops on half rations for two months and i hope that before it is finished we shall be relieved from peshawur we gave the natives a handsome thrashing on the day before we got in here they attacked us in great force trying especially to carry off our baggage but the infantry repulsed them splendidly however they came on to renew the attack the cavalry were placed in ambush and the troops after at first advancing suddenly wheeled round and went off at the double the enemy believing that they had achieved a great victory rushed after them as soon as they reached an open space the cavalry fell upon them for months they had been inactive being of no use among the hills now was their chance and in a moment they were in the thick of the afghans they made terrible havoc among them and thus it was that we were able to enter the town without further trouble the next day the th of november broadfoot was appointed garrison engineer he had a small corps of sappers with him and they soon set to work on the morning of the th the enemy were thick in the gardens round the town the principal body being on the hillside it was resolved to give them another lesson they were as could be seen from the highest point in the city some five thousand strong and colonel monteith of the th bengal infantry took out eleven hundred men at daybreak the advance was covered by the guns which had been mounted on the walls and their shrapnel soon drove the enemy into the open the infantry pressed forward and scattered them and the cavalry completed their rout it was this defeat that so cowed them for a time that i was able to fetch in grain sheep firewood and other necessaries i may mention that i took upon myself as soon as we came in here the post of commissariat officer it was not until the end of the month that they again mustered in force sufficient to attack us they contented themselves with hovering round and keeping up a desultory fire on the st of december however they gathered in great numbers and seemed to threaten an attack colonel dennie commanded this time and he took out the greater portion of the garrison and a couple of guns it was noon when he sallied out abbots guns commenced the action by pouring a tremendous fire of grape into the thick mass they fled in wild confusion the cavalry cut them up terribly and the infantry overtook and bayoneted many of them it could scarcely be called a fight the day was won directly the guns opened fire and we did not lose a single man since that time they have not ventured to attack us news came day after day of the terrible mess at cabul the news was kept as far as possible from the troops so as not to discourage them but of course since brydon came in the truth of the terrible massacre had to be told i am happy to say that although filling them with wrath and indignation it has in no way abated their spirit during the six weeks rest we have had since the battle of the st of december we have as you see really done wonders in the way of fortification and consider that we are in a position to repulse any attack however formidable when do you expect that a relief column will arrive from peshawur that is a grave question which i cannot answer our last news was that brigadiergeneral wyld was on the point of advancing but from the tone in which he wrote he had evidently no great hope of success his four sepoy regiments had been corrupted by the sikhs who having themselves a great repugnance to enter the passes had endeavoured and successfully to inspire the sepoys with the same feeling the sikhs who were to cooperate with him were themselves in a state of open mutiny and threatened to kill general avitable if he interfered with them he intended however to advance as the case was so urgent but with little hope of success he was without cavalry and had but two guns on sikh carriages which would probably break down after a few rounds had been fired it was the letter of a brave man surrounded with difficulties but ready to attempt almost the impossible to bring aid to us i fear however that there is little chance of our relief until reinforcements from india reach peshawur this opinion was justified when on the th news was brought that the movement had failed on the th colonel moseley had started under cover of night with the rd and th native regiments to occupy the fortress of ali musjid which had been held by a small corps of men of one of the native tribes under mr mackeson they had been true to their salt and had resisted every attack of the afridis moseleys force arrived there at daybreak and met with but little opposition on the way but it was discovered that owing to some blunder only fifty supply bullocks had been sent on instead of three hundred and fifty that should have accompanied the force therefore instead of having a months provisions they had but enough for a few days brigadier wyld started on the morning of the th to relieve them but on the preceding day the sikh troops refused to enter the pass and marched back to peshawur nevertheless wyld determined to press forward with the two native regiments as soon however as the enemy attacked them the sepoys at the head of the column wavered and opened an aimless fire in vain the brigadier and the officers endeavoured to persuade them to advance they would not move forward nor would the rest of the troops advance to their assistance the two guns broke down after a round or two and what little spirit remained among the sepoys evaporated at once and the column had to fall back one of the guns was spiked and left behind the sepoys refusing to make any effort to bring it off the brigadier who with several of our officers was wounded saw that it was impossible to persevere and the force fell back beyond the pass moseley could obtain no news and was unaware of the repulse of the relieving column although the troops were on half rations supplies were nearly exhausted the water was bad and numbers of the sepoys fell ill and on the rd he determined to evacuate the fortress two officers volunteered to hold it but the sepoys would not support them and the former native garrison had lost heart so on the th the force marched out the afridis mustered strongly to oppose the retreat the sepoys animated now by the hope of safety fought well two british officers were killed most of the baggage lost and some of the sick and wounded had to be abandoned but the main body got through safely such was the news that was brought by a native in our pay together with a letter from brigadier wyld saying that it would be impossible to renew the attempt until reinforcements of at least one british regiment with some guns arrived but the news that help was still far distant in no way discouraged the garrison of jellalabad who redoubled their efforts to strengthen the fortifications and to prepare by their own unaided efforts for the worst at peshawur wylds repulse bore the natural consequences the discontent among the sepoys increased many deserted and expressions of determination never to enter the pass again were common among them sickness broke out and when on the th of february general pollock who had been selected to command the force gathered there and invested with full authority on all other matters arrived he found a thousand men in hospital a week later the number was increased to eighteen hundred no better man than pollock could have been chosen he possessed at once great firmness kindness of heart and a manner calculated to inspire confidence he declared to the central authorities at once that even with the brigade which had come up with him to advance up the pass would be to court another defeat the four sepoy regiments that had been engaged could in their present state not be counted on for service and the force at his disposal was therefore no greater than that which wyld had lost he set to work in the first place to restore confidence it was a difficult task many even among the officers had become affected with the spirit of defection and did not hesitate to express their opinion that an advance through the khyber pass would involve a repetition of the cabul disaster the new sepoy regiments were at once visited by emissaries from those of wylds brigade and from the sikhs who endeavoured in every way to persuade them also to refuse to enter the pass and succeeded in the case of the th native regiment who joined the four other battalions in refusing to advance on the day after his arrival general pollock visited all the hospitals enquired into the ailments of the sick and talked encouragingly to them then he went to the sepoy regiments enquired into the cause of their discontent and exhorted them to return to their duty and not to bring disgrace upon regiments that had so many times in the past proved their courage and loyalty his task was a hard and difficult one but his method of mildness and firmness combined gradually restored their spirits and discipline and the knowledge that reinforcements were on their way with a good proportion of european troops including cavalry and artillery greatly aided his efforts still until these reinforcements arrived pollock could do nothing but reply to the urgent letters of sale and macgregor by pointing out his inability to move on the th of february angus was with macgregor on the walls of jellalabad the men were as usual working hard and steadily grateful in the thought that their long labour had borne its fruits and that in a few days they would be able to lay by their picks and shovels the work that they had been set to do having been accomplished another week captain havelock who was acting as persian interpreter to macgregor said to angus and the whole work which broadfoot traced out will be finished in one respect i am sorry that it should be so for there is nothing like active work for keeping mens spirits up and preventing them from feeling the effects of idleness i think and he stopped abruptly there was a sudden tremor of the earth and a deep sound like thunder then they were both thrown off their feet the walls the houses the whole city swayed and shook then came the crash of falling houses wild shouts of alarm and pain the earth crumbled beneath them and they rolled down together into the moat on finding that they were unhurt they scrambled up the slope of earth a terrible sight presented itself a third of the buildings in the town had fallen but this was not the worst several of the bastions had been destroyed almost all the parapets were thrown down several great breaches were made in the wall one of them eighty feet in length and the moat had in many places been filled up with the debris of the wall and parapet the soldiers were extricating themselves or helping their comrades from the earth that had almost overwhelmed them others were standing gazing with a dazed air at the destruction that had been wrought we had better go to headquarters havelock said and see what has happened there they made their way with difficulty through the ruins that blocked the streets the movements of the earth still continued and they had all they could do to keep their feet on reaching headquarters they found to their satisfaction that all was safe the general and macgregor had both been occupied in writing despatches to peshawur and had rushed out into the little courtyard of the house the offices round it fell in ruins at their feet but the dwellinghouse although it swayed to and fro did not fall enquiries were at once set on foot when it was found that no lives had been lost among the garrison although two natives had been killed by the fall of their houses no time was lost the whole of the garrison were told off into working parties and in half an hour were diligently at work repairing the wall at the most important points they worked until late at night by which time the breaches were scarped the rubbish all cleared away and the ditches dug out again while a parapet of gabions was erected along the great breach a parapet was erected on the remains of the bastion which flanked the approach to the cabul gate that had been entirely ruined a trench had been dug and a temporary parapet raised on every bastion round the place never probably was so much work accomplished by an equal number of men in the same time day after day the work was continued until by the end of the month the parapets were restored the breaches built up the rampart increased in thickness every battery reestablished and the gates entrenched and yet the troops were in hourly anxiety that their work might be again destroyed for during the month succeeding the great earthquake fully a hundred shocks were felt so extraordinary was the vigour with which the repairs had been accomplished that when akbar khan moved down with his forces early in march and saw the formidable defences he and his followers were unable to understand it and declared that the preservation of jellalabad from destruction must have been the result of witchcraft for no other town or village had escaped while at work the garrison had been in constant expectation of attack for akbars army lay but a few miles from the town but the success of the two sorties had shown the afghan leader that he had very different foes to deal with from the dispirited force that had been annihilated in the passes here were men ready to work and to fight while those at cabul had done neither and he resolved to attempt to starve them out hoping for the same success as had attended a similar step at cabul he kept on therefore drawing in more closely harassing the foraging parties and having occasional skirmishes with the bodies of cavalry sent out to protect the grasscutters on the night of the th the enemy threw up sangars small defences of earth or stone at many points round the town and from behind them opened a brisk fire there was a report that behind these shelters they were mining towards the walls and a strong party of infantry and cavalry with two hundred of broadfoots sappers commanded by colonel dennie were sent out as they poured out through the gate akbar advanced with his forces but the guns on the ramparts received them with a heavy fire and although they came on several times as if prepared to give battle they eventually drew back unable to withstand the storm of shot and shrapnel the working parties of sappers set to work to destroy the sangars and in doing so discovered that there was no foundation for the report that the enemy were mining when the work was done the troops began to fall back to the town as ammunition was beginning to run short on seeing their retirement the afghans again advanced but on our troops halting and facing them they at once turned and fled having lost considerably by our artillery and musketry fire dennies force sustained no loss in killed but broadfoot was wounded and the loss of his services as engineer was serious time passed quietly the whole of the ground had been cleared of trees houses and walls for some distance round the town and the afghans were no longer able to crawl up under shelter and keep up a galling fire on our men early in april a messenger brought in news that pollock had now received his reinforcements and would advance in a day or two the sepoys having recovered their health and spirits his force had been joined by the th foot the rd dragoons nine guns and the st native cavalry on the th these started from jumrood brigadier wyld commanded the advance guard general mcaskill the rear two columns of infantry were to scale the height on either side of the pass major davis in command of that on the right colonel moseley of that on the left at three oclock in the morning they started the heights on either side and the pass were crowded with the enemy who were always well informed of the british movements by the natives in the town they expected that the force would all move along the road and anticipated an easy success the two flanking parties moved off so quietly in the dim light of the morning that they were not perceived by the enemy until they began to scale the heights then a lively combat began and the afghans learned for the first time that even among their own hills the british could beat them the difficulties of the ascent were great but the moral of the sepoys was now completely restored and they stormed the heights on either side with great gallantry driving the afghans before them while this was going on the main column in the valley had cleared away a formidable barricade that had been erected at the mouth of the pass and which could not have been destroyed without much loss had the afghans maintained their position on the hills pollock now advanced and the afghans who had assembled in large numbers at the mouth of the pass bewildered at finding themselves outflanked fell back and the column with its great convoy of animals moved forward the number of draught animals was very large although the baggage of the advancing force had been cut down to the narrowest dimensions in order that provisions and ammunition for the garrison at jellalabad might be taken on the march occupied the greater part of the day the heat was great and the troops suffered from thirst but animated by their success they thought little of this and before nightfall bivouacked round ali musjid whose garrison had evacuated the place when they saw that the day had gone against them all night long the afghans kept up a fire from among the hills but did not attempt an attack the sikhs had joined the main body as the general doubtful as to their fidelity had sent them by another pass the generals estimate of them was not a mistaken one they were left to occupy ali musjid and guard the pass but shortly after the army had moved on they quitted the position and marched away seizing some of the baggage animals on their way up and throwing their loads on the ground employing them to carry their own baggage the crushing and altogether unexpected defeat that the tribesmen had suffered had its effect they had found themselves beaten at their own game and withdrew at once to their fastnesses and pollocks force marched on without meeting with any serious opposition chapter xviii the advance on cabul the garrison of jellalabad found themselves pressed for provisions at the end of march and on the st of april made a gallant sortie and swept into the town a flock of five hundred sheep and goats on the th macgregors spies brought in news from akbars camp that it was reported there that pollock had been beaten with great loss in the khyber pass and on the following morning akbars guns fired a royal salute in honour of the supposed victory sale now confident of the fighting powers of his men determined to make a great effort to break up the blockade as if pollock had really been defeated it would be some time before relief could come to them and they could not hope again to make such a capture as that which they had effected on the st a council of war was held and action was decided upon as success would not only free them from all apprehensions of being starved out but would effect a diversion in favour of pollock the force was but a small one for the enterprise which they moved out to undertake the centre column consisting of the th regiment mustering five hundred bayonets was under the command of colonel dennie the right consisting of some three hundred and fifty men of the two native regiments and a detachment of sappers was commanded by captain havelock the left column was about the same strength under lieutenantcolonel monteith the light field battery and a small cavalry force were to support them they advanced from the city at daylight on the th akbar khan drew up his force six thousand strong before his camp his right resting on a fort and his left on the cabul river havelocks column commenced the fight by attacking the enemys left while dennie advanced to the assault of the fort which was vigorously defended dennie himself fell mortally wounded by an afghan ball but his men captured the place in gallant style a general attack now took place on akbars camp the artillery advanced at a gallop and poured their fire into the afghan centre the th and colonel monteiths column pierced their right while havelock drove back their left from the support afforded by the river the afghans fought sturdily their musketry keeping up a heavy fire and large bodies of horse again and again threatened havelocks column while three guns from a hidden battery opened fire the struggle however was a short one their cannon were taken every position held by them was captured and by seven oclock they were in full retreat two cavalry standards were taken four guns lost by the cabul and gundamuck forces were recaptured a vast quantity of ordnance stores destroyed and the whole of the enemys tents burnt the loss of the afghans had been heavy and several chiefs were among the fallen the loss of the victors was small indeed colonel dennie and ten sepoys were killed three officers and some fifty men wounded a day or two later pollocks force reached jellalabad and the joy of both parties was great indeed no stronger contrast can be found than that between the leading and conduct of the force at cabul and that at jellalabad the one showed the british leader and the british soldier at their worst the other the british commander and men at their best it may be confidently affirmed that had sale been in the place of elphinstone with full power of action the fight in the passes would never have taken place and within three days of the murder of burnes the afghan host would have been a mob of fugitives and cabul would have been in our hands the british soldier is always best in the attack he is ready and eager to fight against any odds but when kept in a state of inaction under a commander in whom he has lost all confidence he speedily deteriorates happily there are few examples in our military history such as those of cabul and walcheren where the british soldier has been placed in such a position while pollock was forcing the khyber pass the reign of shah soojah came to a sudden end after the departure of the british no hostility was shown towards him by the afghans and he continued at the bala hissar in the position of nominal sovereign of afghanistan the nawab having willingly resigned the difficult and dangerous post and accepted that of wuzeer he himself had his troubles most restless and dangerous of these afghan leaders was aneenoollahkhan who had played fast and loose with the british while secretly working against them he demanded the surrender to him of the hostages the nawab steadily refused and as threats of force were used against him raised a body of three thousand men for their protection these however were corrupted by aneen but the nawab remained faithful to his trust on the th of april shah soojah left the bala hissar with his retinue to go down to join akbar khan an ambush was laid for him by one of the sons of the nawab these poured in a volley and shah soojah fell dead shot through the head the nawab was filled with horror at the deed and swore an oath never again to see his son beneath his roof or suffer him to be named in his presence while jellalabad was being besieged the situation at candahar had been precarious ghuznee had been captured by the tribesmen after a gallant defence and its garrison had been massacred kelatighilzye was besieged and without hope of succour candahar was surrounded by the insurgent dooranees but these had been twice defeated by general nott during one of these expeditions the city was in imminent danger for the enemy gradually retiring drew the sortieparty a considerable distance from the walls and then at night slipped away and attacked the place one of the gates was destroyed by fire and for many hours the issue of the contest was doubtful at last however the assailants were beaten off with very heavy loss a force marching up to the relief of the town under general england being very badly handled were opposed on their way up from quettah and fell back and remained there until nott sent a peremptory order for them to advance again he himself marched to meet them and on the united force arriving at candahar the town was placed beyond all risk of capture nott was preparing to march on cabul while pollock advanced on jellalabad but to the stupefaction and disappointment of all an order arrived from calcutta for the abandonment of candahar and the return of the force to india there had been a change of governors lord ellenborough had succeeded lord auckland and immediately set to work to overthrow the whole policy of his predecessor similar orders were sent to pollock the latter however mindful of the honour of his country and the safety of the hostages and ladies replied that being almost without carriage it would be impossible for him to retire at once thus gaining time which he utilized by entering into negotiations with akbar khan for the release of their prisoners both generals wisely kept the order they had received a secret from the troops who would have been profoundly disheartened however no secret had been made as to the orders issued in calcutta and the news soon spread all over india and reached pollocks camp that the army was to be withdrawn pollock did his best to throw doubts upon the truth of the reports by marking out a new camp two miles in advance and arranging with the natives to bring in supplies there so as to give grounds for a belief that so far from leaving the town he was preparing for an advance in the meantime he had written an urgent letter pointing out the evils and difficulties of an immediate withdrawal and the immense advantage that would arise by striking a heavy blow before retiring and so to some extent retrieving the reputation of the british army the letter had its influence and the governor wrote it would be desirable undoubtedly before finally quitting afghanistan that you should have an opportunity of striking a blow at the enemy and since circumstances seem to compel you to remain there till october the governorgeneral earnestly hopes that you will be able to draw the enemy into a position in which you may strike such a blow effectually this was good news every effort was being made to collect carriage cattle in hindostan for the purpose of the withdrawal and pollock determined to turn these to account if there was carriage enough to enable him to fall back upon peshawur there would be carriage enough for him to advance on cabul in the meantime negotiations were going on for the release of the captives the married families had on the day of their arrival at akbars camp been placed in a small fort with pottinger lawrence and mackenzie two days later they were taken down to jugduluk where they found general elphinstone brigadier shelton and captain johnson and thence travelled down to a fort the property of the father of akbars wife the party consisted of nine ladies twenty officers and fourteen children seventeen european soldiers two women and a child were confined in another part of the fort here they remained three months two more officers were brought in and a month after their arrival two other survivors major griffiths and captain souter were added to the party on the day after akbars defeat they were hastily taken away and carried to tezeen and thence to a place called zanda far up in the hills general elphinstone had been bedridden for some weeks and was left behind at tezeen where he died akbar khan sent in his remains to jellalabad civil war was raging in cabul shah soojahs second son had succeeded him but he was altogether without power some of the chiefs supported him others opposed but finally the bala hissar was stormed by akbar who was now the most powerful chief in afghanistan pollock was still harassed by letters from lord ellenborough insisting upon his retiring but public opinion throughout india was so opposed to a course that would bring the deepest disgrace upon the british power that at last in august he wrote to nott saying that he must withdraw his force from afghanistan but that if he chose he might take the route through ghuznee and cabul he similarly issued his orders for pollock to retire but added that you will be at liberty to first march to cabul to meet nott both had been preparing for the movement pollock had sent several expeditions against hostile tribesmen and had recovered one of the captured guns on the th of august he left jellalabad with eight thousand troops and on the rd reached gundamuck the next day the village was cleared of a strong body of the enemy while concentrating his troops there and waiting intelligence from nott the british force remained at gundamuck till the th of september on the st futteh jung who had succeeded his father rode into camp akbar khan had stripped him of all power and all his wealth and imprisoned him in the bala hissar from which he had now escaped and with much difficulty made his way to pollocks camp to seek the protection of the british government on the th the first division of the army under the command of sale moved forward the second division under general mcaskill marched on the following day sale found the hills commanding the roads through the jugduluk pass occupied by large bodies of the enemy who opened a heavy fire the guns replied and the infantry then in three columns dashed up the hills and drove the ghilzyes from them one strong body had taken refuge at an apparently inaccessible point but the british storming party scaled the height and the enemy fled without waiting for the assault at close quarters thus on the hills where the afghans had massacred elphinstones troops they were now taught that if well led the british soldier could defeat them in a position they had deemed impregnable at tezeen the second division joined the first the force halted for a day and the afghans believing that this betokened indecision mustered their forces for a final engagement akbar had as he had threatened to do if they advanced sent off the captives to the bamian pass with the intention of selling them as slaves to the turkomans on the th the two armies were face to face the valley of tezeen was commanded on all sides by lofty hills and these now swarmed with men the enemys horse entered the valley but the british squadrons charged them drove them in headlong flight and cut down many the infantry climbed the hills on both sides under a terrible fire from the afghan guns to these they made no reply well knowing that their muskets were no match for the long firearms of the enemy as soon however as they reached the summit they fixed bayonets and charged with a mighty cheer only a few of the enemy stood their ground and fell the rest fled all day firing was kept up until at last the enemy occupying the highest ridges were in spite of a sturdy resistance driven off fairly beaten on their own ground and in their own style of warfare our troops fought with extraordinary bravery they were animated by a desire to wipe out the disgrace that had fallen on our arms and were maddened by the sight of the numerous skeletons of their comrades in the jugduluk akbar khan saw that all was up and fled while the tribesmen scattered to their homes and the army marched forward without opposition to cabul in the meantime nott had been busy on the th of may he inflicted a decisive defeat upon the dooranees outside the walls of candahar on the th of august the army evacuated that city and on the th arrived at mookoor up to this point no opposition whatever had been offered the inhabitants had been friendly and supplies were obtained without difficulty but the afghan governor of ghuznee had raised all the country and had taken up a very strong position near the source of the turnuck on the th the forces met the position of the enemy was unknown as a thick mist covered the country the cavalry rode forward to reconnoitre cut up a party of afghan infantry in the plain and pursuing them hotly came upon hills crowded by the enemy who opened a heavy fire they fell back in an orderly manner when a body of the enemys horse appeared on the hill above them a squadron of native cavalry charged them but were cut up by the fire of a body of afghan foot who had hitherto been hidden the enemys horse poured down and the troopers already suffering from the infantry fire turned and fled the panic spread and the whole of the cavalry were soon in flight two british officers had been killed and three wounded and fiftysix men disabled nott on hearing the loss marched out with his infantry but on reaching the scene of the fight found that the enemy had retired on the afternoon of the next day nott marching forward came upon a fort held by the enemy our artillery opened upon it with little effect the afghan army some ten thousand strong had been watching us and now opened an artillery fire from the heights and its foot men moved forward to the attack but as they neared us our infantry charged with a cheer and they broke and fled two of their guns and their tents magazines and stores were captured on the th of september nott encamped before ghuznee and began to prepare for the assault the enemy however were in no humour for fighting the greater portion of the tribesmen had scattered to their homes after their defeat the garrison lost heart altogether and evacuated the city and the governor set off with a few followers for cabul the next morning the british entered the town without firing a shot on the following day however the governor returned with a large number of the tribesmen who had just arrived and on the th nott attacked them a hard battle was fought but it was indecisive on the following morning the enemy disappeared they had received the news of the defeat of akbar at tezeen the column however was again harassed when the troops advanced but they cleared the way in good style the tribesmen here had been actively engaged in the cabul insurrection and twentysix of their forts were burned as punishment on the th the army encamped four miles from the city and learned that pollock had occupied cabul two days previously angus campbell had taken no part in the operations of that advance on the th of august news had arrived at gundamuck by a messenger from the moonshee mohun lal who had throughout kept the force at jellalabad well supplied with news of what was passing at cabul he now sent to say that on the previous day akbar had despatched all the captives under an escort of three hundred horse to bamian and that they were to be taken on to khooloom and there handed over to the governor once there it was certain that they would remain in captivity among the tribes until death released them as soon as he heard the news angus went to macgregor i am going to ask he said if you will allow me to go on an expedition on my own account i was thinking that it was just possible that the captives might be overtaken it is probable that they will halt some time at bamian and certainly we could come up to them there with so many women and children it will be impossible for the convoy to move fast and they may stay at bamian until the result of our operations here are known you have already promised me that the part taken by sadut khan shall be forgiven seeing that he did his best to persuade akbar to give protection to the retreating army and also because he showed great kindness to me when i was in his hands if you can obtain permission from the general i will start at once in disguise for his fort in the mountain i cannot but think that he will aid me and i might with four of his followers who have come from bamian and are personally well known to me succeed in some way in rescuing at least a few of the captives eldred pottinger captain boyd and captain johnson are all dear friends of mine and i would willingly run any risk in the endeavour to save them possibly if we overtake the party we may in some way cause a delay which would enable any rescue party sent off when you reach cabul to get up in time it is a brave offer campbell but the enterprise seems to me an almost desperate one however i dont think that i should be justified in refusing it and i am sure that if anyone could succeed you will do so when will you start in ten minutes sir if you will furnish me with an authority to offer a bribe to the officer in command of their escort i will go and see the general at once he is well aware from the report that i have made of the kindness sadut showed you and of his efforts to save our army i have no doubt that the chief has fought against us in the last battle but that was only natural i feel sure that above all things pollock would embrace any offer that promises the slightest chance of rescuing the hostages but the risk would be terrible campbell of course there would be risk angus agreed but i do not see how it would be exceptionally great i have journeyed as an afghan two or three times already without detection and i could just as well do so again at any rate i am willing to undertake the enterprise it would of course be useful for me to take a considerable sum of money to win over the guard still more useful if the general would authorize me to offer terms that would tempt the cupidity of the commander as we have always found that the afghans are ready to do almost anything for bribes i will take you at once with me to the general he is well acquainted with the services you rendered pottinger at herat and have rendered the army ever since it began its march from the indus and he knows the favourable report that has been sent in by pottinger and burnes angus had indeed been introduced by sir robert sale to general pollock on his arrival at cabul on reaching his tent they found him for the moment unoccupied he listened gravely to macgregors statement of the offer that angus had made it is a noble proposal mr campbell he said in his usual kindly and courteous way but the risk seems to me terrible and should anything happen to you the service would be deprived of one of its most promising and meritorious officers at the same time there seems a fair possibility that you may succeed in rescuing one or more of the captives of course it would be quite out of the question that any of the ladies could escape there would be a hot pursuit and only horsemen well mounted could hope to get off however i do not feel justified in refusing any offer that affords a shadow of hope of saving such men as pottinger and will do all that mr macgregor suggests to facilitate your operations you will doubtless pass through cabul and i will at once write a letter to mohun lal requesting him to give you authority in his name as well as mine for payment to the leader of the prisoners escort of any sum in reason at present native opinion is strong that we shall not be able to force the passes and the name of the moonshee may have greater effect than any promise on my part but at the same time until you can get into communication with the captives and learn something of the officer and his disposition it would be madness to attempt to bribe him the difficulties of the journey appear to me to be great but not insuperable the real difficulty will only begin when you overtake the captives escort i feel that sir but i rely greatly upon the men i hope to obtain from sadut although not of his tribe they have attached themselves most strongly to him they are strong resolute men and as one of them was a petty chief near bamian he may be able to gather a few others to aid me i shall of course be very glad to have authority to offer a bribe to the officer in command of the party but i rely chiefly upon these men and my own efforts at any rate as far as pottinger is concerned captains boyd and johnson can hardly leave their families possibly by the aid of these men i may be able to collect a sufficient number of fighting men to make a sudden attack upon the escort and to carry off all the captives to some hidingplace among the hills and there keep them until you send on a force to bring them in of course i must be entirely guided by circumstances but it is impossible for me to have any fixed plan until i see how matters stand i can quite see that mr campbell and that greatly as you may desire to rescue the whole party it is eldred pottinger who is the first object of your expedition that is so colonel he was most kind to me in herat and it is to him i owe my present position therefore he is my first object if i can free him it will be a great step gained towards rescuing the others i feel sure that he would not think for a moment of leaving his companions to their fate but his name as the defender of herat is known to every afghan and he would be able to bring a great influence to bear upon the tribesmen round bamian whose interests must lie quite as much with herat as with cabul the general nodded approvingly i see that you have thought matters over well if you will call here again in half an hour the letter for the moonshee shall be ready for you and a thousand pounds in gold at the appointed time angus called upon the general and received the money and letter then returning to his own tent he rode out with azim when fairly away from the camp they dismounted and put on their afghan disguises they had brought an orderly with them who took back the clothes they had discarded and anguss sword to macgregors tent he having undertaken to have them brought up to cabul with his own baggage they had no difficulty as to the way as the path they had followed with sadut had come down close to gundamuck they had little fear of being interfered with on the road the afghans would have gathered in the passes and should they meet any they would only have to say that their village near gundamuck had been burnt by the british and they were now on their way to join sadut and fight under his orders although they saw several parties in the distance making their way towards the pass they did not encounter any within speaking distance and just at sunset reached saduts fort they had passed through the village unnoticed tribesmen were frequently coming and going and there was nothing to distinguish them from others they dismounted in front of the fort a man was sitting at the top of a ladder and angus held up his hand to him and hassanfor it was the man who had twice captured himat once waved his hand in welcome and stood up you have come willingly this time he said with a smile as angus reached him of course you wish to see sadut khan he is within it is lucky that you have arrived today for tomorrow he sets out sadut greeted him with pleasure mingled with surprise i did not expect to see you here my friend no i suppose not chief but i am on a mission with which i am sure you will sympathize and in which i hope you will aid me so far as to spare me hassan and his four men what is its nature the chief asked i know that you would not come and offer me english money to abstain from fighting again i should not think of such a thing sadut i know that you are a fair and open enemy and i think the better of you for fighting for your country i may say that general pollock has been informed of your kindness to me and that you did your utmost to make akbar keep his word to grant protection to the retiring army and i can assure you that in any event no harm will happen to you or yours i will tell you what i have come for do you know that all the hostages ladies and children have been sent away by akbar from cabul that they are to be taken over the bamian pass to khooloom and handed over to the governor there and that doubtless they will be sold as slaves to the turkomans i had not heard it sadut said angrily it is a disgrace to us they were delivered up trusting to our word and honour and it is a foul deed of akbar to harm them in any way after taking his oath for their protection it is infamous infamous and he walked up and down the room in fierce indignation what should we say he burst out if the families of dost mahomed and akbar himself were to be sold by your people as slaves to some barbarous race could we complain if when the news of this treatment of the hostages becomes known in india dost mahomeds family should be treated in a similar way then he stopped abruptly what is it that you have come to ask of me the thing is done and cannot be undone akbar and i are ill friends now for i have bearded him in the council and denounced his conduct certainly i have no influence that could assist you i am an afghan and am pledged to join the force that will oppose the march of your troops up the passes and i am a man of my word but even were i free to help you i could be of little assistance i have here not more than thirty or forty fighting men and i doubt if even these would obey me on such an enterprise i might ride to my own fort and summon the momunds whom i have so far kept quiet but the enterprise would be a desperate one we should set all the other tribes against us and they would not risk destruction merely for the sake of rescuing a few white men and women their sympathies are all with the tribes round cabul and they share in their hatred of the infidel invaders it would be as much as i could do to keep them quiet and certainly i should fail if i called upon them to embark on such an enterprise i have no intention of asking it of you chief i am going myself to see what can be done to save my friends and have come to ask you to allow hassan and his men to go with me they are from bamian and at bamian it is likely that the captives will be kept for some time i should of course pay them well for their aid you can take them the chief said at once they are good men and faithful to me and i rely upon them as i could not do on any of my own tribesmen i will call them in at once hassan and his four men entered the room a minute later hassan sadut said you and your men have proved yourselves true and faithful followers from the day when you left your homes to carry me over the passes although you all thought that there was no hope of our getting through you have fought by my side in kohistan you twice at my orders carried off my friend here he appreciates the service you did him and is in sore need of five men upon whom he can rely to the utmost he has come to ask me to let you go with him a sore disgrace has fallen upon our nation akbar khan has sent the men who placed themselves in his hands as hostages and the women whom he swore to protect over the hindoo koosh to be sold as slaves to the usbegs my word has been given to fight against the army of gundamuck if it attempts to ascend the passes and i at least will keep faith this british officer is going to attempt to free some of the captives how he will do so i know not but my best wishes will go with him he thinks it likely that the escort of the prisoners will halt for some little time at bamian and you more than any others might therefore be able to help i do not order you to go but i ask you to do so it is a good work and concerns the honour of every afghan and moreover angus said i will pay a thousand rupees to you and five hundred to each of your followers i will hand them over to you at once and if we are successful i will pay you as much more the sum was a huge one in their eyes it would suffice to settle them in comfort for the rest of their lives hassan looked at his men and saw by the expression of their faces that they were more than willing to accept the offer he held out his hand to angus we are your servants he said and will serve you truly and if needs be lay down our lives for you not only for the sake of the money you offer us but because sadut khan has told us that for the honour of the nation these people ought to be released we have been comrades in danger before and were nigh dead when you rescued us when buried in the snow i see not how this enterprise can be carried out but we will do what you tell us and men cannot do more when do we start every hour is of consequence angus replied can you find your way across the mountains in the dark if so we will start at once i certainly can find the way you must all have a meal first sadut said besides you will need horses they shall be brought in and got ready for you in an hour see that the english officers horses have a good feed and that his servant eats with you the food will be ready in half an hour no time was lost and in an hour and a half after the arrival of angus at the fort the party set out fortunately the moon was nearly full and hassan had so frequently gone down to cabul from the fort that he had no difficulty whatever in following the track this in many places was so steep that all had to dismount and lead their horses down however they reached cabul an hour before sunrise and all lay down in an empty hut for three or four hours sleep then angus with hassan and three of his men entered the town leaving azim and the other man to look after the horses as there were numbers of tribesmen in the streets they attracted no attention whatever proceeding to the house of the moonshee angus enquired if mohun lal was in he is busy he does not grant audiences till ten oclock angus moved away and returned at halfpast nine already five or six persons were waiting to see the moonshee and by ten the number had considerably increased it was eleven before anguss turn arrived the moonshee was alone angus took out his letter and handed it to him he knew mohun lal well having often taken communications to him from burnes the afghan read the letter and looked up in surprise you are well disguised indeed sahib he said rising for often as i have seen you before i did not recognize you in the slightest but thought it was as usual an afghan peasant with complaints to make against plunderers so you have undertaken the dangerous mission of endeavouring to rescue some of the prisoners truly you english have courage thus to thrust yourself into the midst of enemies and on such a mission however i will do what i can to help you i do not say that it is altogether hopeless for i know my man the commander of the escort is saleh mahomed he is an adventurer and has served under many masters he was at one time a subaltern in one of your native regiments but deserted with his men to dost mahomed just before the fight at bamian such a man might be bought over but not cheaply general pollock said he left the sum to be offered to him entirely to you mohun lal thought for some time and then said i should say that a pension of a thousand rupees a month and a present of thirty thousand would tempt him as much as a larger sum it would i think be best for you to disguise yourself now as a cashmerian you know syud moorteza i know him well angus said he helped captain johnson to collect grain from the villages it would be as well for you to use his name as an afghan saleh might doubt you altogether it would be more likely that a man who may be considered a neutral should be employed on such a mission and the offer to sell goods would make an opening of course you could take the dress you now wear with you in case of necessity it would be too dangerous for me to give you a letter for if saleh when you opened the subject to him at once ordered you to be arrested it would certainly be found on you and would cost me my life you will require to take a small escort with you or you might be robbed at the first place you come to i have five men with me angus replied they come from bamian one of them is a petty chief there and might if i find that saleh cannot be approached persuade or bribe some of the people there to aid i fear you would not succeed in that way saleh had i believe two hundred and fifty men with him i suppose you will start at once our horses are outside the town and we shall mount as soon as i return to them i wish you good fortune there are many afghans who feel deeply the disgrace akbar has brought upon himself and upon all of us by breaking his plighted word taking leave of the moonshee angus joined his companions and after having bought in the bazaar a costume suitable for a trader from cashmere and two bales of goods from that country left the city chapter xix the british captives why are you going as a cashmerian hassan asked i thought that you were going in the disguise that you now have on i had intended to hassan but mohun lal suggested that as a trader i should have more chance of going among the escort than as an afghan and i see that this would be so and moreover as afghans can enter into fellowship with the men of the escort better than i can and as you come from bamian no doubt would arise as to the truth of your story namely that having been absent for more than two years from home you were anxious to get home and that as this trader had offered you money to serve as his escort it was a good opportunity for you to return hassan nodded that makes a good story of it certainly the change of disguise was made two ponies were purchased to carry the bales of goods and provisions for the journey and they then started in buying his goods angus had only purchased two costly shawls which he intended as a present for saleh or if he failed with him for one of the officers under him with this exception the bales were filled with trifles such as might tempt the soldiers and with stuffs which would he was sure be very welcome to the ladies who must naturally be in a sore plight for garments as what baggage they had started with must have been lost in the passes and they could have had little opportunity of replenishing their wardrobe during their captivity they travelled rapidly halting only for a few hours when it was necessary to give their horses a rest as the ladies were carried in litters and there was no reason why they should be hurried on their journey angus knew that he must be gaining fast upon the captives and their escort and indeed he reached bamian only a few hours after them he put up at a little khan while hassan and his men went off to their village to see the families from whom they had been so long separated hassan found his wife in undisturbed possession of the little fort and there was great joy in the village when it was found that he and his men had returned with funds that would enable them to pass the coming winter in comfort and largely to increase their stock of animals that evening two or three sheep were killed and a general feast was held in honour of the return of the chief and his followers as nothing was talked of in the little town but the arrival of the british captives angus had no difficulty in learning that these had been lodged in a little fort close to the place he did not attempt to open his bales of goods although several of the people came to him to ask him to do so for so few traders had visited the place since the troubles began that the stores had long been empty there had too been a good deal of plundering since the british force there had retired angus was obliged to explain that he had only brought a few trifles with him as his purpose was to buy turkoman carpets and other goods at khooloom and that he had sold off almost all the stock he had brought from cashmere at cabul leaving azim at the khan to see that his goods were not stolen he strolled out the place was full of the men of the escort who showed much discontent on finding that neither fruit nor any other of the little luxuries to which they were accustomed could be bought at bamian angus had no difficulty in entering into conversation with some of them he had brought with him a considerable quantity of good tobacco and when he produced a pouch and invited them to fill their pipes he at once won their goodwill how quickly have you come from cabul was there any news when you left there we have travelled fast he said you have had three days start of us and i arrived here this afternoon no there was no news they say that the infidels are halting at gundamuck the chiefs are gathering in the passes with all their forces but have not yet moved i should have thought that they would have had enough of our passes they will meet with the same fate as those who tried to go down them it should be so angus replied who can withstand your people when they are fighting among your own hills you must have travelled slowly since we gained three days upon you we made very short journeys the man said you see we were encumbered with these women and children for whom it must have been rough work for the nights are already cold i shall be glad when we get to khooloom and hand them over to the governor there but i will say for them that they have borne up bravely i can tell you that we are all disgusted at having to be making this journey with them instead of taking our share of the spoil that will be gathered in the passes yes it must be annoying to brave men to be thus wasting their time when great things are being done to say nothing of losing their share of the booty to be gathered have you a good commander yes we have no cause to grumble on that account saleh mahomed is a bold soldier and a cheerful fellow is not unduly harsh and as long as we keep our arms in good order and obey his orders he asks no questions when one of us comes in with a sheep fastened to his saddle but there has been no chance of getting anything to help out our rations for the two or three little villages we have passed since we left the valley are for the most part deserted there are women there but the men have not yet come down from the hills with the flocks and none of us have tasted meat since we started saleh mahomed is a man who has travelled much and seen many things he was an officer in the english army but he would not fight against us and two years ago when dost mahomed with his army came here he went over to him with his company of sepoys he was not a chief but was a tribesman near the frontier there are many of them they say in the service of the infidels and he had done well for himself i suppose the captive women must be in want of warm clothes i have not a large stock of goods but among them are several warm robes which i would sell cheaply to them for i wish to clear away my remaining stock as i intend to buy turkoman carpets at khooloom and balkh and besides these i have some stuff which doubtless the women here would buy to make garments for the children think you that saleh would let me traffic with them that i could not say but if you have anything in your pack that would please him he might perhaps let you do so you seem a good fellow if you like i will take you to him tomorrow morning thank you for your offer when i meet you i will have a pound of good tobacco which i shall beg you to accept i will be here i shall be one of the guards tonight round the fort but shall be free in the morning does saleh mahomed sleep there no it is a miserable and dirty place he lodges at the house of the headman there early in the morning hassan came down to the khan now sahib you have only to tell us what you want us to do and you can rely upon us for the present there is nothing i am going to see saleh mahomed this morning and try to get permission to sell some of my goods to the captives i may then be able to learn something of his disposition towards them and how he behaved to them during the journey it is important that i should know this before giving him the message from the moonshee it would be well to do so master but from what i hear the moonshee has been negotiating with many of the chiefs who are willing enough to take his money but who do not carry out their part of the bargain however i have not heard that any of them have denounced him he is always considered to be the chief agent of the english but as he spends english gold freely and as it is well to have some one in cabul through whom negotiations could be entered into with them no one interferes with him the only thing that you can do for the present is to go round among your friends talk to them about the captives and say that it is a disgrace that they should be sent as captives among the usbegs after having received promises of protection and having willingly submitted themselves as hostages of course you will do it carefully but if you can create a feeling in their favour and make them afterwards win over a portion of the escort something might be done of course you can say and truly that sadut khan dost mahomeds nephew by marriage is most indignant at this breach of faith and that you believe that many other chiefs share his feeling i will set about it at once the tribesmen here have not the same animosity against the english as those at cabul the english troops when they were here behaved well they took no mans goods without payment and the tribesmen got better prices for their sheep and cattle than they had ever got before they care little who rules at cabul and it is nothing to them whether it is the barukzyes or a dooranee the next morning angus met the afghan soldier here is the tobacco i promised you it is good stuff if it is like that you gave me yesterday i shall be very content now come with me to saleh he is a good fellow if you find him in the humour the officer was alone when they entered saleh mahomed the soldier said this is a trader from cashmere syud moorteza he will tell you his business he seems to be a good fellow and has some excellent tobacco having thus introduced angus he left the room what is it that you want with me saleh asked in persian angus replied in the same language i am a trader my lord and wish to get rid of some of the wares i am carrying they are but few as i am going north to purchase and not to sell i would willingly rid myself of a part of them among them are warm dresses and stuffs i am told that the persons in your charge are but thinly clad and i doubt not that they would willingly buy these goods of me the afghan laughed they would willingly have them no doubt but as to buying they are altogether without money those who were in charge of them saw to that before they were handed over to me i should not mind that my lord i have had dealings with englishmen who have come up to cashmere and they generally take a store of shawls and other things back with them to india we always find that they are true to their word and we take their orders as willingly as goldmore so indeed because the shroffs in india take them anywhere and it saves our having to send money there for the purchase of goods in india thus then if they gave me orders on their people at calcutta or bombay i would more willingly accept them than gold which is a dangerous commodity to carry but you say that you are going to purchase goods that is so my lord but i do not carry money to do so i pay for them with orders upon a merchant at herat to whom i am wellknown and who acts as my agent and buys for me such goods as i require from persia i have not come emptyhanded to you my lord it is right that if you do me the favour of allowing me to trade with your prisoners you should share in the benefit i have with me here a cashmere shawl i do not say that it is worthy of your acceptance but it is handsome and of the best wool and will make a warm girdle saleh was fond of finery let me look at it he said angus undid the parcel and held the shawl up and closely watched the afghan as he examined it he saw that he was pleased with it however the chief said i say not that it is not a good shawl but it is not of the best quality i have been at srinagar tis not of the best my lordi would not try to deceive one like yourselfbut it is the best i have and i can hardly hope to make more than its value from these people it is worth about two hundred rupees saleh said your lordship is not to be deceived that is the very sum i gave for it but it is worth much more here you seem to be an honest man saleh said throwing the shawl down on the divan from which he had risen and in truth i should be well content that the prisoners were better supplied with garments in the cold weather that is setting in i am ordered to conduct them safely to khooloom but nought was said against my providing them with such comforts on the way as they could obtain today i am busy i have to see that the men are well quartered and fed tomorrow if you come here with your goods i will myself take you to the place where they are confined but mind that no word is said to them save concerning your merchandise what words should i say my lord but doubtless one of your men will be present and see that i confine myself to my business then come at this hour tomorrow angus bowed deeply and then left delighted that he had obtained permission to see the captives that day the prisoners were taken to another fort saleh being moved by their complaints of the dirt and want of accommodation in the little fort in which they were crowded the place was but a little better than the one they had left but there was somewhat more room hassan came to angus in the evening i have seen many of my friends he said and have spoken as you told me they are indignant i told them that dost mahomed and his family and that of akbar are honourably treated in india and are allowed a large income by the government there and live with every comfort and luxury and it is a disgrace to our nation that such treatment should be meted out to the officers who are hostages and the ladies and their families i do not say that they will be disposed to hazard their own safety by taking any active measures but if the soldiers were to show any disposition favourable to the captives they would assuredly take no hostile steps against them i have strong hopes that i may succeed with saleh he has taken a bribe from me to permit me to sell goods to the prisoners and he may be willing to take a vastly greater one to release them my men have been going about among the soldiers sahib they are discontented at this journey they have taken and at the prospect of a still farther one and if their commander gave them the order to return they would not i think hesitate to obey let your men continue at that work but let them be careful not to appear to be too warmly interested let them avoid at present all mention of captives and simply inflame the mens minds by talking of the hardships of their being sent on such a journey when so much booty is likely to be picked up in the passes it is not likely that if saleh orders them to proceed on their journey they will refuse to do so but if he learns from his officers that the men would gladly obey him if he ordered them to return it may help him to decide to accept the offer i have to make him i shall put off doing so till the last moment because at any time news may come that pollock and nott are both beating back all opposition and advancing on cabul and in that case he may see that his interest lies in siding with them rather than with akbar in the morning angus rode with saleh to the fort azim following with the pony carrying the bales of goods two men stood as sentries on the platform on the top of the plain half a dozen others were posted round it the officer in charge came out have you anything to report suleiman no captain except that the prisoners complain that this place is little better than the last they were confined in they are particular these ladies and gentlemen saleh said with a laugh the place might be better no doubt but they will be lucky if they do not find themselves very much worse lodged when they get among the usbegs major pottinger was asking captain that a few blankets should be given them for the use of the women and children we will see about it however this trader here has some warm robes to sell and they may just as well pay for the things themselves as that i should put my hand into my pocket for my instructions said nothing about buying things of this sort for them and from the manner in which prince akbar gave me my orders i should say that the more they suffered the better he would be pleased however i am sorry for them and have given permission to this cashmerian to see them and try to sell his goods to them the officer looked doubtful i do not think there is a rupee among them no but the trader has faith that if they give him notes for his goods their people will assuredly cash them he must be a very confiding fellow the officer said no by what he says the shroffs of all the large cities in india are always ready to take the notes of english officers and that he himself has done so in cashmere at any rate you can take him up to their apartments but remain in the room while he bargains with them i do not mind his carrying on his trade but see that he in no way communicates with them save in the matter of his business saleh went up with angus followed by the officer and azim who was assisted by the soldiers to carry up the goods a sentry was sitting before the door at the top of the stairs with his musket across his knee as saleh came up he rose and took a key hanging on a nail on the wall beside him and opened the door i hear that you are still not content with your lodging captain johnson saleh said as he entered well what would you have these towers are all alike and do not come up to our ideas of comfort in cabul and as glass is scarcely known in bamian no doubt you feel it cold at night illustration angus shows his goods to the prisoners if we had a few blankets to hang across the windows the ladies would not feel it so much saleh that is so and as i am anxious that they should not while under my charge feel greater discomfort than necessary i have permitted this trader syud moorteza to enter he has he tells me some warm robes and other things which he is ready to sell and as i told him that before you came into my charge all your money had been taken away he is ready to take your notes upon a banker at calcutta or bombay in payment captain johnson knew the cashmerian as he had rendered invaluable assistance in obtaining grain angus who was acquainted with him had the more willingly adopted his name because the man was about his own height and build and there was even some resemblance in feature captain johnson therefore looked with interest at the trader who was standing a little behind saleh for a moment he seemed puzzled but angus had his hand on his chin and suddenly moved two fingers across his lips and very slightly shook his head johnson understood the gesture and replied to saleh the man is right he may be sure that whatever happens to us our friends will see that he is paid for any goods we may buy of him we will write a letter in persian which you can read to our friends saying that this man has trusted us and that our orders are to be honoured the ladies who were in the next room were called in the afghan commander who had nothing to do remained with his officer being interested in the contents of the traders bales azim opened them and spread the articles out on the floor for inspection angus was greatly concerned at the appearance of the ladies to all of whom he was known his disguise however had so completely changed his appearance that none of them recognized him his face was darkened his eyebrows and hair had been stained black and by the assistance of some false hair the latter was arranged in the fashion worn by the man he represented syud moorteza was of the hindoo religion and angus had imitated his caste marks on the forehead which alone greatly altered his appearance but the ladies scarcely looked at him their delight at seeing the warm robes and woollen cloths was great indeed here was a prospect that their sufferings from cold would be alleviated and that their children could now be warmly clad among the smaller articles in his bale angus included a good supply of needles and thread buttons and other small necessaries the ladies saw at once that from the soft woolen cloths they would be able to make an abundance of warm clothing for the children angus expatiated after the manner of a trader on the quality of his goods holding up a warm robe to captain johnson he said this would suit you my lord it will keep you warm in the coldest night you have not more than enough for the ladies captain johnson said if there is anything over after they have made their purchases we shall be glad to take the rest of your cloth we can wind it round us but feel the quality of this robe my lord angus urged with a wink that was understood by the officer who at once took hold of it as he did so angus slipped a note which he had folded to the smallest possible dimensions into his hands yes it is good material he said quietly but as i have just said these must be for the ladies and he turned away as if unwilling to be tempted and presently sauntered into the next room in order to keep up his character angus asked fully five times the proper value for his goods but the captives had no thought of bargaining for these goods would be of the greatest comfort to themselves and their children as coverings for the night and as wraps during the passage of the passes for in addition to the clothes and cloth there were silk mufflers for the neck and warm jackets lined with astrakhan fur nor were the needles and thread less prized their clothes and those of the children were in rags and they would be most useful for mending as well as the making of new clothes some of them almost cried with joy at the thought of the comfort that this would be to their little ones in a few minutes the greater portion of the contents of the bales was disposed of the best way pottinger said will be for lawrence mackenzie and myself as the three political officers to give this man an order signed by the three of us on our agent at calcutta and i will write an open letter to accompany it authorizing any british officer or banker to cash the note when it is presented and to send it on to my agent the man has done us an inestimable service and it will facilitate his getting the money where are you thinking of cashing this he asked at herat then i will also give you a note to a trader there he has a shop in the great bazaar and is a friend of mine he has relations with business men in india and will i am sure cash it for you at once should you desire cash or will furnish you in exchange with bills on some merchant in candahar he then mentioned the traders name that will suit me well angus said i know the man by name having been myself at herat he is of good repute and i am sure that he or any other merchant having dealings in india would gladly cash the order as it would be far safer to send than money it was not until the purchases had all been made that captain johnson reentered the room came and stood by angus asking a few questions as to the goods when the two afghans were looking another way he passed a note into the pretended merchants hand presently he said but we have no pen and ink to write this order i have them sahib angus said taking an inkbottle and pen such as were always carried by traders from his pocket together with several sheets of paper the price of all the goods was added up then pottinger wrote an order for the amount which was signed by himself lawrence and mackenzie then johnson took pottinger aside as if to discuss the terms of the letters that man is not syud moorteza at all he said dont turn round and look at him he has given me a note and i am answering it who do you think it is i have been a little puzzled not by his face but by his voice i have it nowit is angus campbell you have guessed right he has come up by himself through the passes to try and overtake us he bears a message from mohun lal to saleh saying that he shall be given a pension of a thousand rupees a month and a present of thirty thousand if he will hand over the captives to the british general when he reaches cabul he has asked my opinion as to whether it would be safe to make the proposition to the man or whether he had better wait until news comes that pollock has defeated akbar in the passes i have told him that i have already sounded saleh and that though he passed the matter off i believe he is open to take a bribe if he hears that nott and pollock are making their way up he says that if bad news comesand i think it would then be useless to approach salehhe will make an attempt with some men he has with him to effect your escape and also mine and that of mackenzie and lawrence boyd of course would not leave his wife and family and it would be impossible to take the women and children with us campbell is a splendid fellow pottinger said he behaved wonderfully well at herat and i was sure that in time he would make a very fine officer it is a noble thing his undertaking such a tremendous risk the letters were now written and handed to angus saleh however took them from his hands and read them and then handed them back after assuring himself that there was nothing written but what had been agreed upon then he and the officer went downstairs with angus and azim the latter carrying easily enough the one small bale that sufficed for the goods unsold you have made a nice sum out of this saleh said i have had a long journey with my goods angus replied humbly but they were well contented and paid without bargaining the prices i asked i feel my lord that i am greatly indebted to you for the opportunity i have not money with mewe traders never carry cash and i shall have to wait many months before i receive the price of the goodsnevertheless my lord i will willingly give you in token of my gratitude another shawl equal to the last i have brought with me only two and you can select any goods you like from those remaining there are many silk things among them for they only bought such as were needed for wear saleh was well satisfied and telling angus that he might call round in the evening with some of the silk embroidered scarfs he allowed him to return to the camp two days passed and then a horseman rode in with the news that akbar had been defeated at tezeen but would fight another battle and as he was being joined by many chiefs would doubtless overthrow the infidels the news spread rapidly and caused much excitement in the camp which was heightened by the fact that the man said that there was a report that ghuznee had been captured by the british force that was marching from candahar angus went in the evening and requested a private interview with saleh as johnson had told him in his note the afghan had already been revolving in his mind whether he could not do better for himself by halting at bamian until he knew how affairs would turn out at cabul johnson who had become very intimate with him on the journey had said casually that the british government would assuredly pay a large sum for the return of the captives he had taken no notice of the remark at the time but had thought a good deal of it he knew that money had been lavishly spent among the chiefs and it seemed to him that he too might have a share in the golden flood he was a shrewd man as well as an unscrupulous one he had three times before deserted his employers when better offers had been made to him and it seemed to him that he had it now in his power to procure a sum that would make him rich for life he had been told by his subofficers that there was a growing disaffection among the men that many of them openly grumbled at the prospect of the journey to khooloom and that some of the bamian petty chiefs had been going among them and they believed stirring up a feeling against the journey he had from the first entertained some suspicion of this cashmerian trader why should he not have bought a larger store of indian goods to exchange with the turkomans his doubt as to the best course to pursue had been heightened at the news that he had received that afternoon what would happen if the british again settled down at cabul they would doubtless send a force to endeavour to rescue the captives and although he might be at khooloom before they did so his situation would then be a most unpleasant one akbar as a fugitive could no longer pay him and his troops they would of course leave him and he would not dare to return to cabul he was thinking over these matters when angus was ushered in the latter had already decided that he would for the present maintain the character that he had assumed if saleh knew that he was a british officer he would assuredly if he remained faithful to his charge arrest him also but as merely the agent of mohun lal one of the most influential men in cabul the afghan would probably allow him to depart unharmed even if he refused the offered bribe i have not come to you this evening to talk of merchandise saleh mahomed angus began i have come upon a more important matter as you know the troops from jellalabad have defeated akbar and are making their way up through the passes they will defeat him again if he fights them the troops from candahar have reached ghuznee and assuredly there is no force that can arrest their progress to cabul i have only waited for this to speak openly to you i am sent here by mohun lal he authorizes me to promise you in his name and that of general pollock a pension of a thousand rupees a month and a gift of thirty thousand rupees if you will hold the prisoners here until a british force arrives to carry them back to cabul the afghan showed no surprise i suspected he said all along that you had come here for some other motive than trade what guarantee does mohun lal offer that these terms shall be fulfilled it would not have been safe for him to have entrusted such a message to paper angus said but he gives you his word words are no guarantee saleh said especially the word of a chief i would suggest saleh mahomed that you have it in your power to obtain a guarantee that even you will acknowledge to be a binding one you have in your hands three men whose names are known throughout afghanistan and through india as those of men of honour you have major pottinger captain lawrence and mr mackenzie all men whose word would be accepted unhesitatingly to whatever promise they might make they and the other officers would i am sure give you a written guarantee that the offer made by mohun lal shall be confirmed and carried out by the government of india what should i do with money without employment if you desire employment i have no doubt that you would be granted in addition to the money payment the command of a native regiment raised among the pathans of the lower hills i will think the matter over the afghan said and with a wave of the hand dismissed angus but the latter had seen by the expression of salehs face when he mentioned the terms that these were far higher than he had himself ever thought of and he had no doubt whatever that they would be accepted the first thing in the morning he received a message from saleh mahomed requesting him to accompany him to the tower the afghan beyond the usual salute was silent during the ride on dismounting saleh told him to follow him on entering the prisoners apartments the officer said you are aware that prince akbars orders are that i am to take you to khooloom i had certainly intended to do so but i have received news that leads me to doubt whether he may be in a position to support you if i carry out the orders yesterday afternoon i heard that he had been defeated at tezeen he will fight again with a stronger force than before still the issue is doubtful i may tell you that the messenger also brought to the fort news that the force from candahar had taken ghuznee an exclamation of joy broke from the prisoners another thing has happened the afghan went on this trader last night informed me that he really came here on a mission from mohun lal he promises me in general pollocks name that if i release you and carry you to cabul i shall be granted a pension of a thousand rupees a month and thirty thousand as a present i know nothing of general pollock and have no great faith in mohun lal but seeing that akbar may be even now a fugitive and your two armies in cabul if you gentlemen will swear by your god to make good to me what syud moorteza states he is authorized to offer i will hand you over to your own people the offer was joyfully accepted angus was requested by saleh to draw out a bond to that effect in persian and this was signed by pottinger lawrence johnson and mackenzie another agreement was then drawn up by johnson by which all the officers bound themselves to pay as many months pay and allowances in accordance with their rank as should be necessary to carry out the terms of the agreement thus satisfying saleh that should the english general refuse to ratify the first agreement he would receive the money from them to this all the prisoners and the ladies signed their names brigadier shelton heading the list while lady macnaghten and mrs sturt who were widows bound themselves in a codicil to pay such sums as might be demanded from them by major pottinger and captains lawrence and johnson you are no longer my prisoner sahibs saleh said when the two documents were handed to him and he on his part had given a bond to perform his share of the conditions now i should like your counsel as to how i had best proceed i believe that my men will gladly obey me in this matter because they are discontented at being sent so far away and i feel sure that a very slight inducement on your part to them will settle the matter if i could offer them in your name a gratuity of four months pay when we arrive at cabul it would settle matters to this the officers willingly agreed i have been thinking over the affair all night he went on which think you would be bestto travel straight for cabul when you hear that the british have arrived there or to wait here i hear that many of the petty chiefs in the neighbourhood are indignant that akbar khan should have broken all the promises he made and have treated so badly those who placed themselves under his protection while at the same time his father together with his own family are receiving most honourable treatment in india doubtless you would rather go straight down to cabul but we must remember that if defeated akbar with a very large number of his followers may again fly by this route and make for khooloom as he and dost mahomed did when the british first marched to cabul should they meet us on our way down they would assuredly attack us and their numbers might be so great that we should be overwhelmed on the other hand if we stay here we can occupy the largest of these little forts and set to work to strengthen it and might then resist any force akbar could bring against us until the british troops arrive to our assistance the officers were silent for a minute and then pottinger said what do you think brigadier this is a military matter i should say the last proposition is the safest shelton replied we may be sure that the moment pollock reaches cabul he will send off a body of cavalry to rescue us akbar would have at best only fortyeight hours start perhaps not half that and he would scarcely venture to stop here to undertake a siege he will certainly have no guns with him and the three hundred men of our escort with ten or twelve of us to lead them could be trusted to withstand any hurried assault he might make upon us the others all agreed that this would be the safest plan very well saleh said i will go now and harangue my men and in the meantime you can prepare to move i will select the largest and most defensible of these forts we will move quietly in there and then i will summon the bamian chiefs and proclaim that i have abandoned the cause of akbar and now with my british allies summon them to invite their men to join me so that when an english force arrives here they will be free from all molestation and will receive presents in accordance with the number of men they furnish so saying he left the room and the joy of the captives broke out in general congratulations among the men and tears of joy from the women pottinger johnson and boyd gathered round angus and poured forth their thanks to him nothing had hitherto been said to the ladies as to the real character of the supposed trader for it was felt that if this enterprise failed the disappointment would to them be terrible as soon as they learned who he was and what he had done they too crowded round and angus was for a time quite confused with the expressions of gratitude showered upon him i see pottinger said when the din of voices had quieted down that you have not informed saleh mahomed of your real character i thought it better not to do so i really came from mohun lal and if he thought i had not done so he might have doubted whether i had any authority to make such a proposal therefore i thought it would be well to keep up my present character to the end perhaps it is best so pottinger agreed these afghans are always suspicious and a man who has several times betrayed his employers would be more suspicious than other people i quite agree with you that it is best you should keep up your present character i suppose mohun lal really did give you the assurance about the ransom yes general pollock told me that he would give any sum mohun lal might think it desirable to offer and that was the figure fixed upon as being high enough to tempt saleh and yet not excessive for such a service besides he thought that he might ask more in which case i should of course have bargained with him it is a sum that would tempt any afghan chief pottinger said and to a mere military adventurer like saleh would appear prodigious well we will hear of your adventures afterwards he may return at any moment and it might put him out of humour if he found that we were not ready not indeed that there is much to do even the ladies will be able to pack up their scanty belongings in a few minutes there would in fact be nothing at all to pack had it not been for the things they bought of you the next room is all in confusion for every one of them is hard at work making clothes for the children it was half an hour before saleh mahomed returned all is well he said the men did not hesitate for a moment they are delighted at the prospect of returning to cabul and declare they will fight till the last if they are attacked i set them to work at once to clear out the largest of the forts here the chief when i told him what it was required for refused his consent so i at once turned him out and have appointed another favourable to us in his place we will move there at once the news infused fresh strength into the ladies several of whom were suffering from sickness and all from longcontinued anxiety and the hardships of the journey they were able to proceed on foot to the fort hassan was the first to come in with ten followers to give in his adherence to the new order of things many others followed the example and as angus was able to supply money strong parties were soon at work throwing up entrenchments round the tower pottinger convinced that audacity was the best policy at once issued a proclamation calling upon the people of the town and the chiefs of all the surrounding villages to come in at once and pay their respects and it was not long before they began to arrive the next day still larger numbers were set to work and by evening the earthworks were so advanced that they were in a position to offer a very strong resistance late that evening a friendly chief brought in the news that general pollock was within a days march of cabul that all resistance had ceased and that akbar had fled no one knew whither it was immediately decided that a start should be made for cabul on the following morning it was evident that akbar had not retired by that routehad he done so he would have arrived before the news of his flightand that therefore the risk of meeting any strong force on the road was very slight they set out at eight oclock in the morning horses had been procured for the whole party the officers took the children before them the ladies rode that night all slept on the rocks within shelter but at midnight they were awakened by the arrival of a horseman he brought a letter from sir richmond shakespere general pollocks military secretary saying that he was on the point of starting with six hundred native horse for bamian at daybreak the party were astir again pressing their horses eagerly their sufferings all forgotten in the hope of speedily meeting their friends at noon a cloud of dust was seen to rise from the road far ahead then some straggling horsemen were made out and behind them a body of cavalry it was still possible that this might be a body of the enemy and preparations were at once made for defence the drums were beat a line formed and muskets loaded soon however it could be made out that an officer riding at the head of the party was in british uniform and in a few minutes shakespere rode up followed by his men the joy of the meeting was almost beyond words a few days before a hopeless captivity among wild tribesmen seemed to be their certain lot now they were among friends again they learned from sir richmond that general sale himself was to set out at the head of a brigade to support the advanced party the next morning they started again and on the th met sales column that evening they passed near the camp of the candahar force and the next day rode through cabul on their way to pollocks camp where their arrival excited unbounded delight for it had generally been felt that the victories that they had won would be incomplete indeed unless their fellow countrymen and women had been rescued general pollock thanked angus publicly that evening for the service that he had rendered and the manner in which he had carried out the perilous scheme he had volunteered to perform and he received innumerable congratulations from all the officers with whom he had shared in the defence of jellalabad the army remained but a few days at cabul for the winter was at hand it was at first proposed to destroy the bala hissar but the idea was given up as it was represented that no ruler of afghanistan would be able to maintain his position unless he had that fortress to rely upon instead of this the great bazaar through which macnaghtens body had been carried in triumph was destroyed and in spite of the efforts of their officers many of the troops entered the city and punished the treachery of its inhabitants by sacking a considerable portion of it the united army then marched down the passes and retired to india pollocks division met with no resistance whatever that of nott which followed it was more than once attacked by large bands of plunderers the report that general pollock had sent in to the governorgeneral on the day the captives reached the camp gave full credit to angus for the courage and devotion that he had shown and stated that had he not succeeded in bringing saleh mahomed over to our side the latter would probably have reached khooloom with the captives before they could have been overtaken and in that case they might have been sent far away on the approach of sales brigade and been lost for ever to their friends the consequence was that he was at once appointed political officer to one of the rajput states henceforth his promotion was rapid six years later he went to england on three years leave on the ship on which he sailed were four officers of his acquaintance some of whom were accompanied by their wives from several of these he received the most pressing invitations to stay with them at their country houses these he gladly accepted for except among military men who had returned home he was without friends feeling at a loss for employment after a life of such activity as he had led he threw up his leave at the end of the year and took back with him to india a wife the daughter of a colonel who had sailed with him from india at the end of another ten years he returned home for good his pay had been large he had laid by a considerable sum before he first went home and this he had placed in the hands of the firm to whom he had sent his money before leaving teheran for herat it had been well employed by them and at the age of forty he returned home with a considerable fortune besides a pension after twentythree years of service he had been reluctant to quit his work but his wifes health had suffered from the climate his three children had been sent home to her family and he now bought a place near her people at first he felt altogether out of his element but he gradually fell into the ways of country life and no longer regretted that his work in india had come to an end the end wherever english is spoken one imagines that mr hentys
