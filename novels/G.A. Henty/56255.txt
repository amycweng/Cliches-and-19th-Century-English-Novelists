by return of post and frank at once went up to prescott's rooms in a state of some excitement to read him its contents they were as follows my dear frank when i opened your letter and saw your signature i was so overwhelmed with astonishment and delight that i nearly upset the tea tray quite upset i mean as regards temper my respected father who hates excitement and the affair would probably have ended fatally had not the girls administered brandy in small doses seriously frank i am truly glad to see your fist again and still more so to hear that you will come down and see us if invited please consider yourself invited hereby we are all agreed father mother and girls that you will be received with open armsthat is by me fortunately this is of all others just the time for you to come for we are about to plunge into dissipation my eldest sister margaret is just going to be married the event comes off on thursday and there are great killings of the fatted calf over the departure of the prodigal now a wedding in london is i imagine a serious not to say heavy business here it gives rise to no end of fun and excitement and is wound up by a ball in the evening you will be a great acquisition travelled swells are scarce in these parts and as shakespeare says homekeeping folks have ever homely wits so great things will be expected of you my people here know all about you having heard me speak of you a thousand times so lose no time but put yourself into the train at twelve o'clock upon the day you receive this i shall be at the station stoke you know at half past five to meet you so let there be no mistake about it shake old prescott by the hand for meyours very truly teddy drake prescott laughed over the letter i suppose you mean to go frank of course frank said this is quite an excitement a country wedding will be a relief indeed after these solemn london parties well i have no time to lose and must go and get gloves and things for the festive occasion keep your eye on buttons prescott and make him useful it was nearly six o'clock and already dark when frank arrived at the dingy little station of stoke on trent teddy drake was upon the platform to meet him and was perfectly uproarious in his greeting and so am i to see you drake very glad you are not a bit altered you are frank tremendously i should hardly have known you with those big whiskers is that portmanteau all you have that is right here porter just put this portmanteau in my dog cart this trent valley of yours drake is rather alarming to a weak minded man all these flaming forges and kilns certainly give one the idea that the crust of the earth must be of unusual thinness hereabouts and the hot regions unpleasantly near i do not feel singed yet certainly still one can't but think that facilis descensus averni the question is shall i hence unscathed go teddy laughed to another man i should have said that the bright eyes of the staffordshire girls were more dangerous than their fathers' fires but you who have seen the beauties of spain italy and the east are not likely to be scorched by our lesser luminaries you see more pretty faces in a week in england than in a year abroad teddy how far is your place only another hundred yards or so there you can see the lights among the trees now we are turning in at the gate mind your face frank some of these shrubs want cutting here we are the front door was opened as the dog cart drove up and the bright light streamed cheerfully out into the damp evening mr drake was in the hall i am very glad to see you mr maynard we have heard so much of you from teddy that we all feel as if you were quite an old friend come along frank i will show you your room dinner will be ready in twenty minutes so you had better go up at once and then i can introduce you to the womankind the room was a small one for which teddy apologised you must put up with a small room frank for to morrow we shall have no end of people herebridesmaids and aunts and that sort of thing you need not apologise teddy after knocking about europe and the east for the last two years i am not likely to quarrel with such a room as this now you go off and dress while i am unpacking and come in again as soon as you can and talk to me teddy was not long absent now teddy sit down while i am dressing and tell me about every one give me the consigne as it were the present occupants of the house teddy drake said are first my father whom you have seena dacent man though i say it myselfacting partner in the great house of painter co porcelain manufacturers an englishman quiet and matter of fact has not a keen appreciation of a joke my mother is irish to the backbone and we all take after her indeed we spend a good deal of our time over there with her relations and the brogue comes natural to us i always use it myself especially when i am talking with ladies one can venture upon a tinder sentiment in the brogue which one could never hazard in saxon the only son of the above mentioned couple spare me that teddy frank laughed i know more of him than is to his advantage already now i call that unkind frank i was about to have said some neat things about edward drake esq my elder sister margaret is to be married in two days so you won't see much of her and i need not bother you with a description she is quiet and takes after her father sarah is one of the jolliest girls you will meet in a day's journey and katie's a darling i remember your speaking of your two elder sisters at cambridge teddy but i do not think i heard you mention the youngest oh katie is not a sister at all frank she is a cousina downright irish girl she has lost her father and mother and has been living with us for the last two years now frank make haste with your dressing and draw it as mild as you conveniently can for the girls' sake it is not fair frank upon my life it is not i told them that you were really a good fellow and they are prepared to like you upon my recommendation but i said that as far as looks went you were nothing to speak ofin fact rather the contraryand now they'll think i've been humbugging them entirely i am very much obliged to you for your recommendation teddy frank said laughing it's as true as the piper frank you know you were not a bit good lookingtoo thin and whipcordy but now you have got so much broader and those whiskers of yours alter your face altogether do you know frank teddy said critically you are really an uncommonly good looking fellow have you got any boxing gloves in the house teddy frank asked laughing because if so we will put them on after breakfast to morrow no thank you frank i know you of old and at any rate no boxing for me till after the wedding there now you are ready let's go downstairs dinner will be ready in three or four minutes as frank maynard crossed the drawing room he came to the rapid conclusion that teddy's sister sarah was a tall handsome girl with good features and a happy good natured expression like that of her brother katie was short and rather plump with large eyes which frank noticed with amusement opened a little wider in surprise as he entered teddy had evidently drawn his portrait in most unflattering colours for the introduction over sarah's first remark was i should not have known you in the least mr maynard by teddy's description you are not one bit like it is he katie no katie said not in one bit teddy what did you take us in that way at all for 'pon my life katie it's as true as could be it's the whiskers have made the difference to him nonsense teddy don't believe him miss drake he has been making fun of you on purpose teddy was always great at romancing don't you mind what these young people say mr maynard they are very rude mrs drake said thank you mrs drake i am pretty well able to take care of myself and i know teddy of old when they were fairly seated at dinner frank had time to examine his new acquaintances more accurately miss drake was something like her sister sarah in appearance but was more quiet and subdued sarah he thought was really very pretty and seemed as full of spirits and fun as her brother kate o'byrne was as has been said short and rather plump her hair was jet black and her head set gracefully on to her neck her features were not particularly good but her eyes were beautiful large eyes of uncertain colour now hazel now grey generally very soft and trusting in their expression but frequently lighting up with an arch ripple of fun and when indignant flashing out defiantly eyes which in repose shaded by the long black eyelashes were soft and thoughtful but which looked up so earnestly and straight for an answer that he would have been a bold man who would have ventured upon an untruth to their owner a soft plump cheek lips slightly parted a pretty chin with a little double roll beneath it a soft and very musical voice a very small well shaped hand and as frank afterwards noticed tiny feet katie o'byrne was not nearly so pretty so far as prettiness went as her cousin sarah hers was one of those faces which do not strike greatly at first sight but grow gradually upon one a face with a good deal of character and firmness altogether as frank said to himself at the end of the evening a very loveable face the conversation at dinner was sustained with unflagging spirit principally by frank teddy drake and his sister sarah miss o'byrne did not talk much and indeed frank found afterwards that she seldom took much share in general conversation frank did not sit long over his wine but soon joined the ladies in the drawing room and was speedily engaged in an animated skirmish with the two girls then they had some music and miss o'byrne sang some irish melodies in a pure rich contralto voice which had been thoroughly trained and with a feeling and expression which delighted frank the ladies retired early as the next was to be a fatiguing day and frank and teddy sat up smoking and talking of college days until a very late hour indeed the next day the house filled with guests and great were the preparations for the event of the day following frank and teddy were in great request and found full occupation in assisting the bridesmaids to fill the vases c with flowers furniture too had to be moved and many arrangements improvised for the ball in the evening very gay was the wedding and the whole town of stoke made holiday the wedding festivities were followed by much general gaietydinners small dances and balls the drakes' house continued full of guests and frank had great opportunities in the midst of all these gaieties to indulge in a very extensive amount of flirtation after his long absence on the continent there was a great charm in the unrestrained and familiar intercourse with a number of young english girls as lively innocent and fearless as young fawns but if he flirted he flirted generally dividing his attentions with perfect impartiality among the bridesmaids and with the assistance of teddy drake keeping up a perpetual state of fun and laughter with them miss drake and himself were great allies after the first few days they had by mutual consent taken to call each other frank and sarah with her cousin frank never attempted a similar step but addressed her as miss o'byrne in a formal manner and took excessive pleasure in teazing her in that and other small matters especially in respect of her brogue to her no small indignation for katie was a staid little person in her way and stood rather on her dignity and she chafed not a little under the feeling that even when frank was professing the utmost deference to her opinion he was really quietly bantering her one evening when frank had been there nearly three weeks and was talking of leaving in a few days he had been specially teazing katie had fought hard as usual but had been conscious of being worsted and when she went upstairs for the night she said to her cousin i am really glad mr maynard is going sarah i begin almost to hate him sarah opened her eyes in astonishment what nonsense katie you don't mean it why i do think he is the very nicest fellow i ever met yes i suppose so sarah and his opinion of you seems to be equally good i hope so sarah said one always wishes to be liked by people as one likes them stuff sarah my opinion is katie said positively that we shall have another wedding here one of these days perhaps so katie sarah answered composedly but i do not think we should name the same person if we were to guess well sarah i will bet you half a dozen pairs of kid gloves upon it very well katie i bet now who do you name frank maynard and you of course that's your idea katie is it sarah said provokingly cool yes it is sarah katie said sturdily now sarah you don't think you can deceive me never mind dear though he does make me mad with him he's a very good fellow and you have my full consent and approval thank you dearwait till you're asked it won't be so very long sarah yes it will katie frank and i are the best friends in the world but if he were stopping here for the next ten years we should never be anything more now sarah you name your couple it must be one of the bridesmaids you know or at any rate some one down here it is one of the bridesmaids sarah said quietly well which katie said impatiently katie o'byrne a flush of colour came into katie's face and she said indignantly sarah you're making fun of me no i am not my dear that's the couple i name for six pair of kid gloves against the other ah well katie said then if what you say about yourself is true our bet will never be decided he dislikes me i'm sure of it and certainly i dislike him why he's always making fun of me he never even says a civil word to me and i'm sure i don't want him to my dear katie i don't say the affair is coming off at once i don't even say that i believe or rather that i have any reason to believe that frank is in love with you i only say as you challenged me to fix on one of the bridesmaids i fix upon you he makes no distinction between the others he flirts with them miscellaneously you are the only exception he certainly does take pleasure in teazing you and in making you indignant but that shows at least that he thinks you worth the trouble of teazing he almost always manages to get next to you out walking and at meals quite accidentally katie or else wonderfully well managed nonsense sarah i never remarked it very well katie but it is so for all that her cousin thought a little and then said well if he does sarah it is only because he sees i would rather he didn't and wants to bother me no no you may not have to pay your gloves but you will never win mine i never heard a more ridiculous idea in my life well katie we shall see sarah said now i must be off to bed the next day they were out in the garden looking for violets for it was now the end of march frank and miss o'bryne were a little apart from the others and he had just made an attack upon ireland the girl turned round upon him suddenly why do you always treat me like a spoilt child mr maynard why are you always teazing me and making me mad not always i hope miss o'byrne frank said seriously yes you are katie said indignantly you are laughing at me now why do you do it do you really wish me to tell you miss o'byrne oh i suppose you are going to invent some ridiculous compliment but i won't believe it mr maynard are you quite sure miss o'byrne sure and sure katie said resolutely well i shall try to convince you frank said do you like the sea i don't see what that has to do with the question mr maynard but yes i do like iti love it dearly so do i miss o'byrne are you a good sailor oh yes katie said i always lived near the sea and used to go out in yachts yes i am a very good sailor then of course you enjoy rough weather miss o'byrne i like above all things to see a storm so do i she said enthusiastically i love being out when it is really rough i suppose then you will agree with me miss o'byrne that no one who does not really love the sea could enjoy a gale katie thought the proposition over for a second no i suppose not she said but i really don't see that this has anything to do with what i asked youwhy are you always teazing me i have been answering your question the whole time miss o'byrne you have only to suppose you are the sea the girl thought a moment and then looked up indignantly with a heightened colour as she saw the application what nonsense you talk mr maynard you will try to persuade me next that to knock a person down is a sign of friendship i shall never believe you again she said as she turned to join the others yes you will some day katie frank said following her closely miss o'byrne did not appear to have heard but she had it was the first time he had called her by her christian name and it sounded strangely to her from his lips katie could not help colouring and was angry with herself for doing so and still more angry when she saw by a little quiet smile on sarah's face that she noticed it when she thought the matter over she determined on the first opportunity to tell mr maynard she considered it to be a great liberty but then she felt certain frank would only laugh and say that he called her cousin sarah but that if miss o'byrne objected he would apologise and not repeat the offence after all too there was no particular reason why she should object any more than sarah as to that talk about the sea it was absurd no one would care for a storm unless he loved the sea katie said thoughtfully and of course he meant me to suppose that he would not have cared about making me mad if he didn'twell like me what humbugs men are she exclaimed indignantly i do think they imagine we girls are fools enough to believe any stuff they like to tell us frank maynard did not repeat the offence of calling her by her christian name until he said good bye to her upon leaving what impudence katie said to herself as she looked after the dog cart what impudence to venture to squeeze my hand as he certainly did just as if he would persuade me that all his rudeness is to go for nothing well men are humbugs i wonder whether he will ever come back again chapter ii the lively stunners after the first greeting between frank maynard and his friend prescott upon the former's return from staffordshire and when they had fairly sat down in frank's room for a talk prescott said now frank let me hear all about what you have been doing your letters were not long and you seemed enjoying yourself down there frank i suppose teddy is just about the same as he used to be just the same frank laughed he pretends to assist his father in the business but i fancy the material advantage derived by painter and co from teddy's services is slight indeed he went round the manufactory with me and i find that his knowledge upon the subject of china is absolutely nil i question if he would know the difference between dresden and svres or between limoges and etruscan and i should imagine his ideas on the subject of accounts are if possible even more vague no he is just what he used to bea careless warm hearted irishman and the best fellow in the world but mr drake is not irish frank not the least in the world a particularly practical long headed sensible englishman his celtic blood all comes from his mother she is as irish in her way as he is in his and so is his sister is miss drake pretty frank yes frank said very pretty an awfully jolly girl prescott not the least bit of nonsense about herdownright and straightforward you know prescott glanced up but he saw that frank was too outspoken in his praise to be the least in love tall or short frank tall frank said a good deal like teddy fancy teddy a pretty girl and you've got sarah and there was a cousin with an irish name frank wasn't there you mentioned her in your first letter but you did not allude to her afterwards what was she like frank was longer in giving his answer this time well he said slowly miss o'byrne would hardly be considered very pretty at least i don't think most people would call her so no i should say not she was rather short and yes i should say and plump prescott glanced across again at frank and a little amused smile came across his face at the cautious way in which he had spoken but frank was looking thoughtfully into the fire and did not notice it there were other young ladies staying in the house you said frank was there anything special about any of them no frank said carelessly they were a very jolly lot of girls i had great fun down there lots of dancing and music and so on i suppose frank no end frank said any of the girls sing well katie sang splendidly one of the finest voices i ever heard in my life frank said enthusiastically katie prescott repeated questioningly miss o'byrne frank explained ah prescott said with a smile the stout little cousin good heavens prescott frank said turning round with great indignation what are you talking aboutstout littleby jove what put such a ridiculous idea in your head why my dear frank you said she was rather short and plump pooh nonsense frank said she is rather short perhaps but has a charming little figure just a little plump but and muttering the obnoxious word over to himself he smoked away in short angry puffs prescott could hardly help laughing aloud at the success which attended his ruse so miss o'byrne is not to be talked of lightly eh frank oh nonsense frank said of course one doesn't like to hear a girl like katie talked of as a stout littlebut there of course you couldn't tell and do you ever mean to repeat your visit frank well yes prescott i expect i shall go down there again at least i hope so and may i ask frank if you have any intention of bringing miss o'byrne back with you frank put his pipe down and looked at prescott who was evidently greatly amused then after a moment's pause he said you have guessed it prescott sure enough if katie will come i will bring her up really frank really old man i should have told you sooner or later i am quite in earnest i will marry katie o'byrne if she will have me i am very glad frank very glad indeed and prescott shook his friend warmly by the hand i always hoped you would do it sooner or later frank you are only leading an idle useless life and a wife will be the making of you of course she is very nice frank my dear fellow frank said quite inclined to be communicative now that the ice was broken she is the most loveable girl in the world prescott laughed but not pretty eh frank well prescott i suppose most men wouldn't call her pretty at first i don't think i did but i think her so now not pretty perhaps but loveable that's the only word that expresses it prescott just loveable with the most trusting eyes you ever saw she is full of fun katie and has got a very decided will of her own not a bit of a muff you know prescott no i don't think you would be likely to fall in love with a muff frank well and what does the young lady think of you frank was it a very strong flirtation frank laughed no prescott not a bit of it it was perpetual war i am afraid i was very hard on her but i did like teazing her and making her indignant katie has rather a will of her own you see and can hit very hard when she likes and she was immensely angry at being made fun of i do think sometimes she almost hated me i don't think she has the least idea i care for her but i don't know prescott i hope that in the end i shall win her prescott smiled at frank's description of his love making well frank and what do you propose doing with yourself this evening i hardly know prescott i feel too restless to sit still and a theatre would be just as bad what with drives and dinners and parties and a constant state of light skirmishing when i was with katie and an extreme amount of thought and restlessness when i was alone i have been kept in a state of constant excitement for the last three weeks i was always wondering whether anything would come of it whether it was a mere case of strong flirtation such as i have been engaged in fifty times before or whether i was seriously in earnest and then at last i arrived at the fixed and settled determination that of all the women i ever met katie was the one most certain to make me perfectly happy altogether i have been regularly worked up and it would be quite impossible for me to sit still i want something to let off the steam a row would suit me admirably it would be an immense satisfaction to hit out from the shoulder suppose we go to the stunners there is sure to be some sparring going on and if there's no one else i can put on the gloves with perkins what do you say prescott anything you like frank so that i am not called upon to bail you out so after dinner they went up to the lively stunners the stunners was a public house situated in one of the small streets lying above the top of the haymarket not an aristocratic neighbourhood indeed the reverse but the stunners did a good business as even perkins was ready to allow perkins was behind the bar in his shirt sleeves and was very busy indeed when the young men entered ah mr maynard i am glad to see you sir how are you perkins anything going on upstairs not much sir it's not the night for sparring we've got harmony to night sir i want a set to with the gloves perkins what do you say well sir i should be willing enough but i am going out for a spree just the thing to suit you if you are in the humour what is it perkins well sir you must keep it dark or it wouldn't do me any good in my business but the slogger and i are goingand here he bent over the bar with an air of great mysterywe're going to a chartist meeting to night the slogger knows a fellow who is hot about it and he's put him up to the pass word so we're going and if you and mr prescott are game you can go with us we can easily get up a row if we like and it's hard if us four can't fight our way out of it the very thing perkins as you say it's hard if we can't get up a row somehow what do you say prescott anything you like frank a black eye will not look strictly professional but as i have no case on in court it won't much matter i have not used my fists since that last town and gown row we were in together at cambridge and i have no objection to a row for once in a way well mr maynard we are not to start till half past nine it's no use getting there too early so if you don't mind going upstairs for an hour i will tell you when it is time to be off if there's no sparring going on perkins i think we'll go out for a stroll and come back at the time you name i can't stand the bad tobacco smoke and the bad singing now gentlemen if you're ready perkins said when they returned i'm with you they went into the bar parlour where the slogger a powerful man with the unmistakeable look of a prize fighter was awaiting them you are not thinking of going like that he asked lor' they'd never let you in not if you'd twenty pass words and if they did they'd pitch into us directly we were in the light no if you mean to go you must go like working men have you any clothes you could lend us perkins well sir i've an old greatcoat which would cover you well enough and i dare say i can rummage out something for mr prescott as for hats your best way is to send out and buy a couple of cheap billycocks you can pull them down over your eyes i think that with that and if you take off your collars and put a black handkerchief or a bird's eye round your necks you will pass well enough the transformation was soon effected and the two young men could not help laughing at each other's altered appearance you'll pass very well for a bricklayer out of employ frank well prescott frank retorted i could swear to you as a disreputable looking tailor anywhere a cab was at the door and the party were soon off now perkins said if there is a shindy we must all keep together and then we shall be as right as ninepence whatever comes of it i'd back the slogger and you and i mr maynard to clear the roughs out of any room in london in about five minutes mr prescott's very handy with the gloves but he hasn't weight and in a close fight weight tells where is the place perkins in the new cut sir it's a penny gaff at ordinary times arrived at the new cut they discharged the cab and went on foot through the busy crowd with which that locality is always filled of a saturday evening hundreds of men were standing about their week's work finished smoking and talking together the women were busy shopping and were engaged in examining the various goods before purchasing and in chaffering with the shopmen and costermongers the pleasure of shopping is by no means a monopoly of the rich the poor enjoy it to at least an equal extent and no lady can more carefully examine the texture of the silk dress which the shopman temptingly holds out before her or turn over one article after another before making her selection than does her poorer sister scrutinise the markings and colour of a piece of bacon or turn over the heaps of cauliflowers and cabbages upon a costermonger's cart great is the noise the touts at the second hand furniture and jew clothing shops the butchers and the itinerant vendors vie with each other in their efforts to obtain customers half price has just begun at the victoria theatre which stands large and black at the corner of the new cut and numbers are flocking in to see the tragedy of the hangman's stepdaughter or the murdered mother of the blind alley views of this drama of thrilling interest and in bright colours are placed beside the doors and illuminated by the bright gaslight exhibit scenes of bloodshed and murder highly enticing to the frequenters of the threepenny gallery a few policemen are scattered among the crowd but their services are seldom required except when some drunken man insists upon fighting everyone and refusing all persuasion to return home has to be taken to the station house in spite of his struggles and shouts by two policemen in the discharge of this duty although undertaken solely for the protection of the public the police are greeted with much jeering and hooting on the part of that ungrateful body and then all goes on quietly for a time the gaslights shine brightly out from the gin palaces and great business is in course of being there carried on numbers go in and out and the glass doors are ever on the swing through these doors glimpses can be caught of crowds of men and women standing at the bar drinking and waiting to be served while through the open windows of the room above sounds of singing and of violent thumping of pewter pots and glasses upon the table come out through all this the four companions slowly made their way and presently stopped at the door of one of those establishments popularly known as a penny gafftheatres at which a suicide three murders four combats two comic songs and a ballet are condensed into the space of a quarter of an hour and are to be heard for the charge of a penny dens in which a perspiring audience inhale a pestilential atmosphere and vicious ideas together and which the strong arm of the legislature should either reform or sweep away altogether at present the establishment was apparently closed the appalling pictures no longer stood before the doors the illumination which usually blazed upon it was extinguished no sound of music or laughter came through into the street the doors were closed and the whole place seemed deserted now and then however a man went up knocked and after a short parley was admitted and then all was quiet again at this door the party knocked it was partially opened and a voice said what do you want universal suffrage the slogger answered the door opened a little wider and they all entered they found themselves in perfect darkness but the man who had let them in turned on the light of a bull's eye lantern you are late mates he said leading the way along the passage opening a door he admitted them into the main apartment a sort of covered room or theatre at one end was a raised stage with the usual front and drop scene the latter was now raised however and four or five chairs and a table were on the stage and some ten or a dozen men were standing or sitting there the aspect of the place was tawdry and dirty beyond description the walls originally white and decorated with flower wreaths were now black with smoke and filth what the ornamentation of the ceiling had once been it was impossible to say the place was lighted by two gas chandeliers without glasses and by a row of footlights in front of the stage the room was full of men who were mostly smoking short pipes and the fog of tobacco smoke made it seem dingier and darker than it really was while the close noxious atmosphere and the entire absence of any ventilation whatever rendered it difficult for any one unaccustomed to such noxious atmosphere to breathe at all the new comers took their stand close to the door where they entered and the seats having been removed and everyone standing their coming was altogether unnoticed by anyone i say prescott the air here is poisonous it makes me feel quite faint so it does me frank we'd better light our pipes we shan't feel it so much they accordingly followed the example of all around them and began to smoke but even then they found the atmosphere almost overpowering we can't stand this long prescott we'll just listen to a speech or two and then we will have some fun the meeting they soon found was principally held for the object of informing the people of the arrangements which had been made for the great meeting to take place in a few days all in the hall were evidently in their way leaders and the speakers urged them to bring up their forces to the appointed place to keep them well in hand and to be prepared in case of resistance for barricade fighting each was requested to notice particularly the addresses of the gunsmiths' shops and even of second hand dealers where a few firearms might be exhibited in the windows and to tell off men upon whom they could rely to seize the arms general instructions too were given as to forming barricades and the noble example of the french was cited to them again and again this is rather a serious business frank it's all talk my dear fellow an english mob has no idea of street fighting a few hundred policemen would drive ten thousand of them the speaker now finished amid a low murmur of applause the man who followed him was of a less practical turn and simply strove to excite his hearers by a speech calling upon them to strike for liberty and to cut off the chains in which they were bound by a pampered aristocracy look out perkins i'm going to begin frank said and then at the top of his voice he shouted out that's a lie an immense confusion at once took place in the hall there were shouts of a spyturn him outhang himlock the doors but those nearest who turned to carry these threats into execution hesitated a moment at the sight of the three powerful men who guarded the door which prescott as previously agreed had opened to prevent the man in the passage locking it on the other side the hesitation was momentary and then a tremendous rush was made by the exasperated crowd those in front however as speedily recoiled or were beaten back by the tremendous blows of frank maynard and the two prizefighters the assault of the slogger however was not in the first place directed against those who attacked him but against a man who was standing in front of him and who had evinced no intention of taking part in the fray he was a tall man dressed as a bricklayer with large whiskers and black hair soon after he had entered the slogger had noticed with surprise that these whiskers were false for the upper part of one of them owing probably to the heat of the room had become detached from his face the slogger would not have thought much of this as he supposed at first it was some one who had disguised himself and come merely from curiosity as he had himself but something in the man's figure and in his peculiar way of holding his head reminded him of a man against whom he had a particular grudge for having only the week before been the means of transporting the slogger's brother he determined immediately the fray began to find out if his suspicions were correct accordingly the instant the rush was made he commenced the assault by striking the unsuspecting man in front of him a violent blow on the ear which would have sent him to the ground had not he been kept on his feet by the crowd around him his false whiskers however fell off and the smoothly shaven cheeks were visible ha mr barton the slogger shouted as he dealt tremendous blows right and left at the assailants who rushed at him it's my turn now you shan't go out from here with a whole skin a spya spy he shouted but the tumult was too great for his voice to be heard for some little time the three men had easily beaten off their assailants but matters were momentarily becoming more serious the men on the platform were breaking up the chairs and tables while others tore down portions of the woodwork to form weapons these now pressed forward through the crowd as they fell back in dismay from their formidable opponents i think it's about time to make a bolt sir all right perkinscome along in the meantime prescott had had a quiet encounter of his own with the door keeperwho had been signally worsted and had run out into the streetand was now holding the door ready to close it as the others retreated after a rush upon the assailants in order to drive them back and gain time for the manuvre the three men made a hasty retreat through the door which prescott instantly closed and locked behind them and in another instant they were out in the new cut come the other way sir perkins said there's a cab stand under the railway arch and if them fellows get out and find us they'd be as likely to knife us as not in another minute they were in the cab that was a sharp fight perkins and no mistake sir as good a turn up as i've had for a long time there'll be some smartish black eyes in the morning do you think there is really going to be a row with these chartists perkins i don't think so sir they don't mind the bobbies but they'll never stand against the red coats i'm going to morrow to get sworn in as a special i ain't going to have them coming in to the stunners to help themselves without pay i don't know and i don't care a rap about the charter and i don't believe one in fifty of them knows theirselves what they want isn't the charter so much as their neighbour's goods well they won't get my beer till some of 'em have gone down they'll find that they have to pay for it one way or the other here we are sir and i ain't sorry for i don't know that i was ever so dry in my life so am i perkins the heat and stench in that place was tremendous the fighting too was warm while it lasted i don't think any of us got hit hit said perkins contemptuously no nor we shouldn't have been if we had stopped there all night not as long as we could have kept them at arm's length the worst of that sort of row is that the fellows who are behind always want to get close and they push the chaps in front on so that at last one gets jammed up into a heap and can't use one's arms no i think we just stopped long enough the leg of a table is a nasty sort of thing to come down on your guard now then sir what's your liquor chapter iii a slap in the face frank maynard's departure for the country had been a relief both to captain bradshaw and alice and when he returned they were able to start anew upon something like their old footing he was not at the house however as much as he had before been for the london season was now beginning in earnest and he was out nearly every night captain bradshaw and alice too were a good deal out for although the old man would have greatly preferred to remain quietly at home yet for alice's sake he went into society and when there enjoyed it perhaps more than she did he would have a quiet rubber for a while and would then go into the dancing room and look on with pleasure at the admiration which alice attracted and indeed alice had many admirers for she was a strikingly elegant girl and an heiress and not a few of the government clerks who form so large a proportion of the dancing men of london would have willingly enough exchanged their arduous duties of copying and endorsing letters for the charge of alice heathcote and her fortune but alice gave but slight encouragement to any of them she was one of those girls with whom a partner very soon gets upon pleasant terms she was perfectly natural straightforward and unaffected sensible herself and expecting some amount of sense from others the sort of girl with whom a flirtation is next to impossible nor upon those evenings when they had no engagements were captain bradshaw and alice often alone for in proportion as the visits of frank had decreased in frequency during the last three months those of fred bingham had increased very pleasant did he make himself upon these evenings full of amusing anecdotes and rattling on with a constant stream of fun and nonsense he aroused alice and kept captain bradshaw in a state of good temper indeed alice felt really grateful to fred bingham for she rather dreaded these evenings alone with her uncle he amused and interested her too with his talk for fred was undoubtedly clever and yet she could hardly explain to herself why she did not like him it was partly an old standing feeling from the day when he had first come to the house a lad of sixteen she a child of twelve had felt a sort of jealousy of him for her playfellow frank's sake which frank had never felt for his own either from some passing remark she had heard from a servant or from some other reason she had come to entertain the feeling that he had interfered with frank's position children are keenly jealous she had always looked upon frank as her guardian's son and heir and she considered this new comer to be a rival of frank's all along she had cherished this impression all along had thought that fred was trying to supplant his cousin in captain bradshaw's affection she could scarcely have given a reason for her belief it was not what he actually said or did it was his way true fred bingham never spoke ill of his cousin in any way on the contrary he frequently praised him but in alice's jealous ears there was a current of implied blame in the very praise she would rather that he had abused frank openly to his uncle than praise him as he did then too he was always fond of drawing frank into an argument when his uncle was present and frank never showed to advantage in these wordy conflicts he was greatly deficient in quiet suavity he could not hear views which he considered vicious expressed and either hold his peace or dissent quietly frank gave his opinion with energy and heartiness even with vehemence he plunged into an argument as if he were personally aggrieved by the opinions stated upon the other side he denounced and scouted them as heresies dangerous to mankind a strong conservative he hated radicalism with a personal hatred he would willingly have buckled on armour and have settled the matter by a combat to the death between himself and the champion of the other party in these conflicts then which fred was constantly provoking fred with his quiet sneering manner would greatly gain the advantage his straight thrusts would be too fine and delicate for his cousin's slashing two handed blows and they not unfrequently ended by frank's losing his temper during frank's absence abroad fred had been a great deal at lowndes square and had at least so alice thought tried hard to gain the place of first favourite with captain bradshaw in this he had not succeeded at present however while his uncle was still smarting under the overthrow of his pet plans alice had fears that fred bingham's attention and adroit flatteries were attaining their effect indeed for the time being he became prime favourite with his uncle and in his absence captain bradshaw would sound his praises loudly to his ward generally coupling them with disparaging remarks of the disgraced frank at first alice had listened in silence but finding that it was becoming a favourite theme with her uncle she spoke out warmly in franks defence declaring roundly that there was more truth and honesty in his little finger than in his cousin's whole composition her uncle as was his wont although nowise convinced was yet fain to let the matter drop for the present in addition to her championship of frank alice had another reason for speaking out so decidedly she had for some time felt that fred was endeavouring to make himself specially agreeable to her and she now thought that her uncle was inclined to favour his efforts now alice had as has been said a positive dislike to fred bingham and although she could not help being amused by his talk she yet believed that all this jesting and fun was a mere cloak which concealed a scheming and crafty disposition after all these years of careful watching she was convinced he was playing a deep game for his uncle's fortune and she now saw at once that in the same way he was wishing to add her fortune to his pile that he cared in the slightest degree for herself she did not for a moment believe now of all these thoughts suspicions and opinions on the part of alice heathcote fred bingham had not the remotest conception shrewd as he was keenly alive to everything which concerned his own interests he was yet completely in the dark as to alice heathcote's sentiments regarding him women in general he knew but little of and understood even less beside this he was intensely vain he had been made a little god of at home his mother and sisters looked up to him as the best of human beings and were never tired of doing him homage over and over again his mother had said in his hearing that freddy ought to marry well for that any girl must feel flattered by his attentions and fred's own experience when he did go into society was that girls were amused by his fun and caustic humour he was profoundly ignorant of the fact that girls very seldom do fall in love with men who amuse them fred bingham then had long looked upon his success with alice heathcote as a certainty only awaiting his making up his mind before frank had left england indeed fred had rather doubted whether alice heathcote did not prefer his cousin to himself but he believed that his long absence had quite put him beyond the pale as a rival and when upon frank's return he had observed that there was a sort of reserve on alice's part towards him and that this reserve apparently increased rather than lessened with time he considered his own success as secured then too with great pleasure he had seen that frank was somehow in disgrace and took the opportunity of his absence to make the greatest progress possible what was the cause of frank's disgrace fred was ignorant as captain bradshaw had upon no occasion even hinted the cause of his displeasure had he done so fred would have done all in his power to keep them apart as it was he was obliged to let matters take their course the sole reason why fred bingham had not long before proposed to alice heathcote was because he was doubtful about himself not doubtful as to whether he loved her for upon that point he had no question at all indeed he had no belief whatever in love and looked upon it as an absurdity quite out of place in business if two people liked each other and could get on well together and the match was mutually advantageous what more could be desired the question in his mind was should he get on well with alice heathcote he liked her well enough yes he really liked her very much and the match would be an advantageous one but he was not quite so easy in his mind as to whether he should get on well with her now fred's idea of a wife who would get on well with him was a woman who would do just as she was told who would never set up her opinion against his who would in fact be a species of bond slave to his will now he had great doubts whether alice heathcote would do all this he was in fact a little afraid of her there was a quiet decision and firmness about her which made him feel uncomfortably that the combat between them would be a hard fought one then too she was tall and fred did not like tall women he fancied sometimes that if he got into a passion with herand he allowed himself that he had a hasty tempershe would look down coldly contemptuous at him there was another difficulty which presented itself and which had for some time kept fred bingham in a state of uncertainty alice heathcote's fortune was he knew about and also that it was her own absolutely and fred felt certain that captain bradshaw would see that the greater part if not the whole of it were settled upon herself at her marriage now fred bingham was very much pressed for ready money he was embarking with his father in several extensive affairs in which capital was all essential more than once his thoughts had turned to a young lady he had met near manchester who had lost her father whose mother was old and weak and who had a fortune of about half the amount of that of alice heathcote at her own disposal miss farrer was pretty but with a weak prettiness which would not stand time her appearance did not belie her character she was an affectionate and amiable but weak girl fred had been very attentive to her and had completely won her mother's heart by playing many games of cribbage with her and losing almost invariably so that altogether he felt sure of his ground there it was not that he had actually any idea of marrying miss farrer he felt too sure of success with alice to think seriously of the other but he was a cautious man and liked to have a second string to his bow in case of accidents it was one morning after breakfast about three weeks after frank's return from the country that fred bingham made up his mind to propose formally to alice he had been chatting with his father as to a contract concerning which they were in treaty the margin of profit is not as large as we could wish fred if we were working with our own capital it would be different but all this discount and advance work makes a large hole in the margin of profit i should think it did fred said shortly it is not to day that we have found that out i think fred that if i were you i should bring your affair with miss heathcote to a head you have been going there now for a very long time you tell me that you think you are pretty safe and even if you do not touch any of her fortune you would be able to borrow upon better terms as the husband of a rich woman and however things went you would fall upon your feet besides as the husband of miss heathcote you would stand better with captain bradshaw yes that's all true enough fred said and i've thought it all over a thousand times i suppose it ought to be done but i would rather remain as i am however needs must i won't put it off any longer i will settle it this afternoon there don't talk about it it's bad enough to have to do it half an hour afterwards fred bingham went out first down to new street where he bought some cigars as usual and stayed for some time in the shop smoking and talking with carry then he went out and turned towards knightsbridge she is an awfully nice child he thought to himself i wish to goodness she was in alice's place and alice in hers i shouldn't mind even if she had that girl farrer's money i would marry her to morrow i wish i had never seen her it would have been better for both of us well it's no use thinking of that now i must go through with this other business the old man will have gone up to his club by this time the sooner it is over the better and so he went on to the house in lowndes square where as he expected he found alice heathcote alone good morning alice i have not gone up to town to day so i thought i would come in for a chat you are not looking very well this morning i miss the usual rosesi do not mean that lilies are less becomingi only notice the change of flowers my uncle is out alice said ignoring the compliment he started for the club rather earlier than usual i rather hoped he would be gone alice for i was anxious to see you alone alice saw what was coming but her mind being fully made up upon the subject she felt no nervousness as she would have felt had she had the slightest belief that he really cared for her the fact is alice i want to ask you to marry me i don't know how it's usually done but that's what it comes to whichever way it's put i have liked you very much for years now i am sure we should suit each other very well and i don't think the old gentleman would make any objection what do you say alice fred bingham had spoken in his usual off hand way but there was a little nervousness in his tone which showed that he felt distrust as to the result of his question you put it in a very straightforward way fred alice said quietly but with a little tinge of sarcasm and i am glad that you do so as it makes it easier for me to say that i differ from you entirely as to our mutual suitability and therefore must decline the honour you propose doing me but i am quite in earnest alice it is only my way you know i suppose you are in earnest fred and i can assure you that i am at least equally so fred bingham paused for a moment and then said much more earnestly than he had spoken before i am afraid alice that i am not going the right way about this i love you very much and have done so for years you must have seen it i know that usually men put all this in a sentimental sort of way but that is quite out of my line but i am not the less in earnest i do love you very much alice i always thought you knew it i will be as frank with you fred as you are with me i have had an idea for some time past that you intended some day or other to make me an offer had you made love to me in the usual sort of way i should assuredly at once have shown you by my manner that the thing was out of the question but you have never done so you have been very often here you have been very chatty and amusing i could not show you that i did not wish you to come so often i was obliged to wait had i believed or did i now believe that you loved me i should feel very great pain in refusing you but although i did and do believe that you wish to marry me i do not believe that you have the slightest love for me in the real meaning of the word any more than i have for you fred coloured up deeply now and looked mortified and angry but i tell you i do love you alice and i suppose i know my own heart a little scornful smile crossed alice's face you may think you do fred if it is so i am sorry but i do not think that your heart has taken any share whatever in the proceeding neither of our hearts are in the slightest degree affected in the question and there is therefore no occasion for me to feel sorrow or for you to feel pain it is a simple matter of opinion you are of opinion that we should suit each other well and that a marriage between us would be for our mutual benefit and gratification i differ from you entirely upon both these points alice was so perfectly cool and composed that fred felt that any further urging would be useless his rage and mortification were excessive and he was far more angry at having been so completely read and seen through by alice when he had believed himself so safe than at the overthrow of his plans may i ask he said bitterly if you have any other reasons beyond those you have given you certainly may not alice said with spirit i have already given you for answer that i do not love you and i conceive that to be quite sufficient answer for any gentleman fred bingham stood irresolute for a moment and then turned to go but his temper got the better of him and he said with a sneer i was a fool to have asked for the reason alice when i know it as well as you do yourself if it had been frank he did not continue for alice heathcote leaped from her seat as if she had been struck with a blow her cheeks flushed with a sudden flame of colour and her eyes flashing but before she could speak fred bingham was gone his last hit had been almost a random one for he had never really suspected alice of caring for frank he had been too well satisfied with his own chance to imagine that he had a serious rival in frank even now he was not sure alice's indignant look might be explained by her natural anger at his own taunt i was a fool to let my beastly temper get the better of me he said to himself the matter was bad enough as it stood without making an enemy of her not that she'll do me any harm she can't well go and tell my uncle what i said however it was a foolish thing to do it's been a nice morning's work altogether to think she should have been all this time laughing at me evidently i don't understand women i believe she cares for frank that's another notch to your score master frank if i ever get a chance to wipe them out look out that's all it was with bitter mortification and anger that fred bingham returned to hans place and briefly told his father that alice heathcote had refused him he gave no details nor did mr bingham ask for any for he saw that fred was in one of those moods when he was better left alone chapter iv a light in the gloom the great bubble had burst at last those who blew it had worked so hard and had blown up such a bulky affair that they had really forgotten that it was all wind and suds a mere baseless fabric which would burst and leave nothing behind it at the first resistance of a solid substance but so it was the great chartist conspiracy had swelled and swelled unmolested by government until relying upon its bulk it sought to assert itself government stood firm and the bubble collapsed the affair however had been of too serious dimensions to be altogether passed over and a few of the most conspicuous among the chartist leaders were taken tried and condemned to transportation at their trial they found as conspirators have almost always done that there had been a traitor in their midst that the whole details of their intended movements were as well known to the government as to themselves who the traitor was they did not discover the evidence was ample without calling him personally but many and deep were the vows of vengeance sworn against him should he ever be discovered among the condemned was william holl who was sentenced to seven years' transportation evan holl learnt the news one afternoon when he had asked leave to go down to knightsbridge he came back before the hour at which he usually returned from his father's frank himself let him in you are early evan yes sir frank noticed that the boy did not speak in his usual cheery tone anything the matter lad yes sir there is a terrible upset at home mother's crying and aunt bessy's crying fit to break her heart and everything is upside down that sounds bad evan come into my room and tell me what is the matter prescott was there as was his custom in the evening when frank was at home now evan tell us all about it if you please sir uncle will has got transported got transported evan why what has your uncle will been doing please sir he's been going and being a chartist oh is the holl who was tried to day your uncle evan yes sir whew whistled frank that is a bad business how the deuce could the man have made such a fool of himself please sir i don't know evan answered taking frank's ejaculation as a direct question addressed to himself no i don't suppose you do evan and i don't suppose he does himself which is more to the point the question is what is to be done there was silence for a moment and then evan said hesitatingly you don't think you could get him off sir do you it will break aunt bessy's heart no evan that is quite out of the question your uncle is a fool and must pay for his folly i could do nothing for him if i wished it ever so much and i am not sure that i do wish it at all i have neither patience with nor pity for these men it is the wife i am thinking of as he ought to have been before he ran his head against a wall something might be done for her though i don't plainly see what there evan go off to bed i will talk it over with mr prescott the result of the talk was that the friends drove down the following morning to knightsbridge mrs hollher honest face swollen and red from cryingwas as usual washing her sister in law sat by the fire in an apathy of sorrow she could cry no more and worn out by her grief looked the image of despondency when the young men entered she did not even look up or appear to notice their presence evan has been telling us mrs holl frank began about this bad affair of your husband's brother of course nothing can be done in his case but we came to ask what his wife intends to do bless the poor creature mrs holl said she ain't even thought about it she is grieving too much over that husband of hers there i have no patience with him though he be my john's brother to think what a tidy chap he were and what a steady good workman before he took up with these chartist goings on yes bessy holl said speaking suddenly and almost startling her listeners for she had appeared lost in her own thoughts as indeed she was having probably but a vague idea of what was being said yes bill was that there was not his equal i've heard say at planing and grooving and moulding and tongueing but there and here she broke into a sort of hysterical laughter it's the tongueing that's done it and i knew it would all along god forgive me she again broke out after a pause i don't know what i am talking about and then she began to cry quietly again rocking herself to and fro i will tell you what i thought mrs holl you see when a convict first goes out he is put to work upon the roads after he has been at that for some time in proportion to the length of his sentence he is hired out to one of the farmers and a year or two afterwards if his conduct continues good he gets a ticket of leave and does as he pleases now in the present case as the sentence is only for seven years it is probable that your brother will not be kept more than a year upon public work and will then be hired to a farmer no disgrace will attach to him afterwards for having been a convict for his political opinions and he may yet live to make an honest name and a fair position in australia now my idea is that his wife should sail a year after him and join him there it is probable that she would find no difficulty in getting employment about the house or dairy wherever he may be women are scarce there the passage money out is about twenty five pounds and say another ten pounds for expenses out there until she is settledthirty five pounds now mrs holl i have plenty of money and i don't see that i can do better with it than to lend this money to your sister in law i am a very unsettled man and do not know where i may be at the end of some months so i have handed over the money to mr prescott here and at the end of a year if mrs holl is ready to start to join her husband he will give it to her as he finished bessy holl rose from her chair and tottered three steps forward and then fell upon her knees then she tried to speak but tears and sobs choked her and she could only gasp out god bless you god bless you to think only a yearmy william my william and she went off in violent hysterics the young men assisted mrs holl to raise her and to carry her into the next room and lay her upon a bed and then frank said we had better leave her to you mrs holl she will soon be better mrs holl turned to him and took his hand young gentleman she said solemnly the thought of that poor child's joyful cry will ring in your ears and gladden your heart may be for many a year to come you will have your reward as the good book says i am a rough woman sir and can no more thank you than that poor creature there but my prayers can do you no harm and you will have them sir may god in heaven bless you sir and make you a very happy man as you deserve to be it was two days later that sarah and bessy holl were shown into the waiting room of the prison where william holl was confined he was to be taken to portland whence he was in a short time to be shipped for australia it was a small room and after they were ushered into it they sat for nearly five minutes in silence before the door was opened bessy was calm and composed now her face was sad but no longer hopeless perhaps indeed if she could have read her own heart she would have found that she was really happier than she had been for months past her life indeed had lately been one long anxiety and care she had seen ruin gradually coming upon them her husband from being one of the best of workmen and the most cheerful of husbands had become an idle moody man her home had been broken up and she herself had suffered the actual pangs of hunger and never for a moment had bessy believed in her husband's schemes and aspirations but had all along had a prison or perhaps a gallows before her eyes as the end which must sooner or later befall him now all this weary strain of thought and care was over her husband would indeed be separated from her for a yearbut what was a year at the end of that time there was a future before them a fresh home in a new country honest labour and contentment and happiness and william would yet again be the william she had loved and married thoughts something like these were running in her mind when the door opened and her husband entered he was already in convict attire and all bessy's glad thoughts faded and she gave a little cry as she looked at his pale haggard face she tottered forward and fell half fainting on his neck my poor girl he said softly my poor girl and i have brought you to this this is the end of all my hopes and plans sarah holl went to the barred window and looked out into the narrow court she so pitied bessy and was so out of all patience as she said herself with her husband that she could not bring herself to speak kindly to him yet for bessy's sake she would not embitter their last meeting so she looked steadily out of the window and stood there alternating between anger and pity now longing to turn round and upbraid william holl for his madness and folly now crying quietly to herself in relenting sorrow william holl placed his wife in a chair and then knelt down beside her oh bessy bessy what can i say how can i ask you to forgive me i have destroyed your life bessy and yet i would have given mine to make you happy when i think bessy how happy we were how bright and gay you were only a year ago and see what i have brought you to i could die bessyoh how gladlyif i could recall the past and have never seen you i see now how right you were and how mad i have beenhow miserably madto think that all the idle hands who were willing to spend their time in talking and drinking and making speeches were patriots ready to die for the cause of freedom i have been a fool bessy but oh that i could have my punishment alone why must i drag you down to misery too even had things been as i thought them what right had i to devote myself as i thought to my country and to sacrifice my wife oh bessy you may forgive me but i never can forgive myself bessy up to this time had not spoken a word sometimes she had tried to stop her husband but her own sobs had prevented her i do forgive you with all my heart william you did what you thought was right you never meant to make me unhappy you never thought and here she broke down again no bessy he said sadly i never did think but i ought to have thought i was a dreamer and i wilfully blinded myself i have not even the satisfaction of knowing that i was ignorant i knew you suffered i knew you wanted bread but i went on oh bessy bessy i have gone all wrong but it is hard upon you i was born to be a blight and a curse to you no no william the wife broke out no no not that yes bessy it is so i know my brother and his wife are good people they will take care of you dear i shall never see you again hear me out darling i only hope that it will not be for long i am not strong and i do not think i shall last many months i hope not i pray to god not it is all i can do for you now bessy to die and set you free but you will think of me kindly dear think of me as i used to be before i went mad as the william who courted you long ago will you promise me this bessy bessy was crying too much to speak oh william she sobbed out at last you must not talk so you will kill me we are going to be happy yet yes yes she said as he shook his head in sad denial you don't know you have not heard what i have to tell you i am coming out to you dear in a little time they tell me they will let you out of prison to work with a farmer and in a year i am to start to you only a year william think of that mr maynard god bless him has given me the money and in a year after you get out i shall be by your side think of it william and he said too there was no disgrace in being sent out for politics and that some day you would get on and be well thought of again yes it is all true william i am only come to say good bye for a year william holl had listened at first with incredulity then with a flash of joyful hope and then with the deep silent thankfulness of conviction then he got up and held his wife to his heart yes yes i feel it is true he said my own bessy once again my own we shall be happy yet then again releasing her he said solemnly let us kneel down bessy and thank god together and let us pray him to bless the man who has thus in the time of our misery given us new life and hope bessy knelt in silence beside her husband and in a voice broken by deep emotion he went on thou merciful god i thank thee that in our hour of misery thou has had mercy upon us grant us a re union in the land to which i go and enable me by a life of earnest toil to atone for my error here and to console my wife for the grief i have caused her and o god bless i pray thee our benefactor and shower blessings and mercies upon him as he has blessed and been merciful to us amen and the sobbing women repeated amen after him the remaining quarter of an hour of the time allotted for the visit was spent in discussing arrangements and in drawing happy pictures of the future and when the turnkey opened the door and said that time was up they parted with tears indeed but with hearts full of anticipation of re union and a happy future chapter v spret injuria form during the time which had intervened between william holl's arrest and his trial and during the anxious time of the trial itself carry walker had called in nearly every day to comfort mrs holl when the trial was over however she had for a few days ceased her visits for she felt that she could do or say nothing to alleviate bessy's distress upon her first visit she was surprised to find bessy sitting at her needlework with a look of absolute contentment upon her face while mrs holl was as usual engaged in washing how are you mrs holl i am glad to see your sister in law is looking better how are you bessy oh i am quite well miss walker and so happy now carry looked surprised happy she repeated has your husband been pardoned no miss but haven't you heard no carry said i have heard nothing i have not been in for the last few days because i was afraid of being in the way what has happened why miss carry sarah holl broke out you'd hardly believe it but it's true a gentleman god bless him has offered to pay bessy's passage out to australia to join william there and in another year she'll be starting that is very kind of him mrs holl who is he his name is maynard him as our evan is with james was watching carry's face and saw a sudden rush of colour come up into it at the name to tell the truth carry had thought a good deal of frank maynard since that solitary visit of his his having saved her father's life had endowed him in her eyes with all the qualities of a hero of romance she had thought over that interview very many times and never without blushing at the thoughts of the kiss she had given him he had said he would come again and very eagerly had she looked forward to his next visit but as days and weeks had passed on without his coming she felt both very resentful and hurt did he think her so forward that he would not come again or did he not think them worth another visit her only consolation had been that perhaps he was out of town all this time and now this hope was dispelled and carry blushed even deeper than before with pique and wounded pride is it the mr maynard who lives in the temple she asked clinging to a last hope yes miss carry do you know him a little carry said coldly he picked my father up one evening last winter when he had slipped down in knightsbridge the cripple lad noticed all thisthe first sudden blush at his name then the coldness of manner and the slighting way in which she spoke of a service which he remembered well she had described in such enthusiastic terms not long before what could this mean carry afterwards was rather ashamed of her little fit of petulance and listened with great interest to the account of bessy holl's hopes and plans for the future then after a few words to james she took her leave very often afterwards james pondered the matter over in his mind while his fingers almost mechanically worked at his wax flowers why should carry have blushed so deeply upon hearing mr maynard's name suddenly mentioned and why should she have spoken so coldly of him when she had formerly been so enthusiastic in his praises as the preserver of her father's life all this was utterly beyond james's comprehension his knowledge of the world was completely confined to what he had learned from books and he owned with a sigh that his books were of no assistance whatever to him in the present case all that after great thought he arrived at satisfactorily or rather unsatisfactorily to himself was that there was some mystery or other although of what nature he could not even guess between carry walker and mr maynard carry walker was a spoilt child she had managed her father from the day when she was able to climb upon his knee and insist with much coaxing certainly and patting of his cheeks and other pretty ways but insisting nevertheless upon having her own way very spoilt she had grown up with no mother to control or check her and with a father who allowed her to do in every respect as she pleased very spoilt had she afterwards beenfor all the admiration and flattery she had received during the last two years was enough to have turned the heads of half a dozen girls she had never had a mother's care or advice or the healthy society of girls of her own age the chances had been all against her and she was little to be blamed in that she had grown up somewhat vain and flighty carry was indignant all that afternoon and was angry with herself for being so during that time she had no opportunity of speaking to her father and it was not until she eat down to tea that she had an opportunity of doing so i was in at the holls' this afternoon father and how is that unfortunate woman my dear dear me dear me i cannot understand why men will neglect their business and go about talking about affairs which don't concern them i cannot see carry upon my life i cannot what good can possibly come of it i told william holl so i cautioned him that he would find out his mistake too late but there i might as well have talked to the wind these all but uneducated young fellows have an idea that the whole wisdom of the nation is centred in their heads all the questions which have occupied and puzzled the wisest men of the nation who have given their whole attention to them these young fellows solve in the twinkling of an eye to their own perfect satisfaction and now what has come of it he has got transported and upon my life i don't pity him at all but there's his poor wife left behind to shift for herself i am very sorry for her but for the matter of that she will do as well without him as with him he has been a world of trouble to her and i believe he has done no work at all for the last four or five months talk talk talk nothing but talk my dear it won't keep the pot boiling still it is sad for her for i believe she loves him idle scamp as he is i wonder what will become of her that is just what i am going to tell you father when you give me a chance carry who had been quietly continuing her tea said i am only waiting till you give me an opportunity of slipping in a word it seems that the gentleman evan holl is with as a servant has heard of william holl's sentence to transportation and of his leaving a wife behind him and he has offered to pay bessy's expenses out to join him it seems that in a year or so he can get a ticket of leave and then she can be with him that is very good of him carry it is mr maynard father the gentleman who picked you up when you slipped down in knightsbridge that night you know you don't say so carry how extraordinary i remember now john holl telling me his boy had gone out to service with a gentleman named maynard but i didn't know it never struck me as being the same dear me what a kind hearted young man to be sure carry was silent a moment and then said pettishly of course he is very kind hearted father but i think he might have come again i call it downright rude stephen walker paused in his tea in utter astonishment he had never given the matter a thought since the evening of frank maynard's visit and this displeasure on the part of his daughter was to him singular and unreasonable in the extreme bless me carry he said you surprise me why should mr maynard come again he came over to see after me and i was very glad that he did come that we might thank him but why in the name of goodness should he come again carry had no particular reason to give so she only said generally that she thought he would come again now carry that is not at all like you i call that unreasonable why because mr maynard saved my life and afterwards took the trouble to come down to see me he should be bound to come again to a place like this to talk to people like ourselves i really can't conceive no carry for once in your life you are wrong and i am sure you will own it carry did not own it but tossed her head a little in dissent at the light in which her father put it but father i am sure mr maynard was pleased with you very pleased you chatted together like friends upon travels and all sorts of things and i am sure he did not look down upon you at all not for the time being carry stephen walker said gravely mr maynard was a gentleman and treated me under my own roof as a gentleman he found that we had topics upon which we could discourse in common he was no doubt surprised and perhaps as you say pleased but carry there are thousands of men of his own class in life with whom he has not only that but a hundred other topics in common and why should he come down here to talk to me no carry you are really not reasonable carry was silent she could not explain that she was angry that frank maynard had not come down to see her and was therefore obliged to let the matter drop still upon subsequent reflection carry did not feel the less piqued she was hurt and was angry with herself for being so if he did not care to see her she certainly did not care for seeing him there were plenty of other gentlemen the same as he was who could appreciate her and were eager enough to talk with her if mr maynard came again she would take care to let him know that there were other people just as good as he was who were not too high and mighty to admire her there was mr bingham for instance he was always there always kind and pleasant and cheerful evidently he cared for her here carry's thoughts wandered off yes it would be very nice to be a lady no more living in a little shop and selling newspapers and tobacco but a real lady with nice dresses and servants and perhaps carriages and above all a home for dear old father after all his troubles and cares oh how nice that would be how very happy and carry's thoughts which had been gloomy enough at the commencement of her reverie ended by drawing a very bright picture indeed carry's thoughts once fairly directed to this subject they returned again to it very frequently by what her father had said she would have been a lady had he not been unfortunate and why should she not regain the position for herself and him indeed she had felt strongly attracted by fred bingham she liked the merry good tempered cheerful young fellow he was so attentive so evidently fond of her indeed it was only the strong influence which the one visit of frank maynard had exercised over her which had hitherto kept this feeling in check now smarting with pique and resentment against frank the feeling returned with redoubled force why she asked herself should she throw away an honest love for a chimera why should she not make herself happy with fred bingham and so from this time she relaxed in her stiffness with him and his visits to the tobacconist's became longer and more frequent the conversations between them more interesting and confidential and there was less of badinage now and more of blushing on her part carry was a very simple innocent girl brought up under her father's wing she had absolutely no thought of evil as soon as she really felt fred bingham loved her she had little hesitation in giving her whole heart to him and in feeling very happy in so doing and so time went on and the gossips of the street began to remark how very often that fair young gentleman was in at walker's shop and the ill natured ones soon began to shake their heads and to say it was a pity carry walker had not a mother to look after her which indeed it was she was ignorant and unsuspicious of harm as una herself only unfortunately she had no lion to protect her a mother would have told her that even if she considered herself engaged to fred bingham as in another two or three months she did it would yet be much wiser not to meet him accidentally so often during the walks which at her father's wish she was in the habit of taking daily but carry had no such adviser and never dreamt on the edge of what a precipice she was walking chapter vi losing the gloves i tell you what frank you are getting extremely snappish and disagreeable prescott said one day to his friend the sooner you go out of town the better do you know prescott i quite agree with you i am i am sick of this sort of life and i want a change you were talking of buying a yacht frank we are in june now if you really mean to do anything in that way this year it is time to be seeing about it pooh nonsense man you know what i mean i want to go down into staffordshire again but i don't see what excuse to make i suppose the proper thing to do frank is to write to mr drake to ask his permission to pay your addresses to his niece what a fellow you are prescott you do make the most ridiculous propositions of any man i ever met it is a pity you did not ask her before you came away frank prescott said after a pause how could i man frank said irritably i was there little over three weeks and i was not sure about myself for the first fortnight if it had been summer and we had had picnics and all that sort of thing where you can manage to get alone with a girl and make your running it would have been different but in a house full of people i had no opportunities whatever it was only that last week too that i had quite made up my own mind about it you don't suppose a woman is like a peach and that you only have to open your mouth for her to fall into it katie is a good deal too great a prize to jump at the first bait besides katie and i fought so and i confess i teazed her so much that she got to look upon everything i said as chaff and if i had told her i loved her the chance was she would have laughed in my face and serve me right too i don't think she had any idea i really cared for her and i believe upon my word that at one time she positively disliked me at any rate it was altogether out of the question my speaking at the time and it would be just as absurd my writing to her now besides writing about those sort of affairs is a mistake things that sound real and earnest enough when you say them look mere sentimental bosh when they're put down on paper no upon my word i don't see my way it's little over two months since i left and i can't offer to go down again especially in junethere is no excuse that i can see there is no hunting or shooting if i did either which i don't what the deuce could i want to go down into staffordshire in june for and frank in extreme perplexity looked at prescott for assistance you have quite made up your mind frank of course my dear fellow am i not telling you so well frank in that case what i should recommend is this i should really write to mr drake not a formal letter you know but a friendly straightforward one say that you are desirous of paying your addresses to his niece that in the confusion and the number of people in the house you had not the opportunity of doing so before that you are perfectly unaware of her feelings towards you and that you are desirous of being a short time in her society again before you speak to her and you therefore ask him if he will again extend his hospitality to you i think that is about the way to put it you might ask him to say nothing to miss o'byrne respecting your visit as it might cause an awkwardness between you by jove yes frank said i would as soon do battle with a lioness as meet katie o'byrne after our late encounters if she knew for certain that i had come down to make formal love to her no no prescott it would destroy my chance altogether i must request absolutely that katie shall know nothing about it she may guess what she likes she can't take a high ground because she guesses but if she were officially informed of it i should no more be able to hold my own with her than i should to fly altogether i think it is a very good idea yes i will write at once now prescott you dictate it you have a legal mind you know and i will write but what do you say to writing to teddy instead of to mr drake i can ask him to put it to his father you know and it will be less formaleh prescott said that he saw no objection and in that case he did not think he need dictate the letter to this frank agreed and wrote as follows my dear teddy i dare say what i am going to tell you will surprise you but the fact is i have really fallen awfully in love with katie o'byrne now you see last time i was down there i had not time to make my running there was too much going on you see and too many people about now i do think teddy i could make her happy if she could care for me i want you to give me a chance will you speak to your father and mother and tell them what i wish and ask them to allow me to try to make katie in love with me you can mention that so far as means are concerned i have eight hundred a year of my own and uncle harry you know captain bradshaw has always treated me as his son and no doubt at his death i shall come into a considerable fortune should they offer no objection will you write and ask me to come down again for a fortnight but above all teddy do not let a word be said to either your sister or kate if sarah knows it katie is certain to find it out and i could no more face her in that formal sort of way than i could fly it would knock any chance i might have completely on head write soon teddy for i shall be in an awfully nervous state till i hear from you be sure and keep it dark as to what i am coming down forsay you have asked me down to do some hunting or something of that sort yours ever frank maynard teddy drake received this epistle at breakfast and its contents threw him into a state of profound astonishment he had not had the slightest idea of frank's feelings towards katie and when he recovered from his astonishment was most delighted he had given one long whistle of surprise when he had arrived at the second line but had read on to the end in silence without heeding the questions of the girls as to what was the matter with him now teddy what is it sarah asked as he finished what does frank say to surprise you so for teddy had apprised them who his correspondent was before he had begun to read is it what does he say teddy repeated in order to gain time to invent an answer yes of course teddy how tiresome you are frank is thinking of becoming a monk and joining a holy community no don't be talking nonsense teddy well sarah he's talking of going out to arabia and becoming a dancing dervish don't ask him sarah katie said indignantly if he doesn't choose to tell us sure and we don't want to know come along we will go and practise our duet when they had left the room teddy turned to his father and mother frank has written to ask me to ask you to let him run down again to make love to katie really teddy you talk so much nonsense i do not know when you are speaking the truth mr drake said while mrs drake uttered an exclamation of surprise i am as serious as possible this time teddy said and he read out a portion of frank's letter i am very glad mrs drake said and to think i had never guessed it i am so glad he is such a nice fellow and it will be a very good thing for katie don't you think so robert yes my dear i do not see any objection in any way mr maynard is a little too rackety to suit me but i do not know that that will be any objection in katie's eyes by all means teddy write and ask him to come down and try and don't do anything foolish if you can help it or speak about his coming if you had not made a sort of mystery about his letter this morning we could have mentioned naturally enough that he was coming down for a short time for change of air or we could have made some excuse or other as it is it will be better to say nothing about it and leave him to explain matters for himself as best he can ask him to come down say on tuesday there is the gig at the door are you ready teddy upon reaching his office teddy drake sat down to write to frank maynard my dear frank i am delighted at hearing that you are smitten by the archer boy isn't that the delicate way of putting it and especially that the person by whom you are so smitten is my cousin katie by the way according to that way of putting it katie would be the archer boy which is absurd so my metaphor is wrong somewhere but after reading it over several times i can't for the life of me see where however you see what i mean and katie and the archer boy have both somehow had to do with the business but they've got mixed up together till i can't tell which is which seriously i am awfully glad frank to think of your falling in love with katie i never dreamt of such a thing and the elders are equally surprised now that you have told me about it i fancy that sarah may have had some suspicion that there was a weakness somewhere for sometimes when your name has been mentioned she has been rather inclined to chaff katie which katie has resented very seriously my father sends word that he shall be very glad if you will come down and stay with us again and named next tuesday come by the ten o'clock train in the morning it gets here at three i will meet you at the station i have read as much of your letter as was necessary to the elders and they as well as myself are pleased at the thought of you and katie coming together we shall strictly obey your injunction and say nothing to the girls about the object of your coming indeed we shall not say you are coming at all for i was too surprised when i got your letter to invent any excuse at the time and if i were to say anything about it now they would think it was odd i did not mention it at the time and would suspect something was up if however you would rather not take them by surprise write a line by return of post and then i will say that you have written to say you are coming for a few days on your way say to ireland on reading over this letter i find it is barely coherent but i dare say you will understand it yours very truly e drake katie o'byrne had thought more often during these two months of frank maynard than was at all satisfactory to herself she had so repeatedly asserted that she did not like him that her assurances lost power even with herself at last however she could no longer shut her eyes to the fact but was forced to own that she had been deceiving herself all along and that she did like yes like frank maynard very much it was with deep mortification that katie made this confession even to herself because in spite of what sarah had said she did not believe that frank had ever thought of her and because he had so teazed and made fun of her that she told herself she ought to hate him still when she thought over that sentence about the sea and the quiet tone in which he had said yes katie you will believe me some day the colour would mount up into her cheeks and she would think that perhaps after all he did care for her but although miss o'byrne came at last to own to herself that she had been wrong and that she liked frank maynard very very much she was by no means disposed to make the same concession to sarah so whenever her cousin turned the conversation to the subject said how she missed frank and wondered whether he would ever come again katie manifested such perfect indifference upon both points that sarah at last came to the conclusion that she had made a mistake and that there was no chance of her ever winning the gloves on the tuesday afternoon the girls were together in the drawing room which looked over the lawn teddy has gone down to the station has he not katie asked yes he ordered the dog cart to be at the office at three in time to take him to meet the train i wonder what he can be up to for when he said so he winked at mamma and she shook her head and frowned but smiled too i wonder what it can be about indeed and i don't know katie said and i don't suppose it's worth guessing about i don't know sarah said there has been something going on for the last two or three days between teddy and mamma some quiet joke and i am not sure papa is not in it too for i have seen him smiling two or three times to himself when there was nothing going on to smile at and do you know katie i have half an idea that it's something about you faith and i'm not curious sarah katie said composedly teddy will be back in a few minutes and the secret will keep till then presently they heard the sound of wheels in the drive and sarah said come along katie we'll catch him in the hall and see what he's brought and she went out followed by her cousin as they went into the large hall the front door was opened and teddy entered followed by frank maynard sarah uttered an exclamation of surprise and hurried forward to meet him as she did so katie whispered indignantly sarah i hate you i'll never forgive you why frank sarah said warmly this is a surprise i am glad to see you again and i'm glad to be back again sarah then frank turned to katie who was coming forward slowly and rather reluctantly for she felt that her cheeks were telling unmistakably that she was not uninterested in this unexpected arrival frank greeted her with how are you miss o'byrnebut i need not ask it's charming you're looking any way don't flatter yourself that it's from pleasure at seeing you again mr maynard don't say that miss o'byrne it's downright cruel i've been picturing you to myself sitting with your watch in your hand counting the minutes to my arrival you are wrong anyhow katie said with indignant triumph for i did not even know you were coming teddy she said turning to her cousin why did you not tell me mr maynard was coming down i asked him not to say anything about it miss o'byrne frank said seeing katie was really indignant either to you or his sister i thought it would be a surprise and i hoped a pleasant one and really and truly did not you know sarah katie asked for up to this time she believed that it had been a plot on the part of all the others to keep her in the dark and that sarah especially had endeavoured to surprise her by bringing her suddenly upon frank really and truly katie i had no more idea than you had well katie said mollified in that case i forgive you teddy i thought you were all tricking me i didn't mean to be cross mr maynard she said frankly only i thought i was being made a fool of and i hate that and she shook hands with him again and looked up unflinchingly at him with her honest eyes it was not until evening that when sarah was playing frank had an opportunity of speaking alone to katie i am sorry i vexed you miss o'byrne it was stupid of me to be vexed katie said but i always hate surprises and i thought sarah had known it all along and was trying to make me look ridiculous i am sorry for it mr maynard then you were not really sorry to see me again katie it was not that no katie said gently it was not that i have been looking forward so much to seeing you again frank said oh yes the girl answered i suppose you wanted some one to plague do you really dislike being plagued katie honestly now i won't do it any more if you do she was silent awhile and then said i did not like it at first but now i begin to understand you i don't mind only i can't help being vexed and then i am ashamed afterwards yes katie frank said i know i used to teaze you abominably but you remember what i told you about the sea well mr maynard you talked so much nonsense that i can hardly remember one part more than another katie rose to go to the piano but frank could see by her face that she did remember it for all that katie did not go into sarah's room that night but kissed her at the door sarah said katie dear the kid gloves will be mine after all the cousin did not answer but went on into her room and shut the door she was happy and felt that she need not check herself now she really had cause to think that frank loved herand although she had laughingly turned off his words she felt he was in earnestshe no longer struggled with her feelings but acknowledged to herself that all along she had loved him the next week passed very quietly frank still teazed katie and katie fought sturdily but she felt the battle was lost there was no mistaking the quiet tone in which he sometimes spoke to her so different from his general strain of light jesting with her and the way in which he spoke to others she fought because it was her nature to fight but she was no longer indignant at his salliesfought as a beaten enemy surrounded and outnumbered fights as a matter of honour and not of hope she resisted occasionally and tried to struggle against the influence he exerted over her but the bird was in the net and knew it she beat her wings and fluttered in vain and ere the fortnight was over frank held her to his heart and her struggles were over she was content to nestle there quietly and answered as he wished to the question and do you believe me at last dear katie chapter vii gathering clouds a cloud has fallen upon the little shop in new street stephen walker is restless and anxious for he feels that something is going wrong carry has changed so much during the last three months that he cannot but notice it her bright colour has quite gone now and only comes back in sudden starts and flushes her manner too has altered even more than her appearance she who used to be so lively and gay who was always humming scraps of song over her work has now become silent and abstracted if she noticed that her father was watching her she would break out in a burst of fitful merriment talking and laughing in a forced unnatural way which was even more painful than her silence stephen walker was a long time before he arrived reluctantly at the conclusion that there was something wrong with carry at first he tried hard to persuade himself that the change existed only in his own imaginationthat she was a little poorly perhaps nothing more but at last he could no longer deceive himself there was evidently something mentally or physically altogether wrong with her very sadly the old man pondered over the matter and wearied himself with conjectures as to what could be the cause she had no bodily ill and quite repudiated any suggestion he made to that effect she was perfectly well she said and stephen walker at last came to the conclusion it must be upon her mind it was evident that nothing could make her unhappy except some love affair and if so with whom could carry be in love when this question was once fairly raised in stephen walker's mind he set himself to watch but it was a long time after he did so before he came to any conclusion upon the subject still longer before he could make up his mind to speak to her about it one day however when he came into the shop after a short absence on business he found the gentleman he suspected leaning on the counter talking confidentially with carry at the sight of her father she started and coloured painfully while the gentleman rose hastily saying i have a holiday you see mr walker mr walker made some general answer and passed into the inner room the gentleman left almost immediately but carry did not as was her custom come into the parlour but remained in the shop all the afternoon it was not until the shop was closed for the evening and carry had taken her work and sat down that father and daughter were together alone even then stephen walker had difficulty in approaching the subject for carry seemed to feel instinctively what he wished to speak of and endeavoured by talking forcedly upon all sorts of topics to keep him from approaching it at last he took advantage of a momentary pause in her talk to begin my dear carry you know very well that i love you dearly i am a poor nervous creature my dear but i cannot but see that you are not the same as you used to be carry with a very pale face laid down her work when her father commenced and she now interposed with a faint protest that she was quite well my dear carry i am not quite sure that i would not rather know that you are not quite well you may be as you say quite well bodily that is you may be free from any actual illness but you are unquestionably changed you are pale and nervous and out of spirits it follows then that your illness must be mental now my dear carry if you had a mother you would tell her and she would advise you and talk to you as i cannot do you are very unfortunately placed dearunfortunate in being so much alone very unfortunate that the only person upon whom you can rely is a poor nervous man like myself but do not think of this carry only think that your old father loves you with all his heart only think that your happiness is his only object in life and open your heart to him dear as you would to a mother carry was crying now kneeling at her father's knees can't you tell me carry she shook her head perhaps i can guess dear i have noticed for months how often mr bingham comes here and i have seen you change colour when he comes in is it he carry do you love him my child carry was still crying but after a pause she said very low i promised not to tell you father but as you have guessed i can speak but please please do not let him see that you know yes father i do love mr bingham and he loves me he has told me so but he does not want anyone to know it because he has no money of his own and we must wait he has a very rich uncle a captain bradshaw who lives in lowndes square and who is going to leave mr bingham a great deal of money but he dares not offend him by marrying he is very old so we are going to wait but i promised not to tell you about it father please do not let him know stephen walker was silent for a little time and then said i wish carry i had known it before i should have warnedno not warned you dear but advised you against it before it was too late i do not like these long engagements carry they seldom come to anything i know the world better than you do my child i have not used my knowledge to much purpose as far as i myself am concerned still i can see clearly enough in your case i had rather it had been some young clerk ay carry or even an honest mechanic or small tradesman that had asked for you still dear i do not wish to blight your hopes but do not build too much upon it these things seldom come off oh father carry said would you not like to see me a lady in a house of my own where you would always live with us and have no more care and trouble oh father i have thought of that so much and this father is quite quite certain to come off yes my child we always think so and the disappointment is in proportion to the hope no carry a long engagement is always bad but when the parties are in different stations of life the chances of its being broken off are tenfold however carry we will hope for the best but be careful my child you know nothing of the world do not encourage him to be here too much neighbours will get to talk of it and a good name is easily lost and although i know my little carry too well not to be able to trust her as well ay and very much better than myself still dear you don't know the world and cannot be too careful if you had only had a mother and here stephen walker's warnings were put a stop to for carry's face which had been bent down while he had been speaking had become deadly white her hand was pressed against her heart and with a half sob half cry she leant forward and her father on stooping down found that she was insensible very poignant were stephen walker's self reproaches as he ran to get some water and endeavoured to bring her round that is just like me he muttered to himself frightening the poor child and telling her her love affair would come to nothing as if i could not see that she worried enough about it without my making her worse what an old fool i am to be sure and to think of her fainting toodear dear and so he wandered on until to his intense relief he saw her open her eyes she looked round in a frightened way there there my dear don't worry yourself carry it is all right now i have been wrong to frighten you carry very wrong and i have no doubt it will all come right why shouldn't it a man who has once fallen in love with my carry would not be likely to draw back no no indeed i thought i was talking wisdom carry and i was an old fool after all carry smiled feebly and stroked her father's hair as he bent over her i am better now father but i am not very strong you are quite right in what you say as you always are dear dear old father but oh i wish oh i wish you had spoken before then after a pause she said how foolish of me to faint but i am better now kiss me father i will go up to bed after carry had gone upstairs stephen walker sat for a long time in the parlour his thoughts were not pleasant poor child poor child he said i would have given all the little i have in the world to have saved her this why did she not fall in love with some one of her own station some one who would have been proud of my bright pretty carry who would have shown her to his friends with pleasure and pride carry would have been very happy in such a home as that and now she must wait for years and perhaps after all be deserted for when the time comes friends will step in and dissuade him and he will begin to think himself that he might choose a wife better suited to him than out of a tobacconist's shop i hope he is not lying to her he would indeed be a scoundrel who would lie to such an innocent child as carry but at any rate i will see if there is any captain bradshaw lives in lowndes square and will find out if i can if he is really mr bingham's uncle if so i shall feel more comfortable and can wait perhaps after waiting a bit carry too may get tired of it and may not take it to heart if it is broken off at last so perhaps no very great harm may come of it but i am sorry i am very sorry if stephen walker could have looked into the room where carry was lying on the bed crying passionately he would have been even more sorry than he was for the next two or three days after this talk stephen walker was but little at home for having found out by a directory captain bradshaw's address in lowndes square he watched there for hours until on the third evening he saw fred bingham enter having thus found out that his story was true so far he went home more satisfied there was another who was watching carry as closely and as anxiously as did her father she had been very restless lately and had very often gone into mrs holl's for a chat mrs holl was frequently out and even when she was at home the conversation was principally between carry and the cripple lad to him carry was as an angel of light he almost worshipped her and she knew it carry liked being admired it was her nature she turned as naturally for admiration as a flower for light besides she pitied james had he been other than he was a helpless cripple carry might have tossed her head a little loftily at the idea of an admirer who was an inmate of john holl's cottage as it was she knew that his feeling had no idea of self in it that it was as disinterested an attachment as that of a brother for a sister accordingly she was very kind to the poor lad and indeed enjoyed a chat with him greatly he had read so much and his whole current of thought and his earnest talk were so different from anything she ever met with elsewhere that she could have listened to him for hours with pleasure the cripple had noticed a change in carry long before it had been visible to her father almost before she had become conscious of it herself at first it had been merely an occasional absent manner while talking to him a kindling of the eye a little flush of colour as if she were thinking of some pleasant thing then james had sighed deeply for he felt that she was in love it was a pain to him to know that he knew she could not be for him he had never thought it but as long as she remained as she was he had at least the pleasure of seeing her often of knowing that she liked him very much that she pitied him and accepted the homage which he paid her if she married all this would be over she would be no longer able to come to see him the visits which were the great happiness of his life would cease and in the love of a husband she would soon forget the poor cripple who would have gladly laid down his life to save her a pang but as time went on the change in carry had deepened and altered and the lad saw that she was anxious and unhappy james in vain tried to find some solution of this the wax flowers made but small progress and the books on mathematics were laid aside that carry should love anyone and not be loved in return seemed to him impossible she was so perfectly different from the few women he had ever seen that he thought every one must see carry in the light of an exceptional being as he did himself what then could it be which could make her unhappy a few days after her conversation with her father carry went into the holls' mother was out and the children were all away carry drew up a chair to the side of the cripple's table and after the first greeting sat silently watching him as he worked james broke the silence by putting down his work and saying suddenly oh miss carry i do so grieve to see that you are not happy not happy james carry said starting from her reverie and colouring deeply not happy what makes you think such an extraordinary thing as that there is no thinking about it miss carry the boy said sadly i am as sure of it as i am that i am sitting here i have watched your face for so many years that i can read it as i can an open book oh miss carry i am miserable to see that you are sad and that i can do nothing had i been like other men i might perhaps have made you happy i would have made a place and a name for myself and i would have loved you so much that you could not have helped loving me a little in return but that was not to be i am a cripple and my love for you is as the love i might have for a dear sister it is hard on me then to know that you are not happy and to be able to do nothing but sit here helpless when i would so willingly give my life if it could do you good carry had sat pale and quiet while he was speaking then she took his hand and said it is better as it is james i should never have made such a wife as you ought to have had i have always known that you loved me always james and as a brother i shall always love you but had you been a brother had you been well and strong you could have done no good here james but you must not think i am unhappy she said trying to speak cheerfully i am rather worried but it will soon be over now and then i shall be very happy i will tell you then james you shall be one of the first to hear it you will always love me james whatever comes won't you she asked wistfully as she rose always carry till i die you will never judge me harshly whatever people say james never carry as god hears me nothing will ever change me thank you james she said i believe you god grant you may never be put to the test and then leaning over him she kissed him quietly and without a word went out from the cottage the next morning stephen walker was in the shop with carry when fred bingham came in for his paper but he was busy arranging his books and did not hear carry's whispered sentence at the old place this evening at five and then as he seemed to hesitate she added in such an agonised whisper you must you must that he nodded assent as he went out of the shop i wonder what she wants he said moodily to himself as he waited at the end of the street for an omnibus the same thing as usual i suppose bah i begin to think i have made a fool of myself at the appointed time carry was walking restlessly backwards and forwards in a retired part of kensington gardens there the trees grew thick and close and through them the long water could be seen with groups of children playing about and throwing food to the waterfowl away to the right the band was playing and through the vista of the trees crowds of fashionably dressed people could be seen moving slowly to and fro for some time no one came near the solitary restless figure at last a man approached whom she recognised as far as she could see him then she stopped walking and leaned against a tree with her hand pressed upon her heart as if to still its beating you're early carry it wants five minutes to the hour is anything the matter oh fred the girl panted out father begins to suspect something he has been asking me questions about you and he sees i am ill oh fred keep your promise to me you know you swore it swore it on the bible you said that if your uncle lived so that you could not marry me publicly you would marry me privately in a month it is three months now fred oh dear dear fred don't put me off any longer no carry i will not but you see i have not been able to arrange matters you see i never thought the old man would have held on so long and then we could have done it publicly but as it is i will see about getting it done privately you are not deceiving me fred you have disappointed me so often oh fred if it is found out what shall i do what shall i do i would much rather dieoh how much rather oh fred marry me in some out of the way chapel anywhere i swear to you that i will never tell anyone but father till you give me leave and we will go away and live anywhere so that it can never be found out only marry me fred so that i may be able to tell him i am a wife if not it will kill him oh fred dear dear fred have pity upon me now my dear carry don't be unreasonable you know how fond i am of you and you may be sure that i will keep my word and make it all right there i promise you i will see about it at once and in a few days i will write and tell you what the arrangements are it is no use your fretting so carry you only make yourself pale and ill i try not to fred but oh i am so so miserable i have to try to talk and laugh and to seem careless and happy when god knows i am wishing i was dead i am obliged to listen and smile when my father talks to me and when every kind word hurts me so that i can hardly help screaming out i shall go mad fred if it goes on much longer you have disappointed me week after week and month after month and though i know so well how you love me and that you are only detained for a while from marrying me still i can't help being very miserable but you will not this time will you you won't put me off any more she said pleadingly no no carry i mean what i say but you don't make allowance enough for me i am so harassed and i have so much to do and have been disappointed inbut there it will all be right now and before very long you shall hear from me i am going into the country on business but will make all my arrangements for the affair to come off as soon as i get back there good bye carry do not fret child it will be all right soon so he kissed her and walked off hastily before she could say anything more when he looked round and saw that she was going away in the opposite direction he sat down on a bench by the water and picking up some small stones threw them viciously at the ducks who swam up to his feet for crumbs it is a great annoyance he said and the deuce of it is the worst has not come yet i have a good mind to take her to some out of the way place and get married and send her away as she proposes into the country where i could run down and see her sometimes i have no doubt she would live quietly enough for years and her old fool of a father with her the betting is ten to one it would never come out and would be pleasant enough but then it is a nasty risk bigamy does not sound wellcase of imprisonment still it might be managed somehow of course after the other i might get some one to manage itget some fellow to act as a registrar and do a civil marriage and he laughed unpleasantly as he hit a duck upon the head it's lucky her old father is such an arrant idiot but there i can think it over while i am away i shan't be gone more than a fortnight and i will carry out this little drama somehow a day or two after i get back i know a billiard marker who would do well enough and then all i have got to do is to get them away from that den into the country she will never know of the other affair they know no one and she never reads the papers at any rate it need not come out for years still it is rather a nuisance altogether take that you little brute the last observation was addressed to a child who had bowled his hoop against the speaker's legs fred bingham accompanied the words by taking the hoop and throwing it far out into the middle of the long water and then with his unpleasant laugh he strolled off pursued by the loud roaring of the child and the indignant scoldings and threatenings of its nurse chapter viii the announcement in the times captain bradshaw had not at first received the news which frank on his return from his second visit to staffordshire had given him of his engagement with equanimity although he had outwardly resigned himself to the failure of his favourite plan he had never quite given up hope that some day or other matters might come right frank's engagement put an end to all this and he could hardly conceal his disappointment frank had however anticipated something of this and passed over the scarcely veiled ill humour with which his uncle had greeted the announcement that he was engaged to a young lady down in staffordshire frank had turned to alice secure that there at least he should find a sympathising listener and although alice had spoken but little at first she presently became as interested as frank could have wished and asked very many questions as to her future cousin and what may miss o'byrne's fortune be frank captain bradshaw asked rather grimly her face is her fortune sir she said frank laughed i thought so captain bradshaw said that is just like you franki could have sworn it the present generation are going to the deuce i think i married well so did my father and my grandfather and so on as far back as history tells us anything about it here you area good looking fellow with every advantagemarrying a young lady of whom i will accept your description as to her personal advantages but altogether as i understand you without fortune it's very sad uncle frank said with comic humility but you see we can't get all our wants if katie had been worth ten thousand a year perhaps she would have been married a year ago i don't think money has much to do with happiness alice said pooh nonsense stuff captain bradshaw said irritably what do you know about it alice alice had no answer ready and after a short pause captain bradshaw went on there frank i don't want to damp your ardour i don't like it and it's no use pretending i do but i dare say i shall like your kate very much when i see her so you had better tell her to make up her mind to like me you have been very troublesome lately frank but i wish you every happiness my boy and so time had gone on the four months the engagement lasted had passed and frank went down to be married taking prescott with him to support him upon that arduous occasion it was three days later that alice saluted her uncle on his coming down to breakfast with there is an announcement in the times of to day which will astonish you uncle what is it alice well to begin with uncle here's frank's marriage innot that that is astonishing but what do you think of the one under it 'on wednesday at st peter's manchester frederick bingham of hans place london to margaret only daughter of the late charles farrer esq of oldham' nonsense alice you are joking it is a fact uncle here is the paper look for yourself what the deuce does he mean by it alice how dare he marry without speaking to me first i don't know i am sure uncle it seems strange but there is a letter on the table for you and i think it is in his handwriting captain bradshaw opened the letter yes it is from him my dear uncle you will i am sure be surprised at the news that i am married indeed i am almost surprised myself it has indeed been rather a sudden affair at the end although i have been attached to the young lady for a considerable time captain bradshaw did not notice the little look of amused contempt upon his niece's face i should have spoken to you on the subject but i hate fuss and i think one marriage in a family is quite enough at a time i did not therefore wish to bore you with my domestic affairs you will i feel sure uncle excuse any apparent disrespect in my not mentioning the matter to you but i did not even tell my father until two days ago my wife is just twenty one years of age is pretty at least i suppose i ought to think so and has a snug little fortune which to a man fighting his way in life is of importance and i cannot like my cousin frank afford to be romantic i trust my dear uncle that when i inform you of the particulars and present my wife to you you will approve of the step i have taken your affectionate nephew fred bingham he is a strange young fellow alice never does anything like anyone else it is just as well though as he says two marriages on the cards would have been rather overpowering it is all a matter of opinion uncle i should not like a husband of mine to marry me in that sort of way as if he were ashamed of the whole affair i don't suppose he's ashamed alice i am afraid though very much afraid by the name oldham you see that he has married into the cotton mills it doesn't matter much in his case he's a railway contractor and i suppose not particular had it been frank it would have been a serious matter i shouldn't like to think of a cotton spinner's daughter at wyvern hall as it is her moneyyou see he says she has a snug fortunewill be very useful to him there's no romance about fred i should think not alice said scornfully no her uncle went on unheeding the tone not a bit he's wide awake is master fred you see she's no father is just twenty one and he married her suddenly i shouldn't be at all surprised and he laughed if there was no time to have settlements drawn out oh uncle alice said impetuously how can you laugh to me all this is shocking well my dear frankly it's not nice and as i said if fred were going to have wyvern hall i shouldn't like it at all still alice i think you are inclined to be a little too hard upon fred he is a shrewd man of the world no doubt but you see you don't know anything about men of the world and so these things go a little against your grain i like fred bingham very much he's a pleasant amiable chatty young fellow although he has not been brought up so to speak in the traditions of a gentleman i like him but i don't do more i shall of course leave him some money when i die but i confess i should never really care for him as i do for frank with all his headstrong ways and the annoyance he has given me alice felt pleased thank you uncle there is in my opinion no more comparison between my two cousins than between light and dark yes alice i know your opinions on the subject but as i said you are not an impartial judge women never are when it is between a man of birth who has a fortune and no work to do and one who has to fight his way but my dear uncle my cousins are equally well born and equally well educated i do not see why there should be any difference between them yes my dear there is a very great difference captain bradshaw said positively frank was brought up with the idea that he should never have to work for his living therefore he has no notion whatever of business is romantic in his ideas would not do a mean thing to save his life and refused even at the risk of losing my favour to do as i wanted himin fact is a gentleman fred has been brought up in a different school he was educated at some private school or other his father is i have always heardfor i never saw the man and never want tois a sharp man of business and married my silly sister for her money and fred has had it instilled into him that money making is the great end of life he is a good tempered off hand young fellow and this has not done him so much harm as it would do most lads he has been to college certainly but that has not done him as much good as it should have done he has turned out a man of the world and as such though i like him very well i could never love him as i do frank you see the difference of their marriages frank marries a little irish girl without a halfpenny she i have no doubt to use his own expression a most loveable little woman and he is as proud of his marriage as if he had made the best match conceivable fred on the other hand without a tithe of frank's natural advantages marries a girl with a fortune and without a father to look after her i shall be interested alice in watching the different way in which the young couples will go on i know which will be the happiest uncle you think you know alice because you have not got rid of your romance yet from what i know of my two nephews i should say they would both make very good husbands in a different sort of way alice dissented very strongly from her uncle but as she could not have said so without adducing reasons which would have shaken what belief her uncle had in fred bingham which she was determined not to do she was silent chapter ix gone carry was in unusually low spirits she had that morning received a letter from fred bingham written from the country in it he told her that he feared he should be detained three weeks but that he would make arrangements for the marriage to take place immediately he returned but that it must be done quietly before a registrar carry quite believed that it would be as he said still she was sick and low at the thought that another month of this wearying deception and secrecy must take place after the shop was closed for the night she took a piece of work as usual but finding that it was in vain to endeavour to keep her attention fixed and that now and then a tear would fall upon it she put her work down and took up the times not for the sake of reading it but to screen her face from her father stephen walker was smoking his pipe quietly and was thinking sadly to himself how greatly carry had changed in the three months when he was startled by a sharp cry of pain from her and looking up saw the paper fall from her hands she had risen to her feet her eyes stared wildly and her face was deadly pale for a moment she stood immoveable then she tottered and with a low gasping cry sank back upon the seat and stephen walker was just in time to support her as she fainted terribly alarmed at this sudden attack her father laid her upon the little sofa and hurried to fetch water to sprinkle her forehead but it was a long time before there were any signs of returning animation then she opened her eyes and looked round wildly then with a shuddering sigh closed them again and remained for some time without speaking at last in answer to her father's earnest entreaties to speak she rose into a sitting position and said faintly i am better again now father i will go up to bed she was so weak however that she had to accept her father's assistance and having seen her to her door the old man returned sadly downstairs poor child poor child he said to himself as he sat down again and mechanically refilled his pipe what a change she is evidently unhappy evidently begins to doubt him already i am afraid he is a rascal if so the sooner she knows it the better what ought i to do and he thought deeply for a while yes that is the only plan next time he comes i will follow him out and talk to him myself i will tell him that i can see that he is here too often for carry's peace of mind i will ask him as a man to keep away altogether if he is only playing with my child's affections if he repeats to me what he has told her i will ask him at any rate to stay away until he is in a position to make her his wife in the meantime if i could but get her away from him the change would strengthen her why should i not he went on more briskly i have two or three hundred pounds at the bank why should i not put some one in charge of the shop and go away for a month to the seaside it would be the very thing for her yes yes if i had carry all to myself at the seaside i should soon get her round again i wish i had thought of it before i will see about getting some one to morrow i will take carry to a doctor too he shall give her some tonics stephen walker went up to bed and felt quite relieved at the thoughts of his plans for carry's benefit he woke up however in the night with a vague idea that some one had been kissing and crying over him as he fairly roused himself and sat up he fancied he heard his door close softly but was not sure that it was not imagination he spoke and there was no answer and after a thought of the pleasant surprise he had in store for carry in the morning he fell asleep again in the morning when stephen walker came downstairs he found that contrary to custom he was the first up poor child he said to himself she is tired i dare say after fainting last night well a good long sleep will do her good and so stephen walker bustled about folded the newspapers and served the customers sending round tom holl before he started on his rounds to ask his mother to come in for half an hour if she could spare time mrs holl soon came round laid and lit the fire and prepared breakfast it was by this time half past nine and the regular customers were all served now mrs holl i will go up and call carry how astonished she will be when i tell her its half past nine and breakfast's ready stephen walker was away two or three minutes and then returned looking white and scared he sat down in a chair trembling in every limb what is the matter mr walker i don't know mrs holl i have knocked and knocked and i cannot make her hear i dare say she's sleeping sound mrs holl said she's not been looking well of late shall i go up and wake her stephen walker made a gesture of assent and mrs holl went upstairs to carry's room she knocked at first gently and then more loudly there was no answer mrs holl was not a nervous woman but she felt frightenedshe did not know of what the fear of stephen walker had infected her and this strange silence made her as timid as he had been she tried the handle to see if the door was locked it was not the door yielded to her touch but it was with a nervous trembling that mrs holl pushed the door open and entered what she had expected to seewhat she was afraid ofshe knew not but no sight could have affected her so much not even the sight of the girl dead in her bed as did that deserted room that unused bed that letter lying upon the table mrs holl saw the truth at once and as she thought of carry thought of the old man downstairs she sat down and began to cry presently she heard a step on the stairs what should she say how should she break it to him she hurried out and met him outside the door don't go in don't go in come downstairs and i will tell you all about it is she he did not finish the questionindeed he had scarcely uttered the words but mrs holl guessed them by the movement of his lips no she's not dead she's not indeed please go down but stephen walker pushed past her and stood in the empty room a low cry broke from him then his eye caught the letter on the table it was addressed to himself he could not stand to read it he sank down in a chair he opened the letter with trembling hands but the trembling ceased and his figure seemed to stiffen into stone as he read on father father what can i say to youhow can i write it he has married another i saw it in the paper this evening yet he promised promised over and over again to marry me only this morning i had a letter from him saying he would marry me in three weeks and when he was writing it he must have been married already i leave his letter that you may see that i spoke truly when i said he promised to marry me and oh father i believed him so i thought him true and honourable and oh father forgive me forgive me for i have disgraced you i cannot live father i cannot live with this shame when you receive this carry and her sins will be over oh father forgive me i know you will and then god will forgive too i have suffered so much surely he will have pity on me father do not think of me as i have been for the last month try and think that i died young think of me as the little carry who loved you so so much and never remember the miserable girl who has brought shame upon herself and you mrs holl was frightened at the ghastly pallor and the set rigid expression which grew upon the old man's face as he read on there he sat still and immovable when he had finished his lips were livid and his eyes fixed don't take on so now don't there's a good creature mrs holl said soothingly she will come back again safe enough don't take on so but mrs holl's words were addressed to deaf ears and seeing that he paid no attention to her she came close to him and touched him then a sharp contraction passed over his face and in another moment he lay on the ground in a violent fit mrs holl was a strong woman and accustomed to hard work but it needed all her strength to hold the old man during the first paroxysm of the attack she was unwilling to call for assistance as she wished to hide what had happened from the neighbours until at any rate she knew what the father might determine upon doing when she saw that the paroxysm was over the kind hearted woman wishing to spare him the sight of his daughter's empty room took the still insensible man up in her strong arms and carried him down to the parlour presently he opened his eyes then putting his hand over his face remained immovable please put up the shutters and close the shop he said at length mrs holl hesitated i wouldn't do that mr walker not if i were you it would tell all the neighbours something wrong had taken place if you bear up and give out she's gone away on a visit no one will be any the wiser when she comes back which she's sure to do sooner or later and you may be sure i would bite my tongue out before i would speak a word you must not be hard on her mr walker poor young thing she has had no mother to advise her right and young girls if they ain't looked after are as certain to go wrong as a horse is to go to water you won't be hard on her now mr walker you'll forgive her when she comes back mrs holl said pleadingly she will never come back the old man said hoarsely never he has married some one else and she could not bear the disgrace she is dead now mrs holl sat down in sudden horror she had not for a moment suspected this she had only thought that carry had eloped with some one and that the letter was to tell her father of it and to beg for forgiveness this was too dreadful and as mrs holl thought of the girl she had known so long and seen so lately now lying dead or perhaps being swept along by the cold river she put her apron over her head and cried unrestrainedly stephen walker shed no tears he sat immovable crushed and hopeless when mrs holl recovered she went outside and put up the shutters and then closing the door went back into the parlour don't take on so there's a dearie let me pour you out a little tea you must not give way if it is true poor child she's happy now whatever has happened she was as good a girl as ever lived and if she has sinned she has suffered the old man did not seem to hear that he was spoken to and mrs holl feeling powerless before this great grief prepared to leave him to himself first however she reached down a bible from the shelf and placed it before him then she said i will come in again this afternoon and see if i can do anything for you keep your heart up there's a dearie do try and think she was always a good girl and that she is happy now and please try and read the good book i've heard them say in church that it binds up the bleeding heart as mrs holl turned to leave mr walker roused himself a little thank you he said faintly thank you you are very good will you send the policeman the one i have met at your house here i want him to search and here he stopped but mrs holl understood him he wanted him to search for the body and with a nod of assent for she could not speak she turned and left him to his great sorrow mrs holl hurried home and then sitting down before the fire and covering her head again with her apron she gave way to a great fit of crying to the astonishment and alarm of the cripple lad who was the only inmate of the house what is the matter mother what is the matter is anything wrong with father or the children mrs holl shook her head but continued to cry silently rocking herself backwards and forwards in her chair the cripple hastily wheeled his box to her side what is it mother you frighten me oh james she sobbed finding words at last carry walker poor girl yes mother yes what of her the cripple panted out she has been deceived my boy by some villain and has drowned herself the cripple gave a cry as of sharp pain his mother looked round and read his secret in his face oh my poor boy my poor boy she cried kneeling by his box and putting her arm round him to think of this but it could not have been james she never could have been for you don't take on my poor lad oh mother i never thought it he cried i never thought it but i loved her so loved her with all my life and to thinkoh carry carry he broke out wildly oh that i who loved you so was helpless to protect you oh that i must sit here and be able to do nothing to avenge youto think that you so good so kind so gentle are goneoh mother mother i shall go mad in vain mrs holl endeavoured to calm the lad his wild excitement his grief and his sense of helplessness turned his brain hour after hour he raved and before night was in a state of raging fever mrs holl sent a neighbour off for a doctor who ordered his hair to be cut off and ice to be placed on his temples but for the next few days his life was despaired of and john was obliged to stay at home to assist sarah with the delirious lad and enable her to slip away for half an hour three times a day to the broken hearted old man in new street chapter x who was it the shop in new street is shut up and has been so for the last ten days two days after carry's disappearance an enterprising young rival a few doors off made an arrangement through mrs holl with stephen walker to take the business off his hands and to supply his customers with newspapers there was an hour's bustle as the books and stock were taken across the road in a hand cart and then the shutters were put up a notice affixed stating that the business was transferred to no over the way and stephen walker remained alone by his deserted hearth great was the excitement and talk in new street upon those first few days not a little was the matter discussed upon the top of the brompton 'busses by the young clerks who had so long bought their morning papers and tobacco at the shop of stephen walker when they first heard of the reason of its sudden closing at the new establishment at no for a few days indeed the matter was talked over almost to the exclusion of every other topic men's comments upon an affair of this sort are very different from those of women women discuss it quite theoretically comparatively few women ever are greatly tempted and they can therefore neither understand nor make allowance for those who are so tried their blame thus falls almost wholly upon the woman upon her they are pitiless she becomes as one who is dead and her name is no more to be spoken by pure lips to the man they are very lenient there may be a little coolness but it soon passes over and in a short time they will again feast him at their tables and offer him their lambs in marriage men upon the other hand reason from what they know in these matters they live altogether in a different atmosphere to that which women inhabit they can understand the old sad story of temptation and weakness of loving trust and broken promises and their censure falls wholly upon the man there was no word of blame for poor carry on the lips of those by whom the matter was discussed upon the top of the brompton 'busses for her there was pity and even sorrow while had his name been known he would have fared but badly at the hands of more than one of the young fellows who had once hoped to win the pretty tobacconist's daughter for their wife in the meantime stephen walker sat alone in the little parlour behind the empty shop like one stunned crouching silently by the firefor although the autumn sun shone warm and bright he was chilled to the bone so he sat from morning to night he seldom moved he never spoke he hardly even thought he sat there in an apathy of despair everything around remained as it had been left there was carry's workbox there in the window hung her birdcage with the canary to which she would chirrup and sing and which would reply in such loud jubilant carollings but the bird missing its mistress's presence and attention had ceased to sing and sat silent upon its perch a mere ball of rough disordered yellow feathers there at his feet was the stool upon which carry was so fond of sitting everything reminded him of her but yet he could hardly think of the past he was too utterly crushed and hopeless to rouse himself into active thought but sat there hour after hour and day after day with the one despairing crywhere was she where was she that question to which no answer came many of the neighbours would have gladly done any kind offices for the old man in his trouble but he would admit two only one was mrs holl who brought him in his meals and stopped to see him eat themwhich he would not otherwise have donetalking to him in the meantime and trying as she said to comfort him up a bit the talking however was all upon her side for stephen walker sat as if he did not hear her as if he was scarcely aware that she was in the room his only other visitor was a these interviews were not long ones as the policeman entered stephen walker would look up with blood shot eyes and trembling lips which could hardly frame the words no news and would pause with almost more of fear than of hope for an answer but day after day a with his usually set face softened before this great sorrow could only shake his head no news to day mr walker and no news you know is good news and then after a few more cheery words which the bent down figure before him seemed not to hear the policeman would turn quietly and go off to his duty but one day the policeman's step was less firm than usual and his face was very grave and serious almost before he entered the room stephen walker felt instinctively that this time there was something to tell he rose from his chair made a step forward leaned one hand upon the table for support and held the other before him as if to ward off a blow what is it he asked almost in a whisper now don't you go and distress yourself mr walker the policeman said soothingly don't you flurry yourself there ain't nothing certain nothing at all it is just this it may be or it may not be more likely not if it weren't that i had promised to let you know directly i heard of anything which might so to say bear upon it i wouldn't have spoken to you at all about it leastways not till i had been down myself and seen about it yes i am coming to it he said answering the appealing look of the old man yes but don't you frighten yourself it may not turn out as you are afraid not at all well according as you asked me i sent round to all the police stations down the river but i have heard of nothing that seemed at all likely not till this morning but this morning i got wordnow don't you frighten yourself mr walker it may not have and i don't suppose it has anything to do with us at allbut this morning i got word that down gravesend way they have picked something up there is nothing whatever to identify it by but it seems they say to have been a young woman and fair that's all i've heard stephen walker did not speak but motioned with his hand towards his hat yes we'll go mr walker but just sit down a few minutes first the policeman said soothingly you had better take a nip of something before you start if you haven't got it in the house i'll fetch it for you stephen walker sank down into his chair again and pointed to a cupboard saying brandy the policeman opened it took out a bottle of brandy and poured a glassful into a tumbler added a little water to it and gave it to the old man there mr walker drink that down then the policeman mixed a glass for himself for accustomed as he was to scenes of suffering and misery he felt nervous at the thought of the scene he had to go through stephen walker drank the brandy holding the tumbler to his lips with both his trembling hands when he had finished it the policeman said now mr walker we will start if you like i've got leave off duty to go down with you and i've got a cab at the door you take my arm sir that's right and so they went out and got into the cab during the drive to london bridge not a word was spoken upon the journey by rail down to gravesend the policeman spoke two or three times to his companion but received no answer and did not even know whether he was heard stephen walker sat in a stupor of despondency and dread from which the policeman had to touch him to arouse him upon arriving at their journey's end outside the station a again took a cab for stephen walker had scarcely strength to stand they were soon at the police office i will go in first mr walker you sit here for a minute or two it may be that i may be able at once to tell you that it is not as you fear and thus you will be saved the pain of such a sight stephen walker made a gesture of assent he was too sick and faint with dread to speak the policeman was away about three minutes which seemed an age to the watcher in the cab then he came again to the door stephen walker gazed at the grave face as if to read his sentence there i can tell you nothing sir it has been ten days in the water and ten days in the thames alters one beyond all knowing i have asked about the clothes and there were none on to speak of and the marks have been torn off what there were either before on purpose or accidentally it looks as if on purpose you will not know more than i do when you see it but i suppose you had better though it is a pitiful sight he opened the door as he spoke and assisted stephen walker to get out the old man followed him into the station house with a firmer step it was a relief at any rate that it was not certain that it was she besides the very extent of his dread took away all hesitation or nervousness there were two or three policemen in the office which they passed through an inspector was sitting in a sort of railed off den writing the others were standing about talking in a low voice they ceased speaking as stephen walker passed through with his conductor a paused for a moment to take up a tumbler of water which had been placed in readiness and then accompanied by the inspector led the way through the office into a yard in one corner of which was a small outhouse a policeman was standing at the door he opened it and they passed into a small room bare and whitewashed with a brick paving the shed was unceiled and the roof was of slates supported by light rafters opposite the door upon some boards and tressels and covered with a sheet lay the body of the dead girl a closed the door and the inspector moved forward to turn down the sheet from her face but stephen walker motioned him back and with a steady step approached his face was hard set he was strung up to a point now when even the dreadful spectacle which met his gaze and which few strong men could have viewed without shuddering and turning faint had no effect on him he looked steadily at it every thought was absorbed by the question had it been carry he could not say no one could say now it was past all recognition only the hair remained intact and although it was fair and long even that was changed the sheen and the glossy brightness were gone and in the tangled skein were pieces of straw and wood and river drift even the hair was scarcely a guide he took it in his hands as if he would fain tell by touch whether it was the same hair he had so often tenderly stroked and played with a thousand memories rushed upon him as he did so the golden haired child who had climbed upon his knee and stroked his face and called him daddy the bright merry girl whose laugh had cheered him in his darkest days the graceful woman he had been so proud and fond of and then a mist swam before his eyes the room reeled round and he felt himself grasped by the strong arms of the inspector and a when he recovered he was lying upon a bed and the inspector and policeman were standing by him his shirt was open and wet and a glass of brandy was upon a table near as soon as they saw that he was reviving they raised him up and held the spirits to his lips in a few minutes he was able to sit up do you feel better now sir yes he said i am better now in a short time he was able to walk before you go sir the inspector said i must ask you if you identify the body you have seen as being that of your daughter i do not stephen walker said firmly it may be i do not know god alone can answer her hair is of the same colour but that is not sufficient for me to say please put down that i do not identify the body this denial upon stephen walkers part was in obedience to a suggestion which a had thrown out upon their way down this although he had at the time made no reply and had not apparently even heard it now recurred to him the policeman had said unless you are sure mr walker quite sure don't swear to it else the name might get into the paper and be put into the registries and come out at the coroner's inquest and all sorts of painful inquiries would be made don't you identify mr walker unless you are quite certain at the same time stephen walker continued to the inspector although i do not recognise the body it is possible that it may be hers and i should wish to pay the funeral expenses i should not like her to lie in a parish grave the coroner and jury will see it this afternoon the inspector said quite understanding stephen walker's feelings and i will tell them that the body is not identified of course an open verdict will be found and i will speak to the parish people they will offer no objection to the expenses being saved i shall go off duty this afternoon myself and if you like sir will make all the necessary arrangements for you the funeral must take place to morrow morning thank you very much stephen walker said you are very good i will be down here at ten o'clock chapter xi stephen walker does his worst on the return journey from gravesend the policeman could not but remark that a great change had taken place in his companion it was not that he spoke more than he had done before for he did not exchange a single word with him but the whole expression of his face and even of his figure had changed on his way down he had cowered in a corner his face generally buried in his hands when he had looked up it was with an expression of utter hopelessness mingled with a certain anxious dread his fingers had twitched nervously he clasped and unclasped his hands and rocked his body to and fro now all this was changed he was another man he sat upright almost stiffly so there was a patch of colour in each cheek his face was set and hard his lips pressed closely together he seemed unconscious of where he was but looked straight in the distance his hands no longer lay nerveless but were tightly compressed in a fierce clench sometimes his lips moved but his companion could not hear that he spoke people got in and out at the various stations but stephen walker never noticed them and was unconscious of their presence much less of the curiosity and comment of which he was the subject his appearance was far too wild and strange not to be instantly remarked and this coupled with the fact of the policeman being seated opposite to him awakened great suspicion not to say alarm one or two people whispered to a to inquire if it was a case of murder and one old lady expressed her opinion audibly that it was shameful taking such a character as that in a railway carriage without so much as a handcuff on the policeman not being able to enter into explanations answered only by a general nod as much as to show he knew what he was about and then tapped his forehead mysteriously this had the effect he desired of inducing a belief that stephen walker was an escaped lunatic and of clearing the carriage of its occupants at the next station complaints were evidently made to the guard of the train on the subject for just before it moved on he came to the window and exchanged a few words with the policeman being informed of the real state of the case he said poor old gentleman in a tone of great sympathy and locked the carriage door so that no other passenger got in until the end of the journey a 's own impression for a while was that stephen walker's brain had given way under the crushing blow he had suffered this demeanour was so utterly unlike the ordinary nervousness of the man that the policeman watched with some anxiety to see that his companion made no sudden movement to open the door and leap out when the train was in full motion after a time he abandoned this idea there was none of the changing light of insanity in stephen walker's eye there was an air of stern determination about him which the policeman felt boded ill for some one the return journey passed without a word being exchanged and not indeed until they got out of the cab at new street was the silence broken then stephen walker turned to the policeman thank you very much for what you have done for me to morrow i shall go down to the funeral of my child for although as you advised i declined to identify her i have no doubt it is her to night i have other things to do the policeman did not turn off at the door as stephen walker evidently expected and wished him to do but followed him into the house excuse me mr walker excuse what i am going to say but from what i have seen of you on the way up i am afraid you are going to do something rash now don't you go to do it sir i ain't talking as a policeman now i am talking as a man don't make matters worse by doing anything rash i know what you are thinking ofyou are thinking of him he's a bad un whoever he is and hanging would be too good for him but don't you touch him sir think it overdon't do anything rash you think i am going to kill him stephen walker asked i don't think and i don't want to know the policeman said i am your friend now and am off duty i may have my own opinion as to what would serve him right but don't tell me they know i've been down with you and i don't want to have to answer awkward questions i only say to you as a friend now think it overdon't do anything rash it can't set things right and it will only cause trouble don't you think of it mr walker i am not thinking of it stephen walker said if i were younger i should i am an old man now and a feeble one although i don't feel feeble at present no i do not think of killing him if i knew i could i would ay as truly as i stand here but i am nervous and feeble and i might fail and then he would escape to enjoy the triumph of another victim no i will strike him with a surer hand than that thank god i know who he is and i think and hope i can ruin him upset all his hopes and plans and embitter his life and i will do it you look surprised policeman and well you may he thought carry had no friendsno protector and well he might i was a feeble nervous old man i could not save her but i am not nervous now i am a desperate old man and i will avenge her good evening the policeman shook stephen walker's hand and went away even had he wished it he could have urged nothing which would have availed with the old man and indeed relieved from his fears of bloodshed he was glad to hear that justice of some kind was to be done that evening after dinner captain bradshaw was still sitting in the dining room with alice when he heard a ring at the bell after a short conversation in the hall the servant entered the room if you please sir there is a man in the hall wants to speak to you particular what sort of man james well sir a decent looking manan old man sirnot a gentlemanbut he looks strange rather i should say as if he had been drinking wild about the eyes you know sir and he won't say what he wants james no sir all he will say is that his name is stephen walker stephen walker captain bradshaw repeated to himself once or twice stephen walker i seem to know the name yes i remember now stephen walker tobacconist the man frank picked upthe broken down gentleman with the pretty daughter what the deuce can he want then aloud for this had been muttered to himself show him into the library james you may as well wait here till i come back alice i don't suppose i shall be a minute if the man is drunk uncle had you not better tell james to wait at the door pooh my dear the old officer laughed i fancy he's nearly as old as i am if i want james i can ring the bell then he rose and went into the library into which the visitor had already been ushered stephen walker was standing by the table he was silent for a minute after the door was shut looking steadily at captain bradshaw as if to read his character captain bradshaw in return looked at him he saw at once that the footman's surmise was unfounded but he saw too by the compressed lips and flashing eye that the man was from some cause in a state of extreme agitation and fury indeed for a moment the thought occurred to him that his visitor was mad this idea was at once dismissed when stephen walker began to speak captain bradshaw i have come to tell you a story it is a sad one sir but not an uncommon onenot an uncommon one i such as you see me was once a gentleman my circumstances changed and i took a very small shop in new street where i sold tobacco i was not as you see me now a determined manperhaps even a dangerous one i was a broken down nervous old man with only one stay one hope one pleasure in the world i had a daughter sir a bright happy innocent girl a man came to us over and over again and he won her heart the old story captain bradshaw of love and trust he promised her marriageover and over again he promised it but he had an unclecaptain bradshaw started violently he saw what was coming now he remembered the conversation he had had with frank upon this very subject of the tobacconist's daughter he remembered the warning he had given and frank's promise not to go there again and he grew very pale and faint as his visitor went onhe had an uncle siran uncle from whom he expected to inherit great wealthand he dared not risk his anger by an open marriage with my child he told her that the uncle could not live long that at his death he would marry her openly but that if he lived he would at any hazard marry her privately in a short time accidentally i gained her secret and to test the truth of the story i watched for days outside that uncle's door until i saw the man enter there then seeing that the story was true so far i hoped for the best you see what a poor nervous simple man i was even then he had ruined her i never dreamt of it or i old and feeble as i am would have killed him a fortnight since my child saw in the paper the marriage of this man with another to day captain bradshaw i have been down to gravesend to identify the body of what was once my child were i a young man i would take vengeance with my own hands but i am old and helpless and i call on you to give me justice that man is your nephew and he is a damned scoundrel captain bradshaw sat for a minute or two as if stunned the old soldier though passionate and hot tempered was a man with a great heart and this sin was one he held in extreme horror the story of the man who stood before him would under any circumstances have greatly moved himwould have filled him with burning indignation as it was the blow fell upon him almost as heavily as upon stephen walker he had lost a son as entirely and finally as the other had lost a daughter for he loved frank maynard as a father might do true he had for a few months past treated him with some coolness but his affection had been unshaken and he had fully resolved that upon his return from his wedding tour he would take him thoroughly into favour again to hear now that he was a cruel and cold blooded seducer to know that he was utterly worthless this was to lose him for ever he hid his face in his hands and groaned then with a quick movement as one determined to throw aside all regrets he rose to his feet and took stephen walker's hand mr walker he said may god help us both for we suffer nearly equally i loved that boy as you loved your daughter he was my heir and the hope of my old age but what you have told me separates him from me as completely as if he were dead you ask me for justice and here the old man's voice grew sharp and clear and justice you shall have from this hour he is dead to me not one farthing of my money shall he ever have never again will i speak to him there sir you have my word for it i thank you sir as you said god help us both and without another word stephen walker turned and left the room alice heathcote had been rather alarmed by what the servant had said and had listened with some anxiety for the departure of the strange visitor presently she heard his step come along the passage from the study and then the closing of the front door as he let himself out she waited two or three minutes but heard no sound of her uncle coming from his study becoming alarmed she went to the door knocked and opened it the old man was still sitting in the chair into which he had sunk while stephen walker was telling his story his hands lay listless beside him but there was a quick nervous movement of the fingers his face was sad and very pale a grief all the more painful to see that it was tearless alice saw at once that something very serious had happened the nature of which she could not even guess her uncle did not look up at her entrance and alarmed at this terrible depression this silence so different from the fits of impatient anger to which captain bradshaw was given when put out she went up to him took one of his hands in hers and laid her other upon his shoulder my dear uncle what is the matter it was only upon the question being repeated that he looked up poor alice he said you will feel it as much as i do more and more alarmed alice knelt down by the old man's side what is it uncle please tell me i would keep it from you if i could alice but you must know it i am grieving alice because i have lost a son yes alice it is so he went on sadly in answer to alice's look of surprise i loved him as a son i looked upon him as my heir and now he is lost to me for ever frank alice gasped with a feeling of sickening dread yes my dearfrank he is alive alice alive and well as far as i know he said quickly for by the ashen pallor of her face he saw that she imagined that he had heard of frank's death but i would far rather have heard of his death from this moment he is dead to meworse than dead had he been really dead i could have mourned him as a father might mourn the dear child of his old age better far better that than to know that he is a base dishonourable scoundrel as captain bradshaw finished alice heathcote leapt to her feet with a start as rapid as if she had been struck her blood rushed to her cheeks her eyes flashed and she exclaimed vehemently it is false uncleit is false i would stake my life on frank's honour who dares to say that of him frank a base dishonourable scoundrel and you believe it oh uncle uncle after all these years to doubt frank i would have spoken as confidently and as warmly as you do alice ten minutes ago but i can do so no longer there is no doubt now in my mind none at all i must tell you the story aliceyou have a right to know it sit down dear by me and listen quietly alice secure as she felt in frank's honour and faith yet felt a cold chill creep over her at this tone of quiet conviction upon the part of her uncle had he been in a passion she would not have believed what he said but the tone of deep quiet sorrow frightened her she put a stool by his chair and sat down on it looking up into his face as he spoke every vestige of colour fading out of her own as he went on with his story you may remember alice last winter frank and mr prescott coming in here and our hearing that frank had picked a man up from almost underneath the wheels of an omnibus at the risk of his own life the man gave frank one of his cards which he showed to us his name was stephen walker tobacconist alice made a slight sign of assent she remembered the circumstance well a fortnight or so afterwards my dear frank came in here and told me laughing that he had been to see this man that he had apparently been once a gentleman and that he had a very pretty daughter who was of course very grateful to frank for having saved her father's life alice felt what was coming now and a feeling of almost terror crept over her as a man of the world my dear i spoke to frank about it i warned him that he had better not go there again the girl was very pretty he said and very grateful if he went again mischief might come of it my words to him were if i remember rightlyin these cases nothing but harm can come a man either makes a fool of himself and marries the girl or he makes a rascal of himself and does worse frank did not like what i said at first but finally agreed in its justice and promised to go no more so you see alice he was warned after that there could be no accidentit was done deliberately i never heard or thought any more of it until i came into this room this evening then when i saw the state of terrible agitation he was in i guessed the truth he came to call for justice frank had won her under promise of marriage he had said that i was very old and that he could not marry her openly until my death but he promised a secret marriage no no uncle alice said vehemently i will not believe that i will not believe it it is not true frank might though i do not think it have done what the man accuses him of but i feel sure he did not but uncle frank is not mercenary he never built on your death no no uncle nothing in the world will make me believe it of him i am as certain as i am of my own life that he did not my dear alice the old man said sadly do you think i should be apt to believe anything against frank rashly but there can be no question here do you think a man would come from the side of his dead daughter to tell me lies oh uncle uncle alice cried pitifully yes alice it is too true i must tell you aliceyou must know it all now that you may agree with me that we must never speak of him again so it went on alice until the poor girl read in the papers the announcement of his marriage then she left her home suddenly and her father came to night to tell me that he had been to see her body to day at gravesend alice gave a little sob of horror and hid her face on her uncle's knees oh uncle it is too dreadfulit cannot be true she cried at last there can be no doubt no hope alice the man's story is too clear and he was too terribly in earnest to doubt him for a moment it seems that he found out something of it and watched to see if frank came here in order to test the truth of that part of the story and he saw him come in my dear there is no doubt frank is guiltyguilty of a deliberate act of baseness done under the worst possible circumstances from this moment he must be to us as if he were dead we have been utterly deceived in him now we really know him there is an end of all communication between us but how is it possible uncle alice pleaded that frank who has always been so true and straightforward and honourable could have done it it does not seem possible uncle my dear all things are possible the old man said sadly you were reading to me last week a book where a man seemingly as open and popular and straightforward as frank did the same thing and you did not see any impossibility in it then steerforth was just such another as frankhe treated little emily just as frank has treated this poor girl oh uncle i can't believe iti can't believe it alice wailed captain bradshaw was silent presently he said although there can be no doubt as to the circumstances alice still of course we have only heard one side frank may have something to urge in his defencesomething which may mitigate although nothing could possibly excuse the terrible fault he has committed i shall write to him to morrow if he has anything to urge in his defence he will do so i trust that he will i can never know him again never but i should be glad if possible to think that he has not been such a cold blooded rascal as he appears to have been there alice don't cry any more dear think that it is worse for me than it is for you you are young and will make fresh loves fresh friends i am old for me there is no future hope i have lost my son i find that my confidence and love have been misplaced i cannot begin again you are all i have in the world now alice for although i like him i can never love the man who must now be my heir chapter xii following it up stephen walker turned away from lowndes square with a feeling of stern satisfaction at least the destroyer of his daughter would not go unpunished he should pay with the loss of his expected fortune for the damage he had wrought so far stephen walker thought that his success had been all that he could have wished for but his task was but begun yet he had resolved upon blighting his enemy's prospects through life he had determined that he would devote his whole life to this purpose that he would everywhere dog his footsteps that wherever he went whatever he did he would follow him and tell the tale to all who would listen to him fred bingham's friends his work people everyone with whom he associated should know that the pleasant laughing young gentleman was a heartless scoundrel no doubt he had imagined that there was nothing to fear from carry's father that the nervous old man would do him no harm would give him no trouble ha hawe shall see and stephen walker laughed fiercely aloud and shook his clenched fists as he strode along across sloane street into hans place with the dignity of a great passion in him he felt and was more of a man than he had ever before been during his life he stopped at mr bingham's house and rang sent in his name and was shown into the study where mr bingham was engaged upon some plans he looked up ah mr walker is it you haven't i paid your last quarter's account for newspapers i do not come about bills mr bingham i come upon a very different matter ah indeed and what may that be mr bingham asked looking up keenly at his visitor for he saw at once by his manner that he had come upon no ordinary business i will tell you mr bingham the man said shortly will you take a seat mr bingham put in more and more surprised but still bland and tranquil in his manner i will not stephen walker said nonot if i never sit down again mr bingham said nothing he still preserved his bland smile but he felt that it was something very serious now you have been to my shop sir and you have seen my daughter mr bingham made an assenting gesture but the smile left his face he guessed somewhat of what was coming she was all i had to love in the world and i did love her with all my heart and soul she had grown up all i could wish hertender loving happy and bright a villain came to the shopa smiling smooth tongued villainwho told her that he loved her promised to marry her and who deceived and ruined her her so innocent of the world her who trusted him as she trusted her god he married another and she read it in the paper and went madwent mad and even doubted my forgiveness i who would have taken her to my heart and comforted her and pitied her she went mad sir and her body was picked up in the thames yesterday the scoundrel who did it was your son frederick bingham mr bingham had listened throughout without moving without changing a muscle the bland expression had died out from his face otherwise he manifested no emotion but all the time stephen walker had been speaking his brain had been busily at work mr bingham was not a very hard hearted man but his susceptibilities had been much blunted with long contact with the world and he was accustomed in his business to what the world calls sharp practice under ordinary circumstances he would have been greatly shocked at the story he had just heard perhaps he was now but the feeling was merged in the more pressing one of actual danger this man was dangerous in his present state he was capable of doing any mischief but what could he do how would he act and how could he be met these thoughts passed rapidly through his mind during the few seconds stephen walker was speaking nor had he determined what course to take when he was unexpectedly relieved by the entrance of mrs bingham who not knowing that her husband was engaged had opened the door and entered in time to hear the closing sentence of stephen walker's speech as a hen will defend her young ones when attacked by a hawk so did mrs bingham blaze out in defence of her son oh you wickedwicked man oh you bad abominable person to come here to say such things against my freddy the dearest and best fellow in the world what does he mean richard she turned to her husband why don't you give him in charge of the police nonsense my dear mr bingham said testily although he really felt grateful for the opportune interference of his wife do be quiet and reasonable this is mr walker a very sad business has taken place his daughter has made away with herself and he accuses fred of having seduced her under promise of marriage oh you villain mrs bingham said turning again upon stephen walker as he stood impassive before her oh you bad story telling man my freddy indeed who would not hurt a fly to be accused of doing such wicked things as this richard go out directly and get a policeman i am ashamed of you sitting there doing nothing why don't you knock him down or kick him or do something and then from indignation and helplessness mrs bingham sat down and began to cry by this time mr bingham was sufficiently recovered from his first shock to continue the conversation i suppose mr walker before you came here to bring forward such a serious accusation as this you were quite sure of what you are stating quite stephen walker said gravely i am heartily sorry mr walkermore sorry than i can say unfortunately there is nothing that i can say or do to alleviate your distress is there anything you can possibly suggest that would afford you any satisfaction stephen walker waved his hand scornfully i called mr bingham to tell you this historyto let you know what this son of yours really is will you tell him from me that i pray god to curse him for the ruin he has brought upon my house tell him that although i am an old feeble man unable to save my daughter i will devote the rest of my life to avenge her that wherever he goes with whomsoever he associates i will take care to let them know this story the men who work for him i will see the men he does business with i will write to he thought me harmless and helpless he thought me incapable alike of protecting carry or of avenging her he will find out his error this is the second visit i have paid this morning i have been to lowndes square and have seen captain bradshaw and your son one day will find that he has paid very very dear for his frolic thus saying and without waiting for any reply whatever from mr bingham stephen walker left the room mr bingham sat in a blank stupor of dismay i have been to captain bradshaw he repeated and your son will some day find that he has paid very very dear for his frolic there was no mistaking the meaning of that as far as his uncle was concerned fred was ruined a splendid fortune was lost in one stroke and beside this there was to be a perpetual persecution and scandal the madman had said that he would follow fred everywhere and denounce him to all this was terrible and mr bingham leaned back in his chair with a positive groan of dismay in the meantime mrs bingham continued to cry hysterically what a shameful vile man she sobbed at last to go about telling stories about poor dear freddythe kindest and best fellow in the world he would not have harmed a worm if he did do it i am quite sure it was not his fault he must have been led on by that shameless wicked hussy it was very wrong of him of course very wicked and sinful but not my dear mr bingham broke in nonsense wicked if it had been fifty times as wicked i should not have minded but it was madness sheer madness richard i am shocked at you mrs bingham began in a tone of absolute horror well well my dear you know i do not mean that but i am almost beside myself to think of fred's madness ay madness indeed mrs bingham said it must have been just that richard a sudden madness which made him fall into there there my dear mr bingham said that is quite enough for the present do go away and let me think over this affair it is enough to drive me out of my senses do go up to your own room and compose yourself there is no occasion to tell the girls and the servants and everyone else about it as if i were a fool richard mrs bingham began indignantly but mr bingham waved his hand so impatiently that she said no more but rising with an extremely injured air left the room as for mr bingham he walked backwards and forwards on the hearthrug with the air of a man astounded once or twice he sat down at his desk took up his pen and then throwing it down with a gesture of almost despair renewed his walk as has been said mr bingham was not a really hard hearted man he had very frequently interposed in favour of defaulting tenants and had endeavoured to mitigate the severe measures fred was disposed to put in force against them at any other time he would have been greatly shocked at the news he had heard now he quite lost sight of the heartlessness and cruelty of fred's conduct in the imminence of the danger his whole thoughts were devoted to the consideration of the best course to be pursued under the circumstances he could arrive at no conclusion however except that he had better summon fred back to town at once at last therefore he sat down in earnest to write saying solemnly as he did so well after this i will believe anything to think that my son fred bingham could have acted in such an insane way as thiswith a girl too in his own neighbourhoodand above all should have allowed his connection with captain bradshaw to be known to her it is beyond all human comprehension with this reflection he drew some paper towards him and wrote in his beautifully neat handwriting in which no one could have detected the least sign of haste or agitation as follows my dear fred if anyone had asked me an hour ago whether i considered you capable of acting like a fool or a madman i should have given them one answer if i were asked now i should give altogether another one mr walker has been here having previously visited captain bradshaw to whom he mentioned that his daughter had drowned herself in the thames and that you were not altogether unconnected with the circumstance to me he announced his intention of devoting the rest of his life to the occupation of keeping your friends acquaintances and work people au fait in the matter i should say that he is likely to carry out that intention i make no comment whatever but should suggest your early return your affectionate father r bingham not a pleasant letter for a man to receive with his breakfast within a fortnight of his wedding day fred bingham was staying at cromer when the letter reached him he was laughing and talking to his young wife as he opened his father's letter and the first glance at its contents froze the words on his lips he never had any colour to speak of but his face turned a ghastly pallor the first thought that shot through him was horror at the news of carry's death the second was consternation at its consequences to himself his wife was startled and alarmed at his face but he made a gesture to her not to mind him and even in the short fortnight which had elapsed since her marriage she had learnt that he must be obeyed fred bingham rose from the table and walked to the window then he came back again and said i have got some troublesome news from town margaret i shall go out for a walk and think it over you take your breakfast i shall have mine when i come back for an hour fred bingham paced up and down upon the sands here were all his plans and hopes destroyed and all by his own carelessness how could he have been fool enough to tell carry walker about his uncle still she had promised not to tell her father and even had he supposed that her father might have found it out who could have dreamt that that old imbecile would have ever turned round and become dangerous everything had turned out unfortunate there was carry well yes he was very sorry for her very sorry indeed but what did she do it for it really looked as if it was just out of perverseness when he had intended to have acted kindly to her and made her comfortable thus to upset everything drive her father into a sort of madness and destroy all his chances in life it was too provoking however one thing was evident he must take his father's advice and go up at once to london he must see captain bradshawof course it would be a most terrible interviewbut it must be got through perhaps after a time he might be able to put matters in a better light of course any promise of marriage must be denied there were no proofs whatever of that except that last letter of his and any assertion carry might have made he should of course plead temptation yes it was a terribly bad business but something might be got out of the fire thus thinking he at last went back to his hotel ate a hearty breakfast and told his wife that he must go up to london on imperative business for twenty four hours he said that she must stay where she was for the house would not be ready for them for another week and she would only be in the way he should be back the next evening without fail so after breakfast he went up to london chapter xiii a desperate game fred bingham on his arrival in town drove to the office where he had telegraphed to his father to meet him the binghams' office was in salisbury street strand there they had two rooms on the ground floor the one behind was occupied by two articled pupils and a clerk whose business it was to draw the details of plans and designs and to make calculations as to quantities and estimates the front room was a comfortable office here was a large drawing table where mr bingham designed and drew plans here was his writing table piled with engineering works upon the walls hung architectural and engineering plans of all sorts faades of churches plans of hospitals railway bridges viaducts and many other things here too piled on shelves or leaning against the walls were plaster friezes drain pipes encaustic tiles valves short sections of railway rails models of bridges and tunnels and many other engineering odds and ends mr bingham was standing in his favourite position on the hearthrug with his back to the empty fireplace when fred entered well fred i must congratulate you on having made as nice a mess of your affairs as could well be imagined there it's too late to talk about that now fred said shortly i've made a fool of myself and you can't tell me that more strongly than i feel it myself the question is what is to be done my own idea is that i had better go and see captain bradshaw at onceof course knowing nothing about what has taken place he will do the indignant and i must be penitent then of course i shall urge youth inexperience artful woman crafty old father and so on create as good an impression as i can profess regret for loss of his good opinion more than that of future fortune take my leave much depressed and leave things alone for a few weeks before i approach him again i suppose that is about the line you recommend yes fred i don't know that you want much advice from me his father said dryly by the way you must say the same sort of thing to your mother when you see her she was in the room and heard it all and has been terribly put out but of course she does not blame you fred looked annoyed i am sorry the old lady heard it we must talk over the best way to shut that madman's mouth well i shall go and get the business over at once i will come in to hans place after i leave him and let you know the result it was not with very comfortable feelings that fred bingham knocked at captain bradshaw's door for he felt that it was by no means improbable that orders might have been given that he was not to be admitted the footman however opened the door and admitted him as usual how are you james my uncle in yes sir he's in but he's not wellsomething wrong sir he added with the privileged loquacity of an old domestic oh indeed fred said carelessly and miss heathcote is she in she is in but you won't see her sir she's poorly tookept her room all yesterday and to day master is in his study sir fred bingham braced himself up for a scene as he followed the footman to the study the servant opened the door and announced mr bingham fred entered captain bradshaw appeared to have been dozing in his easy chair he looked up and to fred's astonishment instead of saluting him with a torrent of invective he merely said why fred you are soon back again in town tired of your honeymoon already fred was too much surprised to answer at once and was rapidly revolving in his mind whether this manner was a mere mask assumed by his uncle however after a moment's pause he answered not tired at all uncle but i had to run up to town for a day on business i go down to cromer to morrow again i think you might have told me you were going to be married fred well uncle i hate a fuss about these things and we were married as quietly as possible so i thought i would say nothing about it until i could tell you that it was all over well well every one to his taste every one to his taste captain bradshaw said evidently thinking of something else and then sat in moody thought fred bingham looked at him in astonishment what could this mean did his uncle intend to keep him in ignorance of his knowledge of the affair of carry or was it possible that he did not know after allthat stephen walker had only intended to frighten him and had not been to captain bradshaw at all this hope was dispelled by the old man's next remark the fact is fred i am out of sorts i have heard a piece of news which has upset me terribly indeed uncle was all fred could say yes fred a very bad affair so bad that i can hardly realise it he paused again what is it uncle fred asked with an effort for he was far more alarmed at this tone of quiet sadness on the part of his uncle than he would have been at the most furious burst of passion yes fred i will tell you the circumstances an old man called upon me the night before last he was half beside himself with grief and anger the man's name was walkerstephen walker i remembered the name because i had heard it before under peculiar circumstances one day last winter it seems he slipped down in knightsbridge and your cousin frank picked him up just as an omnibus was going to run over him perhaps you remember hearing of it fred could only nod his uncle had mentioned the fact to him with great glee at the time but had not mentioned the name and he was until now ignorant that it was stephen walker whom frank had rescued he did not however speak he was too anxiously preparing for the blow which he felt sure his uncle was reserving as the climax for this prolix story some little time afterwards frank came in one evening and told me he had been to see this man and that he had a pretty daughtera very pretty daughter i told frank he had better not go there againit was dangerousand frank saw it and promised not to go again the drops of perspiration stood on fred bingham's forehead as his uncle went on this slow approaching to catastrophe was almost more than he could bear and he had a great mind to throw himself at his uncle's feet and cry for mercy but before he could determine upon the expediency of such a move his uncle went on the night before last as i told you this man came here to cry for justice and vengeance he had just come up from gravesend where he had been to see the body of his daughter who had drowned herself in the thames and who had been seduced under promise of marriage by that infernal scoundrel frank maynard fred bingham had half risen from his seat with the intention of throwing himself at his uncle's knees when the substitution of frank's name for his own astonished him into a sharp cry of surprise frank maynard ah you may well be astonished fred i would not have believed itno i would not have believed it possible but there was no doubting the man he was too terribly in earnest fred bingham sat in stupified astonishment the shock was too great and too sudden for even his constitutional coolness his first thought when he did think waswas this a mere ruse on the part of his uncle or was he really deceived as he looked at the old man's serious face and remembered his perfect simple mindedness and frankness he saw at once that his uncle was acting no double partthat he really believed it was frank and not himself who had been the offender fred remembered too that the servant had said alice was ill and keeping her room and he was very certain that the news of his own downfall would not so affect her it was evident that frank was really looked upon as the offender once conscious of this a whirl of thought flashed through his brain how could this extraordinary mistake have occurredand more important still should he profit by it and keep up the error or should he confess the fault was his own and throw himself on his uncle's mercy while he was yet debating the question captain bradshaw went on the old man asked for justice and punishment on the destroyer of his child and he shall have it until now fred i tell you fairly frank has been my favourite nephew from the time he was a child i have looked upon him as my son and heir and i had left him two thirds of all my property the remainder to yourself i yesterday wrote to my solicitor requesting him to draw out a new will leaving everything to yourself fred was decided now he would risk it it was evident that if he confessed the fault he should get nothing if he could keep up this extraordinary mistake he should get all and he really risked nothing for if he were found out he should be no worse off then than if he confessed now it was worth trying for at any rate a host of dangers rose up before him but he put them aside to consider and meet them as they might occur it was a great stake he was playing for the whole of mr bradshaw's estates or nothing for if he confessed he should certainly get nothing he spoke coolly and collectedly i thank you for your kind intentions uncle but i can hardly think of this now i am so surprised so shocked at this terrible story i could not have believed that frank would do such a thing i knew he was rash and headstrong i heard indeed some stories whispered about him at cambridge but i could neverno not for a momenthave believed him capable of such a cold blooded villany as this seems to have been oh uncle there must surely be some mistake no fred there is no mistake it is too true there was no mistaking the man's manner he was terribly in earnest fred bingham said no more for a while but sat thinking deeply on the course to pursue at last he said and what do you mean to do about frank uncle do you mean to write and tell him what you have discovered i have been writing this afternoon i have not sealed the letter there you can read what i have said if he has any excuse to offer for himselfnot that he can possibly have anyhe will write and urge it fred bingham took the letter and read it through very slowly in order to give himself the more time to think the letter recapitulated the incidents connected with frank's first knowledge of the tobacconist recalled the warning given to him respecting the pretty daughter and his promise not to call there again and then recited stephen walker's visit and the terrible charge brought against him it concluded by cutting off all connection whatever with him and forbidding him ever to speak to his uncle again fred saw at once that frank upon the receipt of this letter would insist upon an explanation would go to the tobacconist and bring him round in triumph to prove his innocence and that his own guilt would infallibly appear well fred what do you think of that letter his uncle asked at last it is conclusive is it not quite so uncle nothing could be better but but what fred captain bradshaw asked well uncle i agree with you of course that nothing can be more base and heartless than frank's conduct but stillstill you see he has only just married i am not attempting much as i wish i could do so to urge any point in frank's favour at the same time uncle think of the misery of his wife if he gets that letter the first day he returns home and opens it before her he might for instance laughingly ask her to open his letters and tell him what they were about your letter especially knowing your handwriting he would suppose could contain nothing she might not read imagine the poor girl's feelings her happiness would be destroyed for life surely uncle frank's punishment would be too severe now if you were to write a letter using any language you like towards himabusing him as much as you please telling him he has forfeited all place in your esteem and is henceforth to be a strangersuch a letter would not have the same effect upon her no doubt he would be able to make some excuse which would satisfy her and at the same time his conscience would tell him the cause of your indignation and he would be able to write and make any excuses he could for his conduct if he did not write you would know it was because he had nothing whatever to urge in palliation very right and very kindly thought of my boy captain bradshaw said warmly god knows there has been mischief enough done already i do not wish to wreck another young creature's life yes i will write exactly as you advise as you say it will leave it open for him to make any plausible explanation he likes to her and his own conscience will tell him what it means as for his making any excuses to me i am afraid that is altogether out of his power and the old man sighed deeply it is indeed a most distressing affair uncle and i am indeed sorry for your sake and for that of alice also for i know she was very fond of frank does she know of the sad business yes fred i was obliged to tell her she must have been informed why all connection with frank is to cease she is terribly cut up but clings to the hope that frank may have some sort of apology or explanation to make i confess i don't see that it is possible we must hope that he will uncle it is a sad business and i am truly sorry for your sake good night now i shall be up again in a week or so and will then bring my wife to see you do fred do i shall be very glad to see my new niece fred bingham did not go straight to hans place but walked several times round lowndes square thinking deeply over this new and unexpected state of affairs there was no doubt he had a difficult and dangerous game to play he would not have willingly embarked upon it but it had been in a way forced upon him and he accepted the risks without flinching he had every confidence in himself and the excitement and intrigue exactly suited him the stakes were worth playing for and had a double value in his eyes in that they were to be won at the expense of frank at any rate he had the consolation that if he were beaten he would be no worse off than if he had thrown up the cards as hopeless at first his uncle would have cast him off at once and he could do no more if he ever found out the truth there could be no doubt then that he had chosen the only possible course to think that this affair which had seemed destruction to his hopes should now turn out to have established him as his uncle's sole heir whereas he was previously to have had only a third it seemed almost too good to be true how that blundering old idiot walker could have made such a mistake fred could not at first imagine but he came to the correct conclusion that he must have said nephew only without mentioning names and that captain bradshaw had jumped to the conclusion that the nephew was frank now as to the future there were two risksthe one from frank the other from stephen walker as to frank he had already achieved the great point of having the letter worded ambiguously and if frank wrote to demand an explanation he must somehow intercept the letter and prevent it reaching captain bradshaw then he must himself see frank and do what he could to keep them asunder then as to this madman walker he would not be likely to go again to captain bradshaw that was most unlikely nor would captain bradshaw be likely to go to him as to his threat to dog him and tell everyone about the affair that was unpleasantvery unpleasantand must if possible be put a stop to but at any rate it would not be likely to come to captain bradshaw's ears none of fred's friends were acquainted with his uncle and if walker were to see them all and tell his story his uncle would not come to hear of it from them what other danger was therealice yes alice was certainly a danger he did not exactly see how but she disliked him and was very fond of frank she was a thoughtful earnest girl and would be very likely to take some steps to inquire further it was even possible that she might go and see stephen walker himself yes he thought alice is quite capable of that and if she does so it is all up with me fred stopped in his walk at this new thought this was indeed a dangera danger against which he saw no prevention in vain did he think over every possible plan but nothing satisfactory could be imagined no he said at last as he walked on again if she does that i am lost my only hope is to get him out of the way and how that is to be done i don't see chapter xiv a shop to let one thing fred bingham quite settled in his mind as he walked slowly in the direction of hans place and that was that he would on no account tell his father of the mistake which had occurred mr bingham might be a sharp practitioner but fred felt that even to shield him it was possible that his father might refuse to have anything to do with this scheme of laying the blame upon frank maynard's shoulders even should he consent to conceal the truth the hold which the knowledge of such a secret as this would give him would be most unpleasant it was quite possible that he and his father might not always get on well together for the latter fred thought was hardly sharp enough for the times and might become a drag no certainly mr bingham must not be told well fred what news mr bingham asked as fred went into his study better than i could have expected fred said cheerfully the old gentleman of course did the savage but i was extremely penitent and made an impression on him of course he gave me a long lecture upon the heinousness of the offence but we parted pretty good friends and i fancy it will all come right in the long run perhaps he may seem friends fred but when he dies you may find he has left every penny to frank perhaps so fred said in a thoughtful voice i dare say he would if he were to die to morrow but now i have once made my footing good i think i shall be able to work myself into my old place in time from some hints he threw out too i believe he is not satisfied with frank he's angry i fancy because frank did not marry alice heathcote at any rate there's a coolness which makes him the less disposed to be severe with me no i think it will all come right in the end there was a silence for a minute or two mr bingham being greatly surprised at fred's easy escape for he remembered how vindictive and unforgiving captain bradshaw had been in his wife's case presently fred spoke again don't you think something could be done to stop that madman's mouth he has done mischief enough already but if he is to go about as he threatened telling this story to every one it will be a horrible nuisance mr bingham thought for a time and then shook his head he is very much in earnest fred he meant every word he said there is no offering him moneyit would make him worse fred thought for a time one could not begin by offering money still he's poor and money must be an object to him look here father you must see what you can do you go round to him in the morning and try and talk him over put to him the misery he has caused me in my own family you can pitch it in strong you know about the old lady point out that i am punished besides by losing any hope of my uncle's money then talk about my wife say she's very delicate and that if this comes to her ears the consequence will be most serious ask him if he wishes to destroy the happiness of an innocent creature beg him to be content with punishing me as he has already done then if he gives way at all offer him a thousand poundsi would willingly pay thatto leave at once and go right away and live quietly somewhere else where the business will not be known i am afraid fred it will be of no use he's been hit too hard oh nonsense father you can do it if you take it in hand pitch it in strong you know about my wife tell him that for him to destroy the happiness of an innocent woman would be as bad as what i have done say how devilishly sorry i am you know the line to take it's a very unpleasant business fred but if you think any good can come of it i will try thank you fred said and be sure to insist upon his leaving his place at once i don't want to have any risk of his meeting my uncle again and stirring him up afresh the next morning accordingly mr bingham started for new street upon arriving at the shop he was astonished at finding it closed and a bill upon the shutterthis house and shop to be let or sold enquire of mr thompson house agent brompton row in spite of this notice he rang at the bell there was no answer and a neighbour seeing mr bingham standing at the door came out and volunteered the information that stephen walker was gone he went off yesterday at twelve o'clock with his boxes in a cab am i likely to be able to find out where he has gone to mr bingham asked i owe him an account for newspapers i can't say sir if anyone knows it's mrs holl she's an old friend of his and has been doing for him lately she lives in moor street no mr bingham went off to moor street he knocked at the door mrs holl came to it on seeing a gentleman she curtseyed do you want me sir i can't ask you to walk in for i've a boy here down with fever thank you mr bingham said i called this morning to pay my newsagent mr walker a little account i owe him and i find his place shut up i was directed to you as the most likely person to tell me of his whereabouts i know no more sir than a new born child i only hope he hasn't done anything with his self i saw him the day afore yesterday when he came back after burying his daughter and when i went yesterday morning he was out when i went again in the afternoon i found the bill up and heard he had gone off with his things i went to the house people but they could tell me nothing about it they said that mr walker who they knew before from his having bought the house through them had come to them all of a sudden at nine o'clock he had told them to let the house at once or to sell it if they got an offer and pay the amount into a bank for him he seemed they said a good deal flurried and in a great hurry they are to send a cart to day for his furniture and are to send it to a sale room they are to give notice to his tenants in the upper part of the house to leave the news was all so sudden it has put me quite in a fluster like but i don't think he can be going to do any harm to himself else he wouldn't have taken his boxes do you think so sir no i should think not mrs holl he is probably leaving in this sudden and secret way because he does not like to say good bye to his friends and intends to go to some fresh place where no one will know him or this sad story i have heard of good morning i am much obliged to you for your information so saying mr bingham went back to his son expecting that the latter would consider this news to be bad for it was probable that stephen walker had left to carry out his plan of vengeance and was not improbably gone down to the neighbourhood of some of the works upon which they were engaged to mr bingham's surprise fred was excessively pleased so that he's gone i am contented down in the country i don't care a snap what people may say but as long as he stayed here there was always a chance of his meeting my uncle again or of my uncle going to see him you see father i was obliged to put things in the best light possible and i should not at all like to have walker referred to again ah i see fred i thought you must have made rather a strong case for yourself with the old man or he would never have come round so easily when you said you would give a thousand pounds to him to go away at once i had an idea you must be mightily afraid of his meeting captain bradshaw again well fred you have saved your thousand pounds but you'll hear more of him yet before he's done or i am mistaken it is a respite at any rate fred said if he comes and bothers me in the country i'll get him shut up as a lunatic it won't cost a thousand pounds to do that and he laughed unpleasantly i shall go back to cromer by the twelve o'clock train i shall be up in a week at the latest i suppose there is nothing particular you want to speak to me about before i go i have not above a quarter of an hour to spare the quarter of an hour was spent in conversation upon business matters and then fred bingham started again for cromer in very much higher spirits than he had felt on his journey up the day before fred bingham had not calculated erroneously when he considered alice heathcote to be his most dangerous enemy at first she had been completely stunned by the blow and upon leaving her uncle had gone up to her own room had thrown herself upon her bed too bewildered too stricken down even to cry and lay there quiet and white with her hand pressed to her forehead frank wicked frank a scoundrel it could not be it could not be and yet her uncle who knew far more of the world than she did and who had loved frank too seemed to have no doubt no question upon the subject nor as she thought it over and over did a single ray of hope present itself to her that she had loved in vain that he had married another had been hard to bear but that was as nothing to this to know that the man in whom she had put all her faith and trust and love was after all a bad base man was almost bewildering if he were false who could be true and yet although she in vain tried to find any solutionany escapefrom this dreadful accusation she did not really believe it her instinct seemed to tell her that frank could never have acted altogether in this way he might have been wicked and wrongshe feared there could be no doubt about thatbut he never could have been so deliberately base as they said yet there was but one explanation which could in any way lessen his offence an explanation which involved a grievous suspicion of another and that other now lying dead still alice did not know her and she believed even now that she knew something of frank and woman like was disposed to throw the blame anywhere so that the weight upon him might be lightened she repeated to herself woman's usual cry under the circumstances it must have been her fault frank may have been wrong and foolish and weak but he never never could be so deliberately wicked as they say he is poor thing alice thought it is very sad to think such a thing now she is dead but she must have been partly to blame and to shield herself she has invented this story of frank promising to marry her at his uncle's death this story alice elaborated gradually in the intervals of throbbing pain in her temples and having once elaborated clung to not as she told herself that it could make any difference to her he was married and she should never see him again for she was certain that her uncle would keep his word still now she might think of him sometimes with sorrow and regret and pain but without absolute horror her idol was terribly cracked and flawed indeed but it had not absolutely fallen to pieces and having at last persuaded herself that it must be so she fell asleep just as morning was breaking for the next three days alice kept her room completely prostrated with headache and feeling altogether unequal to going downstairs to talk upon different matters with her uncle still she clung to the belief that the version of the story she had imagined to herself would turn out to be correct and that frank could not have been to blame as her uncle believed the more she thought of his character ever since she had known him the more positive she felt of his at any rate comparative innocence oh if she could but find out the truth and to do this there was but one waynamely to see stephen walker himself she might then find out what foundation he had for his charges whether he had absolute proof that frank had promised to marry his daughter or whether it was merely the poor girl's own assertion it was a strange step perhaps for her to take but alice rather despised conventionalities and determined that she would not allow frank to rest under this dreadful accusation if she could clear it up besides it would be another fortnight before frank could arrive and have an opportunity of clearing himself and alice in her state of restless anxiety felt that she could not wait for another fortnight she resolved upon saying nothing to her uncle so after he had gone to his club she went up and put on her things and telling the footman to follow her started for new street greatly disappointed was she upon finding the shop shut up but being told that mrs holl of moor street was likely to know stephen walker's address she went there followed in some wonderment by her attendant mrs holl was as usual at home but was unable to give alice any intelligence as to stephen walker can i come in mrs holl i want very much to ask you a question or two yes ma'am and welcome but the place is all in a litter for it's my washing day and i've been thrown a little back for my eldest boy's had a sort of fever he's better to day though and the doctor says there's nothing fectious in it so saying mrs holl showed alice into the room which was filled with a warm soapy steam thank you i will not sit down alice said as mrs holl began to polish the seat of one of the chairs with her apron i have called to ask you about a very sad and distressing affair i mean about mr walker's daughter as you know him well of course you are aware of the circumstances yes poor young thing mrs holl said i know as much as anyone knows except her father leastways we know she's dead and buried mrs holl it is a terrible thing to say but a very great friend of minei may almost say a brotherhas been accused by mr walker of having been the cause of this i need not say how distressed we all are and how anxious to know something of this unfortunate girl he must be a very bad man ma'am saving your presence but i don't want to speak badly of anyone it's not my business and the almighty knows how to punish what i want to ask you mrs holland i am sure now you know how greatly i am interested in the matter you will frankly tell me the truthwas this unfortunate girl a good girl was she always looked upon before this as a good innocent girl because we have only heard of it from her father yes miss carry walker was one of the best of girls one of the kindest best hearted innocentest brightest girls you'd ever see every one spoke well of her she was one of the best of girls thank you mrs holl alice said sadly that is all i wanted to know good morning and alice with a very sad heart went back to lowndes square she had nothing to do now but to wait for frank's answer and she could derive even less hope than before from this chapter xv what can it mean it was evening when frank maynard arrived home from his honeymoon with his wife he had taken a house in the then new neighbourhood thurloe square brompton and katie despite the fatigue of the journey from paris insisted on immediately going over it all and in admiring all its arrangements very proud was the young husband of the trim little figure as it tripped through the rooms you are a dear dear thoughtful old boy she said when her survey completed she returned again to the dining room and took her seat in all the state and dignity of her young matronhood to make tea for the first time everything is very nice frank and my little special den is charming i will give you another kiss for it presently but there are too many rooms frank and i shall feel quite lost frank smiled and katie catching his look as she glanced up from her tea making changed the subject of the conversation hastily sure frank and what a pile of letters there are on the mantel don't read them all to night no katie i won't even look at one of them this first night at home i don't want to think of anyone or anything but you and my happiness and so it was not until the next morning after breakfast that frank set to to examine the pile of letters which had accumulated during his absence his wife sat down close to him and listened on amused while he read out an epitome of each communication those first opened could be classified under two heads letters of congratulation and cards from friends and the circulars of advertising tradesmen presently however he came upon a letter with a stiff precise handwriting and sealed with a coat of arms this is from my uncle bradshaw he said i wonder whether he is in town frank opened the letter and the careless expression of his face changed as he read the first line into intense astonishment which deepened into anger as he went on his wife who was watching him noticed the change in his face and when she saw he had read it through asked what is the matter frank wait dear frank said and again read the letter carefully through either he has gone mad or i am dreaming he said at last may i see frank katie said coming across and putting her hand upon his shoulder frank hesitated well katie perhaps better not it is some extraordinary mistake and would only worry you katie went back to her seat without a word here darling frank said after a moment's thought i wish to have no secrets from you i only hesitated because i did not wish to worry you come and sit down on my knee and read this katie sprang over gladly and took her seat frank gave her over the letter which she as he had done read carefully twice through before she spoke frank watched her face closely at first it expressed indignant anger only then the colour faded a little and a pained thoughtful look came into it the letter was as follows frank maynard i have loved you from a boy and would have wagered my life upon your honour i find that you are a dishonourable scoundrel you see i don't mince matters with you i don't give it mild names i leave the matter to your own conscience when you learn what has happened you will unless you are even more heartless than i even now take you to be bitterly regret your conduct palliation or excuse for you there is none you were warned but you shut your ears to the warning as for me i have done with you i never will see you again you have disappointed all my hopes you have turned out a heartless reprobate and i have done with you for ever your indignant uncle richard bradshaw frank spoke first it seems to me katie that the old gentleman has gone out of his mind what he means i have not the remotest idea i am awfully sorry katie for i like my uncle very much he has been the kindest friend to me as for his money i have enough for us dear and he may do what he likes with it but i am awfully sorry that he has gone out of his mind i can only suppose he has been thinking over that alice heathcote affair which i told you about katie till he has fairly gone cranky katie was silent still then she rose quietly from her husband's knee and looked him fully in the face with those clear honest eyes of hers frank dear you are my husband now and i know you love me very truly whatever you may once have done any other frank dear i am not a child i know mendo thingsbefore they are marriedyou know what i mean frank don't speak please or i can't go on now frank if you have done any wrong thingthere can be no mistake what your uncle meansif you have deceived it is no use mincing words frank some one who had loved and trusted you please tell me i shall be sorry frank very very sorry you will not be quite the same to me i cannot think of you as i have thought of you before but i can quite forgive you because i know you love me now but frank i must have it from your own lips i am your wife now frank and nothing you did before you married me can make me cease to love you if you only trust in me and tell me but if i have it from other lips frank if i find you deceive me i must go away frank even if it break my heart katie's voice trembled now and her eyes filled with tears frank had once or twice tried to interrupt her had tried to draw her towards him but there was a sad dignity about the little figure which checked him until she finished now frank tell me the truth you may trust me dear to hear it i am your wife my own darling katie frank said rising and standing before her my own loving little wife how dare you doubt your husband katie felt at once by the tone of his voice that her suspicions were groundless and stopped him by falling crying upon his neck oh forgive me frank forgive me for doubting you i was wicked and wrong frank oh my husband how could i doubt you don't say a word more frank please please don't i never should have dreamed it only i have heard that men look at these things in a different way to what we do say you are not angry frank say you quite forgive me for doubting you you silly little darling frank said putting her back on her old place upon his knee there is nothing to forgive it was natural enough for you to suppose that my crazy uncle must have had some reason for writing such an epistle as that but it is not so pet i give you my word and honour that i have got into no scrape whatever and that i have not the remotest conception in the world what he means or alludes to except that absurd alice heathcote business are you quite satisfied yes yes frank only i am so ashamed of myself for having doubted you katie required a good deal of petting before she could be reconciled to herself and it was some time before the conversation again came round to the subject of the letter it is really a very serious business katie i never built upon uncle bradshaw's money although if i had been asked i should certainly have answered that i expected him to leave me at any rate half well four or five thousand a year is no trifle katie we have enough to live upon darling but for the sake of our heirs we must regret it if you talk nonsense frank i shan't listen to you i did not know i was talking nonsense katie a man surely may talk of his heirs well then for their sake one naturally does not care suddenly to lose all chance of a fine fortune simply because one's uncle has gone out of his mind and you can't think frank that he has made a mistake about anything else i mean that it may be something else besides this miss heathcote whom i cannot but think you must have behaved shamefully to sir yes you may shake your head and say no indeed but i am sure you must have done no katie i cannot think of anything else and you need not be jealous of alice heathcote i never cared for her that is not to love her for a moment the whole thing was exactly as i told you a mere crotchet of captain bradshaw's well frank if he is not really out of his mind he must be a very wicked old man to write such a letter to you no katie he certainly is not a wicked old man at all he is a passionate old gentleman if you like but he is as good hearted a man as you will meet with in all the course of your life i tell you what katie this afternoon i will put on my hat and go down to my club i am sure to meet someone there who will tell me whether it is publicly known that the poor old man has gone out of his mind i can't go to his house to call after such a letter as that i should think not frank katie said indignantly frank went up to town in the afternoon and came back to dinner looking vexed and annoyed well frank what news i can't make head or tail of it katie captain bradshaw is as far as i can hear as sensible as either you or i several of the men i spoke to had met him within the last day or two and they said he seemed as usual except perhaps that he had not been very lively lately they were perfectly astounded when i asked whether anyone had noticed anything queer about him and evidently thought i must be mad myself to ask such a thing no he seems all right enough and that makes the whole affair more strange than ever what is to be done katie what do you advise i should say frank that you can do nothing if he is not mad how dare he write to you in that way it is infamous katie said very indignantly and i would not condescend to take any notice of it no katie i can't do that captain bradshaw has always been a very kind friend to me he is an old man dear and i can't put up with such an accusation and with the loss of his affection without making at least an effort to clear up the mystery i will write and say i have received his letter that i really cannot conceive what he means and that i must insist upon his explaining himself as i have a right at least to know what my accusation is now katie don't let us worry ourselves about it any more it is time to dress for dinner i will write the letter this evening and post it in the morning i have half a mind to go down and see him myself but he is so awfully passionate and my temper is not of the best that i believe if he went on again about that absurd alice business which i suppose is somehow at the bottom of it all i should say things which would make a quarrel we should never make up no i think writing will be the best katie don't you yes i think so frank besides you know much better what your uncle is like than i can i know i should not keep my temper with him i don't think you would katie frank laughed i always said you were a terrible little spitfire you know chapter xvi the intercepted letter the house in lowndes square was hardly a pleasant abode about this time captain bradshaw was irritable beyond measure the servants led a dreadful life with him and even alice heathcote had to take refuge in her own room for alice herself was scarcely able to withstand the excessive fractiousness and ill temper of her uncle she was looking very ill and was really unhappy alice had truly ceased to love frank maynard from the day when she had heard from his own lips that he did not love her she had striven hard against her own feelings but it was not until she knew that he was engaged to another that she was able to quite win a victory over herself she had been mercilessly severe with herself she had pictured frank as sharing his home and his love with another and had insisted upon rejoicing over his happiness she had herself frequently brought the subject round in her conversation with frank and so it was that by joining in her cousin's talk as to his future plans and by entering into his happy anticipations alice gradually conquered herself and came to feel that she could look upon frank quite as a brother and rejoice in seeing him happy with another as she thus gradually conquered her love she became more as she was before the first destruction of her hopes she grew calm and self possessed again her step regained its elasticity and her eye its steady light when frank had come to say good bye before going down to his wedding she almost regretted that she had refused his earnest request to be one of the bridesmaids for she felt that she could now have seen him married with hardly a pang but this new trial had once again broken her down she could not bear to think that frank who had been her idol whom she had looked up to as a model of all that was good and honest and honourable could have done this thing she did not think it she clung to the belief that he would clear it all up on his return at any rate only from frank's own lips or from frank's own handwriting would she believe it and she counted the days to his return when he would get her uncle's letter and would she was sure repel the accusation captain bradshaw too was longing for frank's return not that he doubted the facts these to his mind were clearly established but he hoped that frank might be able to offer some sort of palliation or excuse might somehow put his conduct in a more favourable light might plead guilty to imprudence but deny evil intention even when confessing the fault might in fact in some way or other enable him to forgive him and after a due amount of scolding and lecturing to restore him to at least a portion of his old share of his affection fred bingham too grew nervously anxious as the time for frank's return approached he came back to town a few days before frank was expected but he only called once upon his uncle he felt that it would look better if he were not to seem too anxious to step into the place of favourite and had been very careful during that one visit to say nothing against frank he knew that his cousin had not yet received captain bradshaw's letter for he had said on leaving that he should give no address upon the continent for that he did not know where he should go and did not mean to be bothered with letter writing while he was away there was therefore no danger until frank's return and then fred knew he would at once write to demand an explanation he felt sure that his uncle's letter contained no direct allusion to the circumstances of which frank was accused and that therefore he could produce no proofs of his innocence which indeed now that stephen walker had left new street was impossible the great step then was to prevent captain bradshaw from receiving frank's letter demanding an explanation that once done fred bingham felt certain of his ground he was playing a difficult game for high stakes but he felt pretty confident in his own skill his one fear was that frank in his indignation might rush down to lowndes square and personally demand an explanation from his uncle but the letter had been so extremely offensive that fred bingham hoped and believed that frank would write on the day upon which he knew frank was to return fred bingham called in lowndes square at a time when his uncle would be from home is miss heathcote in he asked yes sir she is up in her own room shall i tell her you are here no james it is hardly worth while i could only stay a few minutes by the way just step in here i want to speak to you he went into the dining room and the servant followed and closed the door you must have had rather a hard time with your master lately james awful sir i can't stand it much longer flesh and blood can't put up beyond a certain point you know sir do what i will nothing pleases him he does swear sometimes really awful to hear but there sir i need not tell you you know what master is well james he has been a good deal put out lately there is a man who fancies he has some claim upon my uncle and he writes to him and threatens to make public some old story which your master does not want talked about now i am on this man's track and i fancy i shall be able to find him in a day or two and put an end to all this i expect he will be writing to day or to morrow to my uncle again and i know it will make him so furious that he will be doing something rash now i wish to prevent that letter reaching him until i have seen this man who is annoying him i want you therefore to show me all the letters that come for the next day or two i will come over twice a day so you will only have to keep them back one post i only want to save him annoyance and i can see he is quite wearing miss heathcote out i will give you a five pound note if you will manage this and you will be doing your master a real service i know i can rely upon your holding your tongue what do you say james lor' yes sir i would do anything to save master from annoyance he is a real good master on the whole though he is awful sir i can assure you he is downright awful when he is put out i am sure he must be very difficult to manage james the best way to arrange this will be for me to call each day at nine o'clock in the morning and at three in the afternoon he never comes down to breakfast until ten and miss heathcote does not come down till half past nine so there is no chance of his knowing that i have come you can be looking out of the hall window and can open the door when you see me i will call again at three after he has gone out and i will get you to put on your hat and run round to hans place of an evening with any letter which may come by a late post you understand james oh yes mr bingham i will see to it it is only for two or three days you say the next day there was no letter from frank maynard nor was there on the following morning but when fred bingham called at three o'clock there was a letter the handwriting of which he at once recognised ah this is the letter james i am very glad i have stopped it especially as i expect to see the man this evening and to put a stop to his annoying my uncle here is what i promised you james i need not tell you to say nothing about it for my uncle would not be pleased if he knew i was interfering in his affairs even for his own good you may be sure i won't say a word sir i do think master has been expecting the letter for he has been very anxious about letters the last day or two and savage sir that savage that one daren't as much as look at him if he goes on like this i must make a change sir i can't stand it much longer i dare say he will be better james when this annoyance is removed i will go into the dining room for a few minutes i have a letter to write which i forgot before i started once in the dining room fred bingham took the inkstand and writing materials from the side table and then produced from a large pocket book an envelope upon which he had written frank maynard's name and address in a very accurate imitation of the peculiar hand of captain bradshaw in this he enclosed frank's letter and lighting the taper sealed it with a small seal which was in the drawer of the inkstand and which bore the three fingered hand the crest of the bradshaws there he said with his unpleasant smile if that won't keep you apart master frank i am mistaken you are a very fine fellow no doubt and alice heathcote liked you better than she did me but i don't think you will have much reason to boast in the end now if the old man does but go away for the winter as he talks about there is no fear of their coming together again and he is too proud and too passionate and frank is too hot headed and mighty ever to condescend to make the first advances i don't think the old boy can live long so putting on his hat he went out down into knightsbridge and up the hill dropping the letter into the post office at the corner of wilton place then he sauntered on smiling pleasantly as he went and meditating not unflattering thoughts of himself yes fred bingham he concluded deuced few fellows would have got as you have out of about as nasty a scrape as a man could want to get into made it turn out all to my advantage why i might have tried and schemed and flattered the old man and listened to his endless stories about india and at most i should only have shared with frank now i am as good as certain of it all i am a lucky fellowand here he gave a penny to a beggar woman who looked after him and blessed him for a pleasant looking young gentlemanvery lucky to think of old walker never mentioning my name that was a fluke indeed savage old brute who would have thought it of him poor carry and here the smile passed away from his face and he went on angrily a little idiot i would have made her comfortable and settled her in some snug little place and she upsets the whole thing she must have known i never meant to marry her and why the deuce she could not have done as other girls do and made the best of it i can't make out instead of that she nearly ruins me bah what fools women are and he gave a savage cut with his cane at a dog who was asleep by the railings by the side of the footway the dog leapt up with a sharp yell and fred bingham went on relieved and rather liking than otherwise the curses and threats which the dog's master a little boy with matches shouted after him the letter was delivered to frank as he was sitting with his wife after dinner here is the answer katie sealed with the family crest in due form and he tore the paper so as not to destroy the seal with the intention of showing the crest to her by jove he exclaimed angrily this is too bad katie he has sent back my letter unopened without a word katie's face flushed up and she was about to burst out indignantly but seeing by her husband's face that he was grieved as well as angry she only said never mind frank it is no use our worrying ourselves about it you can do nothing more after this refusal to hear you we have a good conscience dear and can afford to wait as you said at first frank there can be no doubt that your uncle has worried himself so much about the upset of his plans for you to marry that miss heathcote that he has really gone a little out of his mind about it perhaps it is a pity you did not do as he wanted you to and she looked up maliciously at frank the attack had the effect she desired and in administering what he called punishment frank soon forgot the annoyance of the letter it was not indeed until they rose to go upstairs to tea that the subject was renewed then frank put the letter into its envelope opened his desk and threw it in there he said we won't talk about it any more katie it is a great annoyance but it can't be helped it is no use crying over spilt milk the next day katie sat up in state and many of frank's acquaintances or friends called and also friends of the drakes frank of course stayed at home to help his wife through the ordeal among the callers was fred bingham after the first introduction and greetings were over frank said to him aside look here fred i want to have a talk with you about a most unpleasant business which i can't for the life of me understand i can't talk now before all these people come like a good fellow to dinner this evening we shall be alone and then i can tell you all about it very well frank i will come fred then turned to katie and was very chatty and amusing as he could be when he chose he stayed some little time and helped frank much in smoothing away the stiffness and in filling up the occasional pauses which are incidental to ceremonies of this kind he came again to dinner and was still in high spirits paying katie many hyperbolical compliments which she laughed at telling him that he was not an irishman and that no one but irishmen had a right to talk outrageous nonsense soon after the dessert was placed upon the table frank said to his wife there katie i want to talk to fred so go upstairs like a good girl and make tea for us then when he was with his cousin he went on now fred i want to talk to you i have had a most extraordinary letter from my uncle accusing me of unheard of wickedness and breaking off all acquaintance and connection with me there it is read it through and tell me what it means fred bingham read captain bradshaw's letter through extraordinary he said but i am really hardly surprised he has spoken to me in a rambling excited way about you and i really am afraid that he is going a little out of his mind frank looked at the table gloomily i have written to him to demand an explanation and he has returned the letter unopened his cousin looked grieved rather than surprised it is abominable frank went on warmly the only possible reason i can see is that i refused to marry alice heathcote when he had set his mind upon it fred bingham had long suspected that such had been captain bradshaw's wish and he now took advantage of the knowledge yes he said absurd as it is frank from a few words he let drop when he was in one of his passions the other day i supposed it was that he said something about all his plans thwartedinfamous scoundrelbreak alice's hearthave nothing to do with him yes frank said i can quite fancy him but he must be mad fred it was all his own hatching up alice and i never cared a scrap for each other sisterly and so on but nothing else fred bingham was silent don't you believe me fred frank asked warmly well frank i don't question what you say about your own feelings and i am sure that you are the last fellow to intend to trifle with any girl's affections but if you frankly wish my opinion i tell you honestly i have no question that alice heathcote did love you nonsense man frank said very angrily alice never cared a scrap for me she told me so herself did you ask her then frank fred said pointedly no i did not frank said still more indignant have i not told you i never thought of such a thing uncle and i were having a row he was insisting on my marrying her i was saying i would not because i did not love herwell she was in the next room and heard it all and came in and told her uncle that it was out of the question for that i did not love her and she did not love me fred looked up almost contemptuously how stupid this big strong man was to be sure and what do you suppose she could have said frank she had just heard you say you did not love her and would not marry her and do you think that a girl like alice heathcote could have done anything else under the circumstances do you think she could have burst out crying and told you she loved you and prayed you to marry her frank sat down in his chair in sheer dismay how long was this ago frank six months frank nodded just as i thoughtjust the time alice got ill and low spirited i saw it all along i was certain that she loved you and i thought you loved her i always looked upon it as a settled thing and indeed it is hardly likely your uncle would have gone so far as he did if he had not been sure alice's happiness was concerned frank sat petrified at last he said and upon your soul and honour fred do you believe she loved me upon my soul and honour i do frank and for once fred bingham spoke the truth frank absolutely groaned poor alice poor alice and i never dreamt of it never once this is worse than the other to think of my having made her unhappy no wonder my uncle is so angry and that it has worked on his brain what is to be done i can't write to her and explain matters i should think not fred bingham said dryly in the first place your letter would be returned for i know that uncle has made her promise not to communicate with you in any way and not even to speak if she meets you accidentally and in the next place alice heathcote is hardly the sort of girl to accept condolences from a man who has slighted her affection frank looked furiously at the speaker but he felt that the remark was true well he said at last this is a nice thing to meet a man on his return from his honeymoonthe girl he cared for most in the world next to his wife made unhappymy uncle altogether estranged and in fact carrying the matter to a point of lunacy and nothing possible to be done i dare say matters will right themselves in time frank our uncle talks about travelling and the change will no doubt do him good and set alice up and seeing that he will get over his great hallucination and if he does not frank said rather bitterly i suppose i may wish you joy of being sole inheritor of wyvern park frank that is not like you fred said reproachfully i should have thought you would have known me better than to suppose me capable of taking advantage of it even if captain bradshaw did in his present state pass you over in his will no frank i beg your pardon fred frank broke in upon my word i beg your pardon i did not mean what i said for a moment i know you are the best hearted fellow in the world and have always said so no no old man i have no jealousy of you i give you my word and he shook fred bingham's hand warmly and now fred i won't ask you to go upstairs to night i am really upset and i must tell katie about this miserable business and i suppose she can hardly be expected to see it quite in the right light good night old fellow come again soon chapter xvii waiting for the answer has he gone frank katie asked as her husband entered the drawing room alone yes pet i wanted to have you all to myself katie was standing with her elbow on the mantel her smooth forehead was knitted up into a frown and she looked a very thoughtful little personage indeed so that is the fred bingham i have often heard you speak of frank frank nodded and you really like him frank really think him honest and true i don't like him so very much katie but i think he is a thoroughly good hearted fellow frank i would not trust him as far as i could see him no katie frank said half amused half vexed at finding his wife thus early set against the friend for whom he had already fought so many hard battles don't you like him then he is amusing katie said indifferently but oh frank he is so false my flesh crept all over when he shook hands with me this morning now that's not like you katie i am sure he made himself very agreeable i don't like you to take prejudices against men i have so long known i am sorry frank she said simply but i can't help myself a man i don't like at first sight i never like a man i do like i like very much and i always find i am right it is an instinct or a prejudice if you like frank but in some things instinct is stronger than reason frank was vexed but he only said well katie one can't argue against a prejudice only remember i like fred bingham and have always found him a very good fellow and i have known him for many years besides katie you know your prejudices are sometimes erroneous his wife made a gesture of dissent come katie you know you almost hated me at first and yet i think you like me a little now katie coloured you silly boy you know that was a different thing you know why i hated you no really katie why but this was a secret katie could only tell when she had nestled close up to her husband and his arm was round her waist then she looked up in his face and said i hated you frank because you were making me love you before i thought you loved me and now katie frank said presently i must tell you what i have learned from fred bingham and it has affected me very much dear katie was all attention now and took her stand by her husband's chair so that she could pet him if such a step were necessary it is rather a difficult thing for a man to say katie and it is only because i was really ignorant and wholly innocent in the affair that i can tell you at all i am very much afraid that without the slightest intention on my part i have made a very dear good girl unhappy katie drew a little farther off now alice heathcote yes dear alice heathcote fred says and he was certainly quite in earnest about it that my uncle's anger is caused by his disappointment at my not marrying alice he says my uncle has harped upon the subject until he thinks with me that his brain has gone a little wrong but the worst of it is he is convinced that alicewell it seems absurd katiedid love me and that my uncle's indignation and anger are upon her account you are sure quite sure frank that you never made love to her quite sure you jealous little thing i always liked her kate just as i might like a sister i never had the slightest idea of making love to her i would tell you if i had dear for i do not want to have any secrets from you she no doubt misinterpreted my manner and her uncle having made up his mind i was to marry her led her into the mistake she has been poorly for some time katie and i am really afraid it is from that it is very absurd of course i am really very sorry frank katie said feeling that frank was speaking the whole truth and that she could afford to be magnanimous but what is to be done i am afraid it is too late for me to give you up now you are a goose katie but be serious and give me your opinion what is to be done the only thing which i can suggest frank is for me to go to her and say that i am sorry the mistake has occurred and that i will go back to staffordshire again and let you do as you like katie had never seen miss heathcote nevertheless from what frank had told her of their early life together she had somehow intuitively felt her to be a rival and now like a true woman could not help a little enjoyment of her triumph very well katie if that is the way you look upon it we will not discuss the matter any farther frank was really hurt and he spoke coldly as he had never spoken to his wife before no no frank she said throwing her arm round his neck as he was rising from his chair i am wrong dear i am very wrong but you know i am a wild little thing don't be angry with me darling it was natural you know that i should be a little jealous of other people loving my frank as i love him but i quite believe what you say and am really very sorry for miss heathcote i can fancy how unhappy she must be she is very nice isn't she she is very nice katie and most men would have loved her very much she is not my style you know i like something i can pet and love she was too tall and stately not a bit like you katie as nice in her way as you are in yours but then her way was not my way and i suppose yours is katie was quite mollified now poor alice she said i wish i had known her i can't quite make it all out frank said thoughtfully alice certainly was quiet and looked ill for some time after that row i had with captain bradshaw but she was looking better and brighter again lately and since i have been engaged to you she has been more natural and affectionate again with me whatever she may have felt i am certain that she will be as sorry for this insane conduct of my uncle's as i am i wish i could see her and have a chat with her but fred tells me that my uncle has made her give him a solemn promise not to meet me or even to speak to me if she accidentally comes across me so you see katie there is nothing to be done but to take matters quietly and to trust in their coming right in the end his wife was silent for some time presently she said you won't be vexed at my asking you a question frank no katie you promise frank nodded you and mr bingham are the two nearest relations to captain bradshaw are you not yes dear then in the event of your uncle permanently quarrelling with you i suppose fred bingham will be his heir most likely katie now frank don't be vexed but i won't talk of it again i own i do not see how he could have done you any harm in this matter but i feel sure he would if he could please please frank don't trust him he is not good i am sure of it there katie i won't be vexed because i promised but you are wrong dear however right or wrong fred can do me no harm if my uncle comes to his senses again i am sure he will be heartily sorry for what he has done and i know alice will bring things round if she can at the same time i do not deceive myself harry bradshaw is not a man very easily to get an idea out of his head he is a most kind hearted man but as obstinate as a mule he has never spoken to his sister since she married mr bingham did i ever tell you about his only daughter katie no frank i did not even know he had any children hereupon frank told what he knew about captain bradshaw's daughter having made some low marriage of his having sent her off and of her having as frank had heard from his parents died somewhere in great poverty and katie after hearing it made up her own mind that captain bradshaw must be a very cruel man and that except as to the money the loss of his acquaintance was no great matter as for alice heathcote of course she was very sorry for her but perhaps on the whole it was just as wellof course for her sakethat she and frank were not to meet again these opinions however katie wisely kept to herself these three days had passed very slowly to the inhabitants of lowndes square the first day captain bradshaw had sworn more violently than ever the second day he was more quiet and the third day he was very sad alice too had suffered terribly her eyes were swollen with crying and the colour faded altogether out from her cheeks on that day after dinner he said suddenly after a long silence it is no use waiting any longer alice let us go away for a bit alice's eyes filled with tears neither she nor her guardian had ever spoken of frank's fault since that first day but each perfectly understood the other's thoughts both knew how they had longed for frank's return and how they had hoped that he would offer some protest against his sentence would urge some point in mitigation of his offence that at least he would have cried i have sinned and i am deeply punished have pity upon me alice then knew what her uncle meant it was no use waiting any more frank had nothing to say nothing to urge he would not even write to express sorrow he was separated from her for ever more than time or place more even than death could have divided them her tears fell fast but she tried to speak steadily yes uncle please let us go abroad yes alice and his voice too shook as he spoke suppose we go to rome for the winter i have often thought of taking you and then next spring you know we can go to jerusalem and the nile and all sorts of places we can be away as long as we like my dear no one will miss us here alice was kneeling by his side now crying unrestrainedly poor child he said stroking her hair i have been a downright brute lately but i could not help it we shall get on better again after a while to think how all my plans and schemes have gone wrong how i loved that boy and trusted him and believed in him how i have gladdened my heart to think that after i was gone you would be standing together in the old hall of wyvern and how he has turned out no no uncle alice burst out don't say anything against himi can't bear it i can't bear it i know it is so but even now though i know it though he says not a word i don't believe it in my heart the frank i lovedfor i did love him unclecould not have done it i know he could not you tell me he has he does not answer he tells me so himself still i say he could not please don't speak against him uncleplease never mention him again let us think he is dead we can forgive the dead you know let us think he died a month ago when he said good bye ah that mistake of mine the old man began when alice interrupted him no uncle you must not think thatthat pain is over long ago i did love him once dearly and i suffered yes i own i suffered when i found out i had deceived myself but i had got over that he could never be anything to me and i had taught myself to look upon him as a dear friend a brother no uncle it is not the man i had loved but the brother i esteemed and trusted and believed in whom i am grieving for now it shall be as you like dear her uncle said kissing her and now when will you be ready to start the sooner the better uncle i have nothing to do but to pack up by the day after to morrow i shall be quite ready and so in two more days the house at lowndes square was shut up and the old captain was missed from his well known seat at his club chapter xviii a cut direct it is now eighteen months since frank maynard's marriage and has been a very quiet happy time to him not many incidents have occurred the most important by far having been the birth of a son about a month back katie is of course very proud of it and is a little disappointed that her husband does not consider it the finest boy in the world frank however pleads that he has no doubt that if she says so she is correct but that for his part he can really see no difference between one baby and anotherthey are all queer little animals till they begin to look about and know people frank has entered at the bar and is reading to a greater extent than either he or prescott who had advised the step had expected but indeed frank had found that he was only in katie's way staying at home all day and that the long days with nothing to do really hung heavy upon his hands complaining of this to prescott the latter had renewed his former suggestion that his friend should enter at the bar and frank had willingly accepted the idea and had established himself in a room adjoining his friend's unfortunately it had happened that prescott had been away on circuit at the time of the maynards' return from their wedding tour and frank had not therefore had the benefit of his advice as to the best course of action to be pursued in reference to captain bradshaw's extraordinary conduct upon prescott's hearing of this he had been as much puzzled as frank himself he like katie had at first suspected that fred bingham must have had some hand in it but frank pointed out that he had seen his uncle only the day before he had gone down into staffordshire to be married and that he was then friendly enough fred bingham was then out of town and had not returned from his wedding tour until after captain bradshaw's letter would have been written he could therefore in no way have influenced his uncle's proceedings this was so evident that prescott had abandoned his idea and had been obliged to fall back upon frank's notion that the old man's head must have turned a little at the failure of his favourite plan he said that had he been in town he should have advised frank upon the receipt of his uncle's unaccountable letter to have called upon him in person he could not however but acknowledge that the fact of captain bradshaw's returning the letter unopened was evident proof that he would not have seen his nephew and that even had he done so a quarrel might have taken place which would have rendered any future reconciliation impossible to prescott as well as to frank this breach in the friendly relations was a trial prescott had never even hoped to win alice heathcote as long as frank had remained unmarried but he had a faint hope that after frank's marriage he might some day succeed in gaining her love now this hope was lost for unless this inexplicable quarrel was made up prescott felt that he as frank's friend could no longer visit at lowndes square both had hoped that captain bradshaw would return in an altered state of mind from his long tour he had now however been back in england nearly a month and frank had received no communication from him this hope then was lost for it was evident that the old man was as determined as ever that the estrangement should be final during these eighteen months the cousins had seen but little of each other their respective wives had called upon each other and each had dined at the other's home but fred was a good deal away from town and mrs frank having in no way altered her first conceived opinion of him the intercourse between thurloe square and harley street was not of a very cordial nature captain bradshaw had returned very little altered by his long ramble abroad he was as hearty and as cheery as of old before his dearest wishes about his ward's marriage had been thwarted his journey had altogether done him good it had been a complete change of life to him and he had greatly enjoyed it of course he had grumbled and had sworn terribly at italians egyptians arabs and many other people but he had enjoyed it and had confessed as much to alice at the same time he was very glad to be back again in lowndes square and to go off as of old to his club for alice's sake too he had determined to go out more into society they had made a great many friends and acquaintances abroad and the captain inaugurated his return by a series of dinner parties alice too had benefited greatly by the change of scene she was essentially a girl of a healthy organization and had resolutely exerted herself to shake off the depression which had weighed upon her when she started the constant change of scene and the desire to amuse her uncle had aided her efforts and in a few months from the time of her leaving england the tone of her mind was completely restored very much was alice heathcote admired in the english circle at rome she was very quiet very unaffected and somewhat stately several of her countrymen had tried their best to win the prize of the season but alice gave no encouragement to any of them and went away quite heartwhole in the spring with her uncle another year's wandering had quite completed her cure and she could now think sadly but without deep pain of the forfeiture by frank maynard of her esteem as well as of her love for now that she could think calmly over it she could not but allow that there was no doubt of his unworthiness once only in the month which had passed since their return to london had she seen him for frank had from the first gradually dropped the acquaintance of those few friends at whose houses he would be likely to meet his uncle on his return alice was walking down knightsbridge with her uncle when they came upon a tall gentleman with a lady on his arm alice and her uncle recognised them at the same moment and each could feel the other start slightly alice grew very pale but looked straight forward as did her uncle frank coloured with indignation but he too gave no sign of recognition katie felt her husband draw himself up stiffly and looked up in his face then she glanced at the passers their faces as well as her husband's told her who they were is that your uncle frank yes katie frank said those are my uncle and alice heathcote is it not too bad katie he must be as much out of his mind as ever and i suppose alice dared not notice me i don't quite think that she wished to speak any more than he did frank she looked very cold and proud never mind dear we can do very well without them very well katie i don't absolutely care a bit only the utter injustice and absurdity of the thing make me angry no dear i am perfectly happy as i am katie was rather pleased too and comparing the stately miss heathcote to herself she said after all i do think i can make frank happier than she would ever have done a thought when they were alone she confided to her husband who said he had never doubted the fact for a moment chapter xix a change of plan john holl's habitation had not changed very greatly since the night that frank maynard had gone there with his friend prescott to help bessy holl in her time of trouble bessy had long since started to join her husbandsooner indeed than she had ever hoped to dofor eight months after he had sailed a letter arrived from him with good news for his anxious wife he told her that at first his life on board ship had been very miserable his companions were principally ruffians of the lowest class but it happened that the officer in command wanted a clerk and had employed him for some hours each day in writing this officer had taken a liking to him and had granted him the great indulgence of sleeping apart from the general herd of convicts who had before made his life miserable by their perpetual blasphemies and disputes when the voyage was half over they had attempted a rising with the object of murdering the warders and seizing the ship in the short fray which followed he had been able to be of some assistance and had received a severe blow intended for the commanding officer from a belaying pin which had laid him up for some time upon landing the officer had reported so strongly in favour of his conduct that the governor of the establishment had written to the home authorities in mitigation of his sentence and had promised him a ticket of leave at the end of six months employing him in the meantime in the office he therefore told bessy she could at once sail for adelaide he would be able to join her upon her arrival frank had been down staying at the drakes' with his wife and therefore did not see the grateful woman before she started with this exception things went on as before the only change was in the cripple he had altered greatly he still worked at his wax flower making and studied at his books but it was no longer with the keen interest with which he had formerly worked he was no longer cheerful and even gay but would sit at his work for hours without speaking he was much thinner than he had been and his face had the expression of great suffering which is often to be seen in deformed people he could no longer swing himself upstairs to his bedroom but slept in the little room on the ground floor which john holl and his wife had resigned to him sarah holl grieved sadly over the change she loved the lad more than her own children for had she not done more for him palpably james was fading he was not dying of a broken heart but he was giving up life because he no longer cared about living he had loved carry as an ordinary man could not have loved her other men would have their pursuits and their pleasures and their duties he had only her he knew that she was not for him he never dreamt of her in that way it was a devotion such as a parsee might pay to his great god of heat and light she was as far out of his reach and yet she lighted and gladdened his life with her loss all its light had gone out it never entered his thought to blame her the fire worshipper would as soon blame the sun god when a cloud has passed between him and the earth he cursed her destroyer cursed him with all the intense bitterness of impotence for none knew who was this man who had brought ruin to the quiet home in new street and so all his life changed to bitterness why was he ever born he asked himself over and over again why was he sent into the earth to be a mere weight upon other people oh that he was strong if only for a little time if only for long enough to find out and to kill this man who had murdered carry he could die then die quietly and happily ay even upon a gallows with the world jeering at him and cursing him but he was a cripple and helpless he had nothing to do but to die after that it might be different he would not be a cripple then all his trouble would be over yes the sooner he died the better with this feeling in his heart it is little wonder that the cripple faded fast and that the medicine which sarah holl insisted upon his taking had no salutary effect with his adopted parents he was always gentle and affectionate he was as ready to help the children as formerly as thoughtful and as unselfish but the bright smile was gone and sarah holl as she looked up from her washing tub at the quiet figure with his work before himbut with his nimble fingers sometimes pausing awhile while his thoughts were far awaywould stop to wipe her eyes furtively with her checked apron with a woman's discernment she had felt the reason of the change the short cry the ghastly pallor with which he had received the first news of carry's flight the wild outburst of passion the subsequent quiet sadness were enough for her she knew then how he had worshipped carry she had communicated her thoughts to john and had ordered the children never to allude to the subject of carry's absence under pain of the severest punishment and so the girl's name was never mentioned in the little house which her presence had so often brightened one thing only of notability had occurred and this had been of so extraordinary a kind that it had upset all mrs holl's calculation of time mr barton had made his usual call and had evidently been struck with the great change which had taken place in james's appearance he had not however spoken upon the subject but had come again after only a month's interval and had been palpably moved and excited at the sight of james's increasing weakness he had even when the others were talking entered into a little private conversation with mrs holl and had inquired of her what was the cause of the illness of the cripple mrs holl had honestly told him that she did not know and that the doctor who had made two visits to the lad had been unable to say what his ailment was poor boy she added i fear he will not be with us long mr barton had been palpably affected and had promised to call again soon to see how his young friend was getting on what was really passing in his mind was evident from his conversation with his wife upon his return home after two or three subsequent visits to the holls you have got away sooner than usual barton that lady said when he entered yes he said no use stopping is the boy worse she asked anxiously he is rachel he is dying there is no doubt about that he may live a year or two it all depends but he is breaking up of course the great question with us is will he hold on till he is one and twenty he wants nearly two years of it yet one and twenty won't do barton his wife said decidedly what is the use of getting a bond for ten thousand pounds from a boy who is going to die before he comes into his property who is going to pay it after what has happened it is not likely his grandfather would pay a penny the bond would not be worth the paper it's written on no if the boy is really dying the whole game is up yes her husband said stroking his chin but i don't quite despair of making a good thing out of it yet you see the old man has two nephews who of course if the boy is not heard of are his natural heirs one of these nephews he has i find quarrelled with but what about i cannot discover and i have tried every way i know however it is a regular split and he is altogether out of it so the other expects to step into the old man's shoes now for the last three months seeing that the boy is dying i have had benjamin at work finding out about this other one he is a hard fisted sharp young fellow and he is said to be a 'cute hand at a bargain and about as hard a chap to get over as you could want a regular grinder he has got some big works on down in the country and his men hate him like poison benjamin says he don't know that he ever knew a young one so hated now i should think i might work him a bit just tell him the heir is alive and that i can produce him i don't know after all that it would not be as good as the old thing and no fear of a blow up what do you think rachel well it might do his wife answered don't you let him find out where the boy is barton or he would wait till he died and then snap his fingers at you thank you rachel i am not quite a fool her husband said grimly in a matter like this which i have waited and planned for for twenty years i am not likely to make a mistake and you have quite made up your mind barton that it will be better to try with the next heir quite rachel i have thought it over in every light and i don't see that there is any chance now of getting anything out of this boy after all these years of watching end of vol ii bradbury evans and co printers whitefriars
