the guardian of a sprite that lives to tease thee loving in earnest chiding but in play the merry mocking bruno who that sees thee can fail to love thee darling even as i my sweetest sylvie we must say good bye preface i must begin with the same announcement as in the previous volume which i shall henceforward refer to as vol i calling the present volume vol ii viz that the locket at p was drawn by miss alice havers and my reason for not stating this on the title pagethat it seems only due to the artist of these wonderful pictures that his name should stand there alonehas i think even greater weight in vol ii than it had in vol i let me call especial attention to the three little birds borders at pp the way in which he has managed to introduce the most minute details of the stanzas to be illustrated seems to me a triumph of artistic ingenuity let me here express my sincere gratitude to the many reviewers who have noticed whether favorably or unfavorably the previous volume their unfavorable remarks were most probably well deserved the favorable ones less probably so both kinds have no doubt served to make the book known and have helped the reading public to form their opinions of it let me also here assure them that it is not from any want of respect for their criticisms that i have carefully forborne from reading any of them i am strongly of opinion that an author had far better not read any reviews of his books the unfavorable ones are almost certain to make him cross and the favorable ones conceited and neither of these results is desirable criticisms have however reached me from private sources to some of which i propose to offer a reply one such critic complains that arthurs strictures on sermons and on choristers are too severe let me say in reply that i do not hold myself responsible for any of the opinions expressed by the characters in my book they are simply opinions which it seemed to me might probably be held by the persons into whose mouths i put them and which were worth consideration other critics have objected to certain innovations in spelling such as cant wont traveler in reply i can only plead my firm conviction that the popular usage is wrong as to cant it will not be disputed that in all other words ending in nt these letters are an abbreviation of not and it is surely absurd to suppose that in this solitary instance not is represented by t in fact cant is the proper abbreviation for can it just as ist is for is it again in wont the first apostrophe is needed because the word would is here abridged into wo but i hold it proper to spell dont with only one apostrophe because the word do is here complete as to such words as traveler i hold the correct principle to be to double the consonant when the accent falls on that syllable otherwise to leave it single this rule is observed in most cases eg we double the r in preferred but leave it single in offered so that i am only extending to other cases an existing rule i admit however that i do not spell parallel as the rule would have it but here we are constrained by the etymology to insert the double l in the preface to vol i were two puzzles on which my readers might exercise their ingenuity one was to detect the lines of padding which i had found it necessary to supply in the passage extending from the top of p to the middle of p they are the th th and th lines of p the other puzzle was to determine which if any of the stanzas of the gardeners song see pp were adapted to the context and which if any had the context adapted to them the last of them is the only one that was adapted to the context the garden door that opened with a key having been substituted for some creature a cormorant i think that nestled in a tree at pp and the context was adapted to the stanza at p neither stanza nor context was altered the connection between them was simply a piece of good luck in the preface to vol i at pp ix x i gave an account of the making up of the story of sylvie and bruno a few more details may perhaps be acceptable to my readers it was in as i now believe that the idea first occurred to me that a little fairy tale written in for aunt judys magazine under the title brunos revenge might serve as the nucleus of a longer story this i surmise from having found the original draft of the last paragraph of vol ii dated so that this paragraph has been waiting years for its chance of emerging into printmore than twice the period so cautiously recommended by horace for repressing ones literary efforts it was in february that i entered into negotiations with mr harry furniss for illustrating the book most of the substance of both volumes was then in existence in manuscript and my original intention was to publish the whole story at once in september i received from mr furniss the first set of drawingsthe four which illustrate peter and paul see i pp in november i received the second setthe three which illustrate the professors song about the little man who had a little gun vol ii pp and in january i received the third setthe four which illustrate the pig tale so we went on illustrating first one bit of the story and then another without any idea of sequence and it was not till march that having calculated the number of pages the story would occupy i decided on dividing it into two portions and publishing it half at a time this necessitated the writing of a sort of conclusion for the first volume and most of my readers i fancy regarded this as the actual conclusion when that volume appeared in december at any rate among all the letters i received about it there was only one which expressed any suspicion that it was not a final conclusion this letter was from a child she wrote we were so glad when we came to the end of the book to find that there was no ending up for that shows us that you are going to write a sequel it may interest some of my readers to know the theory on which this story is constructed it is an attempt to show what might possibly happen supposing that fairies really existed and that they were sometimes visible to us and we to them and that they were sometimes able to assume human form and supposing also that human beings might sometimes become conscious of what goes on in the fairy worldby actual transference of their immaterial essence such as we meet with in esoteric buddhism i have supposed a human being to be capable of various psychical states with varying degrees of consciousness as follows a the ordinary state with no consciousness of the presence of fairies b the eerie state in which while conscious of actual surroundings he is also conscious of the presence of fairies c a form of trance in which while unconscious of actual surroundings and apparently asleep he ie his immaterial essence migrates to other scenes in the actual world or in fairyland and is conscious of the presence of fairies i have also supposed a fairy to be capable of migrating from fairyland into the actual world and of assuming at pleasure a human form and also to be capable of various psychical states viz a the ordinary state with no consciousness of the presence of human beings b a sort of eerie state in which he is conscious if in the actual world of the presence of actual human beings if in fairyland of the presence of the immaterial essences of human beings i will here tabulate the passages in both volumes where abnormal states occur historians locality and state other characters vol i pp in train c chancellor b p do c do c at lodgings c on

of the ideas embodied in the book a few more such details may perhaps interest my readers i p the very peculiar use here made of a dead mouse comes from real life i once found two very small boys in a garden playing a microscopic game of single wicket the bat was i think about the size of a table spoon and the utmost distance attained by the ball in its most daring flights was some or yards the exact length was of course a matter of supreme importance and it was always carefully measured out the batsman and the bowler amicably sharing the toil with a dead mouse i p the two quasi mathematical axioms quoted by arthur at p of vol i things that are greater than the same are greater than one another and all angles are equal were actually enunciated in all seriousness by undergraduates at a university situated not miles from ely ii p brunos remark i can if i like c was actually made by a little boy ii p so also was his remark i know what it doesnt spell and his remark i just twiddled my eyes c i heard from the lips of a little girl who had just solved a puzzle i had set her ii p brunos soliloquy for its father c was actually spoken by a little girl looking out of the window of a railway carriage ii p the remark made by a guest at the dinner party when asking for a dish of fruit ive been wishing for them c i heard made by the great poet laureate whose loss the whole reading world has so lately had to deplore ii p brunos speech on the subject of the age of mein herr embodies the reply of a little girl to the question is your grandmother an old lady i dont know if shes an old lady said this cautious young person shes eighty three ii p the speech about obstruction is no mere creature of my imagination it is copied verbatim from the columns of the standard and was spoken by sir william harcourt who was at the time a member of the opposition at the national liberal club on july the th ii p the professors remark about a dogs tail that it doesnt bite at that end was actually made by a child when warned of the danger he was incurring by pulling the dogs tail ii p the dialogue between sylvie and bruno which occupies lines to is a verbatim report merely substituting cake for penny of a dialogue overheard between two children one story in this volumebrunos picnici can vouch for as suitable for telling to children having tested it again and again and whether my audience has been a dozen little girls in a village school or some thirty or forty in a london drawing room or a hundred in a high school i have always found them earnestly attentive and keenly appreciative of such fun as the story supplied may i take this opportunity of calling attention to what i flatter myself was a successful piece of name coining at p of vol i does not the name sibimet fairly embody the character of the sub warden the gentle reader has no doubt observed what a singularly useless article in a house a brazen trumpet is if you simply leave it lying about and never blow it readers of the first volume who have amused themselves by trying to solve the two puzzles propounded at pp xi xii of the preface may perhaps like to exercise their ingenuity in discovering which if any of the following parallelisms were intentional and which if any accidental little birds events and persons stanza banquet chancellor empress and spinach ii wardens return professors lecture ii other professors song i petting of uggug baron doppelgeist jester and bear i little foxes brunos dinner bell little foxes i will publish the answer to this puzzle in the preface to a little book of original games and puzzles now in course of preparation i have reserved for the last one or two rather more serious topics i had intended in this preface to discuss more fully than i had done in the previous volume the morality of sport with special reference to letters i have received from lovers of sport in which they point out the many great advantages which men get from it and try to prove that the suffering which it inflicts on animals is too trivial to be regarded but when i came to think the subject out and to arrange the whole of the arguments pro and con i found it much too large for treatment here some day i hope to publish an essay on this subject at present i will content myself with stating the net result i have arrived at it is that god has given to man an absolute right to take the lives of other animals for any reasonable cause such as the supply of food but that he has not given to man the right to inflict pain unless when necessary that mere pleasure or advantage does not constitute such a necessity and consequently that pain inflicted for the purposes of sport is cruel and therefore wrong but i find it a far more complex question than i had supposed and that the case on the side of the sportsman is a much stronger one than i had supposed so for the present i say no more about it objections have been raised to the severe language i have put into the mouth of arthur at p on the subject of sermons and at pp on the subjects of choral services and choristers i have already protested against the assumption that i am ready to endorse the opinions of characters in my story but in these two instances i admit that i am much in sympathy with arthur in my opinion far too many sermons are expected from our preachers and as a consequence a great many are preached which are not worth listening to and as a consequence of that we are very apt not to listen the reader of this paragraph probably heard a sermon last sunday morning well let him if he can name the text and state how the preacher treated it then as to choristers and all the other accessoriesof music vestments processions cwhich have come along with them into fashionwhile freely admitting that the ritual movement was sorely needed and that it has effected a vast improvement in our church services which had become dead and dry to the last degree i hold that like many other desirable movements it has gone too far in the opposite direction and has introduced many new dangers for the congregation this new movement involves the danger of learning to think that the services are done for them and that their bodily presence is all they need contribute and for clergy and congregation alike it involves the danger of regarding these elaborate services as ends in themselves and of forgetting that they are simply means and the very hollowest of mockeries unless they bear fruit in our lives for the choristers it seems to involve the danger of self conceit as described at p the danger of regarding those parts of the service where their help is not required as not worth attending to the danger of coming to regard the service as a mere outward forma series of postures to be assumed and of words to be said or sung while the thoughts are elsewhereand the danger of familiarity breeding contempt for sacred things let me illustrate these last two forms of danger from my own experience not long ago i attended a cathedral service and was placed immediately behind a row of men members of the choir and i could not help noticing that they treated the lessons as a part of the service to which they needed not to give any attention and as affording them a convenient opportunity for arranging music books c c also i have frequently seen a row of little choristers after marching in procession to their places kneel down as if about to pray and rise from their knees after a minute spent in looking about them it being but too evident that the attitude was a mere mockery surely it is very dangerous for these children to thus accustom them to pretend to pray as an instance of irreverent treatment of holy things i will mention a custom which no doubt many of my readers have noticed in churches where the clergy and choir enter in procession viz that at the end of the private devotions which are carried on in the vestry and which are of course inaudible to the congregation the final amen is shouted loud enough to be heard all through the church this serves as a signal to the congregation to prepare to rise when the procession appears and it admits of no dispute that it is for this purpose that it is thus shouted when we remember to whom that amen is really addressed and consider that it is here used for the same purpose as one of the church bells we must surely admit that it is a piece of gross irreverence to me it is much as if i were to see a bible used as a footstool as an instance of the dangers for the clergy themselves introduced by this new movement let me mention the fact that according to my experience clergymen of this school are specially apt to retail comic anecdotes in which the most sacred names and wordssometimes actual texts from the bibleare used as themes for jesting many such things are repeated as having been originally said by children whose utter ignorance of evil must no doubt acquit them in the sight of god of all blame but it must be otherwise for those who consciously use such innocent utterances as material for their unholy mirth let me add however most earnestly that i fully believe that this profanity is in many cases unconscious the environment as i have tried to explain at p makes all the difference between man and man and i rejoice to think that many of these profane storieswhich i find so painful to listen to and should feel it a sin to repeatgive to their ears no pain and to their consciences no shock and that they can utter not less sincerely than myself the two prayers hallowed be thy name and from hardness of heart and contempt of thy word and commandment good lord deliver us to which i would desire to add for their sake and for my own kebles beautiful petition help us this and every day to live more nearly as we pray it is in fact for its consequencesfor the grave dangers both to speaker and to hearer which it involvesrather than for what it is in itself that i mourn over this clerical habit of profanity in social talk to the believing hearer it brings the danger of loss of reverence for holy things by the mere act of listening to and enjoying such jests and also the temptation to retail them for the amusement of others to the unbelieving hearer it brings a welcome confirmation of his theory that religion is a fable in the spectacle of its accredited champions thus betraying their trust and to the speaker himself it must surely bring the danger of loss of faith for surely such jests if uttered with no consciousness of harm must necessarily be also uttered with no consciousness at the moment of the reality of god as a living being who hears all we say and he who allows himself the habit of thus uttering holy words with no thought of their meaning is but too likely to find that for him god has become a myth and heaven a poetic fancythat for him the light of life is gone and that he is at heart an atheist lost in a darkness that may be felt there is i fear at the present time an increasing tendency to irreverent treatment of the name of god and of subjects connected with religion some of our theatres are helping this downward movement by the gross caricatures of clergymen which they put upon the stage some of our clergy are themselves helping it by showing that they can lay aside the spirit of reverence along with their surplices and can treat as jests when outside their churches names and things to which they pay an almost superstitious veneration when inside the salvation army has i fear with the best intentions done much to help it by the coarse familiarity with which they treat holy things and surely every one who desires to live in the spirit of the prayer hallowed be thy name ought to do what he can however little that may be to check it so i have gladly taken this unique opportunity however unfit the topic may seem for the preface to a book of this kind to express some thoughts which have weighed on my mind for a long time i did not expect when i wrote the preface to vol i that it would be read to any appreciable extent but i rejoice to believe from evidence that has reached me that it has been read by many and to hope that this preface will also be so and i think that among them some will be found ready to sympathise with the views i have put forwards and ready to help with their prayers and their example the

month or two my solitary town life seemed by contrast unusually dull and tedious i missed the pleasant friends i had left behind at elvestonthe genial interchange of thoughtthe sympathy which gave to ones ideas a new and vivid reality but perhaps more than all i missed the companionship of the two fairiesor dream children for i had not yet solved the problem as to who or what they werewhose sweet playfulness had shed a magic radiance over my life in office hourswhich i suppose reduce most men to the mental condition of a coffee mill or a mangletime sped along much as usual it was in the pauses of life the desolate hours when books and newspapers palled on the sated appetite and when thrown back upon ones own dreary musings one stroveall in vainto people the vacant air with the dear faces of absent friends that the real bitterness of solitude made itself felt one evening feeling my life a little more wearisome than usual i strolled down to my club not so much with the hope of meeting any friend there for london was now out of town as with the feeling that here at least i should hear sweet words of human speech and come into contact with human thought however almost the first face i saw there was that of a friend eric lindon was lounging with rather a bored expression of face over a newspaper and we fell into conversation with a mutual satisfaction which neither of us tried to conceal after a while i ventured to introduce what was just then the main subject of my thoughts and so the doctor a name we had adopted by a tacit agreement as a convenient compromise between the formality of doctor forester and the intimacyto which eric lindon hardly seemed entitledof arthur has gone abroad by this time i suppose can you give me his present address he is still at elvestoni believe was the reply but i have not been there since i last met you i did not know which part of this intelligence to wonder at most and might i askif it isnt taking too much of a libertywhen your wedding bells are toor perhaps they have rung already no said eric in a steady voice which betrayed scarcely a trace of emotion that engagement is at an end i am still benedick the unmarried man after this the thick coming fanciesall radiant with new possibilities of happiness for arthurwere far too bewildering to admit of any further conversation and i was only too glad to avail myself of the first decent excuse that offered itself for retiring into silence the next day i wrote to arthur with as much of a reprimand for his long silence as i could bring myself to put into words begging him to tell me how the world went with him needs must that three or four dayspossibly moreshould elapse before i could receive his reply and never had i known days drag their slow length along with a more tedious indolence to while away the time i strolled one afternoon into kensington gardens and wandering aimlessly along any path that presented itself i soon became aware that i had somehow strayed into one that was wholly new to me still my elfish experiences seemed to have so completely faded out of my life that nothing was further from my thoughts than the idea of again meeting my fairy friends when i chanced to notice a small creature moving among the grass that fringed the path that did not seem to be an insect or a frog or any other living thing that i could think of cautiously kneeling down and making an ex tempore cage of my two hands i imprisoned the little wanderer and felt a sudden thrill of surprise and delight on discovering that my prisoner was no other than bruno himself bruno took the matter very coolly and when i had replaced him on the ground where he would be within easy conversational distance he began talking just as if it were only a few minutes since last we had met doos oo know what the rule is he enquired when oo catches a fairy withouten its having tolded oo where it was brunos notions of english grammar had certainly not improved since our last meeting no i said i didnt know there was any rule about it i think oove got a right to eat me said the little fellow looking up into my face with a winning smile but im not pruffickly sure ood better not do it wizout asking it did indeed seem reasonable not to take so irrevocable a step as that without due enquiry ill certainly ask about it first i said besides i dont know yet whether you would be worth eating i guess im deliciously good to eat bruno remarked in a satisfied tone as if it were something to be rather proud of and what are you doing here bruno thats not my name said my cunning little friend dont oo know my names oh bruno thats what sylvie always calls me when i says mine lessons well then what are you doing here oh bruno doing mine lessons a course with that roguish twinkle in his eye that always came when he knew he was talking nonsense oh thats the way you do your lessons is it and do you remember them well always can member mine lessons said bruno its sylvies lessons thats so dreffully hard to member he frowned as if in agonies of thought and tapped his forehead with his knuckles i cant think enough to understand them he said despairingly it wants double thinking i believe but wheres sylvie gone thats just what i want to know said bruno disconsolately what evers the good of setting me lessons when she isnt here to splain the hard bits ill find her for you i volunteered and getting up i wandered round the tree under whose shade i had been reclining looking on all sides for sylvie in another minute i again noticed some strange thing moving among the grass and kneeling down was immediately confronted with sylvies innocent face lighted up with a joyful surprise at seeing me and was accosted in the sweet voice i knew so well with what seemed to be the end of a sentence whose beginning i had failed to catch and i think he ought to have finished them by this time so im going back to him will you come too its only just round at the other side of this tree it was but a few steps for me but it was a great many for sylvie and i had to be very careful to walk slowly in order not to leave the little creature so far behind as to lose sight of her to find brunos lessons was easy enough they appeared to be neatly written out on large smooth ivy leaves which were scattered in some confusion over a little patch of ground where the grass had been worn away but the pale student who ought by rights to have been bending over them was nowhere to be seen we looked in all directions for some time in vain but at last sylvies sharp eyes detected him swinging on a tendril of ivy and sylvies stern voice commanded his instant return to terra firma and to the business of life illustration sylvies truant pupil pleasure first and business afterwards seemed to be the motto of these tiny folk so many hugs and kisses had to be interchanged before anything else could be done now bruno sylvie said reproachfully didnt i tell you you were to go on with your lessons unless you heard to the contrary but i did heard to the contrary bruno insisted with a mischievous twinkle in his eye what did you hear you wicked boy it were a sort of noise in the air said bruno a sort of a scrambling noise didnt oo hear it mister sir well anyhow you neednt go to sleep over them you lazy lazy for bruno had curled himself up on the largest lesson and was arranging another as a pillow i wasnt asleep said bruno in a deeply injured tone when i shuts mine eyes its to show that im awake well how much have you learned then ive learned a little tiny bit said bruno modestly being evidently afraid of overstating his achievement cant learn no more oh bruno you know you can if you like course i can if i like the pale student replied but i cant if i dont like sylvie had a waywhich i could not too highly admireof evading brunos logical perplexities by suddenly striking into a new line of thought and this masterly stratagem she now adopted well i must say one thing did oo know mister sir bruno thoughtfully remarked that sylvie cant count whenever she says i must say one thing i know quite well shell say two things and she always doos two heads are better than one bruno i said but with no very distinct idea as to what i meant by it i shouldnt mind having two heads bruno said softly to himself one head to eat mine dinner and one head to argue wiz sylviedoos oo think ood look prettier if ood got two heads mister sir the case did not i assured him admit of a doubt the reason why sylvies so cross bruno went on very seriously almost sadly sylvies eyes grew large and round with surprise at this new line of enquiryher rosy face being perfectly radiant with good humour but she said nothing wouldnt it be better to tell me after the lessons are over i suggested very well bruno said with a resigned air only she wont be cross then theres only three lessons to do said sylvie spelling and geography and singing not arithmetic i said no he hasnt a head for arithmetic course i havent said bruno mine heads for hair i havent got a lot of heads and he cant learn his multiplication table i like history ever so much better bruno remarked oo has to repeat that muddlecome table well and you have to repeat no oo hasnt bruno interrupted history repeats itself the professor said so sylvie was arranging some letters on a boardevil now bruno she said what does that spell bruno looked at it in solemn silence for a minute i knows what it doosnt spell he said at last thats no good said sylvie what does it spell bruno took another look at the mysterious letters why its live backwards he exclaimed i thought it was indeed how did you manage to see that said sylvie i just twiddled my eyes said bruno and then i saw it directly now may i sing the king fisher song geography next said sylvie dont you know the rules i thinks there oughtnt to be such a lot of rules sylvie i thinks yes there ought to be such a lot of rules you wicked wicked boy and how dare you think at all about it and shut up that mouth directly so as that mouth didnt seem inclined to shut up of itself sylvie shut it for himwith both handsand sealed it with a kiss just as you would fasten up a letter now that bruno is fastened up from talking she went on turning to me ill show you the map he does his lessons on and there it was a large map of the world spread out on the ground it was so large that bruno had to crawl about on it to point out the places named in the king fisher lesson when a king fisher sees a lady bird flying away he says ceylon if you candia and when he catches it he says come to media and if youre hungary or thirsty ill give you some nubia when he takes it in his claws he says europe when he puts it into his beak he says india when hes swallowed it he says eton thats all thats quite perfect said sylvie now you may sing the king fisher song will oo sing the chorus bruno said to me i was just beginning to say im afraid i dont know the words when sylvie silently turned the map over and i found the words were all written on the back in one respect it was a very peculiar song the chorus to each verse came in the middle instead of at the end of it however the tune was so easy that i soon picked it up and managed the chorus as well perhaps as it is possible for one person to manage such a thing it was in vain that i signed to sylvie to help me she only smiled sweetly and shook her head king fisher courted lady bird sing beans sing bones sing butterflies find me my match he said with such a noble head with such a beard as white as curd with such expressive eyes yet pins have heads said lady bird sing prunes sing prawns sing primrose hill and where you stick them in they stay and thus a pin is very much to be preferred to one thats never still oysters have beards said lady bird sing flies sing frogs sing fiddle strings i love them for i know they never chatter so they would not say one single word not if you crowned them kings needles have eyes said lady bird sing cats sing corks sing cowslip tea and they are sharpjust what your majesty is not so get you gonetis too absurd to come a courting me illustration king fishers wooing so he went away bruno added as a kind of postscript when the last note of the song had died away just like he always did oh my dear bruno sylvie exclaimed with her hands over her ears you shouldnt say like you should say what to which bruno replied doggedly i only says what when oo doosnt speak loud so as i can hear oo where did he go to i asked hoping to prevent an argument he went more far than hed never been before said bruno you should never say more far sylvie corrected him you should say farther then oo shouldnt say more broth when were at dinner bruno retorted oo should say brother this time sylvie evaded an argument by turning away and beginning to roll up the map lessons are over she proclaimed in her sweetest tones and has there been no crying over them i enquired little boys always cry over their lessons dont they i never cries after twelve oclock said bruno cause then its getting so near to dinner time sometimes in the morning sylvie said in a low voice when its geography day and when hes been disobe what a fellow you are to talk sylvie bruno hastily interposed doos oo think the world was made for oo to talk in why where would you have me talk then sylvie said evidently quite ready for an argument but bruno answered resolutely im not going to argue about it cause its getting late and there wont be timebut oos as ong as ever oo can be and he rubbed the back of his hand across his eyes in which tears were beginning to glitter sylvies eyes filled with tears in a moment i didnt mean it bruno darling she whispered and the rest of the argument was lost amid the tangles of neras hair while the two disputants hugged and kissed each other but this new form of argument was brought to a sudden end by a flash of lightning which was closely followed by a peal of thunder and by a torrent of rain drops which came hissing and spitting almost like live creatures through the leaves of the tree that sheltered us why its raining cats and dogs i said and all the dogs has come down first said bruno theres nothing but cats coming down now in another minute the pattering ceased as suddenly as it had begun i stepped out from under the tree and found that the storm was over but i looked in vain on my return for my tiny companions they had vanished with the storm and there was nothing for it but to make the best of my way home on the table lay awaiting my return an envelope of that peculiar yellow tint which always announces a telegram and which must be in the memories of so many of us inseparably linked with some great and sudden sorrowsomething that has cast a shadow never in this world to be wholly lifted off on the brightness of life no doubt it has also heraldedfor many of ussome sudden news of joy but this i think is less common human life seems on the whole to contain more of sorrow than of joy and yet the world goes on who knows why this time however there was no shock of sorrow to be faced in fact the few words it contained could not bring myself to write come soon always welcome a letter follows this arthur seemed so like arthur himself speaking that it gave me quite a thrill of pleasure and i at once began the preparations needed for the journey chapter ii loves curfew fayfield junction change for elveston what subtle memory could there be linked to these commonplace words that caused such a flood of happy thoughts to fill my brain i dismounted from the carriage in a state of joyful excitement for which i could not at first account true i had taken this very journey and at the same hour of the day six months ago but many things had happened since then and an old mans memory has but a slender hold on recent events i sought the missing link in vain suddenly i caught sight of a benchthe only one provided on the cheerless platformwith a lady seated on it and the whole forgotten scene flashed upon me as vividly as if it were happening over again yes i thought this bare platform is for me rich with the memory of a dear friend she was sitting on that very bench and invited me to share it with some quotation from shakespearei forget what ill try the earls plan for the dramatisation of life and fancy that figure to be lady muriel and i wont undeceive myself too soon so i strolled along the platform resolutely making believe as children say that the casual passenger seated on that bench was the lady muriel i remembered so well she was facing away from me which aided the elaborate cheatery i was practising on myself but though i was careful in passing the spot to look the other way in order to prolong the pleasant illusion it was inevitable that when i turned to walk back again i should see who it was it was lady muriel herself illustration spend it all for minnie the whole scene now returned vividly to my memory and to make this repetition of it stranger still there was the same old man whom i remembered seeing so roughly ordered off by the station master to make room for his titled passenger the same but with a difference no longer tottering feebly along the platform but actually seated at lady muriels side and in conversation with her yes put it in your purse she was saying and remember youre to spend it all for minnie and mind you bring her something nice thatll do her real good and give her my love so intent was she on saying these words that although the sound of my footstep had made her lift her head and look at me she did not at first recognise me i raised my hat as i approached and then there flashed across her face a genuine look of joy which so exactly recalled the sweet face of sylvie when last we met in kensington gardens that i felt quite bewildered rather than disturb the poor old man at her side she rose from her seat and joined me in my walk up and down the platform and for a minute or two our conversation was as utterly trivial and commonplace as if we were merely two casual guests in a london drawing room each of us seemed to shrink just at first from touching on the deeper interests which linked our lives together the elveston train had drawn up at the platform while we talked and in obedience to the station masters obsequious hint of this way my lady times up we were making the best of our way towards the end which contained the sole first class carriage and were just passing the now empty bench when lady muriel noticed lying on it the purse in which her gift had just been so carefully bestowed the owner of which all unconscious of his loss was being helped into a carriage at the other end of the train she pounced on it instantly poor old man she cried he mustnt go off and think hes lost it let me run with it i can go quicker than you i said but she was already half way down the platform flying running is much too mundane a word for such fairy like motion at a pace that left all possible efforts of mine hopelessly in the rear she was back again before i had well completed my audacious boast of speed in running and was saying quite demurely as we entered our carriage and you really think you could have done it quicker no indeed i replied i plead guilty of gross exaggeration and throw myself on the mercy of the court the court will overlook itfor this once then her manner suddenly changed from playfulness to an anxious gravity you are not looking your best she said with an anxious glance in fact i think you look more of an invalid than when you left us i very much doubt if london agrees with you it may be the london air i said or it may be the hard workor my rather lonely life anyhow ive not been feeling very well lately but elveston will soon set me up again arthurs prescriptionhes my doctor you know and i heard from him this morningis plenty of ozone and new milk and pleasant society pleasant society said lady muriel with a pretty make believe of considering the question well really i dont know where we can find that for you we have so few neighbours but new milk we can manage do get it of my old friend mrs hunter up there on the hill side you may rely upon the quality and her little bessie comes to school every day and passes your lodgings so it would be very easy to send it ill follow your advice with pleasure i said and ill go and arrange about it tomorrow i know arthur will want a walk youll find it quite an easy walkunder three miles i think well now that weve settled that point let me retort your own remark upon yourself i dont think youre looking quite your best i daresay not she replied in a low voice and a sudden shadow seemed to overspread her face ive had some troubles lately its a matter about which ive been long wishing to consult you but i couldnt easily write about it im so glad to have this opportunity do you think she began again after a minutes silence and with a visible embarrassment of manner most unusual in her that a promise deliberately and solemnly given is always bindingexcept of course where its fulfilment would involve some actual sin i cant think of any other exception at this moment i said that branch of casuistry is usually i believe treated as a question of truth and untruth surely that is the principle she eagerly interrupted i always thought the bible teaching about it consisted of such texts as lie not one to another i have thought about that point i replied and it seems to me that the essence of lying is the intention of deceiving if you give a promise fully intending to fulfil it you are certainly acting truthfully then and if you afterwards break it that does not involve any deception i cannot call it untruthful another pause of silence ensued lady muriels face was hard to read she looked pleased i thought but also puzzled and i felt curious to know whether her question had as i began to suspect some bearing on the breaking off of her engagement with captain now major lindon you have relieved me from a great fear she said but the thing is of course wrong somehow what texts would you quote to prove it wrong any that enforce the payment of debts if a promises something to b b has a claim upon a and as sin if he breaks his promise seems to me more analogous to stealing than to lying its a new way of looking at itto me she said but it seems a true way also however i wont deal in generalities with an old friend like you for we are old friends somehow do you know i think we began as old friends she said with a playfulness of tone that ill accorded with the tears that glistened in her eyes thank you very much for saying so i replied i like to think of you as an old friend though you dont look it would have been the almost necessary sequence with any other lady but she and i seemed to have long passed out of the time when compliments or any such trivialities were possible here the train paused at a station where two or three passengers entered the carriage so no more was said till we had reached our journeys end on our arrival at elveston she readily adopted my suggestion that we should walk up together so as soon as our luggage had been duly taken charge ofhers by the servant who met her at the station and mine by one of the porterswe set out together along the familiar lanes now linked in my memory with so many delightful associations lady muriel at once recommenced the conversation at the point where it had been interrupted you knew of my engagement to my cousin eric did you also hear yes i interrupted anxious to spare her the pain of giving any details i heard it had all come to an end i would like to tell you how it happened she said as that is the very point i want your advice about i had long realised that we were not in sympathy in religious belief his ideas of christianity are very shadowy and even as to the existence of a god he lives in a sort of dreamland but it has not affected his life i feel sure now that the most absolute atheist may be leading though walking blindfold a pure and noble life and if you knew half the good deeds she broke off suddenly and turned away her head i entirely agree with you i said and have we not our saviours own promise that such a life shall surely lead to the light yes i know it she said in a broken voice still keeping her head turned away and so i told him he said he would believe for my sake if he could and he wished for my sake he could see things as i did but that is all wrong she went on passionately god cannot approve such low motives as that still it was not i that broke it off i knew he loved me and i had promised and then it was he that broke it off he released me unconditionally she faced me again now having quite recovered her usual calmness of manner then what difficulty remains it is this that i dont believe he did it of his own free will now supposing he did it against his will merely to satisfy my scruples would not his claim on me remain just as strong as ever and would not my promise be as binding as ever my father says no but i cant help fearing he is biased by his love for me and ive asked no one else i have many friendsfriends for the bright sunny weather not friends for the clouds and storms of life not old friends like you let me think a little i said and for some minutes we walked on in silence while pained to the heart at seeing the bitter trial that had come upon this pure and gentle soul i strove in vain to see my way through the tangled skein of conflicting motives if she loves him truly i seemed at last to grasp the clue to the problem is not that for her the voice of god may she not hope that she is sent to him even as ananias was sent to saul in his blindness that he may receive his sight once more i seemed to hear arthur whispering what knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thy husband and i broke the silence with the words if you still love him truly i do not she hastily interrupted at leastnot in that way i believe i loved him when i promised but i was very young it is hard to know but whatever the feeling was it is dead now the motive on his side is love on mine it isduty again there was a long silence the whole skein of thought was tangled worse than ever this time she broke the silence dont misunderstand me she said when i said my heart was not his i did not mean it was any one elses at present i feel bound to him and till i know i am absolutely free in the sight of god to love any other than him ill never even think of any one elsein that way i mean i would die sooner i had never imagined my gentle friend capable of such passionate utterances i ventured on no further remark until we had nearly arrived at the hall gate but the longer i reflected the clearer it became to me that no call of duty demanded the sacrificepossibly of the happiness of a lifewhich she seemed ready to make i tried to make this clear to her also adding some warnings on the dangers that surely awaited a union in which mutual love was wanting the only argument for it worth considering i said in conclusion seems to be his supposed reluctance in releasing you from your promise i have tried to give to that argument its full weight and my conclusion is that it does not affect the rights of the case or invalidate the release he has given you my belief is that you are entirely free to act as now seems right i am very grateful to you she said earnestly believe it please i cant put it into proper words and the subject was dropped by mutual consent and i only learned long afterwards that our discussion had really served to dispel the doubts that had harassed her so long we parted at the hall gate and i found arthur eagerly awaiting my arrival and before we parted for the night i had heard the whole storyhow he had put off his journey from day to day feeling that he could not go away from the place till his fate had been irrevocably settled by the wedding taking place how the preparations for the wedding and the excitement in the neighbourhood had suddenly come to an end and he had learned from major lindon who called to wish him good bye that the engagement had been broken off by mutual consent how he had instantly abandoned all his plans for going abroad and had decided to stay on at elveston for a year or two at any rate till his newly awakened hopes should prove true or false and how since that memorable day he had avoided all meetings with lady muriel fearing to betray his feelings before he had had any sufficient evidence as to how she regarded him but it is nearly six weeks since all that happened he said in conclusion and we can meet in the ordinary way now with no need for any painful allusions i would have written to tell you all this only i kept hoping from day to day thatthat there would be more to tell and how should there be more you foolish fellow i fondly urged if you never even go near her do you expect the offer to come from her arthur was betrayed into a smile no he said i hardly expect that but im a desperate coward theres no doubt about it and what reasons have you heard of for breaking off the engagement a good many arthur replied and proceeded to count them on his fingers first it was found that she was dying ofsomething so he broke it off then it was found that he was dying ofsome other thing so she broke it off then the major turned out to be a confirmed gamester so the earl broke it off then the earl insulted him so the major broke it off it got a good deal broken off all things considered you have all this on the very best authority of course oh certainly and communicated in the strictest confidence whatever defects elveston society suffers from want of information isnt one of them nor reticence either it seems but seriously do you know the real reason no im quite in the dark i did not feel that i had any right to enlighten him so i changed the subject to the less engrossing one of new milk and we agreed that i should walk over next day to hunters farm arthur undertaking to set me part of the way after which he had to return to keep a business engagement chapter iii streaks of dawn next day proved warm and sunny and we started early to enjoy the luxury of a good long chat before he would be obliged to leave me this neighbourhood has more than its due proportion of the very poor i remarked as we passed a group of hovels too dilapidated to deserve the name of cottages but the few rich arthur replied give more than their due proportion of help in charity so the balance is kept i suppose the earl does a good deal he gives liberally but he has not the health or strength to do more lady muriel does more in the way of school teaching and cottage visiting than she would like me to reveal then she at least is not one of the idle mouths one so often meets with among the upper classes i have sometimes thought they would have a hard time of it if suddenly called on to give their raison dtre and to show cause why they should be allowed to live any longer the whole subject said arthur of what we may call idle mouths i mean persons who absorb some of the material wealth of a communityin the form of food clothes and so onwithout contributing its equivalent in the form of productive labour is a complicated one no doubt ive tried to think it out and it seemed to me that the simplest form of the problem to start with is a community without money who buy and sell by barter only and it makes it yet simpler to suppose the food and other things to be capable of keeping for many years without spoiling yours is an excellent plan i said what is your solution of the problem the commonest type of idle mouths said arthur is no doubt due to money being left by parents to their own children so i imagined a maneither exceptionally clever or exceptionally strong and industriouswho had contributed so much valuable labour to the needs of the community that its equivalent in clothes c was say five times as much as he needed for himself we cannot deny his absolute right to give the superfluous wealth as he chooses so if he leaves four children behind him say two sons and two daughters with enough of all the necessaries of life to last them a life time i cannot see that the community is in any way wronged if they choose to do nothing in life but to eat drink and be merry most certainly the community could not fairly say in reference to them if a man will not work neither let him eat their reply would be crushing the labour has already been done which is a fair equivalent for the food we are eating and you have had the benefit of it on what principle of justice can you demand two quotas of work for one quota of food yet surely i said there is something wrong somewhere if these four people are well able to do useful work and if that work is actually needed by the community and they elect to sit idle i think there is said arthur but it seems to me to arise from a law of godthat every one shall do as much as he can to help othersand not from any rights on the part of the community to exact labour as an equivalent for food that has already been fairly earned i suppose the second form of the problem is where the idle mouths possess money instead of material wealth yes replied arthur and i think the simplest case is that of paper money gold is itself a form of material wealth but a bank note is merely a promise to hand over so much material wealth when called upon to do so the father of these four idle mouths had done let us say five thousand pounds worth of useful work for the community in return for this the community had given him what amounted to a written promise to hand over whenever called upon to do so five thousand pounds worth of food c then if he only uses one thousand pounds worth himself and leaves the rest of the notes to his children surely they have a full right to present these written promises and to say hand over the food for which the equivalent labour has been already done now i think this case well worth stating publicly and clearly i should like to drive it into the heads of those socialists who are priming our ignorant paupers with such sentiments as look at them bloated haristocrats doing not a stroke o work for theirselves and living on the sweat of our brows i should like to force them to see that the money which those haristocrats are spending represents so much labour already done for the community and whose equivalent in material wealth is due from the community might not the socialists reply much of this money does not represent honest labour at all if you could trace it back from owner to owner though you might begin with several legitimate steps such as gift or bequeathing by will or value received you would soon reach an owner who had no moral right to it but had got it by fraud or other crimes and of course his successors in the line would have no better right to it than he had no doubt no doubt arthur replied but surely that involves the logical fallacy of proving too much it is quite as applicable to material wealth as it is to money if we once begin to go back beyond the fact that the present owner of certain property came by it honestly and to ask whether any previous owner in past ages got it by fraud would any property be secure after a minutes thought i felt obliged to admit the truth of this my general conclusion arthur continued from the mere standpoint of human rights man against man was thisthat if some wealthy idle mouth who has come by his money in a lawful way even though not one atom of the labour it represents has been his own doing chooses to spend it on his own needs without contributing any labour to the community from whom he buys his food and clothes that community has no right to interfere with him but its quite another thing when we come to consider the divine law measured by that standard such a man is undoubtedly doing wrong if he fails to use for the good of those in need the strength or the skill that god has given him that strength and skill do not belong to the community to be paid to them as a debt they do not belong to the man himself to be used for his own enjoyment they do belong to god to be used according to his will and we are not left in doubt as to what that will is do good and lend hoping for nothing again anyhow i said an idle mouth very often gives away a great deal in charity in so called charity he corrected me excuse me if i seem to speak uncharitably i would not dream of applying the term to any individual but i would say generally that a man who gratifies every fancy that occurs to himdenying himself in nothingand merely gives to the poor some part or even all of his superfluous wealth is only deceiving himself if he calls it charity but even in giving away superfluous wealth he may be denying himself the misers pleasure in hoarding i grant you that gladly said arthur given that he has that morbid craving he is doing a good deed in restraining it but even in spending on himself i persisted our typical rich man often does good by employing people who would otherwise be out of work and that is often better than pauperising them by giving the money im glad youve said that said arthur i would not like to quit the subject without exposing the two fallacies of that statementwhich have gone so long uncontradicted that society now accepts it as an axiom what are they i said i dont even see one myself one is merely the fallacy of ambiguitythe assumption that doing good that is benefiting somebody is necessarily a good thing to do that is a right thing the other is the assumption that if one of two specified acts is better than another it is necessarily a good act in itself i should like to call this the fallacy of comparisonmeaning that it assumes that what is comparatively good is therefore positively good then what is your test of a good act that it shall be our best arthur confidently replied and even then we are unprofitable servants but let me illustrate the two fallacies nothing illustrates a fallacy so well as an extreme case which fairly comes under it suppose i find two children drowning in a pond i rush in and save one of the children and then walk away leaving the other to drown clearly i have done good in saving a childs life but again supposing i meet an inoffensive stranger and knock him down and walk on clearly that is better than if i had proceeded to jump upon him and break his ribs but those buts are quite unanswerable i said but i should like an instance from real life well let us take one of those abominations of modern society a charity bazaar its an interesting question to think outhow much of the money that reaches the object in view is genuine charity and whether even that is spent in the best way but the subject needs regular classification and analysis to understand it properly i should be glad to have it analysed i said it has often puzzled me well if i am really not boring you let us suppose our charity bazaar to have been organised to aid the funds of some hospital and that a b c give their services in making articles to sell and in acting as salesmen while x y z buy the articles and the money so paid goes to the hospital there are two distinct species of such bazaars one where the payment exacted is merely the market value of the goods supplied that is exactly what you would have to pay at a shop the other where fancy prices are asked we must take these separately first the market value case here a b c are exactly in the same position as ordinary shopkeepers the only difference being that they give the proceeds to the hospital practically they are giving their skilled labour for the benefit of the hospital this seems to me to be genuine charity and i dont see how they could use it better but x y z are exactly in the same position as any ordinary purchasers of goods to talk of charity in connection with their share of the business is sheer nonsense yet they are very likely to do so secondly the case of fancy prices here i think the simplest plan is to divide the payment into two parts the market value and the excess over that the market value part is on the same footing as in the first case the excess is all we have to consider well a b c do not earn it so we may put them out of the question it is a gift from x y z to the hospital and my opinion is that it is not given in the best way far better buy what they choose to buy and give what they choose to give as two separate transactions then there is some chance that their motive in giving may be real charity instead of a mixed motivehalf charity half self pleasing the trail of the serpent is over it all and therefore it is that i hold all such spurious charities in utter abomination he ended with unusual energy and savagely beheaded with his stick a tall thistle at the road side behind which i was startled to see sylvie and bruno standing i caught at his arm but too late to stop him whether the stick reached them or not i could not feel sure at any rate they took not the smallest notice of it but smiled gaily and nodded to me and i saw at once that they were only visible to me the eerie influence had not reached to arthur why did you try to save it he said thats not the wheedling secretary of a charity bazaar i only wish it were he added grimly doos oo know that stick went right froo my head said bruno they had run round to me by this time and each had secured a hand just under my chin i are glad i arent a thistle well weve threshed that subject out anyhow arthur resumed im afraid ive been talking too much for your patience and for my strength i must be turning soon this is about the end of my tether take o boatman thrice thy fee take i give it willingly for invisible to thee spirits twain have crossed with me i quoted involuntarily for utterly inappropriate and irrelevant quotations laughed arthur you are ekalled by few and excelled by none and we strolled on as we passed the head of the lane that led down to the beach i noticed a single figure moving slowly along it seawards she was a good way off and had her back to us but it was lady muriel unmistakably knowing that arthur had not seen her as he had been looking in the other direction at a gathering rain cloud i made no remark but tried to think of some plausible pretext for sending him back by the sea the opportunity instantly presented itself im getting tired he said i dont think it would be prudent to go further i had better turn here i turned with him for a few steps and as we again approached the head of the lane i said as carelessly as i could dont go back by the road its too hot and dusty down this lane and along the beach is nearly as short and youll get a breeze off the sea yes i think i will arthur began but at that moment we came into sight of lady muriel and he checked himself no its too far round yet it certainly would be cooler he stood hesitating looking first one way and then the othera melancholy picture of utter infirmity of purpose how long this humiliating scene would have continued if i had been the only external influence it is impossible to say for at this moment sylvie with a swift decision worthy of napoleon himself took the matter into her own hands you go and drive her up this way she said to bruno ill get him along and she took hold of the stick that arthur was carrying and gently pulled him down the lane he was totally unconscious that any will but his own was acting on the stick and appeared to think it had taken a horizontal position simply because he was pointing with it are not those orchises under the hedge there he said i think that decides me ill gather some as i go along illustration are not those orchises meanwhile bruno had run on beyond lady muriel and with much jumping about and shouting shouts audible to no one but sylvie and myself much as if he were driving sheep he managed to turn her round and make her walk with eyes demurely cast upon the ground in our direction the victory was ours and since it was evident that the lovers thus urged together must meet in another minute i turned and walked on hoping that sylvie and bruno would follow my example as i felt sure that the fewer the spectators the better it would be for arthur and his good angel and what sort of meeting was it i wondered as i paced dreamily on chapter iv the dog king they shooked hands said bruno who was trotting at my side in answer to the unspoken question and they looked ever so pleased sylvie added from the other side well we must get on now as quick as we can i said if only i knew the best way to hunters farm theyll be sure to know in this cottage said sylvie yes i suppose they will bruno would you run in and ask sylvie stopped him laughingly as he ran off wait a minute she said i must make you visible first you know and audible too i suppose i said as she took the jewel that hung round her neck and waved it over his head and touched his eyes and lips with it yes said sylvie and once do you know i made him audible and forgot to make him visible and he went to buy some sweeties in a shop and the man was so frightened a voice seemed to come out of the air please i want two ounces of barley sugar drops and a shilling came bang down upon the counter and the man said i cant see you and bruno said it doosnt sinnify seeing me so long as oo can see the shilling but the man said he never sold barley sugar drops to people he couldnt see so we had tonow bruno youre ready and away he trotted sylvie spent the time while we were waiting for him in making herself visible also its rather awkward you know she explained to me when we meet people and they can see one of us and cant see the other in a minute or two bruno returned looking rather disconsolate hed got friends with him and he were cross he said he asked me who i were and i said im bruno who is these peoples and he said ones my half brother and tothers my half sister and i dont want no more company go along with yer and i said i cant go along wizout mine self and i said oo shouldnt have bits of peoples lying about like that its welly untidy and he said oh dont talk to me and he pushted me outside and he shutted the door and you never asked where hunters farm was queried sylvie hadnt room for any questions said bruno the room were so crowded three people couldnt crowd a room said sylvie they did though bruno persisted he crowded it most hes such a welly thick manso as oo couldnt knock him down i failed to see the drift of brunos argument surely anybody could be knocked down i said thick or thin wouldnt matter oo couldnt knock him down said bruno hes more wider than hes high so when hes lying down hes more higher than when hes standing so a course oo couldnt knock him down heres another cottage i said ill ask the way this time there was no need to go in this time as the woman was standing in the doorway with a baby in her arms talking to a respectably dressed mana farmer as i guessedwho seemed to be on his way to the town and when theres drink to be had he was saying hes just the worst o the lot is your willie so they tell me he gets fairly mad wi it id have given em the lie to their faces a twelvemonth back the woman said in a broken voice but a canna noo a canna noo she checked herself on catching sight of us and hastily retreated into the house shutting the door after her perhaps you can tell me where hunters farm is i said to the man as he turned away from the house i can that sir he replied with a smile im john hunter hissel at your sarvice its nobbut half a mile furtherthe only house in sight when you get round bend o the road yonder youll find my good woman within if so be youve business wi her or mebbe ill do as well thanks i said i want to order some milk perhaps i had better arrange it with your wife aye said the man she minds all that good day tye masterand to your bonnie childer as well and he trudged on he should have said child not childer said bruno sylvies not a childer he meant both of us said sylvie no he didnt bruno persisted cause he said bonnie oo know well at any rate he looked at us both sylvie maintained well then he must have seen were not both bonnie bruno retorted a course im much uglier than oo didnt he mean sylvie mister sir he shouted over his shoulder as he ran off but there was no use in replying as he had already vanished round the bend of the road when we overtook him he was climbing a gate and was gazing earnestly into the field where a horse a cow and a kid were browsing amicably together for its father a horse he murmured to himself for its mother a cow for their dear little child a little goat is the most curiousest thing i ever seen in my world brunos world i pondered yes i suppose every child has a world of his ownand every man too for the matter of that i wonder if thats the cause for all the misunderstanding there is in life that must be hunters farm said sylvie pointing to a house on the brow of the hill led up to by a cart road theres no other farm in sight this way and you said we must be nearly there by this time i had thought it while bruno was climbing the gate but i couldnt remember having said it however sylvie was evidently in the right get down bruno i said and open the gate for us its a good thing wes with oo isnt it mister sir said bruno as we entered the field that big dog might have bited oo if ood been alone oo neednt be flightened of it he whispered clinging tight to my hand to encourage me it arent fierce fierce sylvie scornfully echoed as the doga magnificent newfoundlandthat had come galloping down the field to meet us began curveting round us in gambols full of graceful beauty and welcoming us with short joyful barks fierce why its as gentle as a lamb itswhy bruno dont you know it its so it are cried bruno rushing forwards and throwing his arms round its neck oh you dear dog and it seemed as if the two children would never have done hugging and stroking it and how ever did he get here said bruno ask him sylvie i doosnt know how and then began an eager talk in doggee which of course was lost upon me and i could only guess when the beautiful creature with a sly glance at me whispered something in sylvies ear that i was now the subject of conversation sylvie looked round laughingly he asked me who you are she explained and i said hes our friend and he said whats his name and i said its mister sir and he said bosh what is bosh in doggee i enquired its the same as in english said sylvie only when a dog says it its a sort of a whisper thats half a cough and half a bark nero say bosh and nero who had now begun gamboling round us again said bosh several times and i found that sylvies description of the sound was perfectly accurate i wonder whats behind this long wall i said as we walked on its the orchard sylvie replied after a consultation with nero see theres a boy getting down off the wall at that far corner and now hes running away across the field i do believe hes been stealing the apples bruno set off after him but returned to us in a few moments as he had evidently no chance of overtaking the young rascal i couldnt catch him he said i wiss id started a little sooner his pockets was full of apples the dog king looked up at sylvie and said something in doggee why of course you can sylvie exclaimed how stupid not to think of it neroll hold him for us bruno but id better make him invisible first and she hastily got out the magic jewel and began waving it over neros head and down along his back thatll do cried bruno impatiently after him good doggie oh bruno sylvie exclaimed reproachfully you shouldnt have sent him off so quick i hadnt done the tail meanwhile nero was coursing like a greyhound down the field so at least i concluded from all i could see of himthe long feathery tail which floated like a meteor through the airand in a very few seconds he had come up with the little thief hes got him safe by one foot cried sylvie who was eagerly watching the chase now theres no hurry bruno so we walked quite leisurely down the field to where the frightened lad stood a more curious sight i had seldom seen in all my eerie experiences every bit of him was in violent action except the left foot which was apparently glued to the groundthere being nothing visibly holding it while at some little distance the long feathery tail was waving gracefully from side to side showing that nero at least regarded the whole affair as nothing but a magnificent game of play whats the matter with you i said as gravely as i could got the crahmp in me ahnkle the thief groaned in reply an me futs gone to sleep and he began to blubber aloud now look here bruno said in a commanding tone getting in front of him oove got to give up those apples the lad glanced at me but didnt seem to reckon my interference as worth anything then he glanced at sylvie she clearly didnt count for very much either then he took courage itll take a better man than any of yer to get em he retorted defiantly illustration a royal thief taker sylvie stooped and patted the invisible nero a little tighter she whispered and a sharp yell from the ragged boy showed how promptly the dog king had taken the hint whats the matter now i said is your ankle worse and itll get worse and worse and worse bruno solemnly assured him till oo gives up those apples apparently the thief was convinced of this at last and he sulkily began emptying his pockets of the apples the children watched from a little distance bruno dancing with delight at every fresh yell extracted from neros terrified prisoner thats all the boy said at last it isnt all cried bruno theres three more in that pocket another hint from sylvie to the dog kinganother sharp yell from the thief now convicted of lying alsoand the remaining three apples were surrendered let him go please sylvie said in doggee and the lad limped away at a great pace stooping now and then to rub the ailing ankle in fear seemingly that the crahmp might attack it again illustration summat wrong wi my spectacles bruno ran back with his booty to the orchard wall and pitched the apples over it one by one is welly afraid some of thems gone under the wrong trees he panted on overtaking us again the wrong trees laughed sylvie trees cant do wrong theres no such things as wrong trees then theres no such things as right trees neither cried bruno and sylvie gave up the point wait a minute please she said to me i must make nero visible you know no please dont cried bruno who had by this time mounted on the royal back and was twisting the royal hair into a bridle itll be such fun to have him like this well it does look funny sylvie admitted and led the way to the farm house where the farmers wife stood evidently much perplexed at the weird procession now approaching her its summat gone wrong wi my spectacles i doubt she murmured as she took them off and began diligently rubbing them with a corner of her apron meanwhile sylvie had hastily pulled bruno down from his steed and had just time to make his majesty wholly visible before the spectacles were resumed all was natural now but the good woman still looked a little uneasy about it my eyesights getting bad she said but i see you now my darlings youll give me a kiss wont you bruno got behind me in a moment however sylvie put up her face to be kissed as representative of both and we all went in together chapter v matilda jane come to me my little gentleman said our hostess lifting bruno into her lap and tell me everything i cant said bruno there wouldnt be time besides i dont know everything the good woman looked a little puzzled and turned to sylvie for help does he like riding she asked yes i think so sylvie gently replied hes just had a ride on nero ah neros a grand dog isnt he were you ever outside a horse my little man always bruno said with great decision never was inside one was oo here i thought it well to interpose and to mention the business on which we had come and so relieved her for a few minutes from brunos perplexing questions and those dear children will like a bit of cake ill warrant said the farmers hospitable wife when the business was concluded as she opened her cupboard and brought out a cake and dont you waste the crust little gentleman she added as she handed a good slice of it to bruno you know what the poetry book says about wilful waste no i dont said bruno what doos he say about it tell him bessie and the mother looked down proudly and lovingly on a rosy little maiden who had just crept shyly into the room and was leaning against her knee whats that your poetry book says about wilful waste for wilful waste makes woeful want bessie recited in an almost inaudible whisper and you may live to say how much i wish i had the crust that then i threw away now try if you can say it my dear for wilful for wiffulsumfinoruvver bruno began readily enough and then there came a dead pause cant remember no more well what do you learn from it then you can tell us that at any rate bruno ate a little more cake and considered but the moral did not seem to him to be a very obvious one always to sylvie prompted him in a whisper always to bruno softly repeated and then with sudden inspiration always to look where it goes to where what goes to darling why the crust a course said bruno then if i lived to say how much i wiss i had the crust and all that id know where i frew it to this new interpretation quite puzzled the good woman she returned to the subject of bessie wouldnt you like to see bessies doll my dears bessie take the little lady and gentleman to see matilda jane bessies shyness thawed away in a moment matilda jane has just woke up she stated confidentially to sylvie wont you help me on with her frock them strings is such a bother to tie i can tie strings we heard in sylvies gentle voice as the two little girls left the room together bruno ignored the whole proceeding and strolled to the window quite with the air of a fashionable gentleman little girls and dolls were not at all in his line and forthwith the fond mother proceeded to tell me as what mother is not ready to do of all bessies virtues and vices too for the matter of that and of the many fearful maladies which notwithstanding those ruddy cheeks and that plump little figure had nearly time and again swept her from the face of the earth when the full stream of loving memories had nearly run itself out i began to question her about the working men of that neighbourhood and specially the willie whom we had heard of at his cottage he was a good fellow once said my kind hostess but its the drink has ruined him not that id rob them of the drinkits good for the most of thembut theres some as is too weak to stand agin temptations its a thousand pities for them as they ever built the golden lion at the corner there the golden lion i repeated its the new public my hostess explained and it stands right in the way and handy for the workmen as they come back from the brickfields as it might be to day with their weeks wages a deal of money gets wasted that way and some of em gets drunk if only they could have it in their own houses i mused hardly knowing i had said the words out loud thats it she eagerly exclaimed it was evidently a solution of the problem that she had already thought out if only you could manage sos each man to have his own little barrel in his own housethered hardly be a drunken man in the length and breadth of the land and then i told her the old storyabout a certain cottager who bought himself a little barrel of beer and installed his wife as bar keeper and how every time he wanted his mug of beer he regularly paid her over the counter for it and how she never would let him go on tick and was a perfectly inflexible bar keeper in never letting him have more than his proper allowance and how every time the barrel needed refilling she had plenty to do it with and something over for her money box and how at the end of the year he not only found himself in first rate health and spirits with that undefinable but quite unmistakeable air which always distinguishes the sober man from the one who takes a drop too much but had quite a box full of money all saved out of his own pence if only theyd all do like that said the good woman wiping her eyes which were overflowing with kindly sympathy drink hadnt need to be the curse it is to some only a curse i said when it is used wrongly any of gods gifts may be turned into a curse unless we use it wisely but we must be getting home would you call the little girls matilda jane has seen enough of company for one day im sure ill find em in a minute said my hostess as she rose to leave the room maybe that young gentleman saw which way they went where are they bruno i said they aint in the field was brunos rather evasive reply cause theres nothing but pigs there and sylvie isnt a pig now dont imperrupt me any more cause im telling a story to this fly and it wont attend theyre among the apples ill warrant em said the farmers wife so we left bruno to finish his story and went out into the orchard where we soon came upon the children walking sedately side by side sylvie carrying the doll while little bess carefully shaded its face with a large cabbage leaf for a parasol as soon as they caught sight of us little bess dropped her cabbage leaf and came running to meet us sylvie following more slowly as her precious charge evidently needed great care and attention im its mamma and sylvies the head nurse bessie explained and sylvies taught me ever such a pretty song for me to sing to matilda jane lets hear it once more sylvie i said delighted at getting the chance i had long wished for of hearing her sing but sylvie turned shy and frightened in a moment no please not she said in an earnest aside to me bessie knows it quite perfect now bessie can sing it aye aye let bessie sing it said the proud mother bessie has a bonny voice of her own this again was an aside to me though i say it as shouldnt bessie was only too happy to accept the encore so the plump little mamma sat down at our feet with her hideous daughter reclining stiffly across her lap it was one of a kind that wont sit down under any amount of persuasion and with a face simply beaming with delight began the lullaby in a shout that ought to have frightened the poor baby into fits the head nurse crouched down behind her keeping herself respectfully in the back ground with her hands on the shoulders of her little mistress so as to be ready to act as prompter if required and to supply each gap in faithless memory void illustration bessies song the shout with which she began proved to be only a momentary effort after a very few notes bessie toned down and sang on in a small but very sweet voice at first her great black eyes were fixed on her mother but soon her gaze wandered upwards among the apples and she seemed to have quite forgotten that she had any other audience than her baby and her head nurse who once or twice supplied almost inaudibly the right note when the singer was getting a little flat matilda jane you never look at any toy or picture book i show you pretty things in vain you must be blind matilda jane i ask you riddles tell you tales but all our conversation fails you never answer me again i fear youre dumb matilda jane matilda darling when i call you never seem to hear at all i shout with all my might and main but youre so deaf matilda jane matilda jane you neednt mind for though youre deaf and dumb and blind theres some one loves you it is plain and that is me matilda jane she sang three of the verses in a rather perfunctory style but the last stanza evidently excited the little maiden her voice rose ever clearer and louder she had a rapt look on her face as if suddenly inspired and as she sang the last few words she clasped to her heart the inattentive matilda jane kiss it now prompted the head nurse and in a moment the simpering meaningless face of the baby was covered with a shower of passionate kisses what a bonny song cried the farmers wife who made the words dearie ii think ill look for bruno sylvie said demurely and left us hastily the curious child seemed always afraid of being praised or even noticed sylvie planned the words bessie informed us proud of her superior information and bruno planned the musicand i sang it this last circumstance by the way we did not need to be told so we followed sylvie and all entered the parlour together bruno was still standing at the window with his elbows on the sill he had apparently finished the story that he was telling to the fly and had found a new occupation dont imperrupt he said as we came in im counting the pigs in the field how many are there i enquired about a thousand and four said bruno you mean about a thousand sylvie corrected him theres no good saying and four you cant be sure about the four and youre as wrong as ever bruno exclaimed triumphantly its just the four i can be sure about cause theyre here grubbling under the window its the thousand i isnt pruffickly sure about but some of them have gone into the sty sylvie said leaning over him to look out of the window yes said bruno but they went so slowly and so fewly i didnt care to count them we must be going children i said wish bessie good bye sylvie flung her arms round the little maidens neck and kissed her but bruno stood aloof looking unusually shy i never kiss nobody but sylvie he explained to me afterwards the farmers wife showed us out and we were soon on our way back to elveston and thats the new public house that we were talking about i suppose i said as we came in sight of a long low building with the words the golden lion over the door yes thats it said sylvie i wonder if her willies inside run in bruno and see if hes there i interposed feeling that bruno was in a sort of way in my care thats not a place to send a child into for already the revelers were getting noisy and a wild discord of singing shouting and meaningless laughter came to us through the open windows they wont see him you know sylvie explained wait a minute bruno she clasped the jewel that always hung round her neck between the palms of her hands and muttered a few words to herself what they were i could not at all make out but some mysterious change seemed instantly to pass over us my feet seemed to me no longer to press the ground and the dream like feeling came upon me that i was suddenly endowed with the power of floating in the air i could still just see the children but their forms were shadowy and unsubstantial and their voices sounded as if they came from some distant place and time they were so unreal however i offered no further opposition to brunos going into the house he was back again in a few moments no he isnt come yet he said theyre talking about him inside and saying how drunk he was last week while he was speaking one of the men lounged out through the door a pipe in one hand and a mug of beer in the other and crossed to where we were standing so as to get a better view along the road two or three others leaned out through the open window each holding his mug of beer with red faces and sleepy eyes canst see him lad one of them asked i dunnot know the man said taking a step forwards which brought us nearly face to face sylvie hastily pulled me out of his way thanks child i said i had forgotten he couldnt see us what would have happened if i had staid in his way i dont know sylvie said gravely it wouldnt matter to us but you may be different she said this in her usual voice but the man took no sort of notice though she was standing close in front of him and looking up into his face as she spoke hes coming now cried bruno pointing down the road he be a coomin noo echoed the man stretching out his arm exactly over brunos head and pointing with his pipe then chorus agin was shouted out by one of the red faced men in the window and forthwith a dozen voices yelled to a harsh discordant melody the refrain theres him an yo an me roarin laddies we loves a bit o spree roarin laddies we roarin laddies roarin laddies the man lounged back again to the house joining lustily in the chorus as he went so that only the children and i were in the road when willie came up chapter vi willies wife he made for the door of the public house but the children intercepted him sylvie clung to one arm while bruno on the opposite side was pushing him with all his strength with many inarticulate cries of gee up gee back woah then which he had picked up from the waggoners willie took not the least notice of them he was simply conscious that something had checked him and for want of any other way of accounting for it he seemed to regard it as his own act illustration the rescue of willie i wunnut coom in he said not to day a mug o beer wunnut hurt ee his friends shouted in chorus two mugs wunnut hurt ee nor a dozen mugs nay said willie im agoan whoam what withouten thy drink willie man shouted the others but willie man would have no more discussion and turned doggedly away the children keeping one on each side of him to guard him against any change in his sudden resolution for a while he walked on stoutly enough keeping his hands in his pockets and softly whistling a tune in time to his heavy tread his success in appearing entirely at his ease was almost complete but a careful observer would have noted that he had forgotten the second part of the air and that when it broke down he instantly began it again being too nervous to think of another and too restless to endure silence it was not the old fear that possessed him nowthe old fear that had been his dreary companion every saturday night he could remember as he had reeled along steadying himself against gates and garden palings and when the shrill reproaches of his wife had seemed to his dazed brain only the echo of a yet more piercing voice within the intolerable wail of a hopeless remorse it was a wholly new fear that had come to him now life had taken on itself a new set of colours and was lighted up with a new and dazzling radiance and he did not see as yet how his home life and his wife and child would fit into the new order of things the very novelty of it all was to his simple mind a perplexity and an overwhelming terror and now the tune died into sudden silence on the trembling lips as he turned a sharp corner and came in sight of his own cottage where his wife stood leaning with folded arms on the wicket gate and looking up the road with a pale face that had in it no glimmer of the light of hopeonly the heavy shadow of a deep stony despair fine an early lad fine an early the words might have been words of welcoming but oh the bitterness of the tone in which she said it what brings thee from thy merry mates and all the fiddling and the jigging pockets empty i doubt or thoust come mebbe for to see thy little one die the bairnies clemmed and ive nor bite nor sup to gie her but what does thou care she flung the gate open and met him with blazing eyes of fury the man said no word slowly and with downcast eyes he passed into the house while she half terrified at his strange silence followed him in without another word and it was not till he had sunk into a chair with his arms crossed on the table and with drooping head that she found her voice again it seemed entirely natural for us to go in with them at another time one would have asked leave for this but i felt i knew not why that we were in some mysterious way invisible and as free to come and to go as disembodied spirits the child in the cradle woke up and raised a piteous cry which in a moment brought the children to its side bruno rocked the cradle while sylvie tenderly replaced the little head on the pillow from which it had slipped but the mother took no heed of the cry nor yet of the satisfied coo that it set up when sylvie had made it happy again she only stood gazing at her husband and vainly trying with white quivering lips i believe she thought he was mad to speak in the old tones of shrill upbraiding that he knew so well and thoust spent all thy wagesill swear thou haston the devils own drinkand thoust been and made thysen a beast againas thou allus dost hasna the man muttered his voice hardly rising above a whisper as he slowly emptied his pockets on the table theres th wage missus every penny ont the woman gasped and put one hand to her heart as if under some great shock of surprise then hows thee gotten th drink hasna gotten it he answered her in a tone more sad than sullen i hanna touched a drop this blessed day no he cried aloud bringing his clenched fist heavily down upon the table and looking up at her with gleaming eyes nor ill never touch another drop o the cursed drinktill i dieso help me god my maker his voice which had suddenly risen to a hoarse shout dropped again as suddenly and once more he bowed his head and buried his face in his folded arms illustration willies wife the woman had dropped upon her knees by the cradle while he was speaking she neither looked at him nor seemed to hear him with hands clasped above her head she rocked herself wildly to and fro oh my god oh my god was all she said over and over again sylvie and bruno gently unclasped her hands and drew them downtill she had an arm round each of them though she took no notice of them but knelt on with eyes gazing upwards and lips that moved as if in silent thanksgiving the man kept his face hidden and uttered no sound but one could see the sobs that shook him from head to foot after a while he raised his headhis face all wet with tears polly he said softly and then louder old poll then she rose from her knees and came to him with a dazed look as if she were walking in her sleep who was it called me old poll she asked her voice took on it a tender playfulness her eyes sparkled and the rosy light of youth flushed her pale cheeks till she looked more like a happy girl of seventeen than a worn woman of forty was that my own lad my willie a waiting for me at the stile his face too was transformed in the same magic light to the likeness of a bashful boy and boy and girl they seemed as he wound an arm about her and drew her to his side while with the other hand he thrust from him the heap of money as though it were something hateful to the touch tak it lass he said tak it all an fetch us summat to eat but get a sup o milk first for t bairn my little bairn she murmured as she gathered up the coins my own little lassie then she moved to the door and was passing out but a sudden thought seemed to arrest her she hastily returnedfirst to kneel down and kiss the sleeping child and then to throw herself into her husbands arms and be strained to his heart the next moment she was on her way taking with her a jug that hung on a peg near the door we followed close behind we had not gone far before we came in sight of a swinging sign board bearing the word dairy on it and here she went in welcomed by a little curly white dog who not being under the eerie influence saw the children and received them with the most effusive affection when i got inside the dairyman was in the act of taking the money ist for thysen missus or for t bairn he asked when he had filled the jug pausing with it in his hand for t bairn she said almost reproachfully thinkst tha id touch a drop mysen while as she hadna got her fill all right missus the man replied turning away with the jug in his hand lets just mak sure its good measure he went back among his shelves of milk bowls carefully keeping his back towards her while he emptied a little measure of cream into the jug muttering to himself mebbe itll hearten her up a bit the little lassie the woman never noticed the kind deed but took back the jug with a simple good evening master and went her way but the children had been more observant and as we followed her out bruno remarked that were welly kind and i loves that man and if i was welly rich id give him a hundred poundsand a bun that little grummeling dog doosnt know its business he referred to the dairymans little dog who had apparently quite forgotten the affectionate welcome he had given us on our arrival and was now following at a respectful distance doing his best to speed the parting guest with a shower of little shrill barks that seemed to tread on one anothers heels what is a dogs business laughed sylvie dogs cant keep shops and give change sisters businesses isnt to laugh at their brothers bruno replied with perfect gravity and dogs businesses is to barknot like that it should finish one bark before it begins another and it shouldoh sylvie theres some dindledums and in another moment the happy children were flying across the common racing for the patch of dandelions while i stood watching them a strange dreamy feeling came upon me a railway platform seemed to take the place of the green sward and instead of the light figure of sylvie bounding along i seemed to see the flying form of lady muriel but whether bruno had also undergone a transformation and had become the old man whom she was running to overtake i was unable to judge so instantaneously did the feeling come and go when i re entered the little sitting room which i shared with arthur he was standing with his back to me looking out of the open window and evidently had not heard me enter a cup of tea apparently just tasted and pushed aside stood on the table on the opposite side of which was a letter just begun with the pen lying across it an open book lay on the sofa the london paper occupied the easy chair and on the little table which stood by it i noticed an unlighted cigar and an open box of cigar lights all things betokened that the doctor usually so methodical and so self contained had been trying every form of occupation and could settle to none this is very unlike you doctor i was beginning but checked myself as he turned at the sound of my voice in sheer amazement at the wonderful change that had taken place in his appearance never had i seen a face so radiant with happiness or eyes that sparkled with such unearthly light even thus i thought must the herald angel have looked who brought to the shepherds watching over their flocks by night that sweet message of peace on earth good will to men yes dear friend he said as if in answer to the question that i suppose he read in my face it is true it is true no need to ask what was true god bless you both i said as i felt the happy tears brimming to my eyes you were made for each other yes he said simply i believe we were and what a change it makes in ones life this isnt the same world that isnt the sky i saw yesterday those cloudsi never saw such clouds in all my life before they look like troops of hovering angels to me they looked very ordinary clouds indeed but then i had not fed on honey dew and drunk the milk of paradise she wants to see youat once he continued descending suddenly to the things of earth she says that is the one drop yet wanting in her cup of happiness ill go at once i said as i turned to leave the room wont you come with me no sir said the doctor with a sudden effortwhich proved an utter failureto resume his professional manner do i look like coming with you have you never heard that two is company and yes i said i have heard it and im painfully aware that i am number three but when shall we three meet again when the hurly burlys done he answered with a happy laugh such as i had not heard from him for many a year chapter vii mein herr so i went on my lonely way and on reaching the hall i found lady muriel standing at the garden gate waiting for me no need to give you joy or to wish you joy i began none whatever she replied with the joyous laugh of a child we give people what they havent got we wish for something that is yet to come for me its all here its all mine dear friend she suddenly broke off do you think heaven ever begins on earth for any of us for some i said for some perhaps who are simple and childlike you know he said of such is the kingdom of heaven lady muriel clasped her hands and gazed up into the cloudless sky with a look i had often seen in sylvies eyes i feel as if it had begun for me she almost whispered i feel as if i were one of the happy children whom he bid them bring near to him though the people would have kept them back yes he has seen me in the throng he has read the wistful longing in my eyes he has beckoned me to him they have had to make way for me he has taken me up in his arms he has put his hands upon me and blessed me she paused breathless in her perfect happiness yes i said i think he has you must come and speak to my father she went on as we stood side by side at the gate looking down the shady lane but even as she said the words the eerie sensation came over me like a flood i saw the dear old professor approaching us and also saw what was stranger still that he was visible to lady muriel what was to be done had the fairy life been merged in the real life or was lady muriel eerie also and thus able to enter into the fairy world along with me the words were on my lips i see an old friend of mine in the lane if you dont know him may i introduce him to you when the strangest thing of all happened lady muriel spoke i see an old friend of mine in the lane she said if you dont know him may i introduce him to you i seemed to wake out of a dream for the eerie feeling was still strong upon me and the figure outside seemed to be changing at every moment like one of the shapes in a kaleidoscope now he was the professor and now he was somebody else by the time he had reached the gate he certainly was somebody else and i felt that the proper course was for lady muriel not for me to introduce him she greeted him kindly and opening the gate admitted the venerable old mana german obviouslywho looked about him with dazed eyes as if he too had but just awaked from a dream no it was certainly not the professor my old friend could not have grown that magnificent beard since last we met moreover he would have recognised me for i was certain that i had not changed much in the time as it was he simply looked at me vaguely and took off his hat in response to lady muriels words let me introduce mein herr to you while in the words spoken in a strong german accent proud to make your acquaintance sir i could detect no trace of an idea that we had ever met before lady muriel led us to the well known shady nook where preparations for afternoon tea had already been made and while she went in to look for the earl we seated ourselves in two easy chairs and mein herr took up lady muriels work and examined it through his large spectacles one of the adjuncts that made him so provokingly like the professor hemming pocket handkerchiefs he said musingly so that is what the english miladies occupy themselves with is it it is the one accomplishment i said in which man has never yet rivaled woman here lady muriel returned with her father and after he had exchanged some friendly words with mein herr and we had all been supplied with the needful creature comforts the newcomer returned to the suggestive subject of pocket handkerchiefs you have heard of fortunatuss purse miladi ah so would you be surprised to hear that with three of these leetle handkerchiefs you shall make the purse of fortunatus quite soon quite easily shall i indeed lady muriel eagerly replied as she took a heap of them into her lap and threaded her needle please tell me how mein herr ill make one before i touch another drop of tea you shall first said mein herr possessing himself of two of the handkerchiefs spreading one upon the other and holding them up by two corners you shall first join together these upper corners the right to the right the left to the left and the opening between them shall be the mouth of the purse a very few stitches sufficed to carry out this direction now if i sew the other three edges together she suggested the bag is complete not so miladi the lower edges shall first be joinedah not so as she was beginning to sew them together turn one of them over and join the right lower corner of the one to the left lower corner of the other and sew the lower edges together in what you would call the wrong way i see said lady muriel as she deftly executed the order and a very twisted uncomfortable uncanny looking bag it makes but the moral is a lovely one unlimited wealth can only be attained by doing things in the wrong way and how are we to join up these mysteriousno i mean this mysterious opening twisting the thing round and round with a puzzled air yes it is one opening i thought it was two at first you have seen the puzzle of the paper ring mein herr said addressing the earl where you take a slip of paper and join its ends together first twisting one so as to join the upper corner of one end to the lower corner of the other i saw one made only yesterday the earl replied muriel my child were you not making one to amuse those children you had to tea yes i know that puzzle said lady muriel the ring has only one surface and only one edge its very mysterious the bag is just like that isnt it i suggested is not the outer surface of one side of it continuous with the inner surface of the other side so it is she exclaimed only it isnt a bag just yet how shall we fill up this opening mein herr thus said the old man impressively taking the bag from her and rising to his feet in the excitement of the explanation the edge of the opening consists of four handkerchief edges and you can trace it continuously round and round the opening down the right edge of one handkerchief up the left edge of the other and then down the left edge of the one and up the right edge of the other so you can lady muriel murmured thoughtfully leaning her head on her hand and earnestly watching the old man and that proves it to be only one opening illustration fortunatus purse she looked so strangely like a child puzzling over a difficult lesson and mein herr had become for the moment so strangely like the old professor that i felt utterly bewildered the eerie feeling was on me in its full force and i felt almost impelled to say do you understand it sylvie however i checked myself by a great effort and let the dream if indeed it was a dream go on to its end now this third handkerchief mein herr proceeded has also four edges which you can trace continuously round and round all you need do is to join its four edges to the four edges of the opening the purse is then complete and its outer surface i see lady muriel eagerly interrupted its outer surface will be continuous with its inner surface but it will take time ill sew it up after tea she laid aside the bag and resumed her cup of tea but why do you call it fortunatuss purse mein herr the dear old man beamed upon her with a jolly smile looking more exactly like the professor than ever dont you see my childi should say miladi whatever is inside that purse is outside it and whatever is outside it is inside it so you have all the wealth of the world in that leetle purse his pupil clapped her hands in unrestrained delight ill certainly sew the third handkerchief insome time she said but i wont take up your time by trying it now tell us some more wonderful things please and her face and her voice so exactly recalled sylvie that i could not help glancing round half expecting to see bruno also mein herr began thoughtfully balancing his spoon on the edge of his teacup while he pondered over this request something wonderfullike fortunatuss purse that will give youwhen it is madewealth beyond your wildest dreams but it will not give you time a pause of silence ensuedutilised by lady muriel for the very practical purpose of refilling the teacups in your country mein herr began with a startling abruptness what becomes of all the wasted time lady muriel looked grave who can tell she half whispered to herself all one knows is that it is gonepast recall well in myi mean in a country i have visited said the old man they store it up and it comes in very useful years afterwards for example suppose you have a long tedious evening before you nobody to talk to nothing you care to do and yet hours too soon to go to bed how do you behave then i get very cross she frankly admitted and i want to throw things about the room when that happens toto the people i have visited they never act so by a short and simple processwhich i cannot explain to youthey store up the useless hours and on some other occasion when they happen to need extra time they get them out again the earl was listening with a slightly incredulous smile why cannot you explain the process he enquired mein herr was ready with a quite unanswerable reason because you have no words in your language to convey the ideas which are needed i could explain it ininbut you would not understand it no indeed said lady muriel graciously dispensing with the name of the unknown language i never learnt itat least not to speak it fluently you know please tell us some more wonderful things they run their railway trains without any enginesnothing is needed but machinery to stop them with is that wonderful enough miladi but where does the force come from i ventured to ask mein herr turned quickly round to look at the new speaker then he took off his spectacles and polished them and looked at me again in evident bewilderment i could see he was thinkingas indeed i was alsothat we must have met before they use the force of gravity he said it is a force known also in your country i believe but that would need a railway going down hill the earl remarked you cant have all your railways going down hill they all do said mein herr not from both ends from both ends then i give it up said the earl can you explain the process said lady muriel without using that language that i cant speak fluently easily said mein herr each railway is in a long tunnel perfectly straight so of course the middle of it is nearer the centre of the globe than the two ends so every train runs half way down hill and that gives it force enough to run the other half up hill thank you i understand that perfectly said lady muriel but the velocity in the middle of the tunnel must be something fearful mein herr was evidently much gratified at the intelligent interest lady muriel took in his remarks at every moment the old man seemed to grow more chatty and more fluent you would like to know our methods of driving he smilingly enquired to us a run away horse is of no import at all lady muriel slightly shuddered to us it is a very real danger she said that is because your carriage is wholly behind your horse your horse runs your carriage follows perhaps your horse has the bit in his teeth who shall stop him you fly ever faster and faster finally comes the inevitable upset but suppose your horse manages to get the bit in his teeth no matter we would not concern ourselves our horse is harnessed in the very centre of our carriage two wheels are in front of him and two behind to the roof is attached one end of a broad belt this goes under the horses body and the other end is attached to a leetlewhat you call a windlass i think the horse takes the bit in his teeth he runs away we are flying at ten miles an hour we turn our little windlass five turns six turns seven turns andpoof our horse is off the ground now let him gallop in the air as much as he pleases our carriage stands still we sit round him and watch him till he is tired then we let him down our horse is glad very much glad when his feet once more touch the ground capital said the earl who had been listening attentively are there any other peculiarities in your carriages in the wheels sometimes my lord for your health you go to sea to be pitched to be rolled occasionally to be drowned we do all that on land we are pitched as you we are rolled as you but drowned no there is no water what are the wheels like then they are oval my lord therefore the carriages rise and fall yes and pitch the carriage backwards and forwards but how do they make it roll they do not match my lord the end of one wheel answers to the side of the opposite wheel so first one side of the carriage rises then the other and it pitches all the while ah you must be a good sailor to drive in our boat carriages i can easily believe it said the earl mein herr rose to his feet i must leave you now miladi he said consulting his watch i have another engagement i only wish we had stored up some extra time lady muriel said as she shook hands with him then we could have kept you a little longer in that case i would gladly stay replied mein herr as it isi fear i must say good bye where did you first meet him i asked lady muriel when mein herr had left us and where does he live and what is his real name we firstmethim she musingly replied really i cant remember where and ive no idea where he lives and i never heard any other name its very curious it never occurred to me before to consider what a mystery he is i hope we shall meet again i said he interests me very much he will be at our farewell party this day fortnight said the earl of course you will come muriel is anxious to gather all our friends around us once more before we leave the place and then he explained to meas lady muriel had left us togetherthat he was so anxious to get his daughter away from a place full of so many painful memories connected with the now canceled engagement with major lindon that they had arranged to have the wedding in a months time after which arthur and his wife were to go on a foreign tour dont forget tuesday week he said as we shook hands at parting i only wish you could bring with you those charming children that you introduced to us in the summer talk of the mystery of mein herr thats nothing to the mystery that seems to attend them i shall never forget those marvellous flowers i will bring them if i possibly can i said but how to fulfil such a promise i mused to myself on my way back to our lodgings was a problem entirely beyond my skill chapter viii in a shady place the ten days glided swiftly away and the day before the great party was to take place arthur proposed that we should stroll down to the hall in time for afternoon tea hadnt you better go alone i suggested surely i shall be very much de trop well itll be a kind of experiment he said fiat experimentum in corpore vili he added with a graceful bow of mock politeness towards the unfortunate victim you see i shall have to bear the sight to morrow night of my lady love making herself agreable to everybody except the right person and i shall bear the agony all the better if we have a dress rehearsal beforehand my part in the play being apparently that of the sample wrong person well no arthur said musingly as we set forth theres no such part in a regular company heavy father that wont do thats filled already singing chambermaid well the first lady doubles that part comic old man youre not comic enough after all im afraid theres no part for you but the well dressed villain only with a critical side glance im a leetle uncertain about the dress we found lady muriel alone the earl having gone out to make a call and at once resumed old terms of intimacy in the shady arbour where the tea things seemed to be always waiting the only novelty in the arrangements one which lady muriel seemed to regard as entirely a matter of course was that two of the chairs were placed quite close together side by side strange to say i was not invited to occupy either of them we have been arranging as we came along about letter writing arthur began he will want to know how were enjoying our swiss tour and of course we must pretend we are of course she meekly assented and the skeleton in the cupboard i suggested is always a difficulty she quickly put in when youre traveling about and when there are no cupboards in the hotels however ours is a very portable one and will be neatly packed in a nice leather case but please dont think about writing i said when youve anything more attractive on hand i delight in reading letters but i know well how tiring it is to write them it is sometimes arthur assented for instance when youre very shy of the person you have to write to does that show itself in the letter lady muriel enquired of course when i hear any one talkingyou for instancei can see how desperately shy he is but can you see that in a letter well of course when you hear any one talk fluentlyyou for instanceyou can see how desperately un shy she isnot to say saucy but the shyest and most intermittent talker must seem fluent in letter writing he may have taken half an hour to compose his second sentence but there it is close after the first then letters dont express all that they might express thats merely because our system of letter writing is incomplete a shy writer ought to be able to show that he is so why shouldnt he make pauses in writing just as he would do in speaking he might leave blank spacessay half a page at a time and a very shy girlif there is such a thingmight write a sentence on the first sheet of her letterthen put in a couple of blank sheetsthen a sentence on the fourth sheet and so on i quite foresee that wei mean this clever little boy and myself lady muriel said to me evidently with the kind wish to bring me into the conversation are going to become famousof course all our inventions are common property nowfor a new code of rules for letter writing please invent some more little boy well another thing greatly needed little girl is some way of expressing that we dont mean anything explain yourself little boy surely you can find no difficulty in expressing a total absence of meaning i mean that you should be able when you dont mean a thing to be taken seriously to express that wish for human nature is so constituted that whatever you write seriously is taken as a joke and whatever you mean as a joke is taken seriously at any rate it is so in writing to a lady ah youre not used to writing to ladies lady muriel remarked leaning back in her chair and gazing thoughtfully into the sky you should try very good said arthur how many ladies may i begin writing to as many as i can count on the fingers of both hands as many as you can count on the thumbs of one hand his lady love replied with much severity what a very naughty little boy he is isnt he with an appealing glance at me hes a little fractious i said perhaps hes cutting a tooth while to myself i said how exactly like sylvie talking to bruno he wants his tea the naughty little boy volunteered the information hes getting very tired at the mere prospect of the great party to morrow then he shall have a good rest beforehand she soothingly replied the tea isnt made yet come little boy lean well back in your chair and think about nothingor about me whichever you prefer all the same all the same arthur sleepily murmured watching her with loving eyes as she moved her chair away to the tea table and began to make the tea then hell wait for his tea like a good patient little boy shall i bring you the london papers said lady muriel i saw them lying on the table as i came out but my father said there was nothing in them except that horrid murder trial society was just then enjoying its daily thrill of excitement in studying the details of a specially sensational murder in a thieves den in the east of london i have no appetite for horrors arthur replied but i hope we have learned the lesson they should teach usthough we are very apt to read it backwards illustration i am sitting at your feet you speak in riddles said lady muriel please explain yourself see now suiting the action to the word i am sitting at your feet just as if you were a second gamaliel thanks no this was to me who had risen to bring her chair back to its former place pray dont disturb yourself this tree and the grass make a very nice easy chair what is the lesson that one always reads wrong arthur was silent for a minute i would like to be clear what it is i mean he said slowly and thoughtfully before i say anything to youbecause you think about it anything approaching to a compliment was so unusual an utterance for arthur that it brought a flush of pleasure to her cheek as she replied it is you that give me the ideas to think about ones first thought arthur proceeded in reading of anything specially vile or barbarous as done by a fellow creature is apt to be that we see a new depth of sin revealed beneath us and we seem to gaze down into that abyss from some higher ground far apart from it i think i understand you now you mean that one ought to thinknot god i thank thee that i am not as other men arebut god be merciful to me also who might be but for thy grace a sinner as vile as he no said arthur i meant a great deal more than that she looked up quickly but checked herself and waited in silence one must begin further back i think think of some other man the same age as this poor wretch look back to the time when they both began lifebefore they had sense enough to know right from wrong then at any rate they were equal in gods sight she nodded assent we have then two distinct epochs at which we may contemplate the two men whose lives we are comparing at the first epoch they are so far as moral responsibility is concerned on precisely the same footing they are alike incapable of doing right or wrong at the second epoch the one mani am taking an extreme case for contrasthas won the esteem and love of all around him his character is stainless and his name will be held in honour hereafter the other mans history is one unvaried record of crime and his life is at last forfeited to the outraged laws of his country now what have been the causes in each case of each mans condition being what it is at the second epoch they are of two kindsone acting from within the other from without these two kinds need to be discussed separatelythat is if i have not already tired you with my prosing on the contrary said lady muriel it is a special delight to me to have a question discussed in this wayanalysed and arranged so that one can understand it some books that profess to argue out a question are to me intolerably wearisome simply because the ideas are all arranged hap hazarda sort of first come first served you are very encouraging arthur replied with a pleased look the causes acting from within which make a mans character what it is at any given moment are his successive acts of volitionthat is his acts of choosing whether he will do this or that we are to assume the existence of free will i said in order to have that point made quite clear if not was the quiet reply cadit quaestio and i have no more to say we will assume it the rest of the audiencethe majority i may say looking at it from arthurs point of viewimperiously proclaimed the orator proceeded the causes acting from without are his surroundingswhat mr herbert spencer calls his environment now the point i want to make clear is this that a man is responsible for his acts of choosing but not responsible for his environment hence if these two men make on some given occasion when they are exposed to equal temptation equal efforts to resist and to choose the right their condition in the sight of god must be the same if he is pleased in the one case so will he be in the other if displeased in the one case so also in the other that is so no doubt i see it quite clearly lady muriel put in and yet owing to their different environments the one may win a great victory over the temptation while the other falls into some black abyss of crime but surely you would not say those men were equally guilty in the sight of god either that said arthur or else i must give up my belief in gods perfect justice but let me put one more case which will show my meaning even more forcibly let the one man be in a high social positionthe other say a common thief let the one be tempted to some trivial act of unfair dealingsomething which he can do with the absolute certainty that it will never be discoveredsomething which he can with perfect ease forbear from doingand which he distinctly knows to be a sin let the other be tempted to some terrible crimeas men would consider itbut under an almost overwhelming pressure of motivesof course not quite overwhelming as that would destroy all responsibility now in this case let the second man make a greater effort at resistance than the first also suppose both to fall under the temptationi say that the second man is in gods sight less guilty than the other lady muriel drew a long breath it upsets all ones ideas of right and wrongjust at first why in that dreadful murder trial you would say i suppose that it was possible that the least guilty man in the court was the murderer and that possibly the judge who tried him by yielding to the temptation of making one unfair remark had committed a crime outweighing the criminals whole career certainly i should arthur firmly replied it sounds like a paradox i admit but just think what a grievous sin it must be in gods sight to yield to some very slight temptation which we could have resisted with perfect ease and to do it deliberately and in the full light of gods law what penance can atone for a sin like that i cant reject your theory i said but how it seems to widen the possible area of sin in the world is that so lady muriel anxiously enquired oh not so not so was the eager reply to me it seems to clear away much of the cloud that hangs over the worlds history when this view first made itself clear to me i remember walking out into the fields repeating to myself that line of tennyson there seemed no room for sense of wrong the thought that perhaps the real guilt of the human race was infinitely less than i fancied itthat the millions whom i had thought of as sunk in hopeless depths of sin were perhaps in gods sight scarcely sinning at allwas more sweet than words can tell life seemed more bright and beautiful when once that thought had come a livelier emerald twinkles in the grass a purer sapphire melts into the sea his voice trembled as he concluded and the tears stood in his eyes lady muriel shaded her face with her hand and was silent for a minute it is a beautiful thought she said looking up at last thank youarthur for putting it into my head the earl returned in time to join us at tea and to give us the very unwelcome tidings that a fever had broken out in the little harbour town that lay below usa fever of so malignant a type that though it had only appeared a day or two ago there were already more than a dozen down in it two or three of whom were reported to be in imminent danger in answer to the eager questions of arthurwho of course took a deep scientific interest in the matterhe could give very few technical details though he had met the local doctor it appeared however that it was an almost new diseaseat least in this century though it might prove to be identical with the plague recorded in historyvery infectious and frightfully rapid in its action it will not however prevent our party to morrow he said in conclusion none of the guests belong to the infected district which is as you know exclusively peopled by fishermen so you may come without any fear arthur was very silent all the way back and on reaching our lodgings immediately plunged into medical studies connected with the alarming malady of whose arrival we had just heard chapter ix the farewell party on the following day arthur and i reached the hall in good time as only a few of the guestsit was to be a party of eighteenhad as yet arrived and these were talking with the earl leaving us the opportunity of a few words apart with our hostess who is that very learned looking man with the large spectacles arthur enquired i havent met him here before have i no hes a new friend of ours said lady muriel a german i believe he is such a dear old thing and quite the most learned man i ever metwith one exception of course she added humbly as arthur drew himself up with an air of offended dignity and the young lady in blue just beyond him talking to that foreign looking man is she learned too i dont know said lady muriel but im told shes a wonderful piano forte player i hope youll hear her to night i asked that foreigner to take her in because hes very musical too hes a french count i believe and he sings splendidly sciencemusicsingingyou have indeed got a complete party said arthur i feel quite a privileged person meeting all these stars i do love music but the party isnt quite complete said lady muriel you havent brought us those two beautiful children she went on turning to me he brought them here to tea you know one day last summer again addressing arthur and they are such darlings they are indeed i assented but why havent you brought them with you you promised my father you would im very sorry i said but really it was impossible to bring them with me here i most certainly meant to conclude the sentence and it was with a feeling of utter amazement which i cannot adequately describe that i heard myself going on speaking but they are to join me here in the course of the evening were the words uttered in my voice and seeming to come from my lips im so glad lady muriel joyfully replied i shall enjoy introducing them to some of my friends here when do you expect them i took refuge in silence the only honest reply would have been that was not my remark i didnt say it and it isnt true but i had not the moral courage to make such a confession the character of a lunatic is not i believe very difficult to acquire but it is amazingly difficult to get rid of and it seemed quite certain that any such speech as that would quite justify the issue of a writ de lunatico inquirendo lady muriel evidently thought i had failed to hear her question and turned to arthur with a remark on some other subject and i had time to recover from my shock of surpriseor to awake out of my momentary eerie condition whichever it was when things around me seemed once more to be real arthur was saying im afraid theres no help for it they must be finite in number i should be sorry to have to believe it said lady muriel yet when one comes to think of it there are no new melodies now a days what people talk of as the last new song always recalls to me some tune ive known as a child the day must comeif the world lasts long enough said arthur when every possible tune will have been composedevery possible pun perpetrated lady muriel wrung her hands like a tragedy queen and worse than that every possible book written for the number of words is finite itll make very little difference to the authors i suggested instead of saying what book shall i write an author will ask himself which book shall i write a mere verbal distinction lady muriel gave me an approving smile but lunatics would always write new books surely she went on they couldnt write the sane books over again true said arthur but their books would come to an end also the number of lunatic books is as finite as the number of lunatics and that number is becoming greater every year said a pompous man whom i recognised as the self appointed showman on the day of the picnic so they say replied arthur and when ninety per cent of us are lunatics he seemed to be in a wildly nonsensical mood the asylums will be put to their proper use and that is the pompous man gravely enquired to shelter the sane said arthur we shall bar ourselves in the lunatics will have it all their own way outside theyll do it a little queerly no doubt railway collisions will be always happening steamers always blowing up most of the towns will be burnt down most of the ships sunk and most of the men killed murmured the pompous man who was evidently hopelessly bewildered certainly arthur assented till at last there will be fewer lunatics than sane men then we come out they go in and things return to their normal condition the pompous man frowned darkly and bit his lip and folded his arms vainly trying to think it out he is jesting he muttered to himself at last in a tone of withering contempt as he stalked away by this time the other guests had arrived and dinner was announced arthur of course took down lady muriel and i was pleased to find myself seated at her other side with a severe looking old lady whom i had not met before and whose name i had as is usual in introductions entirely failed to catch merely gathering that it sounded like a compound name as my partner for the banquet she appeared however to be acquainted with arthur and confided to me in a low voice her opinion that he was a very argumentative young man arthur for his part seemed well inclined to show himself worthy of the character she had given him and hearing her say i never take wine with my soup this was not a confidence to me but was launched upon society as a matter of general interest he at once challenged a combat by asking her when would you say that property commence in a plate of soup this is my soup she sternly replied and what is before you is yours no doubt said arthur but when did i begin to own it up to the moment of its being put into the plate it was the property of our host while being offered round the table it was let us say held in trust by the waiter did it become mine when i accepted it or when it was placed before me or when i took the first spoonful he is a very argumentative young man was all the old lady would say but she said it audibly this time feeling that society had a right to know it arthur smiled mischievously i shouldnt mind betting you a shilling he said that the eminent barrister next you it certainly is possible to say words so as to make them begin with capitals cant answer me i never bet she sternly replied not even sixpenny points at whist never she repeated whist is innocent enough but whist played for money she shuddered arthur became serious again im afraid i cant take that view he said i consider that the introduction of small stakes for card playing was one of the most moral acts society ever did as society how was it so said lady muriel because it took cards once for all out of the category of games at which cheating is possible look at the way croquet is demoralising society ladies are beginning to cheat at it terribly and if theyre found out they only laugh and call it fun but when theres money at stake that is out of the question the swindler is not accepted as a wit when a man sits down to cards and cheats his friends out of their money he doesnt get much fun out of itunless he thinks it fun to be kicked down stairs if all gentlemen thought as badly of ladies as you do my neighbour remarked with some bitterness there would be very fewvery few she seemed doubtful how to end her sentence but at last took honeymoons as a safe word on the contrary said arthur the mischievous smile returning to his face if only people would adopt my theory the number of honeymoonsquite of a new kindwould be greatly increased may we hear about this new kind of honeymoon said lady muriel let x be the gentleman arthur began in a slightly raised voice as he now found himself with an audience of six including mein herr who was seated at the other side of my polynomial partner let x be the gentleman and y the lady to whom he thinks of proposing he applies for an experimental honeymoon it is granted forthwith the young coupleaccompanied by the great aunt of y to act as chaperonestart for a months tour during which they have many a moonlight walk and many a tte tte conversation and each can form a more correct estimate of the others character in four weeks than would have been possible in as many years when meeting under the ordinary restrictions of society and it is only after their return that x finally decides whether he will or will not put the momentous question to y in nine cases out of ten the pompous man proclaimed he would decide to break it off then in nine cases out of ten arthur rejoined an unsuitable match would be prevented and both parties saved from misery the only really unsuitable matches the old lady remarked are those made without sufficient money love may come afterwards money is needed to begin with this remark was cast loose upon society as a sort of general challenge and as such it was at once accepted by several of those within hearing money became the key note of the conversation for some time and a fitful echo of it was again heard when the dessert had been placed upon the table the servants had left the room and the earl had started the wine in its welcome progress round the table im very glad to see you keep up the old customs i said to lady muriel as i filled her glass its really delightful to experience once more the peaceful feeling that comes over one when the waiters have left the roomwhen one can converse without the feeling of being overheard and without having dishes constantly thrust over ones shoulder how much more sociable it is to be able to pour out the wine for the ladies and to hand the dishes to those who wish for them in that case kindly send those peaches down here said a fat red faced man who was seated beyond our pompous friend ive been wishing for themdiagonallyfor some time yes it is a ghastly innovation lady muriel replied letting the waiters carry round the wine at dessert for one thing they always take it the wrong way roundwhich of course brings bad luck to everybody present better go the wrong way than not go at all said our host would you kindly help yourself this was to the fat red faced man you are not a teetotaler i think indeed but i am he replied as he pushed on the bottles nearly twice as much money is spent in england on drink as on any other article of food read this card what faddist ever goes about without a pocketful of the appropriate literature the stripes of different colours represent the amounts spent on various articles of food look at the highest three money spent on butter and on cheese thirty five millions on bread seventy millions on intoxicating liquors one hundred and thirty six millions if i had my way i would close every public house in the land look at that card and read the motto thats where all the money goes to have you seen the anti teetotal card arthur innocently enquired no sir i have not the orator savagely replied what is it like almost exactly like this one the coloured stripes are the same only instead of the words money spent on it has incomes derived from sale of and instead of thats where all the money goes to its motto is thats where all the money comes from the red faced man scowled but evidently considered arthur beneath his notice so lady muriel took up the cudgels do you hold the theory she enquired that people can preach teetotalism more effectually by being teetotalers themselves certainly i do replied the red faced man now here is a case in point unfolding a newspaper cutting let me read you this letter from a teetotaler to the editor sir i was once a moderate drinker and knew a man who drank to excess i went to him give up this drink i said it will ruin your health you drink he said why shouldnt i yes i said but i know when to leave off he turned away from me you drink in your way he said let me drink in mine be off then i saw that to do any good with him i must forswear drink from that hour i havent touched a drop there what do you say to that he looked round triumphantly while the cutting was handed round for inspection how very curious exclaimed arthur when it had reached him did you happen to see a letter last week about early rising it was strangely like this one the red faced mans curiosity was roused where did it appear he asked let me read it to you said arthur he took some papers from his pocket opened one of them and read as follows to the editor sir i was once a moderate sleeper and knew a man who slept to excess i pleaded with him give up this lying in bed i said it will ruin your health you go to bed he said why shouldnt i yes i said but i know when to get up in the morning he turned away from me you sleep in your way he said let me sleep in mine be off then i saw that to do any good with him i must forswear sleep from that hour i havent been to bed arthur folded and pocketed his paper and passed on the newspaper cutting none of us dared to laugh the red faced man was evidently so angry your parallel doesnt run on all fours he snarled moderate drinkers never do so arthur quietly replied even the stern old lady laughed at this but it needs many other things to make a perfect dinner said lady muriel evidently anxious to change the subject mein herr what is your idea of a perfect dinner party the old man looked round smilingly and his gigantic spectacles seemed more gigantic than ever a perfect dinner party he repeated first it must be presided over by our present hostess that of course she gaily interposed but what else mein herr i can but tell you what i have seen said mein herr in mine ownin the country i have traveled in he paused for a full minute and gazed steadily at the ceilingwith so dreamy an expression on his face that i feared he was going off into a reverie which seemed to be his normal state however after a minute he suddenly began again that which chiefly causes the failure of a dinner party is the running shortnot of meat nor yet of drink but of conversation in an english dinner party i remarked i have never known small talk run short pardon me mein herr respectfully replied i did not say small talk i said conversation all such topics as the weather or politics or local gossip are unknown among us they are either vapid or controversial what we need for conversation is a topic of interest and of novelty to secure these things we have tried various plansmoving pictures wild creatures moving guests and a revolving humorist but this last is only adapted to small parties let us have it in four separate chapters please said lady muriel who was evidently deeply interestedas indeed most of the party were by this time and all down the table talk had ceased and heads were leaning forwards eager to catch fragments of mein herrs oration chapter one moving pictures was proclaimed in the silvery voice of our hostess the dining table is shaped like a circular ring mein herr began in low dreamy tones which however were perfectly audible in the silence the guests are seated at the inner side as well as the outer having ascended to their places by a winding staircase from the room below along the middle of the table runs a little railway and there is an endless train of trucks worked round by machinery and on each truck there are two pictures leaning back to back the train makes two circuits during dinner and when it has been once round the waiters turn the pictures round in each truck making them face the other way thus every guest sees every picture he paused and the silence seemed deader than ever lady muriel looked aghast really if this goes on she exclaimed i shall have to drop a pin oh its my fault is it in answer to an appealing look from mein herr i was forgetting my duty chapter two wild creatures we found the moving pictures a little monotonous said mein herr people didnt care to talk art through a whole dinner so we tried wild creatures among the flowers which we laid just as you do about the table were to be seen here a mouse there a beetle here a spider lady muriel shuddered there a wasp here a toad there a snake father said lady muriel plaintively did you hear that so we had plenty to talk about and when you got stung the old lady began they were all chained up dear madam and the old lady gave a satisfied nod there was no silence to follow this time third chapter lady muriel proclaimed at once moving guests even the wild creatures proved monotonous the orator proceeded so we left the guests to choose their own subjects and to avoid monotony we changed them we made the table of two rings and the inner ring moved slowly round all the time along with the floor in the middle and the inner row of guests thus every inner guest was brought face to face with every outer guest it was a little confusing sometimes to have to begin a story to one friend and finish it to another but every plan has its faults you know fourth chapter lady muriel hastened to announce the revolving humorist for a small party we found it an excellent plan to have a round table with a hole cut in the middle large enough to hold one guest here we placed our best talker he revolved slowly facing every other guest in turn and he told lively anecdotes the whole time i shouldnt like it murmured the pompous man it would make me giddy revolving like that i should decline to here it appeared to dawn upon him that perhaps the assumption he was making was not warranted by the circumstances he took a hasty gulp of wine and choked himself but mein herr had relapsed into reverie and made no further remark lady muriel gave the signal and the ladies left the room chapter x jabbering and jam when the last lady had disappeared and the earl taking his place at the head of the table had issued the military order gentlemen close up the ranks if you please and when in obedience to his command we had gathered ourselves compactly round him the pompous man gave a deep sigh of relief filled his glass to the brim pushed on the wine and began one of his favorite orations they are charming no doubt charming but very frivolous they drag us down so to speak to a lower level they do not all pronouns require antecedent nouns the earl gently enquired pardon me said the pompous man with lofty condescension i had overlooked the noun the ladies we regret their absence yet we console ourselves thought is free with them we are limited to trivial topicsart literature politics and so forth one can bear to discuss such paltry matters with a lady but no man in his senses he looked sternly round the table as if defying contradiction ever yet discussed wine with a lady he sipped his glass of port leaned back in his chair and slowly raised it up to his eye so as to look through it at the lamp the vintage my lord he enquired glancing at his host the earl named the date so i had supposed but one likes to be certain the tint is perhaps slightly pale but the body is unquestionable and as for the bouquet ah that magic bouquet how vividly that single word recalled the scene the little beggar boy turning his somersault in the roadthe sweet little crippled maiden in my armsthe mysterious evanescent nurse maidall rushed tumultuously into my mind like the creatures of a dream and through this mental haze there still boomed on like the tolling of a bell the solemn voice of the great connoisseur of wine even his utterances had taken on themselves a strange and dream like form no he resumedand why is it i pause to ask that in taking up the broken thread of a dialogue one always begins with this cheerless monosyllable after much anxious thought i have come to the conclusion that the object in view is the same as that of the schoolboy when the sum he is working has got into a hopeless muddle and when in despair he takes the sponge washes it all out and begins again just in the same way the bewildered orator by the simple process of denying everything that has been hitherto asserted makes a clean sweep of the whole discussion and can start fair with a fresh theory no he resumed theres nothing like cherry jam after all thats what i say not for all qualities an eager little man shrilly interposed for richness of general tone i dont say that it has a rival but for delicacy of modulationfor what one may call the harmonics of flavourgive me good old raspberry jam allow me one word the fat red faced man quite hoarse with excitement broke into the dialogue its too important a question to be settled by amateurs i can give you the views of a professionalperhaps the most experienced jam taster now living why ive known him fix the age of strawberry jam to a dayand we all know what a difficult jam it is to give a date toon a single tasting well i put to him the very question you are discussing his words were cherry jam is best for mere chiaroscuro of flavour raspberry jam lends itself best to those resolved discords that linger so lovingly on the tongue but for rapturous utterness of saccharine perfection its apricot jam first and the rest nowhere that was well put wasnt it consummately put shrieked the eager little man i know your friend well said the pompous man as a jam taster he has no rival yet i scarcely think but here the discussion became general and his words were lost in a confused medley of names every guest sounding the praises of his own favorite jam at length through the din our hosts voice made itself heard let us join the ladies these words seemed to recall me to waking life and i felt sure that for the last few minutes i had relapsed into the eerie state a strange dream i said to myself as we trooped upstairs grown men discussing as seriously as if they were matters of life and death the hopelessly trivial details of mere delicacies that appeal to no higher human function than the nerves of the tongue and palate what a humiliating spectacle such a discussion would be in waking life when on our way to the drawing room i received from the housekeeper my little friends clad in the daintiest of evening costumes and looking in the flush of expectant delight more radiantly beautiful than i had ever seen them before i felt no shock of surprise but accepted the fact with the same unreasoning apathy with which one meets the events of a dream and was merely conscious of a vague anxiety as to how they would acquit themselves in so novel a sceneforgetting that court life in outland was as good training as they could need for society in the more substantial world it would be best i thought to introduce them as soon as possible to some good natured lady guest and i selected the young lady whose piano forte playing had been so much talked of i am sure you like children i said may i introduce two little friends of mine this is sylvieand this is bruno the young lady kissed sylvie very graciously she would have done the same for bruno but he hastily drew back out of reach their faces are new to me she said where do you come from my dear i had not anticipated so inconvenient a question and fearing that it might embarrass sylvie i answered for her they come from some distance they are only here just for this one evening how far have you come dear the young lady persisted sylvie looked puzzled a mile or two i think she said doubtfully a mile or three said bruno you shouldnt say a mile or three sylvie corrected him the young lady nodded approval sylvies quite right it isnt usual to say a mile or three it would be usualif we said it often enough said bruno it was the young ladys turn to look puzzled now hes very quick for his age she murmured youre not more than seven are you dear she added aloud im not so many as that said bruno im one sylvies one sylvie and me is two sylvie taught me to count oh i wasnt counting you you know the young lady laughingly replied hasnt oo learnt to count said bruno the young lady bit her lip dear what embarrassing questions he does ask she said in a half audible aside bruno you shouldnt sylvie said reprovingly shouldnt what said bruno you shouldnt askthat sort of questions what sort of questions bruno mischievously persisted what she told you not sylvie replied with a shy glance at the young lady and losing all sense of grammar in her confusion oo cant pronounce it bruno triumphantly cried and he turned to the young lady for sympathy in his victory i knewed she couldnt pronounce umbrella sting the young lady thought it best to return to the arithmetical problem when i asked if you were seven you know i didnt mean how many children i meant how many years only got two ears said bruno nobodys got seven ears and you belong to this little girl the young lady continued skilfully evading the anatomical problem no i doosnt belong to her said bruno sylvie belongs to me and he clasped his arms round her as he added she are my very mine and do you know said the young lady ive a little sister at home exactly like your sister im sure theyd love each other theyd be very extremely useful to each other bruno said thoughtfully and they wouldnt want no looking glasses to brush their hair wiz why not my child why each one would do for the other ones looking glass a course cried bruno but here lady muriel who had been standing by listening to this bewildering dialogue interrupted it to ask if the young lady would favour us with some music and the children followed their new friend to the piano arthur came and sat down by me if rumour speaks truly he whispered we are to have a real treat and then amid a breathless silence the performance began she was one of those players whom society talks of as brilliant and she dashed into the loveliest of haydns symphonies in a style that was clearly the outcome of years of patient study under the best masters at first it seemed to be the perfection of piano forte playing but in a few minutes i began to ask myself wearily what is it that is wanting why does one get no pleasure from it then i set myself to listen intently to every note and the mystery explained itself there was an almost perfect mechanical correctnessand there was nothing else false notes of course did not occur she knew the piece too well for that but there was just enough irregularity of time to betray that the player had no real ear for musicjust enough inarticulateness in the more elaborate passages to show that she did not think her audience worth taking real pains forjust enough mechanical monotony of accent to take all soul out of the heavenly modulations she was profaningin short it was simply irritating and when she had rattled off the finale and had struck the final chord as if the instrument being now done with it didnt matter how many wires she broke i could not even affect to join in the stereotyped oh thank you which was chorused around me lady muriel joined us for a moment isnt it beautiful she whispered to arthur with a mischievous smile no it isnt said arthur but the gentle sweetness of his face quite neutralised the apparent rudeness of the reply such execution you know she persisted thats what she deserves arthur doggedly replied but people are so prejudiced against capital now youre beginning to talk nonsense lady muriel cried but you do like music dont you you said so just now do i like music the doctor repeated softly to himself my dear lady muriel there is music and music your question is painfully vague you might as well ask do you like people lady muriel bit her lip frowned and stamped with one tiny foot as a dramatic representation of ill temper it was distinctly not a success however it took in one of her audience and bruno hastened to interpose as peacemaker in a rising quarrel with the remark i likes peoples arthur laid a loving hand on the little curly head what all peoples he enquired not all peoples bruno explained only but sylvieand lady murieland him pointing to the earl and ooand oo you shouldnt point at people said sylvie its very rude in brunos world i said there are only four peopleworth mentioning in brunos world lady muriel repeated thoughtfully a bright and flowery world where the grass is always green where the breezes always blow softly and the rain clouds never gather where there are no wild beasts and no deserts there must be deserts arthur decisively remarked at least if it was my ideal world but what possible use is there in a desert said lady muriel surely you would have no wilderness in your ideal world arthur smiled but indeed i would he said a wilderness would be more necessary than a railway and far more conducive to general happiness than church bells but what would you use it for to practise music in he replied all the young ladies that have no ear for music but insist on learning it should be conveyed every morning two or three miles into the wilderness there each would find a comfortable room provided for her and also a cheap second hand piano forte on which she might play for hours without adding one needless pang to the sum of human misery lady muriel glanced round in alarm lest these barbarous sentiments should be overheard but the fair musician was at a safe distance at any rate you must allow that shes a sweet girl she resumed oh certainly as sweet as eau sucre if you chooseand nearly as interesting you are incorrigible said lady muriel and turned to me i hope you found mrs mills an interesting companion oh thats her name is it i said i fancied there was more of it so there is and it will be at your proper peril whatever that may mean if you ever presume to address her as mrs mills she is mrs ernestatkinsonmills she is one of those would be grandees said arthur who think that by tacking on to their surname all their spare christian names with hyphens between they can give it an aristocratic flavour as if it wasnt trouble enough to remember one surname by this time the room was getting crowded as the guests invited for the evening party were beginning to arrive and lady muriel had to devote herself to the task of welcoming them which she did with the sweetest grace imaginable sylvie and bruno stood by her deeply interested in the process i hope you like my friends she said to them specially my dear old friend mein herr whats become of him i wonder oh there he is that old gentleman in spectacles with a long beard hes a grand old gentleman sylvie said gazing admiringly at mein herr who had settled down in a corner from which his mild eyes beamed on us through a gigantic pair of spectacles and what a lovely beard what does he call his self bruno whispered he calls himself mein herr sylvie whispered in reply bruno shook his head impatiently thats what he calls his hair not his self oo silly he appealed to me what doos he call his self mister sir thats the only name i know of i said but he looks very lonely dont you pity his grey hairs i pities his self said bruno still harping on the misnomer but i doosnt pity his hair one bit his hair cant feel we met him this afternoon said sylvie wed been to see nero and wed had such fun with him making him invisible again and we saw that nice old gentleman as we came back well lets go and talk to him and cheer him up a little i said and perhaps we shall find out what he calls himself chapter xi the man in the moon the children came willingly with one of them on each side of me i approached the corner occupied by mein herr you dont object to children i hope i began crabbed age and youth cannot live together the old man cheerfully replied with a most genial smile now take a good look at me my children you would guess me to be an old man wouldnt you at first sight though his face had reminded me so mysteriously of the professor he had seemed to be decidedly a younger man but when i came to look into the wonderful depth of those large dreamy eyes i felt with a strange sense of awe that he was incalculably older he seemed to gaze at us out of some by gone age centuries away illustration mein herrs fairy friends i dont know if oore an old man bruno answered as the children won over by the gentle voice crept a little closer to him i thinks oore eighty three he is very exact said mein herr is he anything like right i said there are reasons mein herr gently replied reasons which i am not at liberty to explain for not mentioning definitely any persons places or dates one remark only i will permit myself to makethat the period of life between the ages of a hundred and sixty five and a hundred and seventy five is a specially safe one how do you make that out i said thus you would consider swimming to be a very safe amusement if you scarcely ever heard of any one dying of it am i not right in thinking that you never heard of any one dying between those two ages i see what you mean i said but im afraid you cant prove swimming to be safe on the same principle it is no uncommon thing to hear of some one being drowned in my country said mein herr no one is ever drowned is there no water deep enough plenty but we cant sink we are all lighter than water let me explain he added seeing my look of surprise suppose you desire a race of pigeons of a particular shape or colour do you not select from year to year those that are nearest to the shape or colour you want and keep those and part with the others we do i replied we call it artificial selection exactly so said mein herr well we have practised that for some centuriesconstantly selecting the lightest people so that now everybody is lighter than water then you never can be drowned at sea never it is only on the landfor instance when attending a play in a theatrethat we are in such a danger how can that happen at a theatre our theatres are all underground large tanks of water are placed above if a fire breaks out the taps are turned and in one minute the theatre is flooded up to the very roof thus the fire is extinguished and the audience i presume that is a minor matter mein herr carelessly replied but they have the comfort of knowing that whether drowned or not they are all lighter than water we have not yet reached the standard of making people lighter than air but we are aiming at it and in another thousand years or so what doos oo do wiz the peoples thats too heavy bruno solemnly enquired we have applied the same process mein herr continued not noticing brunos question to many other purposes we have gone on selecting walking sticksalways keeping those that walked besttill we have obtained some that can walk by themselves we have gone on selecting cotton wool till we have got some lighter than air youve no idea what a useful material it is we call it imponderal what do you use it for well chiefly for packing articles to go by parcel post it makes them weigh less than nothing you know and how do the post office people know what you have to pay thats the beauty of the new system mein herr cried exultingly they pay us we dont pay them ive often got as much as five shillings for sending a parcel but doesnt your government object well they do object a little they say it comes so expensive in the long run but the things as clear as daylight by their own rules if i send a parcel that weighs a pound more than nothing i pay three pence so of course if it weighs a pound less than nothing i ought to receive three pence it is indeed a useful article i said yet even imponderal has its disadvantages he resumed i bought some a few days ago and put it into my hat to carry it home and the hat simply floated away had oo some of that funny stuff in oor hat today bruno enquired sylvie and me saw oo in the road and oor hat were ever so high up werent it sylvie no that was quite another thing said mein herr there was a drop or two of rain falling so i put my hat on the top of my stickas an umbrella you know as i came along the road he continued turning to me i was overtaken by a shower of rain said bruno well it looked more like the tail of a dog mein herr replied it was the most curious thing something rubbed affectionately against my knee and i looked down and i could see nothing only about a yard off there was a dogs tail wagging all by itself oh sylvie bruno murmured reproachfully oo didnt finish making him visible im so sorry sylvie said looking very penitent i meant to rub it along his back but we were in such a hurry well go and finish him tomorrow poor thing perhaps hell get no supper tonight course he wont said bruno nobody never gives bones to a dogs tail mein herr looked from one to the other in blank astonishment i do not understand you he said i had lost my way and i was consulting a pocket map and somehow i had dropped one of my gloves and this invisible something that had rubbed against my knee actually brought it back to me course he did said bruno hes welly fond of fetching things mein herr looked so thoroughly bewildered that i thought it best to change the subject what a useful thing a pocket map is i remarked thats another thing weve learned from your nation said mein herr map making but weve carried it much further than you what do you consider the largest map that would be really useful about six inches to the mile only six inches exclaimed mein herr we very soon got to six yards to the mile then we tried a hundred yards to the mile and then came the grandest idea of all we actually made a map of the country on the scale of a mile to the mile have you used it much i enquired it has never been spread out yet said mein herr the farmers objected they said it would cover the whole country and shut out the sunlight so we now use the country itself as its own map and i assure you it does nearly as well now let me ask you another question what is the smallest world you would care to inhabit i know cried bruno who was listening intently id like a little teeny tiny world just big enough for sylvie and me then you would have to stand on opposite sides of it said mein herr and so you would never see your sister at all and id have no lessons said bruno you dont mean to say youve been trying experiments in that direction i said well not experiments exactly we do not profess to construct planets but a scientific friend of mine who has made several balloon voyages assures me he has visited a planet so small that he could walk right round it in twenty minutes there had been a great battle just before his visit which had ended rather oddly the vanquished army ran away at full speed and in a very few minutes found themselves face to face with the victorious army who were marching home again and who were so frightened at finding themselves between two armies that they surrendered at once of course that lost them the battle though as a matter of fact they had killed all the soldiers on the other side killed soldiers cant run away bruno thoughtfully remarked killed is a technical word replied mein herr in the little planet i speak of the bullets were made of soft black stuff which marked everything it touched so after a battle all you had to do was to count how many soldiers on each side were killedthat means marked on the back for marks in front didnt count then you couldnt kill any unless they ran away i said my scientific friend found out a better plan than that he pointed out that if only the bullets were sent the other way round the world they would hit the enemy in the back after that the worst marksmen were considered the best soldiers and the very worst of all always got first prize and how did you decide which was the very worst of all easily the best possible shooting is you know to hit what is exactly in front of you so of course the worst possible is to hit what is exactly behind you they were strange people in that little planet i said they were indeed perhaps their method of government was the strangest of all in this planet i am told a nation consists of a number of subjects and one king but in the little planet i speak of it consisted of a number of kings and one subject you say you are told what happens in this planet i said may i venture to guess that you yourself are a visitor from some other planet bruno clapped his hands in his excitement is oo the man in the moon he cried mein herr looked uneasy i am not in the moon my child he said evasively to return to what i was saying i think that method of government ought to answer well you see the kings would be sure to make laws contradicting each other so the subject could never be punished because whatever he did hed be obeying some law and whatever he did hed be disobeying some law cried bruno so hed always be punished lady muriel was passing at the moment and caught the last word nobodys going to be punished here she said taking bruno in her arms this is liberty hall would you lend me the children for a minute the children desert us you see i said to mein herr as she carried them off so we old folk must keep each other company the old man sighed ah well were old folk now and yet i was a child myself onceat least i fancy so it did seem a rather unlikely fancy i could not help owning to myselflooking at the shaggy white hair and the long beardthat he could ever have been a child you are fond of young people i said young men he replied not of children exactly i used to teach young menmany a year agoin my dear old university i didnt quite catch its name i hinted i did not name it the old man replied mildly nor would you know the name if i did strange tales i could tell you of all the changes i have witnessed there but it would weary you i fear no indeed i said pray go on what kind of changes but the old man seemed to be more in a humour for questions than for answers tell me he said laying his hand impressively on my arm tell me something for i am a stranger in your land and i know little of your modes of education yet something tells me we are further on than you in the eternal cycle of changeand that many a theory we have tried and found to fail you also will try with a wilder enthusiasm you also will find to fail with a bitterer despair it was strange to see how as he talked and his words flowed more and more freely with a certain rhythmic eloquence his features seemed to glow with an inner light and the whole man seemed to be transformed as if he had grown fifty years younger in a moment of time chapter xii fairy music the silence that ensued was broken by the voice of the musical young lady who had seated herself near us and was conversing with one of the newly arrived guests well she said in a tone of scornful surprise we are to have something new in the way of music it appears i looked round for an explanation and was nearly as much astonished as the speaker herself it was sylvie whom lady muriel was leading to the piano do try it my darling she was saying im sure you can play very nicely sylvie looked round at me with tears in her eyes i tried to give her an encouraging smile but it was evidently a great strain on the nerves of a child so wholly unused to be made an exhibition of and she was frightened and unhappy yet here came out the perfect sweetness of her disposition i could see that she was resolved to forget herself and do her best to give pleasure to lady muriel and her friends she seated herself at the instrument and began instantly time and expression so far as one could judge were perfect but her touch was one of such extraordinary lightness that it was at first scarcely possible through the hum of conversation which still continued to catch a note of what she was playing but in a minute the hum had died away into absolute silence and we all sat entranced and breathless to listen to such heavenly music as none then present could ever forget hardly touching the notes at first she played a sort of introduction in a minor keylike an embodied twilight one felt as though the lights were growing dim and a mist were creeping through the room then there flashed through the gathering gloom the first few notes of a melody so lovely so delicate that one held ones breath fearful to lose a single note of it ever and again the music dropped into the pathetic minor key with which it had begun and each time that the melody forced its way so to speak through the enshrouding gloom into the light of day it was more entrancing more magically sweet under the airy touch of the child the instrument actually seemed to warble like a bird rise up my love my fair one it seemed to sing and come away for lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds is come one could fancy one heard the tinkle of the last few drops shaken from the trees by a passing gustthat one saw the first glittering rays of the sun breaking through the clouds the count hurried across the room in great excitement i cannot remember myself he exclaimed of the name of this so charming an air it is of an opera most surely yet not even will the opera remind his name to me what you call him dear child illustration how call you the opera sylvie looked round at him with a rapt expression of face she had ceased playing but her fingers still wandered fitfully over the keys all fear and shyness had quite passed away now and nothing remained but the pure joy of the music that had thrilled our hearts the title of it the count repeated impatiently how call you the opera i dont know what an opera is sylvie half whispered how then call you the air i dont know any name for it sylvie replied as she rose from the instrument but this is marvellous exclaimed the count following the child and addressing himself to me as if i were the proprietor of this musical prodigy and so must know the origin of her music you have heard her play this sooneri would say before this occasion how call you the air i shook my head but was saved from more questions by lady muriel who came up to petition the count for a song the count spread out his hands apologetically and ducked his head but milady i have already respectedi would say prospectedall your songs and there shall be none fitted to my voice they are not for basso voices wont you look at them again lady muriel implored lets help him bruno whispered to sylvie lets get himyou know sylvie nodded shall we look for a song for you she said sweetly to the count mais oui the little man exclaimed of course we may said bruno while each taking a hand of the delighted count they led him to the music stand there is still hope said lady muriel over her shoulder as she followed them i turned to mein herr hoping to resume our interrupted conversation you were remarking i began but at this moment sylvie came to call bruno who had returned to my side looking unusually serious do come bruno she entreated you know weve nearly found it then in a whisper the lockets in my hand now i couldnt get it out while they were looking but bruno drew back the man called me names he said with dignity what names i enquired with some curiosity i asked him said bruno which sort of song he liked and he said a song of a man not of a lady and i said shall sylvie and me find you the song of mister tottles and he said wait eel and im not an eel oo know im sure he didnt mean it sylvie said earnestly its something frenchyou know he cant talk english so well as bruno relented visibly course he knows no better if hes flench flenchmen never can speak english so goodly as us and sylvie led him away a willing captive nice children said the old man taking off his spectacles and rubbing them carefully then he put them on again and watched with an approving smile while the children tossed over the heap of music and we just caught sylvies reproving words were not making hay bruno this has been a long interruption to our conversation i said pray let us go on willingly replied the gentle old man i was much interested in what you he paused a moment and passed his hand uneasily across his brow one forgets he murmured what was i saying oh something you were to tell me yes which of your teachers do you value the most highly those whose words are easily understood or those who puzzle you at every turn i felt obliged to admit that we generally admired most the teachers we couldnt quite understand just so said mein herr thats the way it begins well we were at that stage some eighty years agoor was it ninety our favourite teacher got more obscure every year and every year we admired him morejust as your art fanciers call mist the fairest feature in a landscape and admire a view with frantic delight when they can see nothing now ill tell you how it ended it was moral philosophy that our idol lectured on well his pupils couldnt make head or tail of it but they got it all by heart and when examination time came they wrote it down and the examiners said beautiful what depth but what good was it to the young men afterwards why dont you see replied mein herr they became teachers in their turn and they said all these things over again and their pupils wrote it all down and the examiners accepted it and nobody had the ghost of an idea what it all meant and how did it end it ended this way we woke up one fine day and found there was no one in the place that knew anything about moral philosophy so we abolished it teachers classes examiners and all and if any one wanted to learn anything about it he had to make it out for himself and after another twenty years or so there were several men that really knew something about it now tell me another thing how long do you teach a youth before you examine him in your universities i told him three or four years just so just what we did he exclaimed we taught em a bit and just as they were beginning to take it in we took it all out again we pumped our wells dry before they were a quarter fullwe stripped our orchards while the apples were still in blossomwe applied the severe logic of arithmetic to our chickens while peacefully slumbering in their shells doubtless its the early bird that picks up the wormbut if the bird gets up so outrageously early that the worm is still deep underground what then is its chance of a breakfast not much i admitted now see how that works he went on eagerly if you want to pump your wells so soonand i suppose you tell me that is what you must do we must i said in an over crowded country like this nothing but competitive examinations mein herr threw up his hands wildly what again he cried i thought it was dead fifty years ago oh this upas tree of competitive examinations beneath whose deadly shade all the original genius all the exhaustive research all the untiring life long diligence by which our fore fathers have so advanced human knowledge must slowly but surely wither away and give place to a system of cookery in which the human mind is a sausage and all we ask is how much indigestible stuff can be crammed into it always after these bursts of eloquence he seemed to forget himself for a moment and only to hold on to the thread of thought by some single word yes crammed he repeated we went through all that stage of the diseasehad it bad i warrant you of course as the examination was all in all we tried to put in just what was wantedand the great thing to aim at was that the candidate should know absolutely nothing beyond the needs of the examination i dont say it was ever quite achieved but one of my own pupils pardon an old mans egotism came very near it after the examination he mentioned to me the few facts which he knew but had not been able to bring in and i can assure you they were trivial sir absolutely trivial i feebly expressed my surprise and delight the old man bowed with a gratified smile and proceeded at that time no one had hit on the much more rational plan of watching for the individual scintillations of genius and rewarding them as they occurred as it was we made our unfortunate pupil into a leyden jar charged him up to the eyelidsthen applied the knob of a competitive examination and drew off one magnificent spark which very often cracked the jar what mattered that we labeled it first class spark and put it away on the shelf but the more rational system i suggested ah yes that came next instead of giving the whole reward of learning in one lump we used to pay for every good answer as it occurred how well i remember lecturing in those days with a heap of small coins at my elbow it was a very good answer mr jones that meant a shilling mostly bravo mr robinson that meant half a crown now ill tell you how that worked not one single fact would any of them take in without a fee and when a clever boy came up from school he got paid more for learning than we got paid for teaching him then came the wildest craze of all what another craze i said its the last one said the old man i must have tired you out with my long story each college wanted to get the clever boys so we adopted a system which we had heard was very popular in england the colleges competed against each other and the boys let themselves out to the highest bidder what geese we were why they were bound to come to the university somehow we neednt have paid em and all our money went in getting clever boys to come to one college rather than another the competition was so keen that at last mere money payments were not enough any college that wished to secure some specially clever young man had to waylay him at the station and hunt him through the streets the first who touched him was allowed to have him that hunting down of the scholars as they arrived must have been a curious business i said could you give me some idea of what it was like willingly said the old man i will describe to you the very last hunt that took place before that form of sport for it was actually reckoned among the sports of the day we called it cub hunting was finally abandoned i witnessed it myself as i happened to be passing by at the moment and was what we called in at the death i can see it now he went on in an excited tone gazing into vacancy with those large dreamy eyes of his it seems like yesterday and yet it happened he checked himself hastily and the remaining words died away into a whisper illustration scholar hunting the pursued how many years ago did you say i asked much interested in the prospect of at last learning some definite fact in his history illustration scholar hunting the pursuers many years ago he replied the scene at the railway station had been so they told me one of wild excitement eight or nine heads of colleges had assembled at the gates no one was allowed inside and the station master had drawn a line on the pavement and insisted on their all standing behind it the gates were flung open the young man darted through them and fled like lightning down the street while the heads of colleges actually yelled with excitement on catching sight of him the proctor gave the word in the old statutory form semel bis ter currite and the hunt began oh it was a fine sight believe me at the first corner he dropped his greek lexicon further on his railway rug then various small articles then his umbrella lastly what i suppose he prized most his hand bag but the game was up the spherical principal ofof of which college i said of one of the colleges he resumed had put into operation the theoryhis own discoveryof accelerated velocity and captured him just opposite to where i stood i shall never forget that wild breathless struggle but it was soon over once in those great bony hands escape was impossible may i ask why you speak of him as the spherical principal i said the epithet referred to his shape which was a perfect sphere you are aware that a bullet another instance of a perfect sphere when falling in a perfectly straight line moves with accelerated velocity i bowed assent well my spherical friend as i am proud to call him set himself to investigate the causes of this he found them to be three one that it is a perfect sphere two that it moves in a straight line three that its direction is not upwards when these three conditions are fulfilled you get accelerated velocity hardly i said if you will excuse my differing from you suppose we apply the theory to horizontal motion if a bullet is fired horizontally it it does not move in a straight line he quietly finished my sentence for me i yield the point i said what did your friend do next the next thing was to apply the theory as you rightly suggest to horizontal motion but the moving body ever tending to fall needs constant support if it is to move in a true horizontal line what then he asked himself will give constant support to a moving body and his answer was human legs that was the discovery that immortalised his name his name being i suggested i had not mentioned it was the gentle reply of my most unsatisfactory informant his next step was an obvious one he took to a diet of suet dumplings until his body had become a perfect sphere then he went out for his first experimental runwhich nearly cost him his life how was that well you see he had no idea of the tremendous new force in nature that he was calling into play he began too fast in a very few minutes he found himself moving at a hundred miles an hour and if he had not had the presence of mind to charge into the middle of a haystack which he scattered to the four winds there can be no doubt that he would have left the planet he belonged to and gone right away into space and how came that to be the last of the cub hunts i enquired well you see it led to a rather scandalous dispute between two of the colleges another principal had laid his hand on the young man so nearly at the same moment as the spherical one that there was no knowing which had touched him first the dispute got into print and did us no credit and in short cub hunts came to an end now ill tell you what cured us of that wild craze of ours the bidding against each other for the clever scholars just as if they were articles to be sold by auction just when the craze had reached its highest point and when one of the colleges had actually advertised a scholarship of one thousand pounds per annum one of our tourists brought us the manuscript of an old african legendi happen to have a copy of it in my pocket shall i translate it for you pray go on i said though i felt i was getting very sleepy chapter xiii what tottles meant mein herr unrolled the manuscript but to my great surprise instead of reading it he began to sing it in a rich mellow voice that seemed to ring through the room one thousand pounds per annuum is not so bad a figure come cried tottles and i tell you flat a man may marry well on that to say the husband needs the wife is not the way to represent it the crowning joy of womans life is man said tottles and he meant it the blissful honey moon is past the pair have settled down at last mamma in law their home will share and make their happiness her care your income is an ample one go it my children and they went it i rayther think this kind of fun wont last said tottles and he meant it they took a little country box a box at covent garden also they lived a life of double knocks acquaintances began to call so their london house was much the same it took three hundred clear to rent it life is a very jolly game cried happy tottles and he meant it contented with a frugal lot he always used that phrase at gunters he bought a handy little yacht a dozen serviceable hunters the fishing of a highland loch a sailing boat to circumvent it the sounding of that gaelic och beats me said tottles and he meant it here with one of those convulsive starts that wake one up in the very act of dropping off to sleep i became conscious that the deep musical tones that thrilled me did not belong to mein herr but to the french count the old man was still conning the manuscript i beg your pardon for keeping you waiting he said i was just making sure that i knew the english for all the words i am quite ready now and he read me the following legend in a city that stands in the very centre of africa and is rarely visited by the casual tourist the people had always bought eggsa daily necessary in a climate where egg flip was the usual dietfrom a merchant who came to their gates once a week and the people always bid wildly against each other so there was quite a lively auction every time the merchant came and the last egg in his basket used to fetch the value of two or three camels or thereabouts and eggs got dearer every week and still they drank their egg flip and wondered where all their money went to illustration the egg merchant and there came a day when they put their heads together and they understood what donkeys they had been and next day when the merchant came only one man went forth and he said oh thou of the hook nose and the goggle eyes thou of the measureless beard how much for that lot of eggs and the merchant answered him i could let thee have that lot at ten thousand piastres the dozen and the man chuckled inwardly and said ten piastres the dozen i offer thee and no more oh descendant of a distinguished grandfather and the merchant stroked his beard and said hum i will await the coming of thy friends so he waited and the man waited with him and they waited both together the manuscript breaks off here said mein herr as he rolled it up again but it was enough to open our eyes we saw what simpletons we had beenbuying our scholars much as those ignorant savages bought their eggsand the ruinous system was abandoned if only we could have abandoned along with it all the other fashions we had borrowed from you instead of carrying them to their logical results but it was not to be what ruined my country and drove me from my home was the introductioninto the army of all placesof your theory of political dichotomy shall i trouble you too much i said if i ask you to explain what you mean by the theory of political dichotomy no trouble at all was mein herrs most courteous reply i quite enjoy talking when i get so good a listener what started the thing with us was the report brought to us by one of our most eminent statesmen who had stayed some time in england of the way affairs were managed there it was a political necessity so he assured us and we believed him though we had never discovered it till that moment that there should be two parties in every affair and on every subject in politics the two parties which you had found it necessary to institute were called he told us whigs and tories that must have been some time ago i remarked it was some time ago he admitted and this was the way the affairs of the british nation were managed you will correct me if i misrepresent it i do but repeat what our traveler told us these two partieswhich were in chronic hostility to each othertook turns in conducting the government and the party that happened not to be in power was called the opposition i believe that is the right name i said there have always been so long as we have had a parliament at all two parties one in and one out well the function of the ins if i may so call them was to do the best they could for the national welfarein such things as making war or peace commercial treaties and so forth undoubtedly i said and the function of the outs was so our traveller assured us though we were very incredulous at first to prevent the ins from succeeding in any of these things to criticize and to amend their proceedings i corrected him it would be unpatriotic to hinder the government in doing what was for the good of the nation we have always held a patriot to be the greatest of heroes and an unpatriotic spirit to be one of the worst of human ills excuse me for a moment the old gentleman courteously replied taking out his pocket book i have a few memoranda here of a correspondence i had with our tourist and if you will allow me ill just refresh my memoryalthough i quite agree with youit is as you say one of the worst of human ills and here mein herr began singing again but oh the worst of human ills poor tottles found are little bills and with no balance in the bank what wonder that his spirits sank still as the money flowed away he wondered how on earth she spent it you cost me twenty pounds a day at least cried tottles and he meant it she sighed those drawing rooms you know i really never thought about it mamma declared we ought to go we should be nobodies without it that diamond circlet for my brow i quite believed that she had sent it until the bill came in just now viper cried tottles and he meant it poor mrs t could bear no more but fainted flat upon the floor mamma in law with anguish wild seeks all in vain to rouse her child quick take this box of smelling salts dont scold her james or youll repent it shes a dear girl with all her faults she is groaned tottles and he meant it i was a donkey tottles cried to choose your daughter for my bride twas you that bid us cut a dash tis you have brought us to this smash you dont suggest one single thing that can in any way prevent it then whats the use of arguing shut up cried tottles and he meant it once more i started into wakefulness and realised that mein herr was not the singer he was still consulting his memoranda it is exactly what my friend told me he resumed after conning over various papers unpatriotic is the very word i had used in writing to him and hinder is the very word he used in his reply allow me to read you a portion of his letter i can assure you he writes that unpatriotic as you may think it the recognised function of the opposition is to hinder in every manner not forbidden by the law the action of the government this process is called legitimate obstruction and the greatest triumph the opposition can ever enjoy is when they are able to point out that owing to their obstruction the government have failed in everything they have tried to do for the good of the nation your friend has not put it quite correctly i said the opposition would no doubt be glad to point out that the government had failed through their own fault but not that they had failed on account of obstruction you think so he gently replied allow me now to read to you this newspaper cutting which my friend enclosed in his letter it is part of the report of a public speech made by a statesman who was at the time a member of the opposition at the close of the session he thought they had no reason to be discontented with the fortunes of the campaign they had routed the enemy at every point but the pursuit must be continued they had only to follow up a disordered and dispirited foe now to what portion of your national history would you guess that the speaker was referring really the number of successful wars we have waged during the last century i replied with a glow of british pride is far too great for me to guess with any chance of success which it was we were then engaged in however i will name india as the most probable the mutiny was no doubt all but crushed at the time that speech was made what a fine manly patriotic speech it must have been i exclaimed in an outburst of enthusiasm you think so he replied in a tone of gentle pity yet my friend tells me that the disordered and dispirited foe simply meant the statesmen who happened to be in power at the moment that the pursuit simply meant obstruction and that the words they had routed the enemy simply meant that the opposition had succeeded in hindering the government from doing any of the work which the nation had empowered them to do i thought it best to say nothing it seemed queer to us just at first he resumed after courteously waiting a minute for me to speak but when once we had mastered the idea our respect for your nation was so great that we carried it into every department of life it was the beginning of the end with us my country never held up its head again and the poor old gentleman sighed deeply let us change the subject i said do not distress yourself i beg no no he said with an effort to recover himself i had rather finish my story the next step after reducing our government to impotence and putting a stop to all useful legislation which did not take us long to do was to introduce what we called the glorious british principle of dichotomy into agriculture we persuaded many of the well to do farmers to divide their staff of labourers into two parties and to set them one against the other they were called like our political parties the ins and the outs the business of the ins was to do as much of ploughing sowing or whatever might be needed as they could manage in a day and at night they were paid according to the amount they had done the business of the outs was to hinder them and they were paid for the amount they had hindered the farmers found they had to pay only half as much wages as they did before and they didnt observe that the amount of work done was only a quarter as much as was done before so they took it up quite enthusiastically at first and afterwards i enquired well afterwards they didnt like it quite so well in a very short time things settled down into a regular routine no work at all was done so the ins got no wages and the outs got full pay and the farmers never discovered till most of them were ruined that the rascals had agreed to manage it so and had shared the pay between them while the thing lasted there were funny sights to be seen why ive often watched a ploughman with two horses harnessed to the plough doing his best to get it forwards while the opposition ploughman with three donkeys harnessed at the other end was doing his best to get it backwards and the plough never moving an inch either way but we never did anything like that i exclaimed simply because you were less logical than we were replied mein herr there is sometimes an advantage in being a donkexcuse me no personal allusion intended all this happened long ago you know did the dichotomy principle succeed in any direction i enquired in none mein herr candidly confessed it had a very short trial in commerce the shop keepers wouldnt take it up after once trying the plan of having half the attendants busy in folding up and carrying away the goods which the other half were trying to spread out upon the counters they said the public didnt like it i dont wonder at it i remarked well we tried the british principle for some years and the end of it all was his voice suddenly dropped almost to a whisper and large tears began to roll down his cheeks the end was that we got involved in a war and there was a great battle in which we far out numbered the enemy but what could one expect when only half of our soldiers were fighting and the other half pulling them back it ended in a crushing defeatan utter rout this caused a revolution and most of the government were banished i myself was accused of treason for having so strongly advocated the british principle my property was all forfeited andandi was driven into exile now the mischiefs done they said perhaps youll kindly leave the country it nearly broke my heart but i had to go the melancholy tone became a wail the wail became a chant the chant became a songthough whether it was mein herr that was singing this time or somebody else i could not feel certain and now the mischiefs done perhaps youll kindly go and pack your traps since two your daughter and your son are company but three are none a course of saving well begin when change is needed ill invent it dont think to put your finger in this pie cried tottles and he meant it the music seemed to die away mein herr was again speaking in his ordinary voice now tell me one thing more he said am i right in thinking that in your universities though a man may reside some thirty or forty years you examine him once for all at the end of the first three or four that is so undoubtedly i admitted practically then you examine a man at the beginning of his career the old man said to himself rather than to me and what guarantee have you that he retains the knowledge for which you have rewarded himbeforehand as we should say none i admitted feeling a little puzzled at the drift of his remarks how do you secure that object by examining him at the end of his thirty or forty yearsnot at the beginning he gently replied on an average the knowledge then found is about one fifth of what it was at firstthe process of forgetting going on at a very steady uniform rateand he who forgets least gets most honour and most rewards then you give him the money when he needs it no longer and you make him live most of his life on nothing hardly that he gives his orders to the tradesmen they supply him for forty sometimes fifty years at their own risk then he gets his fellowshipwhich pays him in one year as much as your fellowships pay in fiftyand then he can easily pay all his bills with interest but suppose he fails to get his fellowship that must occasionally happen that occasionally happens it was mein herrs turn now to make admissions and what becomes of the tradesmen they calculate accordingly when a man appears to be getting alarmingly ignorant or stupid they will sometimes refuse to supply him any longer you have no idea with what enthusiasm a man will begin to rub up his forgotten sciences or languages when his butcher has cut off the supply of beef and mutton and who are the examiners the young men who have just come brimming over with knowledge you would think it a curious sight he went on to see mere boys examining such old men i have known a man set to examine his own grandfather it was a little painful for both of them no doubt the old gentleman was as bald as a coot how bald would that be ive no idea why i asked this question i felt i was getting foolish chapter xiv brunos picnic as bald as bald was the bewildering reply now bruno ill tell you a story and ill tell oo a story said bruno beginning in a great hurry for fear of sylvie getting the start of him once there were a mousea little tiny mousesuch a tiny little mouse oo never saw such a tiny mouse did nothing ever happen to it bruno i asked havent you anything more to tell us besides its being so tiny nothing never happened to it bruno solemnly replied why did nothing never happen to it said sylvie who was sitting with her head on brunos shoulder patiently waiting for a chance of beginning her story it were too tiny bruno explained thats no reason i said however tiny it was things might happen to it bruno looked pityingly at me as if he thought me very stupid it were too tiny he repeated if anything happened to it it would dieit were so very tiny really thats enough about its being tiny sylvie put in havent you invented any more about it havent invented no more yet well then you shouldnt begin a story till youve invented more now be quiet theres a good boy and listen to my story and bruno having quite exhausted all his inventive faculty by beginning in too great a hurry quietly resigned himself to listening tell about the other bruno please he said coaxingly sylvie put her arms round his neck and began the wind was whispering among the trees that wasnt good manners bruno interrupted never mind about manners said sylvie and it was eveninga nice moony evening and the owls were hooting pretend they werent owls bruno pleaded stroking her cheek with his fat little hand i dont like owls owls have such great big eyes pretend they were chickens are you afraid of their great big eyes bruno i said arent fraid of nothing bruno answered in as careless a tone as he could manage theyre ugly with their great big eyes i think if they cried the tears would be as bigoh as big as the moon and he laughed merrily doos owls cry ever mister sir owls cry never i said gravely trying to copy brunos way of speaking theyve got nothing to be sorry for you know oh but they have bruno exclaimed theyre ever so sorry cause they killed the poor little mouses but theyre not sorry when theyre hungry i suppose oo dont know nothing about owls bruno scornfully remarked when theyre hungry theyre very very sorry they killed the little mouses cause if they hadnt killed them thered be sumfin for supper oo know bruno was evidently getting into a dangerously inventive state of mind so sylvie broke in with now im going on with the story so the owlsthe chickens i meanwere looking to see if they could find a nice fat mouse for their supper pretend it was a nice abbit said bruno but it wasnt a nice habit to kill mouses sylvie argued i cant pretend that i didnt say habit oo silly fellow bruno replied with a merry twinkle in his eye abbitsthat runs about in the fields rabbit well it can be a rabbit if you like but you mustnt alter my story so much bruno a chicken couldnt eat a rabbit but it might have wished to see if it could try to eat it well it wished to see if it could tryoh really bruno thats nonsense i shall go back to the owls well then pretend they hadnt great eyes and they saw a little boy sylvie went on disdaining to make any further corrections and he asked them to tell him a story and the owls hooted and flew away oo shouldnt say flewed oo should say flied bruno whispered but sylvie wouldnt hear and he met a lion and he asked the lion to tell him a story and the lion said yes it would and while the lion was telling him the story it nibbled some of his head off dont say nibbled bruno entreated only little things nibblelittle thin sharp things with edges well then it nubbled said sylvie and when it had nubbled all his head off he went away and he never said thank you that were very rude said bruno if he couldnt speak he might have noddedno he couldnt nod well he might have shaked hands with the lion oh id forgotten that part said sylvie he did shake hands with it he came back again you know and he thanked the lion very much for telling him the story then his head had growed up again said bruno oh yes it grew up in a minute and the lion begged pardon and said it wouldnt nubble off little boys headsnot never no more bruno looked much pleased at this change of events now that are a really nice story he said arent it a nice story mister sir very i said i would like to hear another story about that boy so would i said bruno stroking sylvies cheek again please tell about brunos picnic and dont talk about nubbly lions i wont if it frightens you said sylvie flightens me bruno exclaimed indignantly it isnt that its cause nubbly s such a grumbly word to saywhen one persons got her head on another persons shoulder when she talks like that he explained to me the talking goes down bofe sides of my faceall the way to my chinand it doos tickle so its enough to make a beard grow that it is he said this with great severity but it was evidently meant for a joke so sylvie laugheda delicious musical little laugh and laid her soft cheek on the top of her brothers curly head as if it were a pillow while she went on with the story so this boy but it wasnt me oo know bruno interrupted and oo neednt try to look as if it was mister sir i represented respectfully that i was trying to look as if it wasnt he was a middling good boy he were a welly good boy bruno corrected her and he never did nothing he wasnt told to do that doesnt make a good boy sylvie said contemptuously that do make a good boy bruno insisted sylvie gave up the point well he was a very good boy and he always kept his promises and he had a big cupboard for to keep all his promises in cried bruno if he kept all his promises sylvie said with a mischievous look in her eyes he wasnt like some boys i know of he had to put salt with them a course bruno said gravely oo cant keep promises when there isnt any salt and he kept his birthday on the second shelf how long did he keep his birthday i asked i never can keep mine more than twenty four hours why a birthday stays that long by itself cried bruno oo doosnt know how to keep birthdays this boy kept his a whole year and then the next birthday would begin said sylvie so it would be his birthday always so it were said bruno doos oo have treats on oor birthday mister sir sometimes i said when oore good i suppose why it is a sort of treat being good isnt it i said a sort of treat bruno repeated its a sort of punishment i think oh bruno sylvie interrupted almost sadly how can you well but it is bruno persisted why look here mister sir this is being good and he sat bolt upright and put on an absurdly solemn face first oo must sit up as straight as pokers as a poker sylvie corrected him as straight as pokers bruno firmly repeated then oo must clasp oor handsso thenwhy hasnt oo brushed oor hair go and brush it toreckly thenoh bruno oo mustnt dogs ear the daisies did oo learn oor spelling wiz daisies mister sir i want to hear about that boys birthday i said bruno returned to the story instantly well so this boy said now its my birthday and soim tired he suddenly broke off laying his head in sylvies lap sylvie knows it best sylvies grown upper than me go on sylvie sylvie patiently took up the thread of the story again so he said now its my birthday whatever shall i do to keep my birthday all good little boys sylvie turned away from bruno and made a great pretence of whispering to me all good little boysboys that learn their lessons quite perfectthey always keep their birthdays you know so of course this little boy kept his birthday oo may call him bruno if oo like the little fellow carelessly remarked it werent me but it makes it more interesting so bruno said to himself the properest thing to do is to have a picnic all by myself on the top of the hill and ill take some milk and some bread and some apples and first and foremost i want some milk so first and foremost bruno took a milk pail and he went and milkted the cow bruno put in yes said sylvie meekly accepting the new verb and the cow said moo what are you going to do with all that milk and bruno said pleasem i want it for my picnic and the cow said moo but i hope you wont boil any of it and bruno said no indeed i wont new milks so nice and so warm it wants no boiling it doesnt want no boiling bruno offered as an amended version so bruno put the milk in a bottle and then bruno said now i want some bread so he went to the oven and he took out a delicious new loaf and the oven ever so light and so puffy bruno impatiently corrected her oo shouldnt leave out so many words sylvie humbly apologised a delicious new loaf ever so light and so puffy and the oven said here sylvie made a long pause really i dont know what an oven begins with when it wants to speak both children looked appealingly at me but i could only say helplessly i havent the least idea i never heard an oven speak for a minute or two we all sat silent and then bruno said very softly oven begins wiz o good little boy sylvie exclaimed he does his spelling very nicely hes cleverer than he knows she added aside to me so the oven said o what are you going to do with all that bread and bruno said please is an oven sir or m would you say she looked to me for a reply both i think seemed to me the safest thing to say sylvie adopted the suggestion instantly so bruno said please sirm i want it for my picnic and the oven said o but i hope you wont toast any of it and bruno said no indeed i wont new breads so light and so puffy it wants no toasting it never doesnt want no toasting said bruno i wiss oo wouldnt say it so short so bruno put the bread in the hamper then bruno said now i want some apples so he took the hamper and he went to the apple tree and he picked some lovely ripe apples and the apple tree said here followed another long pause bruno adopted his favourite expedient of tapping his forehead while sylvie gazed earnestly upwards as if she hoped for some suggestion from the birds who were singing merrily among the branches overhead but no result followed what does an apple tree begin with when it wants to speak sylvie murmured despairingly to the irresponsive birds at last taking a leaf out of brunos book i ventured on a remark doesnt apple tree always begin with eh why of course it does how clever of you sylvie cried delightedly bruno jumped up and patted me on the head i tried not to feel conceited so the apple tree said eh what are you going to do with all those apples and bruno said please sir i want them for my picnic and the apple tree said eh but i hope you wont bake any of them and bruno said no indeed i wont ripe apples are so nice and so sweet they want no baking they never doesnt bruno was beginning but sylvie corrected herself before he could get the words out they never doesnt nonow want no baking so bruno put the apples in the hamper along with the bread and the bottle of milk and he set off to have a picnic on the top of the hill all by himself he wasnt greedy oo know to have it all by himself bruno said patting me on the cheek to call my attention cause he hadnt got no brothers and sisters it was very sad to have no sisters wasnt it i said well i dont know bruno said thoughtfully cause he hadnt no lessons to do so he didnt mind sylvie went on so as he was walking along the road he heard behind him such a curious sort of noisea sort of a thump thump thump whatever is that said bruno oh i know said bruno why its only my watch a ticking were it his watch a ticking bruno asked me with eyes that fairly sparkled with mischievous delight no doubt of it i replied and bruno laughed exultingly then bruno thought a little harder and he said no it cant be my watch a ticking because i havent got a watch bruno peered up anxiously into my face to see how i took it i hung my head and put a thumb into my mouth to the evident delight of the little fellow so bruno went a little further along the road and then he heard it again that queer noisethump thump thump what ever is that said bruno oh i know said bruno why its only the carpenter a mending my wheelbarrow were it the carterpenter a mending his wheelbarrow bruno asked me i brightened up and said it must have been in a tone of absolute conviction bruno threw his arms round sylvies neck sylvie he said in a perfectly audible whisper he says it must have been then bruno thought a little harder and he said no it cant be the carpenter amending my wheelbarrow because i havent got a wheelbarrow this time i hid my face in my hands quite unable to meet brunos look of triumph so bruno went a little further along the road and then he heard that queer noise againthump thump thump so he thought hed look round this time just to see what it was and what should it be but a great lion a great big lion bruno corrected her a great big lion and bruno was ever so frightened and he ran no he wasnt flightened a bit bruno interrupted he was evidently anxious for the reputation of his namesake he runned away to get a good look at the lion cause he wanted to see if it were the same lion what used to nubble little boys heads off and he wanted to know how big it was well he ran away to get a good look at the lion and the lion trotted slowly after him and the lion called after him in a very gentle voice little boy little boy you neednt be afraid of me im a very gentle old lion now i never nubble little boys heads off as i used to do and so bruno said dont you really sir then what do you live on and the lion oo see he werent a bit flightened bruno said to me patting my cheek again cause he remembered to call it sir oo know i said that no doubt that was the real test whether a person was frightened or not and the lion said oh i live on bread and butter and cherries and marmalade and plum cake and apples bruno put in yes and apples and bruno said wont you come with me to my picnic and the lion said oh i should like it very much indeed and bruno and the lion went away together sylvie stopped suddenly is that all i asked despondingly not quite all sylvie slily replied theres a sentence or two more isnt there bruno yes with a carelessness that was evidently put on just a sentence or two more and as they were walking along they looked over a hedge and who should they see but a little black lamb and the lamb was ever so frightened and it ran it were really flightened bruno put in it ran away and bruno ran after it and he called little lamb you neednt be afraid of this lion it never kills things it lives on cherries and marmalade and apples said bruno oo always forgets the apples and bruno said wont you come with us to my picnic and the lamb said oh i should like it very much indeed if my ma will let me and bruno said lets go and ask your ma and they went to the old sheep and bruno said please may your little lamb come to my picnic and the sheep said yes if its learnt all its lessons and the lamb said oh yes ma ive learnt all my lessons pretend it hadnt any lessons bruno earnestly pleaded oh that would never do said sylvie i cant leave out all about the lessons and the old sheep said do you know your a b c yet have you learnt a and the lamb said oh yes ma i went to the a field and i helped them to make a very good my child and have you learnt b oh yes ma i went to the b hive and the b gave me some honey very good my child and have you learnt c oh yes ma i went to the c side and i saw the ships sailing on the c very good my child you may go to brunos picnic illustration starting for brunos picnic so they set off and bruno walked in the middle so that the lamb mightnt see the lion it were flightened bruno explained yes and it trembled so and it got paler and paler and before theyd got to the top of the hill it was a white little lambas white as snow but bruno werent flightened said the owner of that name so he staid black no he didnt stay black he staid pink laughed sylvie i shouldnt kiss you like this you know if you were black ood have to bruno said with great decision besides bruno wasnt bruno oo knowi mean bruno wasnt mei meandont talk nonsense sylvie i wont do it again sylvie said very humbly and so as they went along the lion said oh ill tell you what i used to do when i was a young lion i used to hide behind trees to watch for little boys bruno cuddled a little closer to her and if a little thin scraggy boy came by why i used to let him go but if a little fat juicy bruno could bear no more pretend he wasnt juicy he pleaded half sobbing nonsense bruno sylvie briskly replied itll be done in a moment if a little fat juicy boy came by why i used to spring out and gobble him up oh youve no idea what a delicious thing it isa little juicy boy and bruno said oh if you please sir dont talk about eating little boys it makes me so shivery the real bruno shivered in sympathy with the hero and the lion said oh well we wont talk about it then ill tell you what happened on my wedding day i like this part better said bruno patting my cheek to keep me awake there was oh such a lovely wedding breakfast at one end of the table there was a large plum pudding and at the other end there was a nice roasted lamb oh youve no idea what a delicious thing it isa nice roasted lamb and the lamb said oh if you please sir dont talk about eating lambs it makes me so shivery and the lion said oh well we wont talk about it then chapter xv the little foxes so when they got to the top of the hill bruno opened the hamper and he took out the bread and the apples and the milk and they ate and they drank and when theyd finished the milk and eaten half the bread and half the apples the lamb said oh my paws is so sticky i want to wash my paws and the lion said well go down the hill and wash them in the brook yonder well wait for you it never comed back bruno solemnly whispered to me but sylvie overheard him youre not to whisper bruno it spoils the story and when the lamb had been gone a long time the lion said to bruno do go and see after that silly little lamb it must have lost its way and bruno went down the hill and when he got to the brook he saw the lamb sitting on the bank and who should be sitting by it but an old fox dont know who should be sitting by it bruno said thoughtfully to himself a old fox were sitting by it and the old fox were saying sylvie went on for once conceding the grammatical point yes my dear youll be ever so happy with us if youll only come and see us ive got three little foxes there and we do love little lambs so dearly and the lamb said but you never eat them do you sir and the fox said oh no what eat a lamb we never dream of doing such a thing so the lamb said then ill come with you and off they went hand in hand that fox were welly extremely wicked werent it said bruno no no said sylvie rather shocked at such violent language it wasnt quite so bad as that well i mean it wasnt nice the little fellow corrected himself and so bruno went back to the lion oh come quick he said the fox has taken the lamb to his house with him im sure he means to eat it and the lion said ill come as quick as ever i can and they trotted down the hill do oo think he caught the fox mister sir said bruno i shook my head not liking to speak and sylvie went on and when they got to the house bruno looked in at the window and there he saw the three little foxes sitting round the table with their clean pinafores on and spoons in their hands spoons in their hands bruno repeated in an ecstasy of delight and the fox had got a great big knifeall ready to kill the poor little lamb oo neednt be flightened mister sir bruno put in in a hasty whisper illustration enter the lion and just as he was going to do it bruno heard a great roar the real bruno put his hand into mine and held tight and the lion came bang through the door and the next moment it had bitten off the old foxs head and bruno jumped in at the window and went leaping round the room and crying out hooray hooray the old fox is dead the old fox is dead bruno got up in some excitement may i do it now he enquired sylvie was quite decided on this point wait till afterwards she said the speeches come next dont you know you always love the speeches dont you yes i doos said bruno and sat down again the lions speech now you silly little lamb go home to your mother and never listen to old foxes again and be very good and obedient the lambs speech oh indeed sir i will sir and the lamb went away but oo neednt go away bruno explained its quite the nicest partwhats coming now sylvie smiled she liked having an appreciative audience the lions speech to bruno now bruno take those little foxes home with you and teach them to be good obedient little foxes not like that wicked old thing there thats got no head that hasnt got no head bruno repeated brunos speech to the lion oh indeed sir i will sir and the lion went away it gets betterer and betterer now bruno whispered to me right away to the end brunos speech to the little foxes now little foxes youre going to have your first lesson in being good im going to put you into the hamper along with the apples and the bread and youre not to eat the apples and youre not to eat the bread and youre not to eat anythingtill we get to my house and then youll have your supper the little foxes speech to bruno the little foxes said nothing so bruno put the apples into the hamperand the little foxesand the bread they had picnicked all the milk bruno explained in a whisper and he set off to go to his house were getting near the end now said bruno and when he had got a little way he thought he would look into the hamper and see how the little foxes were getting on so he opened the door said bruno oh bruno sylvie exclaimed youre not telling the story so he opened the door and behold there were no apples so bruno said eldest little fox have you been eating the apples and the eldest little fox said no no no it is impossible to give the tone in which sylvie repeated this rapid little no no no the nearest i can come to it is to say that it was much as if a young and excited duck had tried to quack the words it was too quick for a quack and yet too harsh to be anything else then he said second little fox have you been eating the apples and the second little fox said no no no then he said youngest little fox have you been eating the apples and the youngest little fox tried to say no no no but its mouth was so full it couldnt and it only said wauch wauch wauch and bruno looked into its mouth and its mouth was full of apples and bruno shook his head and he said oh dear oh dear what bad creatures these foxes are bruno was listening intently and when sylvie paused to take breath he could only just gasp out the words about the bread yes said sylvie the bread comes next so he shut the door again and he went a little further and then he thought hed just peep in once more and behold there was no bread what do behold mean said bruno hush said sylvie and he said eldest little fox have you been eating the bread and the eldest little fox said no no no second little fox have you been eating the bread and the second little fox only said wauch wauch wauch and bruno looked into its mouth and its mouth was full of bread it might have chokeded it said bruno so he said oh dear oh dear what shall i do with these foxes and he went a little further now comes the most interesting part bruno whispered and when bruno opened the hamper again what do you think he saw only two foxes bruno cried in a great hurry you shouldnt tell it so quick however he did see only two foxes and he said eldest little fox have you been eating the youngest little fox and the eldest little fox said no no no second little fox have you been eating the youngest little fox and the second little fox did its very best to say no no no but it could only say weuchk weuchk weuchk and when bruno looked into its mouth it was half full of bread and half full of fox bruno said nothing in the pause this time he was beginning to pant a little as he knew the crisis was coming and when hed got nearly home he looked once more into the hamper and he saw only bruno began but a generous thought struck him and he looked at me oo may say it this time mister sir he whispered it was a noble offer but i wouldnt rob him of the treat go on bruno i said you say it much the best onlybutonefox bruno said with great solemnity illustration whihuauch whihuauch eldest little fox sylvie said dropping the narrative form in her eagerness youve been so good that i can hardly believe youve been disobedient but im afraid youve been eating your little sister and the eldest little fox said whihuauch whihuauch and then it choked and bruno looked into its mouth and it was full sylvie paused to take breath and bruno lay back among the daisies and looked at me triumphantly isnt it grand mister sir said he i tried hard to assume a critical tone its grand i said but it frightens one so oo may sit a little closer to me if oo like said bruno and so bruno went home and took the hamper into the kitchen and opened it and he saw sylvie looked at me this time as if she thought i had been rather neglected and ought to be allowed one guess at any rate he cant guess bruno cried eagerly i fraid i must tell him there werentnuffin in the hamper i shivered in terror and bruno clapped his hands with delight he is flightened sylvie tell the rest so bruno said eldest little fox have you been eating yourself you wicked little fox and the eldest little fox said whihuauch and then bruno saw there was only its mouth in the hamper so he took the mouth and he opened it and shook and shook and at last he shook the little fox out of its own mouth and then he said open your mouth again you wicked little thing and he shook and shook and he shook out the second little fox and he said now open your mouth and he shook and shook and he shook out the youngest little fox and all the apples and all the bread and then bruno stood the little foxes up against the wall and he made them a little speech now little foxes youve begun very wickedlyand youll have to be punished first youll go up to the nursery and wash your faces and put on clean pinafores then youll hear the bell ring for supper then youll come down and you wont have any supper but youll have a good whipping then youll go to bed then in the morning youll hear the bell ring for breakfast but you wont have any breakfast youll have a good whipping then youll have your lessons and perhaps if youre very good when dinner time comes youll have a little dinner and no more whipping how very kind he was i whispered to bruno middling kind bruno corrected me gravely so the little foxes ran up to the nursery and soon bruno went into the hall and rang the big bell tingle tingle tingle supper supper supper down came the little foxes in such a hurry for their supper clean pinafores spoons in their hands and when they got into the dining room there was ever such a white table cloth on the table but there was nothing on it but a big whip and they had such a whipping i put my handkerchief to my eyes and bruno hastily climbed upon my knee and stroked my face only one more whipping mister sir he whispered dont cry more than oo cant help and the next morning early bruno rang the big bell again tingle tingle tingle breakfast breakfast breakfast down came the little foxes clean pinafores spoons in their hands no breakfast only the big whip then came lessons sylvie hurried on for i still had my handkerchief to my eyes and the little foxes were ever so good and they learned their lessons backwards and forwards and upside down and at last bruno rang the big bell again tingle tingle tingle dinner dinner dinner and when the little foxes came down had they clean pinafores on bruno enquired of course said sylvie and spoons why you know they had couldnt be certain said bruno they came as slow as slow and they said oh therell be no dinner therell only be the big whip but when they got into the room they saw the most lovely dinner buns cried bruno clapping his hands buns and cake and and jam said bruno yes jamand soupand and sugar plums bruno put in once more and sylvie seemed satisfied and ever after that they were such good little foxes they did their lessons as good as goldand they never did what bruno told them not toand they never ate each other any moreand they never ate themselves the story came to an end so suddenly it almost took my breath away however i did my best to make a pretty speech of thanks im sure its veryveryvery much so im sure i seemed to hear myself say chapter xvi beyond these voices i didnt quite catch what you said were the next words that reached my ear but certainly not in the voice either of sylvie or of bruno whom i could just see through the crowd of guests standing by the piano and listening to the counts song mein herr was the speaker i didnt quite catch what you said he repeated but ive no doubt you take my view of it thank you very much for your kind attention there is only but one verse left to be sung these last words were not in the gentle voice of mein herr but in the deep bass of the french count and in the silence that followed the final stanza of tottles rang through the room illustration never yelled tottles see now this couple settled down in quiet lodgings out of town submissively the tearful wife accepts a plain and humble life yet begs one boon on bended knee my ducky darling dont resent it mamma might come for two or three never yelled tottles and he meant it the conclusion of the song was followed by quite a chorus of thanks and compliments from all parts of the room which the gratified singer responded to by bowing low in all directions it is to me a great privilege he said to lady muriel to have met with this so marvellous a song the accompaniment to him is so strange so mysterious it is as if a new music were to be invented i will play him once again so as that to show you what i mean he returned to the piano but the song had vanished the bewildered singer searched through the heap of music lying on an adjoining table but it was not there either lady muriel helped in the search others soon joined the excitement grew what can have become of it exclaimed lady muriel nobody knew one thing only was certain that no one had been near the piano since the count had sung the last verse of the song nevare mind him he said most good naturedly i shall give it you with memory alone he sat down and began vaguely fingering the notes but nothing resembling the tune came out then he too grew excited but what oddness how much of singularity that i might lose not the words alone but the tune alsothat is quite curious i suppose we all supposed it heartily it was that sweet little boy who found it for me the count suggested quite perhaps he is the thief of course he is cried lady muriel bruno where are you my darling but no bruno replied it seemed that the two children had vanished as suddenly and as mysteriously as the song they are playing us a trick lady muriel gaily exclaimed this is only an ex tempore game of hide and seek that little bruno is an embodied mischief the suggestion was a welcome one to most of us for some of the guests were beginning to look decidedly uneasy a general search was set on foot with much enthusiasm curtains were thrown back and shaken cupboards opened and ottomans turned over but the number of possible hiding places proved to be strictly limited and the search came to an end almost as soon as it had begun they must have run out while we were wrapped up in the song lady muriel said addressing herself to the count who seemed more agitated than the others and no doubt theyve found their way back to the housekeepers room not by this door was the earnest protest of a knot of two or three gentlemen who had been grouped round the door one of them actually leaning against it for the last half hour as they declared this door has not been opened since the song began an uncomfortable silence followed this announcement lady muriel ventured no further conjectures but quietly examined the fastenings of the windows which opened as doors they all proved to be well fastened inside not yet at the end of her resources lady muriel rang the bell ask the housekeeper to step here she said and to bring the childrens walking things with her ive brought them my lady said the obsequious housekeeper entering after another minute of silence i thought the young lady would have come to my room to put on her boots heres your boots my love she added cheerfully looking in all directions for the children there was no answer and she turned to lady muriel with a puzzled smile have the little darlings hid themselves i dont see them just now lady muriel replied rather evasively you can leave their things here wilson ill dress them when theyre ready to go the two little hats and sylvies walking jacket were handed round among the ladies with many exclamations of delight there certainly was a sort of witchery of beauty about them even the little boots did not miss their share of favorable criticism such natty little things the musical young lady exclaimed almost fondling them as she spoke and what tiny tiny feet they must have finally the things were piled together on the centre ottoman and the guests despairing of seeing the children again began to wish good night and leave the house there were only some eight or nine leftto whom the count was explaining for the twentieth time how he had had his eye on the children during the last verse of the song how he had then glanced round the room to see what effect de great chest note had had upon his audience and how when he looked back again they had both disappearedwhen exclamations of dismay began to be heard on all sides the count hastily bringing his story to an end to join in the outcry the walking things had all disappeared after the utter failure of the search for the children there was a very half hearted search made for their apparel the remaining guests seemed only too glad to get away leaving only the count and our four selves the count sank into an easy chair and panted a little who then are these dear children i pray you he said why come they why go they in this so little ordinary a fashion that the music should make itself to vanishthat the hats the boots should make themselves to vanishhow is it i pray you ive no idea where they are was all i could say on finding myself appealed to by general consent for an explanation the count seemed about to ask further questions but checked himself the hour makes himself to become late he said i wish to you a very good night my lady i betake myself to my bedto dreamif that indeed i be not dreaming now and he hastily left the room stay awhile stay awhile said the earl as i was about to follow the count you are not a guest you know arthurs friend is at home here thanks i said as with true english instincts we drew our chairs together round the fire place though no fire was burninglady muriel having taken the heap of music on her knee to have one more search for the strangely vanished song dont you sometimes feel a wild longing she said addressing herself to me to have something more to do with your hands while you talk than just holding a cigar and now and then knocking off the ash oh i know all that youre going to say this was to arthur who appeared about to interrupt her the majesty of thought supersedes the work of the fingers a mans severe thinking plus the shaking off a cigar ash comes to the same total as a womans trivial fancies plus the most elaborate embroidery thats your sentiment isnt it only better expressed arthur looked into the radiant mischievous face with a grave and very tender smile yes he said resignedly that is my sentiment exactly rest of body and activity of mind i put in some writer tells us that is the acme of human happiness plenty of bodily rest at any rate lady muriel replied glancing at the three recumbent figures around her but what you call activity of mind is the privilege of young physicians only said the earl we old men have no claim to be active what can an old man do but die a good many other things i should hope arthur said earnestly well maybe still you have the advantage of me in many ways dear boy not only that your day is dawning while mine is setting but your interest in lifesomehow i cant help envying you that it will be many a year before you lose your hold of that yet surely many human interests survive human life i said many do no doubt and some forms of science but only some i think mathematics for instance that seems to possess an endless interest one cant imagine any form of life or any race of intelligent beings where mathematical truth would lose its meaning but i fear medicine stands on a different footing suppose you discover a remedy for some disease hitherto supposed to be incurable well it is delightful for the moment no doubtfull of interestperhaps it brings you fame and fortune but what then look on a few years into a life where disease has no existence what is your discovery worth then milton makes jove promise too much of so much fame in heaven expect thy meed poor comfort when ones fame concerns matters that will have ceased to have a meaning at any rate one wouldnt care to make any fresh medical discoveries said arthur i see no help for thatthough i shall be sorry to give up my favorite studies still medicine disease pain sorrow sini fear theyre all linked together banish sin and you banish them all military science is a yet stronger instance said the earl without sin war would surely be impossible still any mind that has had in this life any keen interest not in itself sinful will surely find itself some congenial line of work hereafter wellington may have no more battles to fightand yet we doubt not that for one so true there must be other nobler work to do than when he fought at waterloo and victor he must ever be he lingered over the beautiful words as if he loved them and his voice like distant music died away into silence after a minute or two he began again if im not wearying you i would like to tell you an idea of the future life which has haunted me for years like a sort of waking nightmarei cant reason myself out of it pray do arthur and i replied almost in a breath lady muriel put aside the heap of music and folded her hands together the one idea the earl resumed that has seemed to me to overshadow all the rest is that of eternityinvolving as it seems to do the necessary exhaustion of all subjects of human interest take pure mathematics for instancea science independent of our present surroundings i have studied it myself a little take the subject of circles and ellipseswhat we call curves of the second degree in a future life it would only be a question of so many years or hundreds of years if you like for a man to work out all their properties then he might go to curves of the third degree say that took ten times as long you see we have unlimited time to deal with i can hardly imagine his interest in the subject holding out even for those and though there is no limit to the degree of the curves he might study yet surely the time needed to exhaust all the novelty and interest of the subject would be absolutely finite and so of all other branches of science and when i transport myself in thought through some thousands or millions of years and fancy myself possessed of as much science as one created reason can carry i ask myself what then with nothing more to learn can one rest content on knowledge for the eternity yet to be lived through it has been a very wearying thought to me i have sometimes fancied one might in that event say it is better not to be and pray for personal annihilationthe nirvana of the buddhists but that is only half the picture i said besides working for oneself may there not be the helping of others surely surely lady muriel exclaimed in a tone of relief looking at her father with sparkling eyes yes said the earl so long as there were any others needing help but given ages and ages more surely all created reasons would at length reach the same dead level of satiety and then what is there to look forward to i know that weary feeling said the young doctor i have gone through it all more than once now let me tell you how i have put it to myself i have imagined a little child playing with toys on his nursery floor and yet able to reason and to look on thirty years ahead might he not say to himself by that time i shall have had enough of bricks and ninepins how weary life will be yet if we look forward through those thirty years we find him a great statesman full of interests and joys far more intense than his baby life could givejoys wholly inconceivable to his baby mindjoys such as no baby language could in the faintest degree describe now may not our life a million years hence have the same relation to our life now that the mans life has to the childs and just as one might try all in vain to express to that child in the language of bricks and ninepins the meaning of politics so perhaps all those descriptions of heaven with its music and its feasts and its streets of gold may be only attempts to describe in our words things for which we really have no words at all dont you think that in your picture of another life you are in fact transplanting that child into political life without making any allowance for his growing up i think i understand you said the earl the music of heaven may be something beyond our powers of thought yet the music of earth is sweet muriel my child sing us something before we go to bed do said arthur as he rose and lit the candles on the cottage piano lately banished from the drawing room to make room for a semi grand there is a song here that i have never heard you sing hail to thee blithe spirit bird thou never wert that from heaven or near it pourest thy full heart he read from the page he had spread open before her and our little life here the earl went on is to that grand time like a childs summer day one gets tired as night draws on he added with a touch of sadness in his voice and one gets to long for bed for those welcome words come child tis bed time chapter xvii to the rescue it isnt bed time said a sleepy little voice the owls hasnt gone to bed and i sant go to seep wizout oo sings to me oh bruno cried sylvie dont you know the owls have only just got up but the frogs have gone to bed ages ago well i arent a frog said bruno what shall i sing said sylvie skilfully avoiding the argument ask mister sir bruno lazily replied clasping his hands behind his curly head and lying back on his fern leaf till it almost bent over with his weight this arent a comfable leaf sylvie find me a comfablerplease he added as an after thought in obedience to a warning finger held up by sylvie i doosnt like being feet upwards it was a pretty sight to seethe motherly way in which the fairy child gathered up her little brother in her arms and laid him on a stronger leaf she gave it just a touch to set it rocking and it went on vigorously by itself as if it contained some hidden machinery it certainly wasnt the wind for the evening breeze had quite died away again and not a leaf was stirring over our heads why does that one leaf rock so without the others i asked sylvie she only smiled sweetly and shook her head i dont know why she said it always does if its got a fairy child on it it has to you know and can people see the leaf rock who cant see the fairy on it why of course cried sylvie a leafs a leaf and everybody can see it but brunos bruno and they cant see him unless theyre eerie like you then i understood how it was that one sometimes seesgoing through the woods in a still eveningone fern leaf rocking steadily on all by itself havent you ever seen that try if you can see the fairy sleeper on it next time but dont pick the leaf whatever you do let the little one sleep on but all this time bruno was getting sleepier and sleepier sing sing he murmured fretfully sylvie looked to me for instructions what shall it be she said could you sing him the nursery song you once told me of i suggested the one that had been put through the mind mangle you know the little man that had a little gun i think it was why that are one of the professors songs cried bruno i likes the little man and i likes the way they spinned himlike a teetle totle tum and he turned a loving look on the gentle old man who was sitting at the other side of his leaf bed and who instantly began to sing accompanying himself on his outlandish guitar while the snail on which he sat waved its horns in time to the music illustration brunos bed time in stature the manlet was dwarfish no burly big blunderbore he and he wearily gazed on the crawfish his wifelet had dressed for his tea now reach me sweet atom my gunlet and hurl the old shoelet for luck let me hie to the bank of the runlet and shoot thee a duck she has reached him his minikin gunlet she has hurled the old shoelet for luck she is busily baking a bunlet to welcome him home with his duck on he speeds never wasting a wordlet though thoughtlets cling closely as wax to the spot where the beautiful birdlet so quietly quacks illustration long ceremonious calls where the lobsterlet lurks and the crablet so slowly and sleepily crawls where the dolphins at home and the dablet pays long ceremonious calls where the grublet is sought by the froglet where the frog is pursued by the duck where the ducklet is chased by the doglet so runs the worlds luck illustration the voices he has loaded with bullet and powder his footfall is noiseless as air but the voices grow louder and louder and bellow and bluster and blare they bristle before him and after they flutter above and below shrill shriekings of lubberly laughter weird wailings of woe they echo without him within him they thrill through his whiskers and beard like a teetotum seeming to spin him with sneers never hitherto sneered avengement they cry on our foelet let the manikin weep for our wrongs let us drench him from toplet to toelet with nursery songs illustration his soul shall be sad for the spider he shall muse upon hey diddle diddle on the cow that surmounted the moon he shall rave of the cat and the fiddle and the dish that eloped with the spoon and his soul shall be sad for the spider when miss muffet was sipping her whey that so tenderly sat down beside her and scared her away the music of midsummer madness shall sting him with many a bite till in rapture of rollicking sadness he shall groan with a gloomy delight he shall swathe him like mists of the morning in platitudes luscious and limp such as deck with a deathless adorning the song of the shrimp when the ducklets dark doom is decided we will trundle him home in a trice and the banquet so plainly provided shall round into rose buds and rice in a blaze of pragmatic invention he shall wrestle with fate and shall reign but he has not a friend fit to mention so hit him again he has shot it the delicate darling and the voices have ceased from their strife not a whisper of sneering or snarling as he carries it home to his wife then cheerily champing the bunlet his spouse was so skilful to bake he hies him once more to the runlet to fetch her the drake hes sound asleep now said sylvie carefully tucking in the edge of a violet leaf which she had been spreading over him as a sort of blanket good night good night i echoed you may well say good night laughed lady muriel rising and shutting up the piano as she spoke when youve been nidnidnodding all the time ive been singing for your benefit what was it all about now she demanded imperiously something about a duck i hazarded well a bird of some kind i corrected myself perceiving at once that that guess was wrong at any rate something about a bird of some kind lady muriel repeated with as much withering scorn as her sweet face was capable of conveying and thats the way he speaks of shelleys sky lark is it when the poet particularly says hail to thee blithe spirit bird thou never wert illustration lords of the creation she led the way to the smoking room where ignoring all the usages of society and all the instincts of chivalry the three lords of the creation reposed at their ease in low rocking chairs and permitted the one lady who was present to glide gracefully about among us supplying our wants in the form of cooling drinks cigarettes and lights nay it was only one of the three who had the chivalry to go beyond the common place thank you and to quote the poets exquisite description of how geraint when waited on by enid was moved to stoop and kiss the tender little thumb that crossed the platter as she laid it down and to suit the action to the wordan audacious liberty for which i feel bound to report he was not duly reprimanded as no topic of conversation seemed to occur to any one and as we were all four on those delightful terms with one another the only terms i think on which any friendship that deserves the name of intimacy can be maintained which involve no sort of necessity for speaking for mere speakings sake we sat in silence for some minutes at length i broke the silence by asking is there any fresh news from the harbour about the fever none since this morning the earl said looking very grave but that was alarming enough the fever is spreading fast the london doctor has taken fright and left the place and the only one now available isnt a regular doctor at all he is apothecary and doctor and dentist and i dont know what other trades all in one its a bad outlook for those poor fishermenand a worse one for all the women and children how many are there of them altogether arthur asked there were nearly one hundred a week ago said the earl but there have been twenty or thirty deaths since then and what religious ministrations are there to be had there are three brave men down there the earl replied his voice trembling with emotion gallant heroes as ever won the victoria cross i am certain that no one of the three will ever leave the place merely to save his own life theres the curate his wife is with him they have no children then theres the roman catholic priest and theres the wesleyan minister they go amongst their own flocks mostly but im told that those who are dying like to have any of the three with them how slight the barriers seem to be that part christian from christian when one has to deal with the great facts of life and the reality of death so it must be and so it should be arthur was beginning when the front door bell rang suddenly and violently we heard the front door hastily opened and voices outside then a knock at the door of the smoking room and the old house keeper appeared looking a little scared two persons my lord to speak with dr forester arthur stepped outside at once and we heard his cheery well my men but the answer was less audible the only words i could distinctly catch being ten since morning and two more just but there is a doctor there we heard arthur say and a deep voice that we had not heard before replied dead sir died three hours ago lady muriel shuddered and hid her face in her hands but at this moment the front door was quietly closed and we heard no more for a few minutes we sat quite silent then the earl left the room and soon returned to tell us that arthur had gone away with the two fishermen leaving word that he would be back in about an hour and true enough at the end of that intervalduring which very little was said none of us seeming to have the heart to talkthe front door once more creaked on its rusty hinges and a step was heard in the passage hardly to be recognised as arthurs so slow and uncertain was it like a blind man feeling his way he came in and stood before lady muriel resting one hand heavily on the table and with a strange look in his eyes as if he were walking in his sleep murielmy love he paused and his lips quivered but after a minute he went on more steadily murielmy darlingtheywant medown in the harbour must you go she pleaded rising and laying her hands on his shoulders and looking up into his face with her great eyes brimming over with tears must you go arthur it may meandeath he met her gaze without flinching it does mean death he said in a husky whisper butdarlingi am called and even my life itself his voice failed him and he said no more for a minute she stood quite silent looking upwards with a helpless gaze as if even prayer were now useless while her features worked and quivered with the great agony she was enduring then a sudden inspiration seemed to come upon her and light up her face with a strange sweet smile your life she repeated it is not yours to give arthur had recovered himself by this time and could reply quite firmly that is true he said it is not mine to give it is yours now mywife that is to be and youdo you forbid me to go will you not spare me my own beloved one still clinging to him she laid her head softly on his breast she had never done such a thing in my presence before and i knew how deeply she must be moved i will spare you she said calmly and quietly to god and to gods poor he whispered and to gods poor she added when must it be sweet love illustration will you not spare me to morrow morning he replied and i have much to do before then and then he told us how he had spent his hour of absence he had been to the vicarage and had arranged for the wedding to take place at eight the next morning there was no legal obstacle as he had some time before this obtained a special license in the little church we knew so well my old friend here indicating me will act as best man i know your father will be there to give you away andandyou will dispense with brides maids my darling she nodded no words came and then i can go with a willing heartto do gods workknowing that we are oneand that we are together in spirit though not in bodily presenceand are most of all together when we pray our prayers will go up together yes yes sobbed lady muriel but you must not stay longer now my darling go home and take some rest you will need all your strength to morrow well i will go said arthur we will be here in good time to morrow good night my own own darling i followed his example and we two left the house together as we walked back to our lodgings arthur sighed deeply once or twice and seemed about to speakbut no words came till we had entered the house and had lit our candles and were at our bedroom doors then arthur said good night old fellow god bless you god bless you i echoed from the very depths of my heart we were back again at the hall by eight in the morning and found lady muriel and the earl and the old vicar waiting for us it was a strangely sad and silent party that walked up to the little church and back and i could not help feeling that it was much more like a funeral than a wedding to lady muriel it was in fact a funeral rather than a wedding so heavily did the presentiment weigh upon her as she told us afterwards that her newly won husband was going forth to his death then we had breakfast and all too soon the vehicle was at the door which was to convey arthur first to his lodgings to pick up the things he was taking with him and then as far towards the death stricken hamlet as it was considered safe to go one or two of the fishermen were to meet him on the road to carry his things the rest of the way and are you quite sure you are taking all that you will need lady muriel asked all that i shall need as a doctor certainly and my own personal needs are few i shall not even take any of my own wardrobethere is a fishermans suit ready made that is waiting for me at my lodgings i shall only take my watch and a few books andstaythere is one book i should like to add a pocket testamentto use at the bedsides of the sick and dying take mine said lady muriel and she ran upstairs to fetch it it has nothing written in it but muriel she said as she returned with it shall i inscribe no my own one said arthur taking it from her what could you inscribe better than that could any human name mark it more clearly as my own individual property are you not mine are you not with all the old playfulness of manner as bruno would say my very mine he bade a long and loving adieu to the earl and to me and left the room accompanied only by his wife who was bearing up bravely and wasoutwardly at leastless overcome than her old father we waited in the room a minute or two till the sound of wheels had told us that arthur had driven away and even then we waited still for the step of lady muriel going upstairs to her room to die away in the distance her step usually so light and joyous now sounded slow and weary like one who plods on under a load of hopeless misery and i felt almost as hopeless and almost as wretched as she are we four destined ever to meet again on this side the grave i asked myself as i walked to my home and the tolling of a distant bell seemed to answer me no no no chapter xviii a newspaper cutting extract from the fayfield chronicle our readers will have followed with painful interest the accounts we have from time to time published of the terrible epidemic which has during the last two months carried off most of the inhabitants of the little fishing harbour adjoining the village of elveston the last survivors numbering twenty three only out of a population which three short months ago exceeded one hundred and twenty were removed on wednesday last under the authority of the local board and safely lodged in the county hospital and the place is now veritably a city of the dead without a single human voice to break its silence the rescuing party consisted of six sturdy fellowsfishermen from the neighbourhooddirected by the resident physician of the hospital who came over for that purpose heading a train of hospital ambulances the six men had been selectedfrom a much larger number who had volunteered for this peaceful forlorn hopefor their strength and robust health as the expedition was considered to be even now when the malady has expended its chief force not unattended with danger every precaution that science could suggest against the risk of infection was adopted and the sufferers were tenderly carried on litters one by one up the steep hill and placed in the ambulances which each provided with a hospital nurse were waiting on the level road the fifteen miles to the hospital were done at a walking pace as some of the patients were in too prostrate a condition to bear jolting and the journey occupied the whole afternoon the twenty three patients consist of nine men six women and eight children it has not been found possible to identify them all as some of the childrenleft with no surviving relativesare infants and two men and one woman are not yet able to make rational replies the brain powers being entirely in abeyance among a more well to do race there would no doubt have been names marked on the clothes but here no such evidence is forthcoming besides the poor fishermen and their families there were but five persons to be accounted for and it was ascertained beyond a doubt that all five are numbered with the dead it is a melancholy pleasure to place on record the names of these genuine martyrsthan whom none surely are more worthy to be entered on the glory roll of englands heroes they are as follows the rev james burgess ma and emma his wife he was the curate at the harbour not thirty years old and had been married only two years a written record was found in their house of the dates of their deaths next to theirs we will place the honoured name of dr arthur forester who on the death of the local physician nobly faced the imminent peril of death rather than leave these poor folk uncared for in their last extremity no record of his name or of the date of his death was found but the corpse was easily identified although dressed in the ordinary fishermans suit which he was known to have adopted when he went down there by a copy of the new testament the gift of his wife which was found placed next his heart with his hands crossed over it it was not thought prudent to remove the body for burial elsewhere and accordingly it was at once committed to the ground along with four others found in different houses with all due reverence his wife whose maiden name was lady muriel orme had been married to him on the very morning on which he undertook his self sacrificing mission next we record the rev walter saunders wesleyan minister his death is believed to have taken place two or three weeks ago as the words died october were found written on the wall of the room which he is known to have

father francis a young jesuit priest who had been only a few months in the place he had not been dead many hours when the exploring party came upon the body which was identified beyond the possibility of doubt by the dress and by the crucifix which was like the young doctors testament clasped closely to his heart since reaching the hospital two of the men and one of the children have died hope is entertained for all the others though there are two or three cases where the vital powers seem to be so entirely exhausted that it is but hoping against hope to regard ultimate recovery as even possible chapter xix a fairy duet the yearwhat an eventful year it had been for mewas drawing to a close and the brief wintry day hardly gave light enough to recognise the old familiar objects bound up with so many happy memories as the train glided round the last bend into the station and the hoarse cry of elveston elveston resounded along the platform it was sad to return to the place and to feel that i should never again see the glad smile of welcome that had awaited me here so few months ago and yet if i were to find him here i muttered as in solitary state i followed the porter who was wheeling my luggage on a barrow and if he were to strike a sudden hand in mine and ask a thousand things of home i should notno i should not feel it to be strange having given directions to have my luggage taken to my old lodgings i strolled off alone to pay a visit before settling down in my own quarters to my dear old friendsfor such i indeed felt them to be though it was barely half a year since first we metthe earl and his widowed daughter the shortest way as i well remembered was to cross through the churchyard i pushed open the little wicket gate and slowly took my way among the solemn memorials of the quiet dead thinking of the many who had during the past year disappeared from the place and had gone to join the majority a very few steps brought me in sight of the object of my search lady muriel dressed in the deepest mourning her face hidden by a long crape veil was kneeling before a little marble cross round which she was fastening a wreath of flowers the cross stood on a piece of level turf unbroken by any mound and i knew that it was simply a memorial cross for one whose dust reposed elsewhere even before reading the simple inscription in loving memory of arthur forester md whose mortal remains lie buried by the sea whose spirit has returned to god who gave it greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends she threw back her veil on seeing me approach and came forwards to meet me with a quiet smile and far more self possessed than i could have expected it is quite like old times seeing you here again she said in tones of genuine pleasure have you been to see my father no i said i was on my way there and came through here as the shortest way i hope he is well and you also thanks we are both quite well and you are you any better yet not much better i fear but no worse i am thankful to say let us sit here awhile and have a quiet chat she said the calmnessalmost indifferenceof her manner quite took me by surprise i little guessed what a fierce restraint she was putting upon herself one can be so quiet here she resumed i come here everyevery day it is very peaceful i said you got my letter yes but i delayed writing it is so hard to sayon paper i know it was kind of you you were with us when we saw the last of she paused a moment and went on more hurriedly i went down to the harbour several times but no one knows which of those vast graves it is however they showed me the house he died in that was some comfort i stood in the very room wherewhere she struggled in vain to go on the flood gates had given way at last and the outburst of grief was the most terrible i had ever witnessed totally regardless of my presence she flung herself down on the turf burying her face in the grass and with her hands clasped round the little marble cross oh my darling my darling she sobbed and god meant your life to be so beautiful illustration in the church yard i was startled to hear thus repeated by lady muriel the very words of the darling child whom i had seen weeping so bitterly over the dead hare had some mysterious influence passed from that sweet fairy spirit ere she went back to fairyland into the human spirit that loved her so dearly the idea seemed too wild for belief and yet are there not more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy god meant it to be beautiful i whispered and surely it was beautiful gods purpose never fails i dared say no more but rose and left her at the entrance gate to the earls house i waited leaning on the gate and watching the sun set revolving many memoriessome happy some sorrowfuluntil lady muriel joined me she was quite calm again now do come in she said my father will be so pleased to see you the old man rose from his chair with a smile to welcome me but his self command was far less than his daughters and the tears coursed down his face as he grasped both my hands in his and pressed them warmly my heart was too full to speak and we all sat silent for a minute or two then lady muriel rang the bell for tea you do take five oclock tea i know she said to me with the sweet playfulness of manner i remembered so well even though you cant work your wicked will on the law of gravity and make the teacups descend into infinite space a little faster than the tea this remark gave the tone to our conversation by a tacit mutual consent we avoided during this our first meeting after her great sorrow the painful topics that filled our thoughts and talked like light hearted children who had never known a care did you ever ask yourself the question lady muriel began propos of nothing what is the chief advantage of being a man instead of a dog no indeed i said but i think there are advantages on the dogs side of the question as well no doubt she replied with that pretty mock gravity that became her so well but on mans side the chief advantage seems to me to consist in having pockets it was borne in upon meupon us i should say for my father and i were returning from a walkonly yesterday we met a dog carrying home a bone what it wanted it for ive no idea certainly there was no meat on it a strange sensation came over me that i had heard all this or something exactly like it before and i almost expected her next words to be perhaps he meant to make a cloak for the winter however what she really said was and my father tried to account for it by some wretched joke about pro bono publico well the dog laid down the bonenot in disgust with the pun which would have shown it to be a dog of tastebut simply to rest its jaws poor thing i did pity it so wont you join my charitable association for supplying dogs with pockets how would you like to have to carry your walking stick in your mouth ignoring the difficult question as to the raison dtre of a walking stick supposing one had no hands i mentioned a curious instance i had once witnessed of reasoning by a dog a gentleman with a lady and child and a large dog were down at the end of a pier on which i was walking to amuse his child i suppose the gentleman put down on the ground his umbrella and the ladys parasol and then led the way to the other end of the pier from which he sent the dog back for the deserted articles i was watching with some curiosity the dog came racing back to where i stood but found an unexpected difficulty in picking up the things it had come for with the umbrella in its mouth its jaws were so far apart that it could get no firm grip on the parasol after two or three failures it paused and considered the matter then it put down the umbrella and began with the parasol of course that didnt open its jaws nearly so wide and it was able to get a good hold of the umbrella and galloped off in triumph one couldnt doubt that it had gone through a real train of logical thought i entirely agree with you said lady muriel but dont orthodox writers condemn that view as putting man on the level of the lower animals dont they draw a sharp boundary line between reason and instinct that certainly was the orthodox view a generation ago said the earl the truth of religion seemed ready to stand or fall with the assertion that man was the only reasoning animal but that is at an end now man can still claim certain monopoliesfor instance such a use of language as enables us to utilise the work of many by division of labour but the belief that we have a monopoly of reason has long been swept away yet no catastrophe has followed as some old poet says god is where he was most religious believers would now agree with bishop butler said i and not reject a line of argument even if it led straight to the conclusion that animals have some kind of soul which survives their bodily death i would like to know that to be true lady muriel exclaimed if only for the sake of the poor horses sometimes ive thought that if anything could make me cease to believe in a god of perfect justice it would be the sufferings of horseswithout guilt to deserve it and without any compensation it is only part of the great riddle said the earl why innocent beings ever suffer it is a great strain on faithbut not a breaking strain i think the sufferings of horses i said are chiefly caused by mans cruelty so that is merely one of the many instances of sin causing suffering to others than the sinner himself but dont you find a greater difficulty in sufferings inflicted by animals upon each other for instance a cat playing with a mouse assuming it to have no moral responsibility isnt that a greater mystery than a man over driving a horse i think it is said lady muriel looking a mute appeal to her father what right have we to make that assumption said the earl many of our religious difficulties are merely deductions from unwarranted assumptions the wisest answer to most of them is i think behold we know not anything you mentioned division of labour just now i said surely it is carried to a wonderful perfection in a hive of bees so wonderfulso entirely super human said the earl and so entirely inconsistent with the intelligence they show in other waysthat i feel no doubt at all that it is pure instinct and not as some hold a very high order of reason look at the utter stupidity of a bee trying to find its way out of an open window it doesnt try in any reasonable sense of the word it simply bangs itself about we should call a puppy imbecile that behaved so and yet we are asked to believe that its intellectual level is above sir isaac newton then you hold that pure instinct contains no reason at all on the contrary said the earl i hold that the work of a bee hive involves reason of the highest order but none of it is done by the bee god has reasoned it all out and has put into the mind of the bee the conclusions only of the reasoning process but how do their minds come to work together i asked what right have we to assume that they have minds special pleading special pleading lady muriel cried in a most unfilial tone of triumph why you yourself said just now the mind of the bee but i did not say minds my child the earl gently replied it has occurred to me as the most probable solution of the bee mystery that a swarm of bees have only one mind among them we often see one mind animating a most complex collection of limbs and organs when joined together how do we know that any material connection is necessary may not mere neighbourhood be enough if so a swarm of bees is simply a single animal whose many limbs are not quite close together it is a bewildering thought i said and needs a nights rest to grasp it properly reason and instinct both tell me i ought to go home so good night ill set you part of the way said lady muriel ive had no walk to day it will do me good and i have more to say to you shall we go through the wood it will be pleasanter than over the common even though it is getting a little dark we turned aside into the shade of interlacing boughs which formed an architecture of almost perfect symmetry grouped into lovely groined arches or running out far as the eye could follow into endless aisles and chancels and naves like some ghostly cathedral fashioned out of the dream of a moon struck poet always in this wood she began after a pause silence seemed natural in this dim solitude i begin thinking of fairies may i ask you a question she added hesitatingly do you believe in fairies the momentary impulse was so strong to tell her of my experiences in this very wood that i had to make a real effort to keep back the words that rushed to my lips if you mean by believe believe in their possible existence i say yes for their actual existence of course one would need evidence you were saying the other day she went on that you would accept anything on good evidence that was not priori impossible and i think you named ghosts as an instance of a provable phenomenon would fairies be another instance yes i think so and again it was hard to check the wish to say more but i was not yet sure of a sympathetic listener and have you any theory as to what sort of place they would occupy in creation do tell me what you think about them would they for instance supposing such beings to exist would they have any moral responsibility i mean and the light bantering tone suddenly changed to one of deep seriousness would they be capable of sin they can reasonon a lower level perhaps than men and womennever rising i think above the faculties of a child and they have a moral sense most surely such a being without free will would be an absurdity so i am driven to the conclusion that they are capable of sin you believe in them she cried delightedly with a sudden motion as if about to clap her hands now tell me have you any reason for it and still i strove to keep back the revelation i felt sure was coming i believe that there is life everywherenot material only not merely what is palpable to our sensesbut immaterial and invisible as well we believe in our own immaterial essencecall it soul or spirit or what you will why should not other similar essences exist around us not linked on to a visible and material body did not god make this swarm of happy insects to dance in this sunbeam for one hour of bliss for no other object that we can imagine than to swell the sum of conscious happiness and where shall we dare to draw the line and say he has made all these and no more yes yes she assented watching me with sparkling eyes but these are only reasons for not denying you have more reasons than this have you not well yes i said feeling i might safely tell all now and i could not find a fitter time or place to say it i have seen themand in this very wood lady muriel asked no more questions silently she paced at my side with head bowed down and hands clasped tightly together only as my tale went on she drew a little short quick breath now and then like a child panting with delight and i told her what i had never yet breathed to any other listener of my double life and more than that for mine might have been but a noonday dream of the double life of those two dear children and when i told her of brunos wild gambols she laughed merrily and when i spoke of sylvies sweetness and her utter unselfishness and trustful love she drew a deep breath like one who hears at last some precious tidings for which the heart has ached for a long while and the happy tears chased one another down her cheeks i have often longed to meet an angel she whispered so low that i could hardly catch the words im so glad ive seen sylvie my heart went out to the child the first moment that i saw her listen she broke off suddenly thats sylvie singing im sure of it dont you know her voice i have heard bruno sing more than once i said but i never heard sylvie i have only heard her once said lady muriel it was that day when you brought us those mysterious flowers the children had run out into the garden and i saw eric coming in that way and went to the window to meet him and sylvie was singing under the trees a song i had never heard before the words were something like i think it is love i feel it is love her voice sounded far away like a dream but it was beautiful beyond all wordsas sweet as an infants first smile or the first gleam of the white cliffs when one is coming home after weary yearsa voice that seemed to fill ones whole being with peace and heavenly thoughts listen she cried breaking off again in her excitement that is her voice and thats the very song i could distinguish no words but there was a dreamy sense of music in the air that seemed to grow ever louder and louder as if coming nearer to us we stood quite silent and in another minute the two children appeared coming straight towards us through an arched opening among the trees each had an arm round the other and the setting sun shed a golden halo round their heads like what one sees in pictures of saints they were looking in our direction but evidently did not see us and i soon made out that lady muriel had for once passed into a condition familiar to me that we were both of us eerie and that though we could see the children so plainly we were quite invisible to them illustration a fairy duet the song ceased just as they came into sight but to my delight bruno instantly said lets sing it all again sylvie it did sound so pretty and sylvie replied very well its you to begin you know so bruno began in the sweet childish treble i knew so well say what is the spell when her fledgelings are cheeping that lures the bird home to her nest or wakes the tired mother whose infant is weeping to cuddle and croon it to rest whats the magic that charms the glad babe in her arms till it cooes with the voice of the dove and now ensued quite the strangest of all the strange experiences that marked the wonderful year whose history i am writingthe experience of first hearing sylvies voice in song her part was a very short oneonly a few wordsand she sang it timidly and very low indeed scarcely audibly but the sweetness of her voice was simply indescribable i have never heard any earthly music like it tis a secret and so let us whisper it low and the name of the secret is love on me the first effect of her voice was a sudden sharp pang that seemed to pierce through ones very heart i had felt such a pang only once before in my life and it had been from seeing what at the moment realised ones idea of perfect beautyit was in a london exhibition where in making my way through a crowd i suddenly met face to face a child of quite unearthly beauty then came a rush of burning tears to the eyes as though one could weep ones soul away for pure delight and lastly there fell on me a sense of awe that was almost terrorsome such feeling as moses must have had when he heard the words put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground the figures of the children became vague and shadowy like glimmering meteors while their voices rang together in exquisite harmony as they sang for i think it is love for i feel it is love for im sure it is nothing but love by this time i could see them clearly once more bruno again sang by himself say whence is the voice that when anger is burning bids the whirl of the tempest to cease that stirs the vexed soul with an achinga yearning for the brotherly hand grip of peace whence the music that fills all our beingthat thrills around us beneath and above sylvie sang more courageously this time the words seemed to carry her away out of herself tis a secret none knows how it comes how it goes but the name of the secret is love and clear and strong the chorus rang out for i think it is love for i feel it is love for im sure it is nothing but love once more we heard brunos delicate little voice alone say whose is the skill that paints valley and hill like a picture so fair to the sight that flecks the green meadow with sunshine and shadow till the little lambs leap with delight and again uprose that silvery voice whose angelic sweetness i could hardly bear tis a secret untold to hearts cruel and cold though tis sung by the angels above in notes that ring clear for the ears that can hear and the name of the secret is love and then bruno joined in again with for i think it is love for i feel it is love for im sure it is nothing but love that are pretty the little fellow exclaimed as the children passed usso closely that we drew back a little to make room for them and it seemed we had only to reach out a hand to touch them but this we did not attempt no use to try and stop them i said as they passed away into the shadows why they could not even see us no use at all lady muriel echoed with a sigh one would like to meet them again in living form but i feel somehow that can never be they have passed out of our lives she sighed again and no more was said till we came out into the main road at a point near my lodgings well i will leave you here she said i want to get back before dark and i have a cottage friend to visit first good night dear friend let us see you soonand often she added with an affectionate warmth that went to my very heart for those are few we hold as dear good night i answered tennyson said that of a worthier friend than me tennyson didnt know what he was talking about she saucily rejoined with a touch of her old childish gaiety and we parted chapter xx gammon and spinach my landladys welcome had an extra heartiness about it and though with a rare delicacy of feeling she made no direct allusion to the friend whose companionship had done so much to brighten life for me i felt sure that it was a kindly sympathy with my solitary state that made her so specially anxious to do all she could think of to ensure my comfort and make me feel at home the lonely evening seemed long and tedious yet i lingered on watching the dying fire and letting fancy mould the red embers into the forms and faces belonging to bygone scenes now it seemed to be brunos roguish smile that sparkled for a moment and died away now it was sylvies rosy cheek and now the professors jolly round face beaming with delight youre welcome my little ones he seemed to say and then the red coal which for the moment embodied the dear old professor began to wax dim and with its dying lustre the words seemed to die away into silence i seized the poker and with an artful touch or two revived the waning glow while fancyno coy minstrel shesang me once again the magic strain i loved to hear youre welcome little ones the cheery voice repeated i told them you were coming your rooms are all ready for you and the emperor and the empresswell i think theyre rather pleased than otherwise in fact her highness said i hope theyll be in time for the banquet those were her very words i assure you will uggug be at the banquet bruno asked and both children looked uneasy at the dismal suggestion why of course he will chuckled the professor why its his birthday dont you know and his health will be drunk and all that sort of thing what would the banquet be without him ever so much nicer said bruno but he said it in a very low voice and nobody but sylvie heard him the professor chuckled again itll be a jolly banquet now youve come my little man i am so glad to see you again i fraid weve been very long in coming bruno politely remarked well yes the professor assented however youre very short now youre come thats some comfort and he went on to enumerate the plans for the day the lecture comes first he said that the empress insists on she says people will eat so much at the banquet theyll be too sleepy to attend to the lecture afterwardsand perhaps shes right therell just be a little refreshment when the people first arriveas a kind of surprise for the empress you know ever since shes beenwell not quite so clever as she once wasweve found it desirable to concoct little surprises for her then comes the lecture what the lecture you were getting readyever so long ago sylvie enquired yesthats the one the professor rather reluctantly admitted it has taken a goodish time to prepare ive got so many other things to attend to for instance im court physician i have to keep all the royal servants in good healthand that reminds me he cried ringing the bell in a great hurry this is medicine day we only give medicine once a week if we were to begin giving it every day the bottles would soon be empty but if they were ill on the other days sylvie suggested what ill on the wrong day exclaimed the professor oh that would never do a servant would be dismissed at once who was ill on the wrong day this is the medicine for today he went on taking down a large jug from a shelf i mixed it myself first thing this morning taste it he said holding out the jug to bruno dip in your finger and taste it bruno did so and made such an excruciatingly wry face that sylvie exclaimed in alarm oh bruno you mustnt its welly extremely nasty bruno said as his face resumed its natural shape nasty said the professor why of course it is what would medicine be if it wasnt nasty nice said bruno i was going to say the professor faltered rather taken aback by the promptness of brunos reply that that would never do medicine has to be nasty you know be good enough to take this jug down into the servants hall he said to the footman who answered the bell and tell them its their medicine for today which of them is to drink it the footman asked as he carried off the jug oh ive not settled that yet the professor briskly replied ill come and settle that soon tell them not to begin on any account till i come its really wonderful he said turning to the children the success ive had in curing diseases here are some of my memoranda he took down from the shelf a heap of little bits of paper pinned together in twos and threes just look at this set now under cook number thirteen recovered from common feverfebris communis and now see whats pinned to it gave under cook number thirteen a double dose of medicine thats something to be proud of isnt it but which happened first said sylvie looking very much puzzled the professor examined the papers carefully they are not dated i find he said with a slightly dejected air so i fear i cant tell you but they both happened theres no doubt of that the medicines the great thing you know the diseases are much less important you can keep a medicine for years and years but nobody ever wants to keep a disease by the way come and look at the platform the gardener asked me to come and see if it would do we may as well go before it gets dark wed like to very much sylvie replied come bruno put on your hat dont keep the dear professor waiting cant find my hat the little fellow sadly replied i were rolling it about and its rolled itself away maybe its rolled in there sylvie suggested pointing to a dark recess the door of which stood half open and bruno ran in to look after a minute he came slowly out again looking very grave and carefully shut the cupboard door after him it arent in there he said with such unusual solemnity that sylvies curiosity was roused what is in there bruno theres cobwebsand two spiders bruno thoughtfully replied checking off the catalogue on his fingers and the cover of a picture bookand a tortoiseand a dish of nutsand an old man an old man cried the professor trotting across the room in great excitement why it must be the other professor thats been lost for ever so long illustration the other professor found he opened the door of the cupboard wide and there he was the other professor sitting in a chair with a book on his knee and in the act of helping himself to a nut from a dish which he had taken down off a shelf just within his reach he looked round at us but said nothing till he had cracked and eaten the nut then he asked the old question is the lecture all ready itll begin in an hour the professor said evading the question first we must have something to surprise the empress and then comes the banquet the banquet cried the other professor springing up and filling the room with a cloud of dust then id better go andand brush myself a little what a state im in he does want brushing the professor said with a critical air heres your hat little man i had put it on by mistake id quite forgotten i had one on already lets go and look at the platform and theres that nice old gardener singing still bruno exclaimed in delight as we went out into the garden i do believe hes been singing that very song ever since we went away why of course he has replied the professor it wouldnt be the thing to leave off you know wouldnt be what thing said bruno but the professor thought it best not to hear the question what are you doing with that hedgehog he shouted at the gardener whom they found standing upon one foot singing softly to himself and rolling a hedgehog up and down with the other foot well i wanted fur to know what hedgehogs lives on so i be a keeping this here hedgehogfur to see if it eats potatoes much better keep a potato said the professor and see if hedgehogs eat it that be the roight way sure ly the delighted gardener exclaimed be you come to see the platform aye aye the professor cheerily replied and the children have come back you see the gardener looked round at them with a grin then he led the way to the pavilion and as he went he sang he looked again and found it was a double rule of three and all its mystery he said is clear as day to me youve been months over that song said the professor isnt it finished yet there be only one verse more the gardener sadly replied and with tears streaming down his cheeks he sang the last verse he thought he saw an argument that proved he was the pope he looked again and found it was a bar of mottled soap a fact so dread he faintly said extinguishes all hope choking with sobs the gardener hastily stepped on a few yards ahead of the party to conceal his emotion did he see the bar of mottled soap sylvie enquired as we followed oh certainly said the professor that song is his own history you know tears of an ever ready sympathy glittered in brunos eyes is welly sorry he isnt the pope he said arent you sorry sylvie welli hardly know sylvie replied in the vaguest manner would it make him any happier she asked the professor it wouldnt make the pope any happier said the professor isnt the platform lovely he asked as we entered the pavilion ive put an extra beam under it said the gardener patting it affectionately as he spoke and now its that strong asas a mad elephant might dance upon it thank you very much the professor heartily rejoined i dont know that we shall exactly requirebut its convenient to know and he led the children upon the platform to explain the arrangements to them here are three seats you see for the emperor and the empress and prince uggug but there must be two more chairs here he said looking down at the gardener one for lady sylvie and one for the smaller animal and may i help in the lecture said bruno i can do some conjuring tricks well its not exactly a conjuring lecture the professor said as he arranged some curious looking machines on the table however what can you do did you ever go through a table for instance often said bruno havent i sylvie the professor was evidently surprised though he tried not to show it this must be looked into he muttered to himself taking out a note book and firstwhat kind of table tell him bruno whispered to sylvie putting his arms round her neck tell him yourself said sylvie cant said bruno its a bony word nonsense laughed sylvie you can say it well enough if you only try come muddle said bruno thats a bit of it what does he say cried the bewildered professor he means the multiplication table sylvie explained the professor looked annoyed and shut up his note book again oh thats quite another thing he said it are ever so many other things said bruno arent it sylvie a loud blast of trumpets interrupted this conversation why the entertainment has begun the professor exclaimed as he hurried the children into the reception saloon i had no idea it was so late a small table containing cake and wine stood in a corner of the saloon and here we found the emperor and empress waiting for us the rest of the saloon had been cleared of furniture to make room for the guests i was much struck by the great change a few months had made in the faces of the imperial pair a vacant stare was now the emperors usual expression while over the face of the empress there flitted ever and anon a meaningless smile so youre come at last the emperor sulkily remarked as the professor and the children took their places it was evident that he was very much out of temper and we were not long in learning the cause of this he did not consider the preparations made for the imperial party to be such as suited their rank a common mahogany table he growled pointing to it contemptuously with his thumb why wasnt it made of gold i should like to know it would have taken a very long the professor began but the emperor cut the sentence short then the cake ordinary plum why wasnt it made ofof he broke off again then the wine merely old madeira why wasnt it then this chair thats worst of all why wasnt it a throne one might excuse the other omissions but i cant get over the chair what i cant get over said the empress in eager sympathy with her angry husband is the table pooh said the emperor it is much to be regretted the professor mildly replied as soon as he had a chance of speaking after a moments thought he strengthened the remark everything he said addressing society in general is very much to be regretted a murmur of hear hear rose from the crowded saloon there was a rather awkward pause the professor evidently didnt know how to begin the empress leant forwards and whispered to him a few jokes you know professorjust to put people at their ease true true madam the professor meekly replied this little boy please dont make any jokes about me bruno exclaimed his eyes filling with tears i wont if youd rather i didnt said the kind hearted professor it was only something about a ships buoy a harmless punbut it doesnt matter here he turned to the crowd and addressed them in a loud voice learn your as he shouted your bs your cs and your ds then youll be at your ease there was a roar of laughter from all the assembly and then a great deal of confused whispering what was it he said something about bees i fancy the empress smiled in her meaningless way and fanned herself the poor professor looked at her timidly he was clearly at his wits end again and hoping for another hint the empress whispered again some spinach you know professor as a surprise the professor beckoned to the head cook and said something to him in a low voice then the head cook left the room followed by all the other cooks its difficult to get things started the professor remarked to bruno when once we get started itll go on all right youll see if oo want to startle people said bruno oo should put live frogs on their backs here the cooks all came in again in a procession the head cook coming last and carrying something which the others tried to hide by waving flags all round it nothing but flags your imperial highness nothing but flags he kept repeating as he set it before her then all the flags were dropped in a moment as the head cook raised the cover from an enormous dish illustration her imperial highness is surprised what is it the empress said faintly as she put her spy glass to her eye why its spinach i declare her imperial highness is surprised the professor explained to the attendants and some of them clapped their hands the head cook made a low bow and in doing so dropped a spoon on the table as if by accident just within reach of the empress who looked the other way and pretended not to see it i am surprised the empress said to bruno arent you not a bit said bruno i heard but sylvie put her hand over his mouth and spoke for him hes rather tired i think he wants the lecture to begin i want the supper to begin bruno corrected her the empress took up the spoon in an absent manner and tried to balance it across the back of her hand and in doing this she dropped it into the dish and when she took it out again it was full of spinach how curious she said and put it into her mouth it tastes just like real spinach i thought it was an imitationbut i do believe its real and she took another spoonful it wont be real much longer said bruno but the empress had had enough spinach by this time and somehowi failed to notice the exact processwe all found ourselves in the pavilion and the professor in the act of beginning the long expected lecture chapter xxi the professors lecture in sciencein fact in most thingsit is usually best to begin at the beginning in some things of course its better to begin at the other end for instance if you wanted to paint a dog green it might be best to begin with the tail as it doesnt bite at that end and so may i help oo bruno interrupted help me to do what said the puzzled professor looking up for a moment but keeping his finger on the book he was reading from so as not to lose his place to paint a dog green cried bruno oo can begin wiz its mouf and ill no no said the professor we havent got to the experiments yet and so returning to his note book ill give you the axioms of science after that i shall exhibit some specimens then i shall explain a process or two and i shall conclude with a few experiments an axiom you know is a thing that you accept without contradiction for instance if i were to say here we are that would be accepted without any contradiction and its a nice sort of remark to begin a conversation with so it would be an axiom or again supposing i were to say here we are not that would be a fib cried bruno oh bruno said sylvie in a warning whisper of course it would be an axiom if the professor said it that would be accepted if people were civil continued the professor so it would be another axiom it might be an axledum bruno said but it wouldnt be true ignorance of axioms the lecturer continued is a great drawback in life it wastes so much time to have to say them over and over again for instance take the axiom nothing is greater than itself that is nothing can contain itself how often you hear people say he was so excited he was quite unable to contain himself why of course he was unable the excitement had nothing to do with it i say look here you know said the emperor who was getting a little restless how many axioms are you going to give us at this rate we shant get to the experiments till to morrow week oh sooner than that i assure you the professor replied looking up in alarm there are only he referred to his notes again only two more that are really necessary read em out and get on to the specimens grumbled the emperor the first axiom the professor read out in a great hurry consists of these words whatever is is and the second consists of these words whatever isnt isnt we will now go on to the specimens the first tray contains crystals and other things he drew it towards him and again referred to his note book some of the labelsowing to insufficient adhesion here he stopped again and carefully examined the page with his eyeglass i cant quite read the rest of the sentence he said at last but it means that the labels have come loose and the things have got mixed let me stick em on again cried bruno eagerly and began licking them like postage stamps and dabbing them down upon the crystals and the other things but the professor hastily moved the tray out of his reach they might get fixed to the wrong specimens you know he said oo shouldnt have any wrong peppermints in the tray bruno boldly replied should he sylvie but sylvie only shook her head the professor heard him not he had taken up one of the bottles and was carefully reading the label through his eye glass our first specimen he announced as he placed the bottle in front of the other things isthat is it is called here he took it up and examined the label again as if he thought it might have changed since he last saw it is called aqua puracommon waterthe fluid that cheers hip hip hip the head cook began enthusiastically but not inebriates the professor went on quickly but only just in time to check the hooroar which was beginning our second specimen he went on carefully opening a small jar is here he removed the lid and a large beetle instantly darted out and with an angry buzz went straight out of the pavilion isor rather i should say looking sadly into the empty jar it wasa curious kind of blue beetle did any one happen to remarkas it went pastthree blue spots under each wing nobody had remarked them ah well the professor said with a sigh its a pity unless you remark that kind of thing at the moment its very apt to get overlooked the next specimen at any rate will not fly away it isin short or perhaps more correctly at lengthan elephant you will observe here he beckoned to the gardener to come up on the platform and with his help began putting together what looked like an enormous dog kennel with short tubes projecting out of it on both sides but weve seen elephants before the emperor grumbled yes but not through a megaloscope the professor eagerly replied you know you cant see a flea properly without a magnifying glasswhat we call a microscope well just in the same way you cant see an elephant properly without a minimifying glass theres one in each of these little tubes and this is a megaloscope the gardener will now bring in the next specimen please open both curtains down at the end there and make way for the elephant there was a general rush to the sides of the pavilion and all eyes were turned to the open end watching for the return of the gardener who had gone away singing he thought he saw an elephant that practised on a fife there was silence for a minute and then his harsh voice was heard again in the distance he looked againcome up then he looked again and found it waswoa back and found it was a letter from hismake way there hes a coming illustration he thought he saw an elephant and in marched or waddledit is hard to say which is the right wordan elephant on its hind legs and playing on an enormous fife which it held with its fore feet the professor hastily threw open a large door at the end of the megaloscope and the huge animal at a signal from the gardener dropped the fife and obediently trotted into the machine the door of which was at once shut by the professor the specimen is now ready for observation he proclaimed it is exactly the size of the common mousemus communis there was a general rush to the tubes and the spectators watched with delight the minikin creature as it playfully coiled its trunk round the professors extended finger finally taking its stand upon the palm of his hand while he carefully lifted it out and carried it off to exhibit to the imperial party isnt it a darling cried bruno may i stroke it please ill touch it welly gently the empress inspected it solemnly with her eye glass it is very small she said in a deep voice smaller than elephants usually are i believe the professor gave a start of delighted surprise why thats true he murmured to himself then louder turning to the audience her imperial highness has made a remark which is perfectly sensible and a wild cheer arose from that vast multitude the next specimen the professor proclaimed after carefully placing the little elephant in the tray among the crystals and other things is a flea which we will enlarge for the purposes of observation taking a small pill box from the tray he advanced to the megaloscope and reversed all the tubes the specimen is ready he cried with his eye at one of the tubes while he carefully emptied the pill box through a little hole at the side it is now the size of the common horseequus communis there was another general rush to look through the tubes and the pavilion rang with shouts of delight through which the professors anxious tones could scarcely be heard keep the door of the microscope shut he cried if the creature were to escape this size it would but the mischief was done the door had swung open and in another moment the monster had got out and was trampling down the terrified shrieking spectators but the professors presence of mind did not desert him undraw those curtains he shouted it was done the monster gathered its legs together and in one tremendous bound vanished into the sky where is it said the emperor rubbing his eyes in the next province i fancy the professor replied that jump would take it at least five miles the next thing is to explain a process or two but i find there is hardly room enough to operatethe smaller animal is rather in my way who does he mean bruno whispered to sylvie he means you sylvie whispered back hush be kind enough to moveangularlyto this corner the professor said addressing himself to bruno bruno hastily moved his chair in the direction indicated did i move angrily enough he inquired but the professor was once more absorbed in his lecture which he was reading from his note book i will now explain the process ofthe name is blotted im sorry to say it will be illustrated by a number ofof here he examined the page for some time and at last said it seems to be either experiments or specimens let it be experiments said the emperor weve seen plenty of specimens certainly certainly the professor assented we will have some experiments may i do them bruno eagerly asked oh dear no the professor looked dismayed i really dont know what would happen if you did them nor nobody doosnt know whatll happen if oo doos them bruno retorted our first experiment requires a machine it has two knobsonly twoyou can count them if you like the head cook stepped forwards counted them and retired satisfied now you might press those two knobs togetherbut thats not the way to do it or you might turn the machine upside downbut thats not the way to do it what are the way to do it said bruno who was listening very attentively the professor smiled benignantly ah yes he said in a voice like the heading of a chapter the way to do it permit me and in a moment he had whisked bruno upon the table i divide my subject he began into three parts i think ill get down bruno whispered to sylvie it arent nice to be divided he hasnt got a knife silly boy sylvie whispered in reply stand still youll break all the bottles the first part is to take hold of the knobs putting them into brunos hands the second part is here he turned the handle and with a loud oh bruno dropped both the knobs and began rubbing his elbows the professor chuckled in delight it had a sensible effect hadnt it he enquired no it hadnt a sensible effect bruno said indignantly it were very silly indeed it jingled my elbows and it banged my back and it crinkled my hair and it buzzed among my bones im sure it didnt said sylvie youre only inventing oo doosnt know nuffin about it bruno replied oo wasnt there to see nobody cant go among my bones there isnt room our second experiment the professor announced as bruno returned to his place still thoughtfully rubbing his elbows is the production of that seldom seen but greatly to be admired phenomenon black light you have seen white light red light green light and so on but never till this wonderful day have any eyes but mine seen black light this box carefully lifting it upon the table and covering it with a heap of blankets is quite full of it the way i made it was thisi took a lighted candle into a dark cupboard and shut the door of course the cupboard was then full of yellow light then i took a bottle of black ink and poured it over the candle and to my delight every atom of the yellow light turned black that was indeed the proudest moment of my life then i filled a box with it and nowwould any one like to get under the blankets and see it dead silence followed this appeal but at last bruno said ill get under if it wont jingle my elbows satisfied on this point bruno crawled under the blankets and after a minute or two crawled out again very hot and dusty and with his hair in the wildest confusion what did you see in the box sylvie eagerly enquired i saw nuffin bruno sadly replied it were too dark he has described the appearance of the thing exactly the professor exclaimed with enthusiasm black light and nothing look so extremely alike at first sight that i dont wonder he failed to distinguish them we will now proceed to the third experiment the professor came down and led the way to where a post had been driven firmly into the ground to one side of the post was fastened a chain with an iron weight hooked on to the end of it and from the other side projected a piece of whalebone with a ring at the end of it this is a most interesting experiment the professor announced it will need time im afraid but that is a trifling disadvantage now observe if i were to unhook this weight and let go it would fall to the ground you do not deny that nobody denied it and in the same way if i were to bend this piece of whalebone round the postthusand put the ring over this hookthusit stays bent but if i unhook it it straightens itself again you do not deny that again nobody denied it well now suppose we left things just as they are for a long time the force of the whalebone would get exhausted you know and it would stay bent even when you unhooked it now why shouldnt the same thing happen with the weight the whalebone gets so used to being bent that it cant straighten itself any more why shouldnt the weight get so used to being held up that it cant fall any more thats what i want to know thats what we want to know echoed the crowd how long must we wait grumbled the emperor the professor looked at his watch well i think a thousand years will do to begin with he said then we will cautiously unhook the weight and if it still shows as perhaps it will a slight tendency to fall we will hook it on to the chain again and leave it for another thousand years here the empress experienced one of those flashes of common sense which were the surprise of all around her meanwhile therell be time for another experiment she said there will indeed cried the delighted professor let us return to the platform and proceed to the fourth experiment for this concluding experiment i will take a certain alkali or acidi forget which now youll see what will happen when i mix it with some here he took up a bottle and looked at it doubtfully when i mix it withwith something here the emperor interrupted whats the name of the stuff he asked i dont remember the name said the professor and the label has come off he emptied it quickly into the other bottle and with a tremendous bang both bottles flew to pieces upsetting all the machines and filling the pavilion with thick black smoke i sprang to my feet in terror andand found myself standing before my solitary hearth where the poker dropping at last from the hand of the sleeper had knocked over the tongs and the shovel and had upset the kettle filling the air with clouds of steam with a weary sigh i betook myself to bed illustration an explosion chapter xxii the banquet heaviness may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning the next day found me quite another being even the memories of my lost friend and companion were sunny as the genial weather that smiled around me i did not venture to trouble lady muriel or her father with another call so soon but took a walk into the country and only turned homewards when the low sunbeams warned me that day would soon be over on my way home i passed the cottage where the old man lived whose face always recalled to me the day when i first met lady muriel and i glanced in as i passed half curious to see if he were still living there yes the old man was still alive he was sitting out in the porch looking just as he did when i first saw him at fayfield junctionit seemed only a few days ago good evening i said pausing good evening maister he cheerfully responded wont ee step in i stepped in and took a seat on the bench in the porch im glad to see you looking so hearty i began last time i remember i chanced to pass just as lady muriel was coming away from the house does she still come to see you ees he answered slowly she has na forgotten me i dont lose her bonny face for many days together well i mind the very first time she come after wed met at railway station she told me as she come to mak amends dear child only think o that to mak amends to make amends for what i enquired what could she have done to need it well it were loike this you see we were both on us a waiting fur t train at t junction and i had setten mysen down upat t bench and station maister he comes and he orders me offfur t mak room for her ladyship you understand i remember it all i said i was there myself that

died a matter of two months agoor it may be three she was a bonny lassand a good lass too eh but life has been rare an lonely without her he covered his face in his hands and i waited a minute or two in silence for him to recover himself so she says just tak me fur your minnie she says didna minnie mak your tea fur you says she ay says i an she maks the tea an didna minnie light your pipe says she ay says i an she lights the pipe for me an didna minnie set out your tea in t porch an i says my dear i says im thinking youre minnie hersen an she cries a bit we both on us cries a bit again i kept

kisses me on t cheekan may god in heaven bless her and here the poor old man broke down entirely and could say no more illustration a cannot shak hands wi thee god bless her i echoed and good night to you i pressed his hand and left him lady muriel i said softly to myself as i went homewards truly you know how to mak amends seated once more by my lonely fireside i tried to recall the strange vision of the night before and to conjure up the face of the dear old professor among the blazing coals that black onewith just a touch of redwould suit him well i thought after such a catastrophe it would be sure to be covered with black stainsand he would say the result of that combinationyou may have noticedwas an explosion shall i repeat the experiment no no dont trouble yourself was the general cry and we all trooped off in hot haste to the banqueting hall where the feast had already begun no time was lost in helping the dishes and very speedily every guest found his plate filled with good things i have always maintained the principle the professor began that it is a good rule to take some foodoccasionally the great advantage of dinner parties he broke off suddenly why actually heres the other professor he cried and theres no place left for him illustration the other professors fall the other professor came in reading a large book which he held close to his eyes one result of his not looking where he was going was that he tripped up as he crossed the saloon flew up into the air and fell heavily on his face in the middle of the table what a pity cried the kind hearted professor as he helped him up it wouldnt be me if i didnt trip said the other professor the professor looked much shocked almost anything would be better than that he exclaimed it never does he added aside to bruno to be anybody else does it to which bruno gravely replied is got nuffin on my plate the professor hastily put on his spectacles to make sure that the facts were all right to begin with then he turned his jolly round face upon the unfortunate owner of the empty plate and what would you like next my little man well bruno said a little doubtfully i think ill take some plum pudding pleasewhile i think of it oh bruno this was a whisper from sylvie it isnt good manners to ask for a dish before it comes and bruno whispered back but i might forget to ask for some when it comes oo knowi do forget things sometimes he added seeing sylvie about to whisper more and this assertion sylvie did not venture to contradict meanwhile a chair had been placed for the other professor between the empress and sylvie sylvie found him a rather uninteresting neighbour in fact she couldnt afterwards remember that he had made more than one remark to her during the whole banquet and that was what a comfort a dictionary is she told bruno afterwards that she had been too much afraid of him to say more than yes sir in reply and that had been the end of their conversation on which bruno expressed a very decided opinion that that wasnt worth calling a conversation at all oo should have asked him a riddle he added triumphantly why i asked the professor three riddles one was that one you asked me in the morning how many pennies is there in two shillings and another was oh bruno sylvie interrupted that wasnt a riddle it were bruno fiercely replied by this time a waiter had supplied bruno with a plateful of something which drove the plum pudding out of his head another advantage of dinner parties the professor cheerfully explained for the benefit of any one that would listen is that it helps you to see your friends if you want to see a man offer him something to eat its the same rule with a mouse this cats very kind to the mouses bruno said stooping to stroke a remarkably fat specimen of the race that had just waddled into the room and was rubbing itself affectionately against the leg of his chair please sylvie pour some milk in your saucer pussies ever so thirsty why do you want my saucer said sylvie youve got one yourself yes i know said bruno but i wanted mine for to give it some more milk in sylvie looked unconvinced however it seemed quite impossible for her ever to refuse what her brother asked so she quietly filled her saucer with milk and handed it to bruno who got down off his chair to administer it to the cat the rooms very hot with all this crowd the professor said to sylvie i wonder why they dont put some lumps of ice in the grate you fill it with lumps of coal in the winter you know and you sit round it and enjoy the warmth how jolly it would be to fill it now with lumps of ice and sit round it and enjoy the coolth hot as it was sylvie shivered a little at the idea its very cold outside she said my feet got almost frozen to day thats the shoemakers fault the professor cheerfully replied how often ive explained to him that he ought to make boots with little iron frames under the soles to hold lamps but he never thinks no one would suffer from cold if only they would think of those little things i always use hot ink myself in the winter very few people ever think of that yet how simple it is yes its very simple sylvie said politely has the cat had enough this was to bruno who had brought back the saucer only half emptied but bruno did not hear the question theres somebody scratching at the door and wanting to come in he said and he scrambled down off his chair and went and cautiously peeped out through the door way who was it wanted to come in sylvie asked as he returned to his place it were a mouse said bruno and it peepted in and it saw the cat and it said ill come in another day and i said oo neednt be flightened the cats welly kind to mouses and it said but is got some imporkant business what i must attend to and it said ill call again to morrow and it said give my love to the cat what a fat cat it is said the lord chancellor leaning across the professor to address his small neighbour its quite a wonder it was awfully fat when it camed in said bruno so it would be more wonderfuller if it got thin all in a minute and that was the reason i suppose the lord chancellor suggested why you didnt give it the rest of the milk no said bruno it were a betterer reason i tooked the saucer up cause it were so discontented it doesnt look so to me said the lord chancellor what made you think it was discontented cause it grumbled in its throat oh bruno cried sylvie why thats the way cats show theyre pleased bruno looked doubtful its not a good way he objected oo wouldnt say i were pleased if i made that noise in my throat what a singular boy the lord chancellor whispered to himself but bruno had caught the words what do it mean to say a singular boy he whispered to sylvie it means one boy sylvie whispered in return and plural means two or three then is welly glad i is a singular boy bruno said with great emphasis it would be horrid to be two or three boys praps they wouldnt play with me why should they said the other professor suddenly waking up out of a deep reverie they might be asleep you know couldnt if i was awake bruno said cunningly oh but they might indeed the other professor protested boys dont all go to sleep at once you know so these boysbut who are you talking about he never remembers to ask that first the professor whispered to the children why the rest of me a course bruno exclaimed triumphantly supposing i was two or three boys the other professor sighed and seemed to be sinking back into his reverie but suddenly brightened up again and addressed the professor theres nothing more to be done now is there well theres the dinner to finish the professor said with a bewildered smile and the heat to bear i hope youll enjoy the dinnersuch as it is and that you wont mind the heatsuch as it isnt the sentence sounded well but somehow i couldnt quite understand it and the other professor seemed to be no better off such as it isnt what he peevishly enquired it isnt as hot as it might be the professor replied catching at the first idea that came to hand ah i see what you mean now the other professor graciously remarked its very badly expressed but i quite see it now thirteen minutes and a half ago he went on looking first at bruno and then at his watch as he spoke you said this cats very kind to the mouses it must be a singular animal so it are said bruno after carefully examining the cat to make sure how many there were of it but how do you know its kind to the mousesor more correctly speaking the mice cause it plays with the mouses said bruno for to amuse them oo know but that is just what i dont know the other professor rejoined my belief is it plays with them to kill them oh thats quite a accident bruno began so eagerly that it was evident he had already propounded this very difficulty to the cat it splained all that to me while it were drinking the milk it said i teaches the mouses new games the mouses likes it ever so much it said sometimes little accidents happens sometimes the mouses kills theirselves it said is always welly sorry when the mouses kills theirselves it said if it was so very sorry sylvie said rather disdainfully it wouldnt eat the mouses after theyd killed themselves but this difficulty also had evidently not been lost sight of in the exhaustive ethical discussion just concluded it said the orator constantly omitted as superfluous his own share in the dialogue and merely gave us the replies of the cat it said dead mouses never objecks to be eaten it said theres no use wasting good mouses it said wifful sumfinoruvver it said and oo may live to say how much i wiss i had the mouse that then i frew away it said it hadnt time to say such a lot of things sylvie interrupted indignantly oo doosnt know how cats speaks bruno rejoined contemptuously cats speaks welly quick chapter xxiii the pig tale by this time the appetites of the guests seemed to be nearly satisfied and even bruno had the resolution to say when the professor offered him a fourth slice of plum pudding i thinks three helpings is enough suddenly the professor started as if he had been electrified why i had nearly forgotten the most important part of the entertainment the other professor is to recite a tale of a pigi mean a pig tale he corrected himself it has introductory verses at the beginning and at the end it cant have introductory verses at the end can it said sylvie wait till you hear it said the professor then youll see im not sure it hasnt some in the middle as well here he rose to his feet and there was an instant silence through the banqueting hall they evidently expected a speech ladies and gentlemen the professor began the other professor is so kind as to recite a poem the title of it is the pig tale he never recited it before general cheering among the guests he will never recite it again frantic excitement and wild cheering all down the hall the professor himself mounting the table in hot haste to lead the cheering and waving his spectacles in one hand and a spoon in the other then the other professor got up and began little birds are dining warily and well hid in mossy cell hid i say by waiters gorgeous in their gaiters ive a tale to tell illustration teaching tigresses to smile little birds are feeding justices with jam rich in frizzled ham rich i say in oysters haunting shady cloisters that is what i am little birds are teaching tigresses to smile innocent of guile smile i say not smirkle mouth a semicircle thats the proper style little birds are sleeping all among the pins where the loser wins where i say he sneezes when and how he pleases so the tale begins there was a pig that sat alone beside a ruined pump by day and night he made his moan it would have stirred a heart of stone to see him wring his hoofs and groan because he could not jump a certain camel heard him shout a camel with a hump oh is it grief or is it gout what is this bellowing about that pig replied with quivering snout because i cannot jump that camel scanned him dreamy eyed methinks you are too plump i never knew a pig so wide that wobbled so from side to side who could however much he tried do such a thing as jump yet mark those trees two miles away all clustered in a clump if you could trot there twice a day nor ever pause for rest or play in the far futurewho can say you may be fit to jump illustration horrid was that pigs despair that camel passed and left him there beside the ruined pump oh horrid was that pigs despair his shrieks of anguish filled the air he wrung his hoofs he rent his hair because he could not jump there was a frog that wandered by a sleek and shining lump inspected him with fishy eye and said o pig what makes you cry and bitter was that pigs reply because i cannot jump that frog he grinned a grin of glee and hit his chest a thump o pig said be ruled by me and you shall see what you shall see this minute for a trifling fee ill teach you how to jump you may be faint from many a fall and bruised by many a bump but if you persevere through all and practise first on something small concluding with a ten foot wall youll find that you can jump that pig looked up with joyful start oh frog you are a trump your words have healed my inward smart come name your fee and do your part bring comfort to a broken heart by teaching me to jump my fee shall be a mutton chop my goal this ruined pump observe with what an airy flop i plant myself upon the top now bend your knees and take a hop for thats the way to jump illustration the fatal jump uprose that pig and rushed full whack against the ruined pump rolled over like an empty sack and settled down upon his back while all his bones at once went crack it was a fatal jump when the other professor had recited this verse he went across to the fire place and put his head up the chimney in doing this he lost his balance and fell head first into the empty grate and got so firmly fixed there that it was some time before he could be dragged out again bruno had had time to say i thought he wanted to see how many peoples was up the chimbley and sylvie had said chimneynot chimbley and bruno had said dont talk ubbish all this while the other professor was being extracted you must have blacked your face the empress said anxiously let me send for some soap thanks no said the other professor keeping his face turned away blacks quite a respectable colour besides soap would be no use without water keeping his back well turned away from the audience he went on with the introductory verses illustration bathing crocodiles in cream little birds are writing interesting books to be read by cooks read i say not roasted letterpress when toasted loses its good looks little birds are playing bagpipes on the shore where the tourists snore thanks they cry tis thrilling take oh take this shilling let us have no more little birds are bathing crocodiles in cream like a happy dream like but not so lasting crocodiles when fasting are not all they seem illustration that pig lay still as any stone that camel passed as day grew dim around the ruined pump o broken heart o broken limb it needs that camel said to him something more fairy like and slim to execute a jump that pig lay still as any stone and could not stir a stump nor ever if the truth were known was he again observed to moan nor ever wring his hoofs and groan because he could not jump that frog made no remark for he was dismal as a dump he knew the consequence must be that he would never get his fee and still he sits in miserie upon that ruined pump illustration still he sits in miserie its a miserable story said bruno it begins miserably and it ends miserablier i think i shall cry sylvie please lend me your handkerchief i havent got it with me sylvie whispered then i wont cry said bruno manfully there are more introductory verses to come said the other professor but im hungry he sat down cut a large slice of cake put it on brunos plate and gazed at his own empty plate in astonishment where did you get that cake sylvie whispered to bruno he gived it me said bruno but you shouldnt ask for things you know you shouldnt i didnt ask said bruno taking a fresh mouthful he gived it me sylvie considered this for a moment then she saw her way out of it well then ask him to give me some you seem to enjoy that cake the professor remarked doos that mean munch bruno whispered to sylvie sylvie nodded it means to munch and to like to munch bruno smiled at the professor i doos enjoy it he said the other professor caught the word and i hope youre enjoying yourself little man he enquired brunos look of horror quite startled him no indeed i arent he said the other professor looked thoroughly puzzled well well he said try some cowslip wine and he filled a glass and handed it to bruno drink this my dear and youll be quite another man who shall i be said bruno pausing in the act of putting it to his lips dont ask so many questions sylvie interposed anxious to save the poor old man from further bewilderment suppose we get the professor to tell us a story bruno adopted the idea with enthusiasm please do he cried eagerly sumfin about tigersand bumble beesand robin redbreasts oo knows why should you always have live things in stories said the professor why dont you have events or circumstances oh please invent a story like that cried bruno the professor began fluently enough once a coincidence was taking a walk with a little accident and they met an explanationa very old explanationso old that it was quite doubled up and looked more like a conundrum he broke off suddenly please go on both children exclaimed the professor made a candid confession its a very difficult sort to invent i find suppose bruno tells one first bruno was only too happy to adopt the suggestion once there were a pig and a accordion and two jars of orange marmalade the dramatis person murmured the professor well what then so when the pig played on the accordion bruno went on one of the jars of orange marmalade didnt like the tune and the other jar of orange marmalade did like the tunei know i shall get confused among those jars of orange marmalade sylvie he whispered anxiously i will now recite the other introductory verses said the other professor illustration blessed by happy stags little birds are choking baronets with bun taught to fire a gun taught i say to splinter salmon in the winter merely for the fun little birds are hiding crimes in carpet bags blessed by happy stags blessed i say though beaten since our friends are eaten when the memory flags little birds are tasting gratitude and gold pale with sudden cold pale i say and wrinkled when the bells have tinkled and the tale is told the next thing to be done the professor cheerfully remarked to the lord chancellor as soon as the applause caused by the recital of the pig tale had come to an end is to drink the emperors health is it not undoubtedly the lord chancellor replied with much solemnity as he rose to his feet to give the necessary directions for the ceremony fill your glasses he thundered all did so instantly drink the emperors health a general gurgling resounded all through the hall three cheers for the emperor the faintest possible sound followed this announcement and the chancellor with admirable presence of mind instantly proclaimed a speech from the emperor the emperor had begun his speech almost before the words were uttered however unwilling to be emperorsince you all wish me to be emperoryou know how badly the late warden managed thingswith such enthusiasm as you have shownhe persecuted youhe taxed you too heavilyyou know who is fittest man to be emperormy brother had no sense how long this curious speech might have lasted it is impossible to say for just at this moment a hurricane shook the palace to its foundations bursting open the windows extinguishing some of the lamps and filling the air with clouds of dust which took strange shapes in the air and seemed to form words but the storm subsided as suddenly as it had risenthe casements swung into their places again the dust vanished all was as it had been a minute agowith the exception of the emperor and empress over whom had come a wondrous change the vacant stare the meaningless smile had passed away all could see that these two strange beings had returned to their senses the emperor continued his speech as if there had been no interruption and we have behavedmy wife and ilike two arrant knaves we deserve no better name when my brother went away you lost the best warden you ever had and ive been doing my best wretched hypocrite that i am to cheat you into making me an emperor me one that has hardly got the wits to be a shoe black the lord chancellor wrung his hands in despair he is mad good people he was beginning but both speeches stopped suddenlyand in the dead silence that followed a knocking was heard at the outer door what is it was the general cry people began running in and out the excitement increased every moment the lord chancellor forgetting all the rules of court ceremony ran full speed down the hall and in a minute returned pale and gasping for breath chapter xxiv the beggars return your imperial highnesses he began its the old beggar again shall we set the dogs at him bring him here said the emperor the chancellor could scarcely believe his ears here your imperial highness did i rightly understand bring him here the emperor thundered once more the chancellor tottered down the halland in another minute the crowd divided and the poor old beggar was seen entering the banqueting hall illustration the old beggars return he was indeed a pitiable object the rags that hung about him were all splashed with mud his white hair and his long beard were tossed about in wild disorder yet he walked upright with a stately tread as if used to command andstrangest sight of allsylvie and bruno came with him clinging to his hands and gazing at him with looks of silent love men looked eagerly to see how the emperor would receive the bold intruder would he hurl him from the steps of the das but no to their utter astonishment the emperor knelt as the beggar approached and with bowed head murmured forgive us forgive us the empress kneeling at her husbands side meekly repeated the outcast smiled rise up he said i forgive you and men saw with wonder that a change had passed over the old beggar even as he spoke what had seemed but now to be vile rags and splashes of mud were seen to be in truth kingly trappings broidered with gold and sparkling with gems all knew him now and bent low before the elder brother the true warden brother mine and sister mine the warden began in a clear voice that was heard all through that vast hall i come not to disturb you rule on as emperor and rule wisely for i am chosen king of elfland to morrow i return there taking nought from hence save onlysave only his voice trembled and with a look of ineffable tenderness he laid his hands in silence on the heads of the two little ones who clung around him but he recovered himself in a moment and beckoned to the emperor to resume his place at the table the company seated themselves againroom being found for the elfin king between his two childrenand the lord chancellor rose once more to propose the next toast the next toastthe hero of the daywhy he isnt here he broke off in wild confusion good gracious everybody had forgotten prince uggug he was told of the banquet of course said the emperor undoubtedly replied the chancellor that would be the duty of the gold stick in waiting let the gold stick come forwards the emperor gravely said the gold stick came forwards i attended on his imperial fatness was the statement made by the trembling official i told him of the lecture and the banquet what followed said the emperor for the unhappy man seemed almost too frightened to go on his imperial fatness was graciously pleased to be sulky his imperial fatness was graciously pleased to box my ears his imperial fatness was graciously pleased to say i dont care dont care came to a bad end sylvie whispered to bruno im not sure but i believe he was hanged the professor overheard her that result he blandly remarked was merely a case of mistaken identity both children looked puzzled permit me to explain dont care and care were twin brothers care you know killed the cat and they caught dont care by mistake and hanged him instead and so care is alive still but hes very unhappy without his brother thats why they say begone dull care thank you sylvie said heartily its very extremely interesting why it seems to explain everything well not quite everything the professor modestly rejoined there are two or three scientific difficulties what was your general impression as to his imperial fatness the emperor asked the gold stick my impression was that his imperial fatness was getting more more what all listened breathlessly for the next word more prickly he must be sent for at once the emperor exclaimed and the gold stick went off like a shot the elfin king sadly shook his head no use no use he murmured to himself loveless loveless pale trembling speechless the gold stick came slowly back again well said the emperor why does not the prince appear one can easily guess said the professor his imperial fatness is without doubt a little preoccupied bruno turned a look of solemn enquiry on his old friend what do that word mean but the professor took no notice of the question he was eagerly listening to the gold sticks reply please your highness his imperial fatness is not a word more could he utter the empress rose in an agony of alarm let us go to him she cried and there was a general rush for the door bruno slipped off his chair in a moment may we go too he eagerly asked but the king did not hear the question as the professor was speaking to him preoccupied your majesty he was saying that is what he is no doubt may we go and see him bruno repeated the king nodded assent and the children ran off in a minute or two they returned slowly and gravely well said the king whats the matter with the prince heswhat you said bruno replied looking at the professor that hard word and he looked to sylvie for assistance porcupine said sylvie no no the professor corrected her pre occupied you mean illustration porcupine no its porcupine persisted sylvie not that other word at all and please will you come the house is all in an uproar and ood better bring an uproar glass wiz oo added bruno we got up in great haste and followed the children upstairs no one took the least notice of me but i wasnt at all surprised at this as i had long realised that i was quite invisible to them alleven to sylvie and bruno all along the gallery that led to the princes apartment an excited crowd was surging to and fro and the babel of voices was deafening against the door of the room three strong men were leaning vainly trying to shut itfor some great animal inside was constantly bursting it half open and we had a glimpse before the men could push it back again of the head of a furious wild beast with great fiery eyes and gnashing teeth its voice was a sort of mixturethere was the roaring of a lion and the bellowing of a bull and now and then a scream like a gigantic parrot there is no judging by the voice the professor cried in great excitement what is it he shouted to the men at the door and a general chorus of voices answered him porcupine prince uggug has turned into a porcupine a new specimen exclaimed the delighted professor pray let me go in it should be labeled at once but the strong men only pushed him back label it indeed do you want to be eaten up they cried never mind about specimens professor said the emperor pushing his way through the crowd tell us how to keep him safe a large cage the professor promptly replied bring a large cage he said to the people generally with strong bars of steel and a portcullis made to go up and down like a mouse trap does any one happen to have such a thing about him it didnt sound a likely sort of thing for any one to have about him however they brought him one directly curiously enough there happened to be one standing in the gallery put it facing the opening of the door and draw up the portcullis this was done in a moment blankets now cried the professor this is a most interesting experiment there happened to be a pile of blankets close by and the professor had hardly said the word when they were all unfolded and held up like curtains all around the professor rapidly arranged them in two rows so as to make a dark passage leading straight from the door to the mouth of the cage now fling the door open this did not need to be done the three men had only to leap out of the way and the fearful monster flung the door open for itself and with a yell like the whistle of a steam engine rushed into the cage down with the portcullis no sooner said than done and all breathed freely once more on seeing the porcupine safely caged the professor rubbed his hands in childish delight the experiment has succeeded he proclaimed all that is needed now is to feed it three times a day on chopped carrots and never mind about its food just now the emperor interrupted let us return to the banquet brother will you lead the way and the old man attended by his children headed the procession down stairs see the fate of a loveless life he said to bruno as they returned to their places to which bruno made reply i always loved sylvie so ill never get prickly like that he is prickly certainly said the professor who had caught the last words but we must remember that however porcupiny he is royal still after this feast is over im going to take a little present to prince uggugjust to soothe him you know it isnt pleasant living in a cage whatll you give him for a birthday present bruno enquired a small saucer of chopped carrots replied the professor in giving birthday presents my motto ischeapness i should think i save forty pounds a year by givingoh what a twinge of pain what is it said sylvie anxiously my old enemy groaned the professor lumbagorheumatismthat sort of thing i think ill go and lie down a bit and he hobbled out of the saloon watched by the pitying eyes of the two children hell be better soon the elfin king said cheerily brother turning to the emperor i have some business to arrange with you to night the empress will take care of the children and the two brothers went away together arm in arm the empress found the children rather sad company they could talk of nothing but the dear professor and what a pity hes so ill till at last she made the welcome proposal lets go and see him the children eagerly grasped the hands she offered them and we went off to the professors study and found him lying on the sofa covered up with blankets and reading a little manuscript book notes on vol three he murmured looking up at us and there on a table near him lay the book he was seeking when first i saw him and how are you now professor the empress asked bending over the invalid the professor looked up and smiled feebly as devoted to your imperial highness as ever he said in a weak voice all of me that is not lumbago is loyalty a sweet sentiment the empress exclaimed with tears in her eyes you seldom hear anything so beautiful as thateven in a valentine we must take you to stay at the seaside sylvie said tenderly itll do you ever so much good and the seas so grand but a mountains grander said bruno what is there grand about the sea said the professor why you could put it all into a teacup some of it sylvie corrected him well youd only want a certain number of tea cups to hold it all and then wheres the grandeur then as to a mountainwhy you could carry it all away in a wheel barrow in a certain number of years it wouldnt look grandthe bits of it in the wheel barrow sylvie candidly admitted but when oo put it together again bruno began when youre older said the professor youll know that you cant put mountains together again so easily one lives and one learns you know but it neednt be the same one need it said bruno wont it do if i live and if sylvie learns i cant learn without living said sylvie but i can live without learning bruno retorted oo just try me what i meant was the professor began looking much puzzled wasthat you dont know everything you know but i do know everything i know persisted the little fellow i know ever so many things everything cept the things i dont know and sylvie knows all the rest the professor sighed and gave it up do you know what a boojum is i know cried bruno its the thing what wrenches people out of their boots he means bootjack sylvie explained in a whisper you cant wrench people out of boots the professor mildly observed bruno laughed saucily oo can though unless theyre welly tight in once upon a time there was a boojum the professor began but stopped suddenly i forget the rest of the fable he said and there was a lesson to be learned from it im afraid i forget that too ill tell oo a fable bruno began in a great hurry once there were a locust and a magpie and a engine driver and the lesson is to learn to get up early it isnt a bit interesting sylvie said contemptuously you shouldnt put the lesson so soon when did you invent that fable said the professor last week no said bruno a deal shorter ago than that guess again i cant guess said the professor how long ago why it isnt invented yet bruno exclaimed triumphantly but i have invented a lovely one shall i say it if youve finished inventing it said sylvie and let the lesson be to try again no said bruno with great decision the lesson are not to try again once there were a lovely china man what stood on the chimbley piece and he stood and he stood and one day he tumbleded off and he didnt hurt his self one bit only he would try again and the next time he tumbleded off he hurted his self welly much and breaked off ever so much varnish but how did he come back on the chimney piece after his first tumble said the empress it was the first sensible question she had asked in all her life i put him there cried bruno then im afraid you know something about his tumbling said the professor perhaps you pushed him to which bruno replied very seriously didnt pushed him muchhe were a lovely china man he added hastily evidently very anxious to change the subject come my children said the elfin king who had just entered the room we must have a little chat together before you go to bed and he was leading them away but at the door they let go his hands and ran back again to wish the professor good night illustration good night professor good night professor good night and bruno solemnly shook hands with the old man who gazed at him with a loving smile while sylvie bent down to press her sweet lips upon his forehead good night little ones said the professor you may leave me nowto ruminate im as jolly as the day is long except when its necessary to ruminate on some very difficult subject all of me he murmured sleepily as we left the room all of me that isnt bonhommie is rumination what did he say bruno sylvie enquired as soon as we were safely out of hearing i think he said all of me that isnt bone disease is rheumatism whatever are that knocking sylvie sylvie stopped and listened anxiously it sounded like some one kicking at a door i hope it isnt that porcupine breaking loose she exclaimed lets go on bruno said hastily theres nuffin to wait for oo know chapter xxv life out of death the sound of kicking or knocking grew louder every moment and at last a door opened somewhere near us did you say come in sir my landlady asked timidly oh yes come in i replied whats the matter a note has just been left for you sir by the bakers boy he said he was passing the hall and they asked him to come round and leave it here the note contained five words only please come at once muriel a sudden terror seemed to chill my very heart the earl is ill i said to myself dying perhaps and i hastily prepared to leave the house no bad news sir i hope my landlady said as she saw me out the boy said as some one had arrived unexpectedly i hope that is it i said but my feelings were those of fear rather than of hope though on entering the house i was somewhat reassured by finding luggage lying in the entrance bearing the initials e l its only eric lindon after all i thought half relieved and half annoyed surely she need not have sent for me for that lady muriel met me in the passage her eyes were gleamingbut it was the excitement of joy rather than of grief i have a surprise for you she whispered you mean that eric lindon is here i said vainly trying to disguise the involuntary bitterness of my tone the funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables i could not help repeating to myself how cruelly i was misjudging her no no she eagerly replied at leasteric is here but her voice quivered but there is another no need for further question i eagerly followed her in there on the bed he laypale and wornthe mere shadow of his old selfmy old friend come back again from the dead arthur i exclaimed i could not say another word yes back again old boy he murmured smiling as i grasped his hand he indicating eric who stood near saved my lifehe brought me back next to god we must thank him muriel my wife silently i shook hands with eric and with the earl and with one consent we moved into the shaded side of the room where we could talk without disturbing the invalid who lay silent and happy holding his wifes hand in his and watching her with eyes that shone with the deep steady light of love he has been delirious till to day eric explained in a low voice and even to day he has been wandering more than once but the sight of her has been new life to him and then he went on to tell us in would be careless tonesi knew how he hated any display of feelinghow he had insisted on going back to the plague stricken town to bring away a man whom the doctor had abandoned as dying but who might he fancied recover if brought to the hospital how he had seen nothing in the wasted features to remind him of arthur and only recognised him when he visited the hospital a month after how the doctor had forbidden him to announce the discovery saying that any shock to the over taxed brain might kill him at once how he had staid on at the hospital and nursed the sick man by night and dayall this with the studied indifference of one who is relating the commonplace acts of some chance acquaintance and this was his rival i thought the man who had won from him the heart of the woman he loved illustration his wife knelt down at his side the sun is setting said lady muriel rising and leading the way to the open window just look at the western sky what lovely crimson tints we shall have a glorious day to morrow we had followed her across the room and were standing in a little group talking in low tones in the gathering gloom when we were startled by the voice of the sick man murmuring words too indistinct for the ear to catch he is wandering again lady muriel whispered and returned to the bedside we drew a little nearer also but no this had none of the incoherence of delirium what reward shall i give unto the lord the tremulous lips were saying for all the benefits that he hath done unto me i will receive the cup of salvation and calland call but here the poor weakened memory failed and the feeble voice died into silence his wife knelt down at the bedside raised one of his arms and drew it across her own fondly kissing the thin white hand that lay so listlessly in her loving grasp it seemed to me a good opportunity for stealing away without making her go through any form of parting so nodding to the earl and eric i silently left the room eric followed me down the stairs and out into the night is it life or death i asked him as soon as we were far enough from the house for me to speak in ordinary tones it is life he replied with eager emphasis the doctors are quite agreed as to that all he needs now they say is rest and perfect quiet and good nursing hes quite sure to get rest and quiet here and as for the nursing why i think its just possible he tried hard to make his trembling voice assume a playful tone he may even get fairly well nursed in his present quarters im sure of it i said thank you so much for coming out to tell me and thinking he had now said all he had come to say i held out my hand to bid him good night he grasped it warmly and added turning his face away as he spoke by the way there is one other thing i wanted to say i thought youd like to know thatthat im notnot in the mind i was in when last we met it isntthat i can accept christian beliefat least not yet but all this came about so strangely and she had prayed you know and i had prayed andand his voice broke and i could only just catch the concluding words there is a god that answers prayer i know it for certain now he wrung my hand once more and left me suddenly never before had i seen him so deeply moved so in the gathering twilight i paced slowly homewards in a tumultuous whirl of happy thoughts my heart seemed full and running over with joy and thankfulness all that i had so fervently longed for and prayed for seemed now to have come to pass and though i reproached myself bitterly for the unworthy suspicion i had for one moment harboured against the true hearted lady muriel i took comfort in knowing it had been but a passing thought not bruno himself could have mounted the stairs with so buoyant a step as i felt my way up in the dark not pausing to strike a light in the entry as i knew i had left the lamp burning in my sitting room but it was no common lamplight into which i now stepped with a strange new dreamy sensation of some subtle witchery that had come over the place light richer and more golden than any lamp could give flooded the room streaming in from a window i had somehow never noticed before and lighting up a group of three shadowy figures that grew momently more distincta grave old man in royal robes leaning back in an easy chair and two children a girl and a boy standing at his side have you the jewel still my child the old man was saying oh yes sylvie exclaimed with unusual eagerness do you think id ever lose it or forget it she undid the ribbon round her neck as she spoke and laid the jewel in her fathers hand bruno looked at it admiringly what a lovely brightness he said its just like a little red star may i take it in my hand sylvie nodded and bruno carried it off to the window and held it aloft against the sky whose deepening blue was already spangled with stars soon he came running back in some excitement sylvie look here he cried i can see right through it when i hold it up to the sky and it isnt red a bit its oh such a lovely blue and the words are all different do look at it sylvie was quite excited too by this time and the two children eagerly held up the jewel to the light and spelled out the legend between them all will love sylvie illustration the blue locket why this is the other jewel cried bruno dont you remember sylvie the one you didnt choose sylvie took it from him with a puzzled look and held it now up to the light now down its blue one way she said softly to herself and its red the other way why i thought there were two of themfather she suddenly exclaimed laying the jewel once more in his hand i do believe it was the same jewel all the time then you choosed it from itself bruno thoughtfully remarked father could sylvie choose a thing from itself yes my own one the old man replied to sylvie not noticing brunos embarrassing question it was the same jewelbut you chose quite right and he fastened the ribbon round her neck again sylvie will love allall will love sylvie bruno murmured raising himself on tiptoe to kiss the little red star and when you look at it its red and fierce like the sunand when you look through it its gentle and blue like the sky gods own sky sylvie said dreamily gods own sky the little fellow repeated as they stood lovingly clinging together and looking out into the night but oh sylvie what makes the sky such a darling blue sylvies sweet lips shaped themselves to reply but her voice sounded faint and very far away the vision was fast slipping from my eager gaze but it seemed to me in that last bewildering moment that not sylvie but an angel was looking out through those trustful brown eyes and that not
