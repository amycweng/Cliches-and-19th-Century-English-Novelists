bank by her sis ter till she was tired once or twice she had looked at the book her sis ter held in her hand but there were no pict ures in it and what is the use of a book thought alice with out pict ures she asked her self as well as she could for the hot day made her feel quite dull if it would be worth while to get up and pick some dai sies to make a chain just then a white rab bit with pink eyes ran close by her illustration that was not such a strange thing nor did alice think it so much out of the way to hear the rab bit say oh dear oh dear i shall be late but when the rab bit took a watch out of its pock et and looked at it and then ran on al ice start ed to her feet for she knew that was the first time she had seen a rab bit with a watch she jumped up and ran to get a look at it and was just in time to see it pop down a large rab bit hole near the hedge as fast as she could go al ice went down the hole af ter it and did not once stop to think how in the world she was to get out the hole went straight on for some way and then turned down with a sharp bend so sharp that al ice had no time to think to stop till she found her self fall ing in what seemed a deep well she must not have moved fast or the well must have been quite deep for it took her a long time to go down and as she went she had time to look at the strange things she passed first she tried to look down and make out what was there but it was too dark to see then she looked at the sides of the well and saw that they were piled with book shelves here and there she saw maps hung on pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed on it was the word jam but there was no jam in it so she put it back on one of the shelves as she fell past it well thought al ice to her self af ter such a fall as this i shall not mind a fall down stairs at all how brave they'll all think me at home why i wouldn't say a thing if i fell off the top of the house which i dare say was quite true down down down would the fall nev er come to an end i should like to know she said how far i have come by this time wouldn't it be strange if i should fall right through the earth and come out where the folks walk with their feet up and their heads down down down down di nah will miss me to night al ice went on di nah was the cat i hope they'll think to give her her milk at tea time di nah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no mice in the air but you might catch a bat and that's much like a mouse you know but do cats eat bats and here al ice must have gone to sleep for she dreamed that she walked hand in hand with di nah and just as she asked her now di nah tell me the truth do you eat bats all at once thump thump down she came on a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the long fall was o ver al ice was not a bit hurt but at once jumped to her feet she looked up but all was dark there at the end of a long hall in front of her the white rab bit was still in sight there was no time to be lost so off al ice went like the wind and was just in time to hear it say oh my ears how late it is then it was out of sight she found she was in a long hall with a low roof from which hung a row of light ed lamps there were doors on all sides but when al ice had been all round and tried each one she found they were all locked she walked back and forth and tried to think how she was to get out at last she came to a stand made all of glass on it was a ti ny key of gold and al ice's first thought was that this might be a key to one of the doors of the hall but when she had tried the key in each lock she found the locks were too large or the key was too small it did not fit one of them but when she went round the hall once more she came to a low cur tain which she had not seen at first and when she drew this back she found a small door not much more than a foot high she tried the key in the lock and to her great joy it fit ted illustration al ice found that the door led to a hall the size of a rat hole she knelt down and looked through it in to a gar den of gay flow ers how she longed to get out of that dark hall and near those bright blooms but she could not so much as get her head through the door and if my head would go through thought al ice it would be of no use for the rest of me would still be too large to go through oh how i wish i could shut up small i think i could if i knew how to start there seemed to be no use to wait by the small door so she went back to the stand with the hope that she might find a key to one of the large doors or may be a book of rules that would teach her to grow small this time she found a small bot tle on it which i am sure was not here just now said al ice and tied round the neck of the bot tle was a tag with the words drink me printed on it it was all right to say drink me but al ice was too wise to do that in haste no i'll look first she said and see if it's marked 'poi son' or not for she had been taught if you drink much from a bot tle marked 'poi son' it is sure to make you sick this had no such mark on it so she dared to taste it and as she found it nice it had in fact a taste of pie ice cream roast fowl and hot toast she soon drank it off how strange i feel said al ice i am sure i am not so large as i was and so it was she was now not quite a foot high and her face light ed up at the thought that she was now the right size to go through the small door and get out to that love ly gar den illustration poor al ice when she reached the door she found that she had left the key on the stand and when she went back for it she found she could by no means reach it she could see it through the glass and she tried her best to climb one of the legs of the stand but it was too sleek and when she was quite tired out she sat down and cried come there's no use to cry like that al ice said to her self as stern as she could speak i tell you to leave off at once soon her eyes fell on a small glass box that lay on the floor she looked in it and found a tiny cake on which were the words eat me marked in grapes well i'll eat it said al ice and if it makes me grow tall i can reach the key and if it makes me shrink up i can creep un der the door so i'll get out some way so she set to work and soon ate all the cake chapter ii the pool of tears how strange oh my said al ice how tall i am and all at once too good by feet for when she looked down at her feet they seemed so far off she thought they would soon be out of sight oh my poor feet who will put on your shoes for you now dears i'm sure i shan't do it i shall be a great deal too far off to take care of you you must get on the best way you can but i must be kind to them thought al ice or they won't walk the way i want to go let me see i'll give them a pair of new shoes each christ mas she stopped to think how she would send them they must go by the mail she thought and how fun ny it'll seem to send shoes to one's own feet how odd the ad dress will look al ice's right foot esq hearth rug near the fire with al ice's love illustration oh dear there's no sense in all that just then her head struck the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took up the small key and went back to the door poor al ice it was as much as she could do when she lay down on one side to look through to the gar den with one eye but to get through was not to be hoped for so she sat down and had a good cry shame on you said al ice a great big girl like you she might well say this to cry in this way stop at once i tell you but she went on all the same and shed tears till there was a large pool all round her and which reached half way down the hall illustration at last she heard the sound of feet not far off then she dried her eyes in great haste to see who it was it was the white rab bit that had come back dressed in fine clothes with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the oth er he trot ted on in great haste and talked to him self as he came oh the duch ess the duch ess oh won't she be in a fine rage if i've made her wait al ice felt so bad and so in need of help from some one that when the rab bit came near she said in a low tim id voice if you please sir the rab bit started as if shot dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and ran off in to the dark as fast as his two hind feet could take him al ice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was quite hot she fanned her self all the time she went on talk ing dear dear how queer all things are to day could i have been changed in the night let me think was i the same when i got up to day seems to me i didn't feel quite the same but if i'm not the same then who in the world am i then she thought of all the girls she knew that were of her age to see if she could have been changed for one of them i'm sure i'm not a da she said for her hair is in such long curls and mine doesn't curl at all and i'm sure i can't be ma bel for i know all sorts of things and she oh she knows such a lit tle then she's she and i'm i and oh dear how strange it all is i'll try if i know all the things i used to know let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thir teen and four times sev en is oh dear that is not right i must have been changed for ma bel i'll try if i know 'how doth the lit tle ' and she placed her hands on her lap as if she were at school and tried to say it but her voice was hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do i'm sure those are not the right words said poor al ice and her eyes filled with tears as she went on i must be ma bel af ter all and i shall have to go and live in that po ky house and have next to no toys to play with and oh such hard things to learn no i've made up my mind if i'm ma bel i'll stay down here it'll be no use for them to put their heads down and say 'come up dear' i shall look up and say 'who am i then tell me that first and then if i like it i'll come up if not i'll stay down here till i'm some one else' but oh dear cried al ice with a fresh burst of tears i do wish they would put their heads down i am so tired of this place as she said this she looked down at her hands and saw that she had put on one of the rab bit's white kid gloves while she was talk ing how can i have done that she thought i must have grown small once more she got up and went to the glass stand to test her height by that and found that as well as she could guess she was now not more than two feet high and still shrink ing quite fast she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she held and she dropped it at once or she might have shrunk to the size of a gnat al ice was at first in a sad fright at the quick change but glad that it was no worse now for the gar den and she ran with all her speed back to the small door but oh dear the door was shut and the key lay on the glass stand and things are worse than ev er thought the poor child for i nev er was so small as this nev er it's too bad that it is as she said these words her foot slipped and splash she was up to her chin in salt wa ter at first she thought she must be in the sea but she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high illustration i wish i hadn't cried so much said al ice as she swam round and tried to find her way out i shall now be drowned in my own tears that will be a queer thing to be sure but all things are queer to day just then she heard a splash in the pool a lit tle way off and she swam near to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a whale but when she thought how small she was now she soon made out that it was a mouse that had slipped in the pond would it be of an y use now to speak to this mouse all things are so out of way down here i should think may be it can talk at least there's no harm to try so she said o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i have swum here till i'm quite tired o mouse the mouse looked at her and seemed to her to wink with one of its small eyes but it did not speak it may be a french mouse thought al ice so she said ou est ma chatte where is my cat which was all the french she could think of just then the mouse gave a quick leap out of the wa ter and seemed in a great fright oh i beg your par don cried al ice i quite for got you didn't like cats not like cats cried the mouse in a shrill harsh voice would you like cats if you were me well i guess not said al ice but please don't get mad and yet i wish i could show you our cat di nah i'm sure you'd like cats if you could see her she is such a dear thing al ice went on half to her self as she swam round in the pool and she sits and purrs by the fire and licks her paws and wash es her face and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse and she's a fine one to catch mice oh dear cried al ice for this time the mouse was in a great fright and each hair stood on end we won't talk of her if you don't like it we talk cried the mouse who shook down to the end of his tail as if i would talk of such low mean things as cats all rats hate them don't let me hear the name a gain i won't said al ice in great haste to change the theme are you fond of of dogs the mouse did not speak so al ice went on there is such a nice dog near our house i should like to show you a ti ny bright eyed dog you know with oh such long cur ly brown hair and it'll fetch things when you throw them and it'll sit up and beg for its meat and do all sorts of things i can't tell you half of them and it kills all the rats and m oh dear cried al ice in a sad tone i've made it mad a gain for the mouse swam off from her as fast as it could go and made quite a stir in the pool as it went so she called it in a soft kind voice mouse dear do come back and we won't talk of cats or dogs if you don't like them when the mouse heard this it turned round and swam back to her its face was quite pale with rage al ice thought and it said in a low weak voice let us get to the shore and then i'll tell you why it is i hate cats and dogs it was high time to go for the pool was by this time quite crowded with the birds and beasts that had slipped in to it al ice led the way and they all swam to the shore chapter iii a race they were a queer look ing crowd as they stood or sat on the bank the wings and tails of the birds drooped to the earth the fur of the beasts clung close to them and all were as wet and cross as could be illustration the first thought of course was how to get dry they had a long talk a bout this and al ice joined with them as if she had known them all her life but it was hard to tell what was best what i want to say at last spoke up the do do is that the best thing to get us dry would be a race what kind of race asked al ice not that she much want ed to know but the do do had paused as if it thought that some one ought to speak and no one else would say a word why said the do do the best way to make it plain is to do it and as you might like to try the thing some cold day i'll tell you how the do do did it first it marked out a race course in a sort of ring it didn't care much for the shape and then all the crowd were placed on the course here and there there was no one two three and here we go but they ran when they liked and left off when they liked so that no one could tell when the race was ended when they had been running half an hour or so and were all quite dry the do do called out the race is o ver and they all crow ded round it and and asked but who has won this the do do could not at first tell but sat for a long time with one claw pressed to its head while the rest wait ed but did not speak at last the do do said all have won and each must have a prize but who is to give them all asked at once why she of course said the do do as it point ed to al ice with one long claw and the whole par ty at once crowd ed round her as they called out a prize a prize al ice did not know what to do but she pulled from her pock et a box of lit tle cakes by a strange good luck they did not get wet while she was in the pool and hand ed them round as priz es there was one a piece all round but she must have a prize you know said the mouse of course the do do said what else have you got he went on as he turned to al ice a thim ble said al ice looking quite sad hand it here said the do do then they all crowd ed round her once more while the do do hand ed the thim ble back to al ice and said we beg that you accept this fine thim ble and when it had made this short speech they all cheered al ice thought the whole thing quite fool ish but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think what to say she bowed and took the thim ble while she looked as staid as she could illustration the next thing was to eat the cakes this caused some noise as the large birds said they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be pat ted on the back it was o ver at last and they sat down in a ring and begged the mouse to tell them a tale you said you would tell us why you hate cats and dogs said al ice mine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse as it turned to al ice with a sigh it is a long tail i'm sure said al ice look ing down at the mouse's tail but why do you call it sad i shall not tell you said the mouse as it got up and walked off please come back and tell us your tale called al ice and all joined in yes please do but the mouse shook its head and walked on and was soon out of sight i wish i had our di nah here i know i do said al ice she'd soon fetch it back and who is di nah if i may dare to ask such a thing said one of the birds al ice was glad to talk of her pet di nah's our cat and she's such a fine one to catch mice you can't think and oh i wish you could see her chase a bird why she'll eat a bird as soon as look at it this speech caused a great stir in the par ty some of the birds rushed off at once one old jay wrapped it self up with care and said i must get home the night air doesn't suit my throat and a wren called out to her brood come my dears it's high time you were all in bed soon they all moved off and al ice was left a lone i wish i hadn't told them of di nah she said to her self no one seems to like her down here and i'm sure she's the best cat in the world oh my dear di nah shall i ev er see you an y more and here poor al ice burst in to tears for she felt ver y sad and lone ly in a short time she heard the pat ter of feet and she looked up with the hope that the mouse had changed its mind and come back to tell his long and sad tale chapter iv the rab bit sends in a bill it was the white rab bit who trot ted back a gain it looked from side to side as it went as if it had lost some thing and al ice heard it say to it self the duch ess the duch ess oh my dear paws she'll get my head cut off as sure as rats are rats where can i have lost them al ice guessed at once that he was in search of the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and like the good girl that she was she set out to hunt for them but they were not to be found all things seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool the great hall with the glass stand and the lit tle door all were gone soon the rab bit saw al ice and called out to her why ann what are you out here for run home at once and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan quick now and al ice was in such a fright that she ran off and did not wait to tell it who she was he took me for his house maid she said to her self as she ran what will he think when he finds out who i am but i must take him his fan and gloves that is if i can find them as she said this she came to a small neat house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name w rab bit on it she ran up stairs in great fear lest she should meet ann and be turned out of the house be fore she had found the fan and gloves how queer it seems that i should do things for a rab bit i guess di nah'll send me to wait on her next illustration by this time she had made her way to a ti dy room with a ta ble near the wall and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs of small white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of gloves and turned to leave the room when her eye fell up on a small bot tle that stood near there was no tag this time with the words drink me but al ice put it to her lips i know i am sure to change in some way if i eat or drink any thing so i'll just see what this does i do hope it'll make me grow large a gain for i'm quite tired of this size al ice said to her self it did as she had wished for in a short time her head pressed the roof so hard she couldn't stand up straight she put the bot tle down in haste and said that's as much as i need i hope i shan't grow an y more as it is i can't get out at the door i do wish i hadn't drunk so much but it was too late to wish that she grew and grew till she had to kneel down on the floor next there was not room for this and she had to lie down still she grew and grew and grew till she had to put one arm out the window and one foot up the chim ney and said to her self now i can do no more let come what may there seemed no sort of chance that she could ev er get out of the room i wish i was at home thought poor al ice where i wouldn't change so much and where i didn't have to do things for mice and rab bits i wish i hadn't gone down that rab bit hole and yet and yet it's queer you know this sort of life when i used to read fair y tales i thought they were just made up by some one and now here i am in one my self when i grow up i'll write a book a bout these strange things but i'm grown up now she added in a sad tone at least there's no room to grow an y more here she heard a voice out side and stopped to list en ann ann said the voice fetch me my gloves quick then came the sound of feet on the stairs al ice knew it was the rab bit and that it had come to look for her she quaked with fear till she shook the house poor thing she didn't think that she was now more than ten times as large as the rab bit and that she had no cause to be a fraid of it soon the rab bit came to the door and tried to come in but al ice's arm pressed it so hard the door would not move al ice heard it say then i'll go round and get in at the win dow illustration that you won't thought al ice then she wait ed till she heard the rab bit quite near the win dow then spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of it but she heard a shriek and a fall next came an an gry voice the rab bit's pat pat where are you and then a voice which was new to her sure then i'm here dig ging for apples yer hon or dig ging for ap ples in deed said the rab bit here come and help me out of this now tell me pat what's that in the win dow sure it's an arm yer hon or an arm you goose who ever saw one that size why it fills the whole win dow sure it does yer hon or but it's an arm for all that well it has no right there go and take it out for a long time they seemed to stand still but now and then al ice could hear a few words in a low voice such as sure i don't like it yer hon or at all at all do as i tell you you cow ard and at last she spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air this time there were two lit tle shrieks i should like to know what they'll do next as to their threats to pull me out i on ly wish they could i'm sure i don't want to stay in here she wait ed for some time but all was still at last came the noise of small cart wheels and the sound of voi ces from which she made out the words where's the oth er lad der why i hadn't to bring but one bill's got the oth er bill fetch it here lad here put 'em up at this place no tie 'em first they don't reach half as high as they should yet oh they'll do here bill catch hold of this rope will the roof bear mind that loose slate oh here it comes look out a loud crash now who did that it was bill i guess who's to go down the chim ney nay i shan't you do it that i won't then bill's got to go down here bill you've got to go down the chim ney oh so bill's got to come down has he said al ice to her self why they seem to put all the work on bill i wouldn't be in bill's place for a good deal this fire place is small to be sure but i think i can kick some she drew her foot as far down as she could and wait ed till she heard a small beast she couldn't guess of what sort it was come scratch scratch down the chim ney quite close to her then she said to her self this is bill gave one sharp kick and wait ed to see what would hap pen next illustration the first thing she heard was there goes bill then the rab bit's voice catch him you by the hedge then all was still then the voices hold up his head wine now don't choke him how was it old fel low what sent you up so fast tell us all a bout it last came a weak voice that's bill thought al ice well i don't know no more thank'ye i'm not so weak now but i'm a deal too shocked to tell you all i know is a thing comes at me like a jack in the box and up i goes like a rocket so you did old fel low said the oth ers we must burn the house down said the rab bit's voice and al ice called out as loud as she could if you do i'll set di nah at you at once all was still as death and al ice thought what will they do next if they had an y sense they'd take the roof off then she heard the rab bit say one load will do to start with a load of what thought al ice but she had not long to doubt for soon a show er of small stones came in at the win dow and some of them hit her in the face i'll put a stop to this she said to her self and shout ed out you stop that at once a gain all was still as death al ice saw that the stones all changed to small cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright thought came to her if i eat one of these cakes she said it is sure to make some change in my size and as it can't make me larg er i hope it will change me to the size i used to be so she ate one of the cakes and was glad to see that she shrank quite fast she was soon so small that she could get through the door so she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of beasts and birds in the yard the poor liz ard bill was in the midst of the group held up by two guin ea pigs who gave it some thing to drink out of a bot tle they all made a rush at al ice as soon as she came out but she ran off as hard as she could and was soon safe in a thick wood the first thing i've got to do said al ice to her self as she walked round in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the next thing is to find my way to that love ly gar den i think that will be the best plan it was a fine scheme no doubt and well planned but the hard thing was that she did not in the least know how she should start to work it out and while she peered round through the trees a sharp bark just o ver her head made her look up in great haste illustration a great pup py looked down at her with large round eyes stretched out one paw and tried to touch her poor thing said al ice in a kind tone and tried hard to show it that she wished to be its friend but she was in a sore fright lest it should eat her up al ice could not think what to do next so she picked up a bit of stick and held it out to the pup py it jumped from the tree with a yelp of joy as if to play with it then al ice dodged round a large plant that stood near but the pup py soon found her and made a rush at the stick a gain but tum bled head o ver heels in its haste to get hold of it al ice felt that it was quite like a game with a cart horse and looked at each turn to be crushed 'neath its great feet at last to her joy it seemed to grow tired of the sport and ran a good way off and sat down with its tongue out of its mouth and its big eyes half shut this seemed to al ice a good time to get out of its sight so she set out at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the pup py's bark sound ed quite faint illustration and yet what a dear pup py it was said al ice as she stopped to rest and fanned her self with a leaf i should have liked so much to teach it tricks if if i'd been the right size to do it oh dear i've got to grow up a gain let me see how am i to do it i guess i ought to eat or drink some thing but i don't know what al ice looked all round her at the blades of grass the blooms the leaves but could not see a thing that looked like the right thing to eat or drink to make her grow there was a large mush room near her a bout the same height as she was and when she had looked all round it she thought she might as well look and see what was on the top of it she stretched up as tall as she could and her eyes met those of a large blue cat er pil lar that sat on the top with its arms fold ed smok ing a queer pipe with a long stem that bent and curved round it like a hoop chapter v a cat er pil lar tells alice what to do the cat er pil lar looked at al ice and she stared at it but did not speak at last it took the pipe from its mouth and said who are you al ice said i'm not sure sir who i am just now i know who i was when i left home but i think i have been changed two or three times since then what do you mean by that asked the cat er pil lar i fear i can't tell you for i'm sure i don't know my self but to change so man y times all in one day makes one's head swim it doesn't said the cat er pil lar well may be you haven't found it so yet said al ice but when you have to change you will some day you know i should think you'd feel it queer won't you not a bit said the cat er pil lar well you may not feel as i do said al ice all i know is it feels queer to me to change so much you said the cat er pil lar with its nose in the air who are you which brought them back to the point from which they start ed al ice was not pleased at this so she said in as stern a voice as she could i think you ought to tell me who you are first why said the cat er pil lar as al ice could not think what to say to this and as it did not seem to want to talk she turned a way come back said the cat er pil lar i have some thing to say to you al ice turned and came back keep your tem per said the cat er pil lar is that all asked al ice while she hid her an ger as well as she could no said the cat er pil lar al ice wait ed what seemed to her a long time while it sat and smoked but did not speak at last it took the pipe from its mouth and said so you think you're changed do you i fear i am sir said al ice i don't know things as i once did and i don't keep the same size but a short while at a time what things is it you don't know well i've tried to say the things i knew at school but the words all came wrong let me hear you say 'you are old fath er wil liam' said the cat er pil lar al ice folded her hands and be gan illustration 'you are old fath er wil liam' the young man said 'and your hair has be come ver y white and yet you stand all the time on your head do you think at your age it is right' 'in my youth' fath er wil liam then said to his son 'i feared it might in jure the brain but now that i know full well i have none why i do it a gain and a gain' 'you are old' said the youth 'shall i tell you once more and are now quite as large as a tun yet you turned a back som er set in at the door pray tell me now how was that done' illustration 'in my youth' said the sage as he shook his gray locks i kept all my limbs ver y sup ple by the use of this oint ment one shil ling the box al low me to sell you a coup le' 'you are old' said the youth and your jaws are too weak for an y thing tough er than su et yet you ate up the goose with the bones and the beak pray how did you man age to do it' illustration 'in my youth' said his fath er 'i took to the law and ar gued each case with my wife and the ver y great strength which it gave to my jaw has last ed the rest of my life' 'you are old' said the youth 'one would hard ly sup pose that your eye was as stead y as ev er yet you bal ance an eel on the end of your nose what makes you al ways so clev er' illustration 'i have re plied to three ques tions and that is e nough' said the fath er 'don't give your self airs do you think i can lis ten all day to such stuff be off or i'll kick you down stairs' that is not said right said the cat er pil lar not quite right i fear said al ice some of the words are changed it is wrong from first to last said the cat er pil lar then did not speak for some time at last it said what size do you want to be oh i don't care so much as to size but one does'nt like to change so much you know i don't know it said al ice was too much vexed to speak for she had nev er in all her life been talked to in that rude way do you like your size now asked the cat er pil lar well i'm not quite so large as i would like to be said al ice three inch es is such a wretch ed height to be it is a good height in deed said the cat er pil lar and reared it self up straight as it spoke it was just three inch es high but i'm not used to it plead ed poor al ice and she thought i wish the things wouldn't be so ea sy to get mad you'll get used to it in time the cat er pil lar said and put the pipe to its mouth and al ice wait ed till it should choose to speak at last it took the pipe from its mouth yawned once or twice then got down from its perch and crawled off in the grass as it went it said one side will make you tall and one side will make you small one side of what thought al ice to her self of the mush room said the cat er pil lar just as if it had heard her speak soon it was out of sight al ice stood and looked at the mush room a long time and tried to make out which were the two sides of it as it was round she found this a hard thing to do at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand and now which is which she said to her self and ate a small piece of the right hand bit to try what it would do the next mo ment she felt her chin strike her foot with a hard blow she was in a sore fright at this quick change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrink ing so fast so she set to work at once to eat some from the left hand bit come my head's free at last said al ice with great joy which changed to fear when she found that her waist and hands were no where to be seen all she could see when she looked down was a vast length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far be low her what can all that green stuff be said al ice and where has my waist got to and oh my poor hands how is it i can't see you she moved them as she spoke the green leaves shook as if to let her know her hands were there but she could not see them as there seemed to be no chance to get her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was pleased to find that her neck would bend a bout like a snake just as she had curved it down and meant to dive in the sea of green which she found was the tops of the trees 'neath which she had been walk ing a sharp hiss made her draw back in haste a large bird had flown in to her face and struck her with its wings snake snake screamed the bird i'm not a snake said al ice let me a lone snake i say snake cried the bird then add ed with a kind of sob i've tried all ways but i can not suit them i don't know what you mean said al ice the bird seemed not to hear her but went on i've tried the roots of trees and i've tried banks and i've tried a hedge but those snakes there's no way to please them as if it were not hard work to hatch the eggs but i must watch for snakes night and day why i haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks it's too bad for you to be so much put out said al ice who be gan to see what it meant and just as i had built my nest in this high tree the bird went on rais ing its voice to a shriek and just as i thought i should be free of them at last they must needs fall down from the sky ugh snake but i'm not a snake i tell you said al ice i'm a i'm a well what are you said the bird i can see you will not tell me the truth i i'm a lit tle girl said al ice though she was not sure what she was when she thought of all the chang es she had gone through that day i've seen girls in my time but none with such a neck as that said the bird no no you're a snake and there's no use to say you're not i guess you'll say next that you don't eat eggs of course i eat eggs said al ice but girls eat eggs quite as much as snakes do you know i don't know said the bird but if they do why then they're a kind of snake that's all i can say this was such a new thing to al ice that at first she did not speak which gave the bird a chance to add you want eggs now i know that quite well but i don't want eggs and if i did i should n't want yours i don't like them raw well be off then said the bird as it sat down in its nest al ice crouched down through the trees as well as she could for her neck would twist round the boughs and now and then she had to stop to get it off at last she thought of the mush room in her hands and set to work with great care to take a small bite first from the right hand then from the left till at length she brought her self down to the right size it was so long since she had been this height that it felt quite strange at first but she soon got used to it come there's half my plan done now she said how strange all these things are i'm not sure one hour what i shall be the next i'm glad i'm back to my right size the next thing is to get in to that gar den how is that to be done i should like to know as she said this she saw in front of her a small house not more than four feet high who lives there thought al ice it'll not do at all to come up on them this size why i should scare them out of their wits so she ate some of the right hand bit a gain and did not dare to go near the house till she had brought her self down to nine inch es high chapter vi pig and pep per for a while al ice stood and looked at the house and tried to think what to do next when a foot man ran out of the wood from the way he was dressed she took him to be a foot man though if she had judged by his face she would have called him a fish and knocked at the door with his fist a foot man with a round face and large eyes came to the door al ice want ed to know what it all meant so she crept a short way out of the wood to hear what they said illustration the fish foot man took from un der his arm a great let ter and hand ed it to the oth er and said in a grave tone for the duch ess from the queen the frog foot man said in the same grave tone from the queen for the duch ess then they both bowed so low that their heads touched each oth er all this made al ice laugh so much that she had to run back to the wood for fear they would hear her and when she next peeped out the fish foot man was gone and the oth er sat on the ground near the door and stared up at the sky al ice went up to the door and knocked there's no sort of use for you to knock said the foot man i'm on the same side of the door that you are and there is so much noise in the room that no one could hear you there was in deed a great noise in the house a howl ing and sneez ing with now and then a great crash as if a dish or a pot had been bro ken to piec es please then said al ice how am i to get in there might be some sense in your knock ing the foot man went on if we were not both on the same side of the door if you were in the room you might knock and i could let you out you know he looked up at the sky all the time he was speak ing which al ice thought was quite rude but per haps he can't help it she thought his eyes are so near the top of his head still he might tell me what i ask him how am i to get in she asked i shall sit here the foot man said till to mor row just then the door of the house flew o pen and a large plate skimmed out straight at his head it just grazed his nose and broke on one of the trees near him or next day may be he went on in the same tone as if he had not seen the plate illustration how am i to get in al ice asked as loud as she could speak are you to get in at all he said that's the first thing you know it was no doubt but al ice didn't like to be told so the foot man seemed to think this a good time to say a gain i shall sit here on and off for days and days but what am i to do said al ice do what you like he said oh there's no use to try to talk to him said al ice he has no sense at all and she o pened the door and went in the door led right in to a large room that was full of smoke from end to end the duch ess sat on a stool and held a child in her arms the cook stood near the fire and stirred a large pot which seemed to be full of soup there's too much pep per in that soup al ice said to her self as well as she could for sneez ing there was too much of it in the air for the duch ess sneezed now and then and as for the child it sneezed and howled all the time a large cat sat on the hearth grin ning from ear to ear please would you tell me said al ice not quite sure that it was right for her to speak first why your cat grins like that it's a che shire cat said the duch ess and that's why pig she said the last word so loud that al ice jumped but she soon saw that the duch ess spoke to the child and not to her so she went on i didn't know that che shire cats grinned in fact i didn't know that cats could grin they all can said the duch ess and most of 'em do i don't know of an y that do al ice said quite pleased to have some one to talk with you don't know much said the duch ess and that's a fact al ice did not at all like the tone in which this was said and thought it would be as well to speak of some thing else while she tried to think of what to say the cook took the pot from the fire and at once set to work throw ing things at the duch ess and the child the tongs came first then pots pans plates and cups flew thick and fast through the air the duch ess did not seem to see them e ven when they hit her and the child had howled so loud all the while that one could not tell if the blows hurt it or not oh please mind what you do cried al ice as she jumped up and down in great fear lest she should be struck hold your tongue said the duch ess then she be gan a sort of song to the child giv ing it a hard shake at the end of each line at the end of the song she threw the child at al ice and said here you may nurse it a bit if you like i must go and get read y to play cro quet with the queen and she left the room in great haste the cook threw a pan after her as she went but it just missed her al ice caught the child which held out its arms and legs on all sides just like a star fish al ice thought the poor thing snort ed like a steam en gine when she caught it and turned a bout so much it was as much as she could do at first to hold it as soon as she found out the right way to nurse it which was to twist it up in a sort of knot then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot she took it out in the fresh air if i don't take this child with me thought al ice they're sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn't it be wrong to leave it here she said the last words out loud and the child grunt ed it had left off sneez ing by this time don't grunt said al ice that is not at all the right way to do the child grunt ed a gain and al ice looked at its face to see what was wrong with it there could be no doubt that it had a turn up nose much more like a snout than a child's nose its eyes were quite small too in fact she did not like the look of the thing at all illustration per haps that was not a grunt but a sob and she looked to see if there were tears in its eyes no there were no tears if you're go ing to turn in to a pig my dear said al ice i'll have no more to do with you mind now the poor thing sobbed once more or grunted al ice couldn't say which now what am i to do with this thing when i get it home thought al ice just then it grunt ed so loud that she looked down at its face with some fear this time there could be no doubt a bout it it was a pig so she set it down and felt glad to see it trot off in to the wood as she turned to walk on she saw the che shire cat on the bough of a tree a few yards off the cat grinned when it saw al ice it looked like a good cat she thought still it had long claws and large teeth so she felt she ought to be kind to it illustration puss said al ice would you please tell me which way i ought to walk from here that de pends a good deal on where you want to go to said the cat i don't much care where said al ice then you need not care which way you walk said the cat so long as i get somewhere al ice add ed oh you're sure to do that if you don't stop said the cat al ice knew that this was true so she asked what sort of peo ple live near here in that way said the cat with a wave of its right paw lives a hat ter and in that way with a wave of its left paw lives a march hare go to see the one you like they're both mad but i don't want to go where mad folks live said al ice illustration oh you can't help that said the cat we're all mad here i'm mad you're mad how do you know i'm mad asked al ice you must be said the cat or you wouldn't have come here al ice didn't think that proved it at all but she went on and how do you know that you are mad first said the cat a dog's not mad you grant that yes well then the cat went on you know a dog growls when it's angry and wags its tail when it's pleased now i growl when i'm pleased and wag my tail when i'm an gry so you see i'm mad i say the cat purrs i do not call it a growl said al ice call it what you like said the cat do you play cro quet with the queen to day i should like it but i haven't been asked yet said al ice you'll see me there said the cat then fa ded out of sight al ice did not think this so queer as she was now used to strange things while she still looked at the place where it had been it came back a gain all at once by the by what be came of the child it asked it turned in to a pig al ice said i thought it would said the cat then once more fa ded out of sight al ice wait ed a while to see if it would come back then walked on in the way in which the march hare was said to live i've seen hat ters she said to her self so i'll go to see the march hare as she said this she looked up and there sat the cat on a branch of a tree did you say pig or fig asked the cat i said pig and i wish you wouldn't come and go all at once like you do you make one quite gid dy all right said the cat and this time it faded out in such a way that its tail went first and the last thing al ice saw was the grin which stayed some time af ter the rest of it had gone well i've seen a cat with out a grin thought al ice but a grin with out a cat it's the strang est thing i ev er saw in all my life she soon came in sight of the house of the march hare she thought it must be the right place as the chim neys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur it was so large a house that she did not like to go too near while she was so small so she ate a small piece from the left hand bit of mush room and raised her self to two feet high then she walked up to the house though with some fear lest it should be mad as the cat had said chapter vii a mad tea party there was a ta ble set out in the shade of the trees in front of the house and the march hare and the hat ter were at tea a dor mouse sat be tween them but it seemed to have gone to sleep the ta ble was a long one but the three were all crowd ed at one cor ner of it no room no room they cried out as soon as they saw al ice there's plen ty of room she said and sat down in a large arm chair at one end of the table have some wine the march hare said in a kind tone al ice looked all round the ta ble but there was not a thing on it but tea i don't see the wine she said there isn't an y said the march hare then it wasn't po lite of you to ask me to have wine said al ice it wasn't po lite of you to sit down when no one had asked you to have a seat said the march hare i didn't know it was your ta ble said al ice it's laid for more than three your hair wants cut ting said the hat ter he had looked hard at al ice for some time and this was his first speech you should learn not to speak to a guest like that said al ice it is ve ry rude the hat ter stretched his eyes quite wide at this but all he said was why is a rav en like a desk illustration come we shall have some fun now thought al ice i think i can guess that she added out loud do you mean that you think you can find out the an swer to it asked the march hare i do said al ice then you should say what you mean the march hare went on i do al ice said at least at least i mean what i say that's the same thing you know not the same thing a bit said the hat ter why you might just as well say 'i see what i eat' is the same thing as 'i eat what i see' you might just as well say added the march hare that 'i like what i get' is the same thing as 'i get what i like' you might just as well say added the dor mouse who seemed to be talk ing in his sleep that 'i breathe when i sleep' is the same thing as 'i sleep when i breathe' it is the same with you said the hat ter no one spoke for some time while al ice tried to think of all she knew of rav ens and desks which wasn't much the hat ter was the first to speak what day of the month is it he said turn ing to al ice he had his watch in his hand looked at it and shook it now and then while he held it to his ear al ice thought a while and said the fourth two days wrong sighed the hat ter i told you but ter wouldn't suit this watch he add ed with a scowl as he looked at the march hare it was the best but ter the march hare said yes but some crumbs must have got in the hat ter growled you shouldn't have put it in with the bread knife the march hare took the watch and looked at it then dipped it in to his cup of tea and looked at it a gain but all he could think to say was it was the best but ter you know oh what a fun ny watch said al ice it tells the day of the month and doesn't tell what o'clock it is why should it growled the hat ter does your watch tell what year it is of course not said al ice but there's no need that it should since it stays the same year such a long time which is just the case with mine said the hat ter which seemed to al ice to have no sense in it at all i don't quite know what you mean she said the dor mouse has gone to sleep once more said the hat ter and he poured some hot tea on the tip of its nose the dor mouse shook its head and said with its eyes still closed of course of course just what i want ed to say my self have you guessed the rid dle yet the hat ter asked turn ing to al ice no i give it up she said what's the an swer i do not know at all said the hat ter nor i said the march hare al ice sighed i think you might do bet ter with the time than to waste it by ask ing rid dles that have no an swers if you knew time as well as i do you wouldn't say 'waste it' it's him i don't know what you mean al ice said of course you don't said the hat ter with a toss of his head i dare say you nev er e ven spoke to time may be not she said but i know i have to beat time when i learn to sing oh that's it said the hat ter he won't stand beat ing now if you kept on good terms with him he would do an y thing you liked with the clock say it was nine o'clock just time to go to school you'd have but to give a hint to time and round goes the clock half past one time for lunch i wish it was the march hare said to it self illustration that would be grand i'm sure said al ice but then i shouldn't be hun gry for it you know not at first per haps but you could keep it to half past one as long as you liked said the hat ter is that the way you do asked al ice the hat ter shook his head and sighed not i he said time and i fell out last march it was at the great con cert giv en by the queen of hearts and i had to sing 'twin kle twin kle lit tle bat how i wonder what you're at' you know the song per haps i've heard some thing like it said alice it goes on you know the hat ter said in this way 'up a bove the world you fly like a tea tray in the sky twin kle twin kle ' here the dor mouse shook it self and sang in its sleep twin kle twin kle twin kle twin kle and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop well while i sang the first verse the hat ter went on the queen bawled out 'see how he mur ders the time off with his head' and ev er since that he won't do a thing i ask it's al ways six o'clock now a bright thought came in to al ice's head is that why so man y tea things are put out here she asked yes that's it said the hat ter with a sigh it's al ways tea time and we've no time to wash the things then you keep mov ing round i guess said al ice just so said the hat ter as the things get used up but when you come to the place where you started what do you do then al ice dared to ask i'm tired of this yawned the march hare i vote you tell us a tale i fear i don't know one said al ice i want a clean cup spoke up the hat ter he moved on as he spoke and the dor mouse moved in to his place the march hare moved in to the dor mouse's place and al ice none too well pleased took the place of the march hare the hat ter was the on ly one to get an y good from the change and al ice was a good deal worse off as the march hare had up set the milk jug in to his plate now for your sto ry the march hare said to al ice i'm sure i don't know alice be gan i i don't think then you shouldn't talk said the hat ter illustration this was more than al ice could stand so she got up and walked off and though she looked back once or twice and half hoped they would call af ter her they didn't seem to know that she was gone the last time she saw them they were trying to put the poor dor mouse head first in to the tea pot well i'll not go there a gain said al ice as she picked her way through the wood it's the dull est tea par ty i was ev er at in all my life as al ice said this she saw that one of the trees had a door that led right in to it that's strange she thought but i haven't seen a thing to day that isn't strange i think i may as well go in at once and in she went once more she found her self in a long hall and close to the lit tle glass stand she took up the lit tle key and un locked the door that led to the gar den then she set to work to eat some of the mush room which she still had with her when she was a bout a foot high she went through the door and walked down the lit tle hall then she found herself at last in the love ly garden where she had seen the bright blooms and the cool foun tains chapter viii the queen's cro quet ground a large rose tree stood near the gar den gate the blooms on it were white but three men who seemed to be in great haste were paint ing them red al ice thought this a strange thing to do so she went near er to watch them just as she came up to them she heard one of them say look out now five don't splash paint on me like that i couldn't help it said five six knocked my arm on which six looked up and said that's right five don't fail to lay the blame on some one else you needn't talk said five i heard the queen say your head must come off what for asked the one who spoke first what is that to you two said six it is much to him and i'll tell him said five he brought the cook tu lip roots for on ions six flung down the brush and said well of all the wrong things just then his eyes chanced to fall on al ice who stood and watched them and he checked him self at once five and two looked round al so and all of them bowed low would you tell me please said al ice why you paint those ros es five and six did not speak but looked at two who said in a low voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rose tree and by mis take a white one was put in and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know so you see miss we are hard at work to get it paint ed so that she may not just then five who had stood and watched the gate for some time called out the queen the queen and the three men at once threw them selves flat up on their fa ces al ice heard the tramp of feet and looked round glad if at last she could see the queen illustration first came ten sol diers with clubs these were all shaped like the three men at the rose tree long and flat like cards with their hands and feet at the cor ners next came ten men who were trimmed with di a monds and walked two and two like the sol diers the ten chil dren of the king and queen came next and the little dears came with a skip and a jump hand in hand by twos they were trimmed with hearts next came the guests most of whom were kings and queens al ice saw the white rab bit with them he did not seem at ease though he smiled at all that was said he didn't see al ice as he went by then came the knave of hearts with the king's crown on a red vel vet cush ion and last of all came the king and queen of hearts illustration at first al ice thought it might be right for her to lie down on her face like the three men at the rose tree but what would be the use of such a fine show she thought if all had to lie down so that they couldn't see it so she stood where she was and wait ed when they came to where she stood they all stopped and looked at her and the queen said in a stern voice who is this she spoke to the knave of hearts who bowed and smiled but did not speak fool said the queen with a toss of her head then she turned to al ice and asked what's your name child my name is al ice so please your ma jes ty said al ice but she thought to her self why they're a mere pack of cards i need have no fears of them and who are these asked the queen as she point ed to the three men who still lay round the rose tree for you see as they all lay on their faces and their backs were the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell who they were how should i know said al ice and thought it strange that she should speak to a queen in that way the queen turned red with rage glared at her for a mo ment like a wild beast then screamed off with her head off non sense said al ice in a loud firm voice and the queen said no more the king laid his hand on the queen's arm and said think my dear she is but a child the queen turned from him with a scowl and said to the knave turn them o ver the knave did so with one foot get up said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the three men jumped up at once and bowed to the king and queen and to the whole crowd leave off that screamed the queen you make me gid dy then she turned to the rose tree and asked what have you been do ing here may it please your ma jes ty said two and went down on one knee as he spoke we were try ing i see said the queen who in the mean time had seen that some of the ros es were paint ed red and some were still white off with their heads and the crowd moved on while three of the sol diers stayed to cut off the heads of the poor men who ran to al ice for help they shan't hurt you she said as she hid them in a large flow er pot that stood near the three sol diers walked round and looked for them a short while then marched off are their heads off shout ed the queen their heads are gone if it please your ma jes ty the sol diers shouted back that's right shouted the queen can you play cro quet she asked al ice yes shouted al ice come on then roared the queen and al ice went on with them it's it's a fine day said a weak voice at her side it was the white rab bit who peeped up in to her face yes said al ice where's the duch ess hush hush said the rab bit in a low tone he looked back as he spoke then raised up on tip toe put his mouth close to her ear and whis pered she's to have her head cut off what for asked al ice did you say 'what a pit y' the rab bit asked no i didn't said al ice i don't think it's at all a pit y i said 'what for' illustration she boxed the queen's ears the rab bit be gan al ice gave a lit tle scream of joy oh hush the rab bit whis pered in a great fright the queen will hear you you see she came late and the queen said each one to his place shout ed the queen in a loud voice and peo ple ran this way and that in great haste and soon each one had found his place and the game be gan al ice thought she had nev er seen such a strange cro quet ground in all her life it was all ridges the balls were live hedge hogs the mal lets were live birds and the sol diers bent down and stood on their hands and feet to make the arch es at first al ice found it hard to use a live bird for a mal let it was a large bird with a long neck and long legs she tucked it un der her arm with its legs down but just as she got its neck straight and thought now she could give the ball a good blow with its head the bird would twist its neck round and give her such a queer look that she could not help laugh ing and by the time she had got its head down a gain she found that the hedge hog had crawled off then too there was al ways a ridge or a hole in the way of where she want ed to send her ball and she couldn't find an arch in its place for the men would get up and walk off when it pleased them al ice soon made up her mind that it was a ve ry hard game to play the queen was soon in a great rage and stamped a bout shout ing off with his head or off with her head with each breath al ice felt quite ill at ease to be sure she had not as yet had cause to feel the wrath of the queen but she knew not how soon it might be her turn and then she thought what shall i do as she was look ing round for some way to get off with out be ing seen she saw a strange thing in the air which she at last made out to be a grin and she said to her self it's the cat now i shall have some one to talk to how do you do said the cat as soon as its whole mouth came out al ice wait ed till she saw the eyes then nod ded it's no use to speak to it till its ears have come or at least one of them in a short time the whole head came in view then she put down her bird and told him of the game glad that she had some one that was pleased to hear her talk i don't think they are at all fair in the game said al ice with a scowl and they all talk so loud that one can't hear one's self speak and they don't have rules to play by at least if they have they don't mind them and you don't know how bad it is to have to use live things to play with the arch i have to go through next walked off just now to the far end of the ground and i should have struck the queen's hedge hog but it ran off when it saw that mine was near how do you like the queen asked the cat in a low voice not at all said al ice she's so just then she saw that the queen was be hind her and heard what she said so she went on sure to win that it's not worth while to go on with the game the queen smiled and passed on who are you talk ing to said the king as he came up to al ice and stared at the cat's head as if it were a strange sight it's a friend of mine a che shire cat said al ice i don't like the look of it at all said the king it may kiss my hand if it likes i don't want to said the cat don't be rude and don't look at me like that said the king a cat may look at a king said al ice i've read that in some book but i can't tell where well it must get off from here said the king in a firm voice and he called to the queen who was near my dear i wish you would see that this cat leaves here at once the queen had but one cure for all ills great or small off with his head she said and did not so much as look round i'll fetch the sol dier my self said the king and rushed off al ice thought she might as well go back and see how the game went on she heard the queen's voice in the dis tance as she screamed with rage off with his head he has missed his turn al ice did not like the look of things at all for the game was so mixed she could not tell when her turn came so she went off to find her hedge hog she came up with two hedge hogs in a fierce fight and thought now was a good time to strike one of them but her mal let was gone to the oth er side of the ground and she saw it in a weak sort of way as it tried to fly up in to a tree by the time she had caught the bird and brought it back the fight was o ver and both hedge hogs were out of sight i don't care much thought al ice for there is not an arch on this side the ground so she went back to have some more talk with her friend when she reached the place she found quite a crowd round the cat the king and the queen and the sol dier who had come with the axe to cut off the cat's head were all talking at once while all the rest stood with closed lips and looked quite grave as soon as they saw al ice they want ed her to say which one was right but as all three spoke at once she found it hard to make out what they said illustration the sol dier said that you couldn't cut off a head unless there was a bod y to cut it off from that he had nev er had to do such a thing and he wouldn't be gin it now at his time of life the king said that all heads could be cut off and that you weren't to talk non sense the queen said if some thing wasn't done in less than no time heads should come off all round it was this last threat that had made the whole crowd look so grave as al ice came up al ice could think of nothing else to say but ask the duch ess it is her cat fetch her here the queen said to the sol dier and he went off like an ar row the cat's head start ed to fade out of sight as soon as he was gone and by the time he had come back with the duch ess it could not be seen at all so the king and the man ran up and down look ing for it while the rest went back to the game chapter ix the mock tur tle you can't think how glad i am to see you once more you dear old thing said the duch ess as she took al ice's arm and they walked off side by side al ice was glad to see her in such a fine mood and thought to her self that the duch ess might not be so bad as she had seemed to be when they first met then al ice fell in to a long train of thought as to what she would do if she were a duch ess she quite lost sight of the duch ess by her side and was star tled when she heard her voice close to her ear you have some thing on your mind my dear and that makes you for get to talk i can't tell you just now what the mor al of that is but i shall think of it in a bit are you sure it has one asked al ice tut tut child said the duch ess all things have a mor al if you can but find it and she squeezed up close to al ice's side as she spoke al ice did not much like to have the duch ess keep so close but she didn't like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could the game is not so bad now al ice said think ing she ought to fill in the time with talk of some kind 'tis so said the duch ess and the mor al of that is 'oh 'tis love 'tis love that makes the world go round' some one said it's done by each one mind ing his own work said al ice ah well it means much the same thing said the duch ess then add ed and the mor al of that is 'take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves' illustration how she likes to find mor als in things said al ice why don't you talk more and not think so long asked the duch ess i've a right to think said al ice in a sharp tone for she was tired and vexed just as much right said the duch ess as pigs have to fly and the mor but here the voice of the duch ess died out in the midst of her pet word mor al and al ice felt the arm that was linked in hers shake as if with fright al ice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms fold ed and a dark frown up on her face a fine day your ma jes ty the duch ess be gan in a weak voice now i warn you in time shout ed the queen with a stamp on the ground as she spoke ei ther you or your head must be off and that in a bout half no time take your choice the duch ess took her choice and was gone in a mo ment let's go on with the game the queen said to al ice and al ice was in too great a fright to speak but went with her back to the cro quet ground the guests had all sat down in the shade to rest while the queen was a way but as soon as they saw her they rushed back to the game while the queen said if they were not in their pla ces at once it would cost them their lives all the time the game went on the queen kept shout ing off with his head or off with her head so that by the end of half an hour there was no one left on the grounds but the king the queen and al ice then the queen left off quite out of breath and said to al ice have you seen the mock tur tle yet no said al ice i don't know what a mock tur tle is it is a thing mock tur tle soup is made from the queen said i've nev er seen or heard of one alice said come on then and he shall tell you his sto ry said the queen as they walked off al ice heard the king say in a low tone to those whom the queen had doomed to death you may all go free come that's a good thing thought al ice for she felt ver y sad that all those men must have their heads cut off illustration they soon came to where a gry phon lay fast a sleep in the sun if you don't know what it is like look at the pic ture up dull thing said the queen and take this young la dy to see the mock tur tle i must go back now and she walked a way and left al ice with the gry phon al ice was by no means pleased with its looks but she thought she would be quite as safe with it as she would be with the queen so she wait ed the gry phon sat up and rubbed its eyes then watched the queen till she was out of sight then it laughed what fun it said half to it self half to alice what is the fun she asked why she it said it's all a whim of hers they nev er cut off those heads you know come on soon they saw the mock tur tle sitting sad and lone on a ledge of rock and as they came near al ice could hear him sigh as if his heart would break what makes him so sad al ice asked it's all a whim of his said the gry phon he hasn't got no grief you know come on illustration so they went up to the mock tur tle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but did not speak this here young la dy said the gry phon she wants for to know a bout your past life she do i'll tell it to her said the mock tur tle in a deep sad tone sit down both of you and don't speak a word till i get through so they sat down and no one spoke for some time once said the mock tur tle at last with a deep sigh i was a re al tur tle when we were young we went to school in the sea we were taught by an old tur tle we used to call him tor toise why did you call him tor toise if he wasn't one al ice asked he taught us that's why said the mock tur tle you are quite dull not to know that shame on you to ask such a sim ple thing add ed the gry phon then they both sat and looked at poor al ice who felt as if she could sink into the earth at last the gry phon said to the mock tur tle drive on old fellow don't be all day a bout it and he went on in these words yes we went to school in the sea though you mayn't think it's true i didn't say i did not said al ice you did said the mock tur tle hold your tongue add ed the gry phon the mock tur tle went on we were well taught in fact we went to school each day i've been to a day school too said alice you needn't be so proud as all that were you taught wash ing asked the mock tur tle of course not said al ice ah then yours wasn't a good school said the mock tur tle now at ours they had at the end of the bill 'french mu sic and wash ing ex tra' you couldn't have need ed it much in the sea said al ice i didn't learn it said the mock tur tle with a sigh i just took the first course what was that asked al ice reel ing and writh ing of course at first the mock tur tle said an old eel used to come once a week he taught us to drawl to stretch and to faint in coils what was that like al ice asked well i can't show you my self he said i'm too stiff and the gry phon didn't learn it how man y hours a day did you do les sons asked al ice ten hours the first day said the mock tur tle nine the next and so on what a strange plan said al ice that's why they're called les sons said the gry phon they les sen from day to day this was such a new thing to al ice that she sat still a good while and didn't speak then there would be a day when you would have no school she said of course there would said the mock tur tle what did you do then asked al ice i'm tired of this said the gry phon tell her now of the games we played chapter x the lob ster dance the mock tur tle sighed looked at al ice and tried to speak but for a min ute or two sobs choked his voice same as if he had a bone in his throat said the gry phon and set to work to shake him and punch him in the back at last the mock tur tle found his voice and with tears run ning down his cheeks he went on illustration you may not have lived much in the sea i have n't said al ice so you can not know what a fine thing a lob ster dance is no said al ice what sort of a dance is it why said the gry phon you first form in a line on the sea shore two lines cried the mock tur tle seals tur tles and so on then when you've cleared all the small fish out of the way that takes some time put in the gry phon you move to the front twice each with a lob ster by his side cried the gry phon of course the mock tur tle said move to the front twice change and come back in same way said the gry phon then you know the mock tur tle went on you throw the the lob sters shout ed the gry phon with a bound in to the air as far out to sea as you can swim out for them screamed the gry phon turn heels o ver head in the sea cried the mock tur tle change a gain yelled the gry phon at the top of his voice then back to land and that's all the first part said the mock tur tle both the gry phon and the mock tur tle had jumped a bout like mad things all this time now they sat down quite sad and still and looked at al ice it must be a pret ty dance said al ice would you like to see some of it asked the mock tur tle oh yes she said come let's try the first part said the mock tur tle to the gry phon we can do it without lob sters you know which shall sing oh you sing said the gry phon i don't know the words so they danced round and round al ice now and then tread ing on her toes when they passed too close they waved their fore paws to mark the time while the mock tur tle sang a queer kind of song each verse of which end ed with these words 'will you won't you will you won't you will you join the dance will you won't you will you won't you won't you join the dance' thank you it's a fine dance to watch said al ice glad that it was o ver at last now said the gry phon tell us a bout what you have seen and done in your life i could tell you of the strange things i have seen to day said al ice with some doubt as to their wish ing to hear it all right go on they both cried so al ice told them what she had been through that day from the time when she first saw the white rab bit they came up quite close to her one on each side and sat still till she got to the part where she tried to say you are old fath er wil liam and the words all came wrong then the mock tur tle drew a long breath and said that's quite strange it's all as strange as it can be said the gry phon it all came wrong the mock tur tle said while he seemed to be in deep thought i should like to hear her try to say some thing now tell her to be gin he looked at the gry phon as if he thought it had the right to make al ice do as it pleased illustration stand up and say 'tis the voice of the slug gard' said the gry phon how they do try to make one do things thought al ice i might just as well be at school at once she stood up and tried to re peat it but her head was so full of the lob ster dance that she didn't know what she was say ing and the words all came ver y queer in deed 'tis the voice of the lob ster i heard him de clare 'you have baked me too brown i must su gar my hair' as a duck with its eye lids so he with his nose trims his belt and his but tons and turns out his toes that's not the way i used to say it when i was a child said the gry phon well i never heard it before said the mock tur tle but there's no sense in it at all al ice did not speak she sat down with her face in her hands and thought will things nev er be as they used to an y more i should like you to tell what it means said the mock tur tle she can't do that said the gry phon go on with the next verse but his toes the mock tur tle went on how could he turn them out with his nose you know go on with the next verse the gry phon said once more it begins 'i passed by his gar den' al ice thought she must do as she was told though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on i passed by his gar den and marked with one eye how the owl and the oys ter were shar ing the pie what is the use of say ing all that stuff the mock tur tle broke in if you don't tell what it means as you go on i tell you it is all non sense yes i think you might as well leave off said the gry phon and al ice was but too glad to do so shall we try the lob ster dance once more the gry phon went on or would you like the mock tur tle to sing you a song oh a song please if the mock tur tle would be so kind al ice said with so much zest that the gry phon threw back his head and said hm well each one to his own taste sing her 'tur tle soup' will you old fel low the mock tur tle heaved a deep sigh and in a voice choked with sobs be gan his song but just then the cry of the tri al is on was heard a long way off come on cried the gry phon he took her by the hand ran off and did not wait to hear the song what trial is it al ice pant ed as she ran but the gry phon on ly said come on and still ran as fast as he could chapter xi who stole the tarts the king and queen of hearts were seat ed on their throne when al ice and the gry phon came up with a great crowd a bout them there were all sorts of small birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the knave stood in front of them in chains with a sol dier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rab bit with a trum pet in one hand and a roll of pa per in the other in the mid dle of the court was a ta ble with a large dish of tarts on it they looked so good that it made al ice feel as if she would like to eat some of them i wish they'd get the tri al done she thought and hand round the pies but there seemed no chance of this so to pass the time a way she looked round at the strange things a bout her this was the first time al ice had been in a court of this kind and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the names of most things she saw there that's the judge she thought i know him by his great wig the judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crown on top of his wig he looked quite ill at ease and that's the ju ry box thought al ice and those twelve things she had to say things you see for some of them were beasts and some were birds i guess are the ju rors she said this last word two or three times as she was proud that she knew it for she was right when she thought that few girls of her age would have known what it all meant the twelve ju rors all wrote on slates what can they have to write now al ice asked the gry phon in a low tone the tri al has not be gun yet they're put ting down their names the gry phon said for fear they should for get them stu pid things al ice said in a loud voice but stopped at once for the white rab bit cried out si lence in court and the king looked round to make out who spoke al ice could see quite well that the ju rors all wrote down stu pid things on their slates she could e ven make out that one of them didn't know how to spell stu pid and that he asked the one by his side to tell him a nice mud dle their slates will be in by the time the tri al's ended thought al ice one of the ju rors had a pen cil that squeaked as he wrote this of course al ice could not stand so she went round near him and soon found a chance to get it from him this she did in such a way that the poor ju ror it was bill the liz ard could not make out at all where it was so he wrote with one fin ger for the rest of the day of course this was of no use as it left no mark on the slate read the charge said the king on this the white rab bit blew three blasts on the trum pet and then from the pa per in his hand read the queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a sum mer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them quite a way the ju ry will now take the case said the king not yet not yet the rab bit said in haste there is a great deal else to come first illustration call the first wit ness said the king and the white rab bit blew three blasts on the trum pet and called out first wit ness the first to come was the hat ter he came in with a tea cup in one hand and a piece of bread and but ter in the oth er i beg par don your ma jes ty he said but i had to bring these in as i was not quite through with my tea when i was sent for you ought to have been through said the king when did you be gin the hat ter looked at the march hare who had just come in to court arm in arm with the dor mouse fourth of march i think it was he said fifth said the march hare sixth add ed the dor mouse write that down said the king to the ju ry and they wrote down all three dates on their slates and then added them up and changed the sum to shil lings and pence take off your hat the king said to the hat ter it isn't mine said the hat ter stole it cried the king as he turned to the jury who at once wrote it down i keep them to sell the hat ter added i've none of my own i'm a hat ter here the queen put on her eye glass es and stared hard at the hat ter who turned pale with fright tell what you know of this case said the king and don't be nerv ous or i'll have your head off on the spot this did not seem to calm him at all he shift ed from one foot to the other and looked at the queen and in his fright he bit a large piece out of his tea cup in place of the bread and but ter just then al ice felt a strange thrill the cause of which she could not make out till she saw she had be gun to grow a gain i wish you wouldn't squeeze so said the dor mouse i haven't room to breathe i can't help it said al ice i'm grow ing you've no right to grow here said the dor mouse don't talk such non sense said al ice you know you grow too yes but not so fast as to squeeze the breath out of those who sit by me he got up and crossed to the oth er side of the court all this time the queen had not left off star ing at the hat ter and just as the dor mouse crossed the court she said to one of the men bring me the list of those who sang in the last con cert on which the poor hat ter trembled so that he shook both his shoes off illustration tell what you know of this case the king called out a gain or i'll have your head off if you do shake i'm a poor man your ma jes ty the hat ter be gan in a weak voice and i hadn't but just be gun my tea not more than a week or so and what with the bread and but ter so thin and the twink ling of the tea the twink ling of what asked the king it be gan with the tea the hat ter said of course twink ling be gins with a t said the king do you take me for a dunce go on i'm a poor man the hat ter went on and most things twink led af ter that but the march hare said i didn't said the march hare in great haste you did said the hat ter i de ny it said the march hare he de nies it said the king leave out that part well i'm sure the dor mouse said the hat ter went on with a look at the dor mouse to see if he would de ny it too but he was fast a sleep then i cut some more bread and but what did the dor mouse say asked one of the ju ry that i can't tell said the hat ter you must tell or i'll have your head off said the king the wretch ed hat ter dropped his cup and bread and went down on one knee i'm a poor man he be gan you're a poor speak er said the king here one of the guin ea pigs cheered and one of the men seized him thrust him in to a bag which tied up with strings and then sat up on it if that's all you know you may stand down the king said i'm as low as i can get now said the hat ter i'm on the floor as it is then you may sit down the king said i'd like to get through with my tea first said the hat ter with a look at the queen who still read the list in her hand you may go said the king and the hat ter left the court in such haste that he did not e ven wait to put his shoes on and just take his head off out side the queen add ed to one of the sol diers but the hat ter was out of sight be fore the man could get to the door call the next wit ness said the king the next to come was the duch ess' cook and al ice guessed who it was by the way the peo ple near the door sneezed all at once illustration tell what you know of this case said the king shan't said the cook the king looked at the white rab bit who said in a low voice your ma jes ty must make her tell well if i must i must said the king with a sad look he fold ed his arms and frowned at the cook till his eyes were al most out of sight then asked in a stern voice what are tarts made of pep per most ly said the cook sug ar said a weak voice near her catch that dor mouse the queen shrieked out off with his head turn him out of court pinch him off with his head the whole court ran here and there get ting the dor mouse turned out and by the time this was done the cook had gone that's all right said the king as if he were glad to be rid of her call the next and he add ed in a low tone to the queen now my dear you must take the next wit ness in hand it quite makes my head ache al ice watched the white rab bit as he looked o ver the list she thought to her self i want to see what the next witness will be like for they haven't found out much yet think if you can how she felt when the white rab bit read out at the top of his shrill lit tle voice the name al ice chapter xii al ice on the stand here cried al ice but she quite for got how large she had grown in the last few min utes and jumped up in such haste that the edge of her skirt tipped the ju ry box and turned them all out on the heads of the crowd be low and there they lay sprawl ing a bout which made her think of a globe of gold fish which she had up set the week be fore illustration oh i beg your par don she said and picked them up and put them backed in the ju ry box as fast as she could the tri al can not go on said the king in a grave voice till all the men are back in place all he said with great force and looked hard at al ice she looked at the ju ry box and saw that in her haste she had put the liz ard in head first and the poor thing was wav ing its tail in the air but could not move she soon got it out and put it right not that it mat ters much she thought i should think it would be quite as much use in the tri al one way up as the oth er illustration as soon as their slates and pen cils had been hand ed back to them the ju ry set to work to write out an ac count of their fall all but the liz ard who seem ed too weak to write but sat and gazed up in to the roof of the court what do you know of this case the king asked al ice not one thing said al ice not one thing at all asked the king not one thing at all said al ice write that down the king said to the ju ry the king sat for some time and wrote in his note book then he called out si lence and read from his book rule for ty two each one more than a mile high to leave the court all looked at al ice i'm not a mile high said al ice you are said the king not far from two miles high add ed the queen well i shan't go said al ice for i know that's a new rule you have just made it's the first rule in the book said the king then it ought to be rule one said al ice the king turned pale and shut his note book at once the ju ry can now take the case he said in a weak voice there's more to come yet please your ma jes ty said the white rab bit as he jumped up this thing has just been picked up what's in it asked the queen i haven't read it yet said the white rab bit but it seems to be a note from the knave of hearts to some one whose name is on it said one of the ju rors there's no name on it said the white rab bit he looked at it with more care as he spoke and add ed it isn't a note at all it's a set of rhymes please your ma jes ty said the knave i didn't write it and they can't prove that i did there's no name signed at the end if you didn't sign it said the king that makes your case worse you must have meant some harm or you'd have signed your name like an hon est man all clapped their hands at this as it was the first smart thing the king had said that day that proves his guilt said the queen it does not prove a thing said al ice why you don't so much as know what the rhymes are read them said the king where shall i be gin your ma jes ty the white rab bit asked why at the first verse of course the king said look ing quite grave and go on till you come to the end then stop the white rab bit read they told me you had been to her and spoke of me to him she gave me a good name in deed but said i could not swim he sent them word that i had gone we know it to be true if she should push the mat ter on what would be come of you i gave her one they gave him two you gave us three or more they all came back from him to you though they were mine be fore my no tion was she liked him best be fore she had this fit this must be kept from all the rest but him and you and it that's the best thing we've heard yet said the king rub bing his hands as if much pleased so now let the ju ry if one of you can tell what it means said al ice she had grown so large by this time that she had no fear of the king i should be glad to hear it i don't think there's a grain of sense in it the ju ry all wrote down on their slates she doesn't think there's a grain of sense in it but no one tried to tell what it meant if there's no sense in it said the king that saves a world of work you know as we needn't try to find it and yet i don't know he went on as he spread out the rhymes on his knee and looked at them with one eye i seem to find some sense in them 'said i could not swim' you can't swim can you he added turn ing to the knave the knave shook his head with a sigh do i look like it he said which it was plain he did not as he was made of card board all right so far said the king and he went on 'we know it to be true' that's the ju ry of course 'i gave her one they gave him two' that must be what he did with the tarts you know but it goes on 'they all came back from him to you' said al ice why there they are said the king point ing to the tarts isn't that as clear as can be then it goes on 'before she had this fit' you don't have fits my dear i think he said to the queen illustration no no said the queen in a great rage throw ing an ink stand at the liz ard as she spoke then the words don't fit you he said and looked round the court with a smile but no one spoke it's a pun he added in a fierce tone then all the court laughed let the ju ry now bring in their verdict the king said no no said the queen sen tence first then the ver dict such stuff said al ice out loud of course the ju ry must make hold your tongue screamed the queen i won't said al ice off with her head shout ed the queen at the top of her voice no one moved who cares for you said al ice she had grown to her full size by this time you are noth ing but a pack of cards at this the whole pack rose up in the air and flew down up on her she gave a lit tle scream and tried to beat them off and found her self ly ing on the bank with her head in the lap of her sis ter who was brush ing a way some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees on to her face wake up al ice dear said her sis ter why what a long sleep you have had oh i've had such a strange dream said al ice and then she told her sis ter as well as she could all these strange things that you have just read a bout and when she came to the end of it her sis ter kissed her and said it was a strange dream dear i'm sure but run now in to your tea it's get ting late so al ice got up and ran off think ing while she ran as well she might what a won der ful dream it had been burt's series of one syllable books titles handsome illuminated cloth binding a series of classics
