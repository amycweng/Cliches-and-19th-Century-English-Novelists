i tom must go to school what i want you know said mr tulliver of dorlcote mill what i want is to give tom a good eddication that was what i was thinking of when i gave notice for him to leave th' academy at lady day i meant to put him to a downright good school at midsummer the two years at th' academy 'ud ha' done well enough the miller went on if i'd meant to make a miller and farmer of him like myself but i should like tom to be a bit of a scholard so as he might be up to the tricks o' these fellows as talk fine and write with a flourish it 'ud be a help to me wi' these lawsuits and things mr tulliver was speaking to his wife a blond comely woman in a fan shaped cap well mr tulliver said she you know best but hadn't i better kill a couple o' fowl and have th' aunts and uncles to dinner next week so as you may hear what sister glegg and sister pullet have got to say about it there's a couple o' fowl wants killing you may kill every fowl i' the yard if you like bessy but i shall ask neither aunt nor uncle what i'm to do wi' my own lad said mr tulliver dear heart said mrs tulliver how can you talk so mr tulliver however if tom's to go to a new school i should like him to go where i can wash him and mend him else he might as well have calico as linen for they'd be one as yallow as th' other before they'd been washed half a dozen times and then when the box is goin' backards and forrards i could send the lad a cake or a pork pie or an apple well well we won't send him out o' reach o' the carrier's cart if other things fit in said mr tulliver but you mustn't put a spoke i' the wheel about the washin' if we can't get a school near enough but it's an uncommon puzzling thing to know what school to pick mr tulliver paused a minute or two and dived with both hands into his pockets as if he hoped to find some idea there then he said i know what i'll do i'll talk it over wi' riley he's coming to morrow well mr tulliver i've put the sheets out for the best bed and kezia's got 'em hanging at the fire they aren't the best sheets but they're good enough for anybody to sleep in be he who he will as mrs tulliver spoke she drew a bright bunch of keys from her pocket and singled out one rubbing her thumb and finger up and down it with a placid smile while she looked at the clear fire i think i've hit it bessy said mr tulliver after a short silence riley's as likely a man as any to know o' some school he's had schooling himself an' goes about to all sorts o' places auctioneering and vallyin' and that i want tom to be such a sort o' man as riley you know as can talk pretty nigh as well as if it was all wrote out for him and a good solid knowledge o' business too well said mrs tulliver so far as talking proper and knowing everything and walking with a bend in his back and setting his hair up i shouldn't mind the lad being brought up to that but them fine talking men from the big towns mostly wear the false shirt fronts they wear a frill till it's all a mess and then hide it with a bib i know riley does and then if tom's to go and live at mudport like riley he'll have a house with a kitchen hardly big enough to turn in an' niver get a fresh egg for his breakfast an' sleep up three pair o' stairs or four for what i know an' be burnt to death before he can get down no no said mr tulliver i've no thoughts of his going to mudport i mean him to set up his office at st ogg's close by us an' live at home i doubt tom's a bit slowish he takes after your family bessy yes that he does said mrs tulliver he's wonderful for liking a deal o' salt in his broth that was my brother's way and my father's before him it seems a bit of a pity though said mr tulliver as the lad should take after the mother's side instead o' the little wench the little un takes after my side now she's twice as 'cute as tom yes mr tulliver and it all runs to naughtiness how to keep her in a clean pinafore two hours together passes my cunning an' now you put me i' mind continued mrs tulliver rising and going to the window i don't know where she is now an' it's pretty nigh tea time ah i thought so there she is wanderin' up an' down by the water like a wild thing she'll tumble in some day mrs tulliver rapped the window sharply beckoned and shook her head you talk o' 'cuteness mr tulliver she said as she sat down but i'm sure the child's very slow i' some things for if i send her upstairs to fetch anything she forgets what she's gone for pooh nonsense said mr tulliver she's a straight black eyed wench as anybody need wish to see and she can read almost as well as the parson but her hair won't curl all i can do with it and she's so franzy about having it put i' paper and i've such work as never was to make her stand and have it pinched with th' irons cut it off cut it off short said the father rashly how can you talk so mr tulliver she's too big a gell gone nine and tall of her age to have her hair cut short maggie maggie continued the mother as the child herself entered the room where's the use o' my telling you to keep away from the water you'll tumble in and be drownded some day and then you'll be sorry you didn't do as mother told you maggie threw off her bonnet now mrs tulliver desiring her daughter to have a curled crop had had it cut too short in front to be pushed behind the ears and as it was usually straight an hour after it had been taken out of paper maggie was incessantly tossing her head to keep the dark heavy locks out of her gleaming black eyes oh dear oh dear maggie what are you thinkin' of to throw your bonnet down there take it upstairs there's a good gell an' let your hair be brushed an' put your other pinafore on an' change your shoes do for shame an' come and go on with your patchwork like a little lady o mother said maggie in a very cross tone i don't want to do my patchwork what not your pretty patchwork to make a counterpane for your aunt glegg it's silly work said maggie with a toss of her mane tearing things to pieces to sew 'em together again and i don't want to sew anything for my aunt glegg i don't like her exit maggie drawing her bonnet by the string while mr tulliver laughs audibly i wonder at you as you'll laugh at her mr tulliver said the mother an' her aunts will have it as it's me spoils her chapter ii the choice of a school mr riley who came next day was a gentleman with a waxen face and fat hands he talked with his host for some time about the water supply to dorlcote mill then after a short silence mr tulliver changed the subject there's a thing i've got i' my head said he at last in rather a lower tone than usual as he turned his head and looked at his companion ah said mr riley in a tone of mild interest it's a very particular thing mr tulliver went on it's about my boy tom at the sound of this name maggie who was seated on a low stool close by the fire with a large book open on her lap shook her heavy hair back and looked up eagerly you see i want to put him to a new school at midsummer said mr tulliver he's comin' away from the 'cademy at lady day an' i shall let him run loose for a quarter but after that i want to send him to a downright good school where they'll make a scholard of him well said mr riley there's no greater advantage you can give him than a good education i don't mean tom to be a miller and farmer said mr tulliver i see no fun i' that why if i made him a miller he'd be expectin' to take the mill an' the land an' a hinting at me as it was time for me to lay by nay nay i've seen enough o' that wi' sons these words cut maggie to the quick tom was supposed capable of turning his father out of doors this was not to be borne and maggie jumped up from her stool forgetting all about her heavy book which fell with a bang within the fender and going up between her father's knees said in a half crying half angry voice father tom wouldn't be naughty to you ever i know he wouldn't what they mustn't say any harm o' tom eh said mr tulliver looking at maggie with a twinkling eye then he added gently go go and see after your mother did you ever hear the like on't said mr tulliver as maggie retired it's a pity but what she'd been the lad mr riley laughed took a pinch of snuff and said but your lad's not stupid is he said mr riley i saw him when i was here last busy making fishing tackle he seemed quite up to it well he isn't stupid he's got a notion o' things out o' door an' a sort o' common sense and he'll lay hold o' things by the right handle but he's slow with his tongue you see and he reads but poorly and can't abide the books and spells all wrong they tell me an' you never hear him say 'cute things like the little wench now what i want is to send him to a school where they'll make him a bit nimble with his tongue and his pen and make a smart chap of him you're quite in the right of it tulliver observed mr riley better spend an extra hundred or two on your son's education than leave it him in your will i dare say now you know of a school as 'ud be just the thing for tom said mr tulliver mr riley took a pinch of snuff and waited a little before he said i know of a very fine chance for any one that's got the necessary money and that's what you have tulliver but if any one wanted his boy to be placed under a first rate fellow i know his man he's an oxford man and a parson he's willing to take one or two boys as pupils to fill up his time the boys would be quite of the family the finest thing in the world for them under stelling's eye continually but do you think they'd give the poor lad twice o' pudding said mrs tulliver who was now in her place again and what money 'ud he want said mr tulliver stelling is moderate in his terms he's not a grasping man said mr riley i've no doubt he'd take your boy at a hundred i'll write to him about it if you like mr tulliver rubbed his knees and looked at the carpet but belike he's a bachelor observed mrs tulliver an' i've no opinion o' house keepers it 'ud break my heart to send tom where there's a housekeeper an' i hope you won't think of it mr tulliver you may set your mind at rest on that score mrs tulliver said mr riley for stelling is married to as nice a little woman as any man need wish for a wife there isn't a kinder little soul in the world father broke in maggie who had stolen to her father's elbow again listening with parted lips while she held her doll topsy turvy and crushed its nose against the wood of the chair father is it a long way off where tom is to go shan't we ever go to see him i don't know my wench said the father tenderly ask mr riley he knows maggie came round promptly in front of mr riley and said how far is it please sir oh a long long way off that gentleman answered you must borrow the seven leagued boots to get to him that's nonsense said maggie tossing her head and turning away with the tears springing to her eyes hush maggie for shame of you chattering so said her mother come and sit down on your little stool and hold your tongue do but added mrs tulliver who had her own alarm awakened is it so far off as i couldn't wash him and mend him about fifteen miles that's all said mr riley you can drive there and back in a day quite comfortably or stelling is a kind pleasant man he'd be glad to have you stay but it's too far off for the linen i doubt said mrs tulliver sadly chapter iii tom comes home tom was to arrive early one afternoon and there was another fluttering heart besides maggie's when it was late enough for the sound of the gig wheels to be expected for if mrs tulliver had a strong feeling it was fondness for her boy at last the sound came and in spite of the wind which was blowing the clouds about and was not likely to respect mrs tulliver's curls and cap strings she came and stood outside the door with her hand on maggie's head there he is my sweet lad but he's got never a collar on it's been lost on the road i'll be bound and spoilt the set mrs tulliver stood with her arms open maggie jumped first on one leg and then on the other while tom stepped down from the gig and said hallo yap what are you there then he allowed himself to be kissed willingly enough though maggie hung on his neck in rather a strangling fashion while his blue eyes wandered towards the croft and the lambs and the river where he promised himself that he would begin to fish the first thing to morrow morning he was a lad with light brown hair cheeks of cream and roses and full lips maggie said tom taking her into a corner as soon as his mother was gone out to examine his box you don't know what i've got in my pockets nodding his head up and down as a means of rousing her sense of mystery no said maggie how stodgy they look tom is it marls marbles or cob nuts maggie's heart sank a little because tom always said it was no good playing with her at those games she played so badly marls no i've swopped all my marls with the little fellows and cobnuts are no fun you silly only when the nuts are green but see here he drew something out of his right hand pocket what is it said maggie in a whisper i can see nothing but a bit of yellow why it's a new guess maggie oh i can't guess tom said maggie impatiently don't be a spitfire else i won't tell you said tom thrusting his hand back into his pocket no tom said maggie laying hold of the arm that was held stiffly in the pocket i'm not cross tom it was only because i can't bear guessing please be good to me tom's arm slowly relaxed and he said well then it's a new fish line 'two new uns one for you maggie all to yourself i wouldn't go halves in the toffee and gingerbread on purpose to save the money and gibson and spouncer fought with me because i wouldn't and here's hooks see here i say won't we go and fish to morrow down by round pond and you shall catch your own fish and put the worms on and everything won't it be fun maggie's answer was to throw her arms round tom's neck and hug him and hold her cheek against his without speaking while he slowly unwound some of the line saying after a pause wasn't i a good brother now to buy you a line all to yourself you know i needn't have bought it if i hadn't liked yes very very good i do love you tom tom had put the line back in his pocket and was looking at the hooks one by one before he spoke again and the fellows fought me because i wouldn't give in about the toffee oh dear i wish they wouldn't fight at your school tom didn't it hurt you hurt me no said tom putting up the hooks again then he took out a large pocket knife and slowly opened the largest blade and rubbed his finger along it at last he said i gave spouncer a black eye i know that's what he got by wanting to leather me i wasn't going to go halves because anybody leathered me oh how brave you are tom i think you're like samson if there came a lion roaring at me i think you'd fight him wouldn't you tom how can a lion come roaring at you you silly thing there's no lions only in the shows no but if we were in the lion countries i mean in africa where it's very hot the lions eat people there i can show it you in the book where i read it well i should get a gun and shoot him but if you hadn't got a gun we might have gone out you know not thinking just as we go fishing and then a great lion might run towards us roaring and we couldn't get away from him what should you do tom tom paused and at last turned away saying but the lion isn't coming what's the use of talking but i like to fancy how it would be said maggie following him just think what you would do tom oh don't bother maggie you're such a silly i shall go and see my rabbits upon this maggie's heart began to flutter with fear for she had bad news for tom she dared not tell the sad truth at once but she walked after tom in trembling silence as he went out tom she said timidly when they were out of doors how much money did you give for your rabbits two half crowns and a sixpence said tom promptly i think i've got a great deal more than that in my steel purse upstairs i'll ask mother to give it you what for said tom i don't want your money you silly thing i've got a great deal more money than you because i'm a boy well but tom if mother would let me give you two half crowns and a sixpence out of my purse to put into your pocket and spend you know and buy some more rabbits with it more rabbits i don't want any more oh but tom they're all dead tom stopped and turned round towards maggie you forgot to feed 'em then and harry forgot he said his colour rising for a moment i'll pitch into harry i'll have him turned away and i don't love you maggie you shan't go fishing with me to morrow i told you to go and see the rabbits every day he walked on again yes but i forgot and i couldn't help it indeed tom i'm so very sorry said maggie while the tears rushed fast you're a naughty girl said tom severely and i'm sorry i bought you the fish line i don't love you o tom it's very cruel sobbed maggie i'd forgive you if you forgot anything i wouldn't mind what you did i'd forgive you and love you yes you're a silly but i never do forget things i don't oh please forgive me tom my heart will break said maggie shaking with sobs clinging to tom's arm and laying her wet cheek on his shoulder tom shook her off now maggie you just listen aren't i a good brother to you ye ye es sobbed maggie didn't i think about your fish line all this quarter and mean to buy it and saved my money o' purpose and wouldn't go halves in the toffee and spouncer fought me because i wouldn't ye ye es and i lo lo love you so tom but you're a naughty girl last holidays you licked the paint off my lozenge box and the holidays before that you let the boat drag my fish line down when i'd set you to watch it and you pushed your head through my kite all for nothing but i didn't mean said maggie i couldn't help it yes you could said tom if you'd minded what you were doing and you're a naughty girl and you shan't go fishing with me to morrow with this tom ran away from maggie towards the mill meaning to greet luke there and complain to him of harry oh he is cruel maggie sobbed aloud she would stay up in the attic and starve herself hide herself behind the tub and stay there all night and then they would all be frightened and tom would be sorry thus maggie thought in the pride of her heart as she crept behind the tub but presently she began to cry again at the idea that they didn't mind her being there meanwhile tom was too much interested in his talk with luke and in going the round of the mill to think of maggie at all but when he had been called in to tea his father said why where's the little wench and mrs tulliver almost at the same moment said where's your little sister i don't know said tom he didn't want to tell of maggie though he was angry with her for tom tulliver was a lad of honour what hasn't she been playing with you all this while said the father she'd been thinking o' nothing but your coming home i haven't seen her this two hours says tom goodness heart she's got drownded exclaimed mrs tulliver rising from her seat and running to the window nay nay she's none drownded said mr tulliver you've been naughty to her i doubt tom i'm sure i haven't father said tom quickly i think she's in the house perhaps up in that attic said mrs tulliver a singing and talking to herself and forgetting all about meal times you go and fetch her down tom said mr tulliver rather sharply and be good to her do you hear else i'll let you know better maggie who had taken refuge in the attic knew tom's step and her heart began to beat with the shock of hope but he only stood still on the top of the stairs and said maggie you're to come down then she rushed to him and clung round his neck sobbing o tom please forgive me i can't bear it i will always be good always remember things do love me please dear tom and the boy quite forgot his desire to punish her as much as she deserved he actually began to kiss her in return and say don't cry then magsie here eat a bit o' cake maggie's sobs began to subside and she put out her mouth for the cake and bit a piece and then tom bit a piece just for company and they ate together and rubbed each other's cheeks and brows and noses together while they ate like two friendly ponies come along magsie and have tea said tom at last so ended the sorrows of this day and the next morning maggie was to be seen trotting out with her own fishing rod in one hand and a handle of the basket in the other she had told tom however that she should like him to put the worms on the hook for her they were on their way to the round pool that wonderful pool which the floods had made a long while ago the sight of the old spot always heightened tom's good humour and he opened the basket and prepared their tackle he threw maggie's line for her and put the rod into her hand she thought it probable that the small fish would come to her hook and the large ones to tom's but after a few moments she had forgotten all about the fish and was looking dreamily at the glassy water when tom said in a loud whisper look look maggie and came running to prevent her from snatching her line away maggie was frightened lest she had been doing something wrong as usual but presently tom drew out her line and brought a large tench bouncing out upon the grass tom was excited o magsie you little duck empty the basket maggie did not know how clever she had been but it was quite enough that tom called her magsie and was pleased with her there was nothing to mar her delight in the whispers and the dreamy silences when she listened to the light dipping sounds of the rising fish and the gentle rustling as if the willows and the reeds and the water had their happy whisperings also maggie thought it would make a very nice heaven to sit by the pool in that way and never be scolded she never knew she had a bite until tom told her it is true but she liked fishing very much it was one of their happy mornings they trotted along and sat down together with no thought that life would ever change much for them they would only get bigger and not go to school and it would always be like the holidays they would always live together and be very very fond of each other chapter iv all about a jam puff it was easter week and mrs tulliver's cheese cakes were even more light than usual so that no season could have been better for a family party to consult sister glegg and sister pullet and sister deane about tom's going to school on wednesday the day before the aunts and uncles were coming tom and maggie made several inroads into the kitchen where great preparations were being made and were induced to keep aloof for a time only by being allowed to carry away some of the good things to eat tom said maggie as they sat on the boughs of the elder tree eating their jam puffs shall you run away to morrow no said tom slowly no i shan't why tom because lucy's coming no said tom opening his pocket knife and holding it over the last jam puff with his head on one side what do i care about lucy she's only a girl she can't play at bandy is it the tipsy cake then said maggie while she leaned forward towards tom with her eyes fixed on the knife no you silly that'll be good the day after it's the pudding i know what the pudding's to be apricot roll up oh my buttons with this the knife came down on the puff and in a moment that dainty lay in two but the result was not pleasing to tom and after a few moments' thought he said shut your eyes maggie what for you never mind what for shut 'em when i tell you maggie obeyed now which'll you have maggie right hand or left i'll have that with the jam run out said maggie keeping her eyes shut to please tom why you don't like that you silly you may have it if it comes to you fair but i shan't give it you without right or left you choose now ha a a said tom as maggie peeped you keep your eyes shut now else you shan't have any so maggie shut her eyes quite close till tom told her to say which and then she said left hand you've got it said tom in rather a bitter tone what the bit with the jam run out no here take it said tom firmly handing the best piece to maggie oh please tom have it i don't mind i like the other please take this no i shan't said tom almost crossly maggie began to eat up her half puff with great relish but tom had finished his own first and had to look on while maggie ate her last morsel or two without noticing that tom was looking at her oh you greedy thing said tom when she had eaten the last morsel maggie turned quite pale o tom why didn't you ask me i wasn't going to ask you for a bit you greedy you might have thought of it without when you knew i gave you the best bit but i wanted you to have it you know i did said maggie in an injured tone yes but i wasn't going to do what wasn't fair but if i go halves i'll go 'em fair only i wouldn't be a greedy with this tom jumped down from his bough and threw a stone with a hoigh to yap who had also been looking on wistfully while the jam puff vanished maggie sat still on her bough and gave herself up to misery she would have given the world not to have eaten all her puff and to have saved some of it for tom not but that the puff was very nice but she would have gone without it many times over sooner than tom should call her greedy and be cross with her and he had said he wouldn't have it and she ate it without thinking how could she help it the tears flowed so plentifully that maggie saw nothing around her for the next ten minutes then she jumped from her bough to look for tom he was no longer near her nor in the paddock behind the rickyard where was he likely to be gone and yap with him maggie ran to the high bank against the great holly tree where she could see far away towards the floss there was tom in the distance but her heart sank again as she saw how far off he was on his way to the great river and that he had another companion besides yap naughty bob jakin whose task of frightening the birds was just now at a standstill it must be owned that tom was fond of bob's company how could it be otherwise bob knew directly he saw a bird's egg whether it was a swallow's or a tom tit's or a yellow hammer's he found out all the wasps' nests and could set all sorts of traps he could climb the trees like a squirrel and had quite a magical power of finding hedgehogs and stoats and every holiday time maggie was sure to have days of grief because tom had gone off with bob well there was no help for it he was gone now and maggie could think of no comfort but to sit down by the holly or wander lonely by the hedgerow nursing her grief chapter v the family party on the day of the family party aunt glegg was the first to arrive and she was followed not long afterwards by aunt pullet and her husband maggie and tom on their part thought their aunt pullet tolerable because she was not their aunt glegg tom always declined to go more than once during his holidays to see either of them both his uncles tipped him that once of course but at his aunt pullet's there were a great many toads to pelt in the cellar area so that he preferred the visit to her maggie disliked the toads and dreamed of them horribly but she liked her uncle pullet's musical snuff box when maggie and tom came in from the garden with their father and their uncle glegg they found that aunt deane and cousin lucy had also arrived maggie had thrown her bonnet off very carelessly and coming in with her hair rough as well as out of curl rushed at once to lucy who was standing by her mother's knee lucy put up the neatest little rosebud mouth to be kissed everything about her was neat her little round neck with the row of coral beads her little straight nose not at all snubby her little clear eyebrows rather darker than her curls to match her hazel eyes which looked up with shy pleasure at maggie taller by the head though scarcely a year older o lucy burst out maggie after kissing her you'll stay with tom and me won't you oh kiss her tom tom too had come up to lucy but he was not going to kiss her no he came up to her with maggie because it seemed easier on the whole than saying how do you do to all those aunts and uncles heyday said aunt glegg loudly do little boys and gells come into a room without taking notice o' their uncles and aunts that wasn't the way when i was a little gell go and speak to your aunts and uncles my dears said mrs tulliver she wanted also to whisper to maggie a command to go and have her hair brushed well and how do you do and i hope you're good children are you said aunt glegg in the same loud way as she took their hands hurting them with her large rings and kissing their cheeks much against their desire look up tom look up boys as go to boarding schools should hold their heads up look at me now tom would not do so and tried to draw his hand away put your hair behind your ears maggie and keep your frock on your shoulder aunt glegg always spoke to them in this loud way as if she thought them quite deaf or perhaps rather silly well my dears said aunt pullet sadly you grow wonderful fast i doubt they'll outgrow their strength she added looking over their heads at their mother i think the gell has too much hair i'd have it thinned and cut shorter sister if i was you it isn't good for her health it's that as makes her skin so brown i shouldn't wonder don't you think so sister deane i can't say i'm sure sister said mrs deane no no said mr tulliver the child's healthy enough there's nothing ails her there's red wheat as well as white for that matter and some like the dark grain best but it 'ud be as well if bessy 'ud have the child's hair cut so as it 'ud lie smooth maggie now wished to learn from her aunt deane whether she would leave lucy behind to stay at the mill aunt deane would hardly ever let lucy come to see them to maggie's great regret you wouldn't like to stay behind without mother should you lucy she said to her little daughter yes please mother said lucy timidly blushing very pink all over her little neck well done lucy let her stay mrs deane let her stay said mr deane a large man who held a silver snuff box very tightly in his hand and now and then exchanged a pinch with mr tulliver maggie said mrs tulliver beckoning maggie to her and whispering in her ear as soon as this point of lucy's staying was settled go and get your hair brushed do for shame i told you not to come in without going to martha first you know i did tom come out with me whispered maggie pulling his sleeve as she passed him and tom followed willingly enough come upstairs with me tom she whispered when they were outside the door there's something i want to do before dinner there's no time to play at anything before dinner said tom oh yes there is time for this do come tom tom followed maggie upstairs into her mother's room and saw her go at once to a drawer from which she took a large pair of scissors what are they for maggie said tom maggie answered by seizing her front locks and cutting them straight across the middle of her forehead oh my buttons maggie you'll catch it exclaimed tom you'd better not cut any more off snip went the great scissors again while tom was speaking and he couldn't help feeling it was rather good fun maggie would look so queer here tom cut it behind for me said maggie much excited you'll catch it you know said tom as he took the scissors never mind make haste said maggie giving a little stamp with her foot her cheeks were quite flushed one delicious grinding snip and then another and another the hinder locks fell heavily on the floor and soon maggie stood cropped in a jagged uneven manner o maggie said tom jumping round her and slapping his knees as he laughed oh my buttons what a queer thing you look look at yourself in the glass maggie felt an unexpected pang she didn't want her hair to look pretty she only wanted people to think her a clever little girl and not to find fault with her untidy head but now when tom began to laugh at her the affair had quite a new aspect she looked in the glass and still tom laughed and clapped his hands while maggie's flushed cheeks began to pale and her lips to tremble a little o maggie you'll have to go down to dinner directly said tom oh my don't laugh at me tom said maggie with an outburst of angry tears stamping and giving him a push now then spitfire said tom what did you cut it off for then i shall go down i can smell the dinner going in he hurried downstairs at once maggie could see clearly enough now the thing was done that it was very foolish and that she should have to hear and think more about her hair than ever as she stood crying before the glass she felt it impossible to go down to dinner and endure the severe eyes and severe words of her aunts while tom and lucy and martha who waited at table and perhaps her father and her uncles would laugh at her for if tom had laughed at her of course every one else would and if she had only let her hair alone she could have sat with tom and lucy and had the apricot pudding and the custard miss maggie you're to come down this minute said kezia entering the room after a few moments lawks what have you been a doing i niver see such a fright don't kezia said maggie angrily go away but i tell you you're to come down miss this minute your mother says so said kezia going up to maggie and taking her by the hand to raise her from the floor on which she had thrown herself get away kezia i don't want any dinner said maggie resisting kezia's arm i shan't come oh well i can't stay i've got to wait at dinner said kezia going out again maggie you little silly said tom peeping into the room ten minutes later why don't you come and have your dinner there's lots o' goodies and mother says you're to come oh it was dreadful tom was so hard if he had been crying on the floor maggie would have cried too and there was the dinner so nice and she was so hungry it was very bitter but tom was not altogether hard he was not inclined to cry but he went and put his head near her and said in a lower comforting tone won't you come then magsie shall i bring you a bit o' pudding when i've had mine and a custard and things ye e es said maggie beginning to feel life a little more tolerable very well said tom going away but he turned again at the door and said but you'd better come you know there's the dessert nuts you know and cowslip wine slowly she rose from amongst her scattered locks and slowly she made her way downstairs then she stood leaning with one shoulder against the frame of the dining parlour door peeping in as it stood ajar she saw tom and lucy with an empty chair between them and there were the custards on a side table it was too much she slipped in and went towards the empty chair but she had no sooner sat down than she wished herself back again mrs tulliver gave a little scream as she saw her and felt such a turn that she dropped the large gravy spoon into the dish with the most serious results to the table cloth mrs tulliver's scream made all eyes turn towards the same point as her own and maggie's cheeks and ears began to burn while uncle glegg a kind looking white haired old gentleman said heyday what little gell's this why i don't know her is it some little gell you've picked up in the road kezia why she's gone and cut her hair herself said mr tulliver in an undertone to mr deane laughing with much enjoyment did you ever know such a little hussy as it is why little miss you've made yourself look very funny said uncle pullet fie for shame said aunt glegg in her loudest tone little gells as cut their own hair should be whipped and fed on bread and water not come and sit down with their aunts and uncles ay ay said uncle glegg playfully she must be sent to jail i think and they'll cut the rest off there and make it all even she's more like a gipsy nor ever said aunt pullet in a pitying tone it's very bad luck sister as the gell should be so brown the boy's fair enough i doubt it'll stand in her way i' life to be so brown she's a naughty child as'll break her mother's heart said mrs tulliver with the tears in her eyes oh my maggie whispered tom i told you you'd catch it the child's heart swelled and getting up from her chair she ran to her father hid her face on his shoulder and burst out into loud sobbing come come my wench said her father soothingly putting his arm round her never mind you was i' the right to cut it off if it plagued you give over crying father'll take your part how your husband does spoil that child bessy said mrs glegg in a loud aside to mrs tulliver it'll be the ruin of her if you don't take care my father niver brought his children up so else we should ha' been a different sort o' family to what we are mrs tulliver took no notice of her sister's remark but threw back her cap strings and served the pudding in silence when the dessert came the children were told they might have their nuts and wine in the summer house since the day was so mild and they scampered out among the budding bushes of the garden like small animals getting from under a burning glass chapter vi the magic music the children were to pay an afternoon visit on the following day to aunt pullet at garum firs where they would hear uncle pullet's musical box already at twelve o'clock mrs tulliver had on her visiting costume maggie was frowning and twisting her shoulders that she might if possible shrink away from the prickliest of tuckers while her mother was saying don't maggie my dear don't look so ugly tom's cheeks were looking very red against his best blue suit in the pockets of which he had to his great joy stowed away all the contents of his everyday pockets as for lucy she was just as pretty and neat as she had been yesterday and she looked with wondering pity at maggie pouting and writhing under the tucker while waiting for the time to set out they were allowed to build card houses as a suitable amusement for boys and girls in their best clothes tom could build splendid houses but maggie's would never bear the laying on of the roof it was always so with the things that maggie made and tom said that no girls could ever make anything but it happened that lucy was very clever at building she handled the cards so lightly and moved so gently that tom admired her houses as well as his own the more readily because she had asked him to teach her maggie too would have admired lucy's houses if tom had not laughed when her houses fell and told her that she was a stupid don't laugh at me tom she burst out angrily i'm not a stupid i know a great many things you don't oh i dare say miss spitfire i'd never be such a cross thing as you making faces like that lucy doesn't do so i like lucy better than you i wish lucy was my sister then it's wicked and cruel of you to wish so said maggie starting up from her place on the floor and upsetting tom's wonderful pagoda she really did not mean it but appearances were against her and tom turned white with anger but said nothing he would have struck her only he knew it was cowardly to strike a girl maggie stood in dismay and terror while tom got up from the floor and walked away lucy looked on mutely like a kitten pausing from its lapping o tom said maggie at last going half way towards him i didn't mean to knock it down indeed indeed i didn't tom took no notice of her but took instead two or three hard peas out of his pocket and shot them with his thumbnail against the window with the object of hitting a bluebottle which was sporting in the spring sunshine thus the morning had been very sad to maggie and when at last they set out tom's coldness to her all through their walk spoiled the fresh air and sunshine for her he called lucy to look at the half built bird's nest without caring to show it to maggie and peeled a willow switch for lucy and himself without offering one to maggie lucy had said maggie shouldn't you like one but tom was deaf still the sight of the peacock spreading his tail on the stackyard wall just as they reached the aunt's house was enough to turn the mind from sadness and this was only the beginning of beautiful sights at garum firs all the farmyard life was wonderful there bantams speckled and top knotted friesland hens with their feathers all turned the wrong way guinea fowls that flew and screamed and dropped their pretty spotted feathers pouter pigeons and a tame magpie nay a goat and a wonderful dog half mastiff half bull dog as large as a lion uncle pullet had seen the party from the window and made haste to unbar and unchain the front door aunt pullet too appeared at the doorway and as soon as her sister was within hearing said stop the children bessy don't let 'em come up the doorsteps sally's bringing the old mat and the duster to rub their shoes you must come with me into the best room she went on as soon as her guests had passed the portal may the children come too sister inquired mrs tulliver who saw that maggie and lucy were looking rather eager well said aunt pullet it'll perhaps be safer for the girls to come they'll be touching something if we leave 'em behind when they all came down again uncle pullet said that he reckoned the missis had been showing her bonnet that was what had made them so long upstairs meanwhile tom had spent the time on the edge of the sofa directly opposite his uncle pullet who looked at him with twinkling gray eyes and spoke to him as young sir well young sir what do you learn at school was the usual question with uncle pullet whereupon tom always looked sheepish rubbed his hand across his face and answered i don't know the appearance of the little girls made uncle pullet think of some small sweetcakes of which he kept a stock under lock and key for his own private eating on wet days but the three children had no sooner got them between their fingers than aunt pullet desired them to abstain from eating till the tray and the plates came since with those crisp cakes they would make the floor all over crumbs lucy didn't mind that much for the cake was so pretty she thought it was rather a pity to eat it but tom watching his chance while the elders were talking hastily stowed his own cake in his mouth at two bites as for maggie she presently let fall her cake and by an unlucky movement crushed it beneath her foot a source of such disgrace to her that she began to despair of hearing the musical snuff box to day till it occurred to her that lucy was in high favour enough to venture on asking for a tune so she whispered to lucy and lucy who always did what she was asked to do went up quietly to her uncle's knee and blushing all over her neck while she fingered her necklace said will you please play us a tune uncle but uncle pullet never gave a too ready consent we'll see about it was the answer he always gave waiting till a suitable number of minutes had passed perhaps the waiting increased maggie's enjoyment when the tune began for the first time she quite forgot that she had a load on her mind that tom was angry with her and by the time hush ye pretty warbling choir had been played her face wore that bright look of happiness while she sat still with her hands clasped which sometimes comforted her mother that maggie could look pretty now and then in spite of her brown skin but when the magic music ceased she jumped up and running towards tom put her arm round his neck and said o tom isn't it pretty now tom had his glass of cowslip wine in his hand and maggie jerked him so as to make him spill half of it he would have been an extreme milksop if he had not said angrily look there now why don't you sit still maggie her mother said peevishly little gells mustn't come to see me if they behave in that way said aunt pullet why you're too rough little miss said uncle pullet poor maggie sat down again with the music all chased out of her soul mrs tulliver wisely took an early opportunity of suggesting that now they were rested after their walk the children might go and play out of doors and aunt pullet gave them leave only telling them not to go off the paved walks in the garden and if they wanted to see the poultry fed to view them from a distance on the horse block for a long time after the children had gone out the elders sat deep in talk about family matters till at last mrs pullet observing that it was tea time turned to reach from a drawer a fine damask napkin which she pinned before her in the fashion of an apron then the door was thrown open but instead of the tea tray sally brought in an object so startling that both mrs pullet and mrs tulliver gave a scream causing uncle pullet to swallow a lozenge he was sucking for the fifth time in his life as he afterwards noted the startling object was no other than little lucy with one side of her person from her small foot to her bonnet crown wet and discoloured with mud holding out two tiny blackened hands and making a very piteous face chapter vii maggie is very naughty as soon as the children reached the open air tom said here lucy you come along with me and walked off to the place where the toads were as if there were no maggie in existence lucy was naturally pleased that cousin tom was so good to her and it was very amusing to see him tickling a fat toad with a piece of string when the toad was safe down the area with an iron grating over him still lucy wished maggie to enjoy the sight also especially as she would doubtless find a name for the toad and say what had been his past history for lucy loved maggie's stories about the live things they came upon by accident how mrs earwig had a wash at home and one of her children had fallen into the hot copper for which reason she was running so fast to fetch the doctor so now the desire to know the history of a very portly toad made her run back to maggie and say oh there is such a big funny toad maggie do come and see maggie said nothing but turned away from her with a deep frown she was actually beginning to think that she should like to make lucy cry by slapping or pinching her especially as it might vex tom whom it was of no use to slap even if she dared because he didn't mind it and if lucy hadn't been there maggie was sure he would have made friends with her sooner tickling a fat toad is an amusement that does not last and tom by and by began to look round for some other mode of passing the time but in so prim a garden where they were not to go off the paved walks there was not a great choice of sport i say lucy he began nodding his head up and down as he coiled up his string again what do you think i mean to do what tom said lucy i mean to go to the pond and look at the pike you may go with me if you like o tom dare you said lucy aunt said we mustn't go out of the garden oh i shall go out at the other end of the garden said tom nobody 'ull see us besides i don't care if they do i'll run off home but i couldn't run said lucy oh never mind they won't be cross with you said tom you say i took you tom walked along and lucy trotted by his side maggie saw them leaving the garden and could not resist the impulse to follow she kept a few yards behind them unseen by tom who was watching for the pike a highly interesting monster he was said to be so very old so very large and to have such a great appetite here lucy he said in a loud whisper come here lucy came carefully as she was bidden and bent down to look at what seemed a golden arrow head darting through the water it was a water snake tom told her and lucy at last could see the wave of its body wondering very much that a snake could swim maggie had drawn nearer and nearer she must see it too though it was bitter to her like everything else since tom did not care about her seeing it at last she was close by lucy and tom turned round and said now get away maggie there's no room for you on the grass here nobody asked you to come then maggie with a fierce thrust of her small brown arm pushed poor little pink and white lucy into the cow trodden mud tom could not restrain himself and gave maggie two smart slaps on the arm as he ran to pick up lucy who lay crying helplessly maggie retreated to the roots of a tree a few yards off and looked on why should she be sorry tom was very slow to forgive her however sorry she might have been i shall tell mother you know miss mag said tom as soon as lucy was up and ready to walk away it was not tom's practice to tell but here justice clearly demanded that maggie should be visited with the utmost punishment sally said tom when they reached the kitchen door sally tell mother it was maggie pushed lucy into the mud sally as we have seen lost no time in presenting lucy at the parlour door goodness gracious aunt pullet exclaimed after giving a scream keep her at the door sally don't bring her off the oilcloth whatever you do why she's tumbled into some nasty mud said mrs tulliver going up to lucy if you please 'um it was miss maggie as pushed her in said sally master tom's been and said so and they must ha' been to the pond for it's only there they could ha' got into such dirt there it is bessy it's what i've been telling you said mrs pullet it's your children there's no knowing what they'll come to mrs tulliver went out to speak to these naughty children supposing them to be close at hand but it was not until after some search that she found tom leaning with rather a careless air against the white paling of the poultry yard and lowering his piece of string on the other side as a means of teasing the turkey cock tom you naughty boy where's your sister said mrs tulliver in a distressed voice i don't know said tom why where did you leave her said his mother looking round sitting under the tree against the pond said tom then go and fetch her in this minute you naughty boy and how could you think o' going to the pond and taking your sister where there was dirt you know she'll do mischief if there's mischief to be done the idea of maggie sitting alone by the pond roused a fear in mrs tulliver's mind and she mounted the horse block to satisfy herself by a sight of that fatal child while tom walked not very quickly on his way towards her they're such children for the water mine are she said aloud without reflecting that there was no one to hear her they'll be brought in dead and drownded some day i wish that river was far enough but when she not only failed to see maggie but presently saw tom returning from the pond alone she hurried to meet him maggie's nowhere about the pond mother said tom she's gone away chapter viii maggie and the gipsies after tom and lucy had walked away maggie's quick mind formed a plan which was not so simple as that of going home no she would run away and go to the gipsies and tom should never see her any more she had been often told she was like a gipsy and half wild so now she would go and live in a little brown tent on the common the gipsies she considered would gladly receive her and pay her much respect on account of her superior knowledge she had once mentioned her views on this point to tom and suggested that he should stain his face brown and they should run away together but tom rejected the scheme with contempt observing that gipsies were thieves and hardly got anything to eat and had nothing to drive but a donkey to day however maggie thought her misery had reached a pitch at which gipsydom was her only refuge and she rose from her seat on the roots of the tree with the sense that this was a great crisis in her life she would run straight away till she came to dunlow common where there would certainly be gipsies and cruel tom and the rest of her relations who found fault with her should never see her any more she thought of her father as she ran along but made up her mind that she would secretly send him a letter by a small gipsy who would run away without telling where she was and just let him know that she was well and happy and always loved him very much maggie soon got out of breath with running but by the time that tom got to the pond again she was at the distance of three long fields and was on the edge of the lane leading to the highroad she presently passed through the gate into the lane and she was soon aware not without trembling that there were two men coming along the lane in front of her she had not thought of meeting strangers and to her surprise while she was dreading their scolding as a runaway one of the men stopped and in a half whining half coaxing tone asked her if she had a copper to give a poor fellow maggie had a sixpence in her pocket her uncle glegg's present which she drew out and gave this poor fellow with a polite smile that's the only money i've got she said thank you little miss said the man in a less grateful tone than maggie expected and she even saw that he smiled and winked at his companion she now went on and turning through the first gate that was not locked crept along by the hedgerows she was used to wandering about the fields by herself and was less timid there than on the highroad sometimes she had to climb over high gates but that was a small evil she was getting out of reach very fast and she should probably soon come within sight of dunlow common she hoped so for she was getting rather tired and hungry it was still broad daylight yet it seemed to her that she had been walking a very great distance indeed and it was really surprising that the common did not come in sight at last however the green fields came to an end and maggie found herself looking through the bars of a gate into a lane with a wide margin of grass on each side of it she crept through the bars of the gate and walked on with a new spirit and at the next bend in the lane maggie actually saw the little black tent with the blue smoke rising before it which was to be her refuge she even saw a tall female figure by the column of smoke doubtless the gipsy mother who provided the tea and other groceries it was astonishing to herself that she did not feel more delighted but it was startling to find the gipsies in a lane after all and not on a common indeed it was rather disappointing for a mysterious common where there were sand pits to hide in and one was out of everybody's reach had always made part of maggie's picture of gipsy life she went on however and before long a tall figure who proved to be a young woman with a baby on her arm walked slowly to meet her maggie looked up in the new face and thought that her aunt pullet and the rest were right when they called her a gipsy for this face with the bright dark eyes and the long hair was really something like what she used to see in her own glass before she cut her hair off my little lady where are you going to the gipsy said it was delightful and just what maggie expected the gipsy saw at once that she was a little lady not any farther said maggie i'm come to stay with you please that's pritty come then why what a nice little lady you are to be sure said the gipsy taking her by the hand maggie thought her very nice but wished she had not been so dirty there was quite a group round the fire when they reached it an old gipsy woman was seated on the ground nursing her knees and poking a skewer into the round kettle that sent forth an odorous steam two small shock headed children were lying down resting on their elbows and a donkey was bending his head over a tall girl who lying on her back was scratching his nose and feeding him with a bite of excellent stolen hay the slanting sunlight fell kindly upon them and the scene was really very pretty and comfortable maggie thought only she hoped they would soon set out the tea cups it was a little confusing though that the young woman began to speak to the old one in a language which maggie did not understand while the tall girl who was feeding the donkey sat up and stared at her at last the old woman said what my pretty lady are you come to stay with us sit ye down and tell us where you come from illustration my pretty lady are you come to stay with us it was just like a story maggie liked to be called pretty lady and treated in this way she sat down and said i'm come from home because i'm unhappy and i mean to be a gipsy i'll live with you if you like and i can teach you a great many things such a clever little lady said the woman with the baby sitting down by maggie and allowing baby to crawl and such a pritty bonnet and frock she added taking off maggie's bonnet and looking at it while she spoke to the old woman in the unknown language the tall girl snatched the bonnet and put it on her own head hind foremost with a grin but maggie was determined not to show that she cared about her bonnet i don't want to wear a bonnet she said i'd rather wear a red handkerchief like yours looking at her friend by her side my hair was quite long till yesterday when i cut it off but i dare say it will grow again very soon oh what a nice little lady and rich i'm sure said the old woman didn't you live in a beautiful house at home yes my home is pretty and i'm very fond of the river where we go fishing but i'm often very unhappy i should have liked to bring my books with me but i came away in a hurry you know but i can tell you almost everything there is in my books i've read them so many times and that will amuse you and i can tell you something about geography too that's about the world we live in very useful and interesting did you ever hear about columbus is that where you live my little lady said the old woman at the mention of columbus oh no said maggie with some pity columbus was a very wonderful man who found out half the world and they put chains on him and treated him very badly you know but perhaps it's rather too long to tell before tea i want my tea so why she's hungry poor little lady said the younger woman give her some o' the cold victual you've been walking a good way i'll be bound my dear where's your home it's dorlcote mill a good way off said maggie my father is mr tulliver but we mustn't let him know where i am else he'll fetch me home again where does the queen of the gipsies live what do you want to go to her my little lady said the younger woman no said maggie i'm only thinking that if she isn't a very good queen you might be glad when she died and you could choose another if i was a queen i'd be a very good queen and kind to everybody here's a bit o' nice victual then said the old woman handing to maggie a lump of dry bread which she had taken from a bag of scraps and a piece of cold bacon thank you said maggie looking at the food without taking it but will you give me some bread and butter and tea instead i don't like bacon we've got no tea nor butter said the old woman with something like a scowl oh a little bread and treacle would do said maggie we han't got no treacle said the old woman crossly meanwhile the tall girl gave a shrill cry and presently there came running up a rough urchin about the age of tom he stared at maggie and she felt very lonely and was quite sure she should begin to cry before long but the springing tears were checked when two rough men came up while a black cur ran barking up to maggie and threw her into a tremor of fear maggie felt that it was impossible she should ever be queen of these people this nice little lady's come to live with us said the young woman aren't you glad ay very glad said the younger man who was soon examining maggie's silver thimble and other small matters that had been taken from her pocket he returned them all except the thimble to the younger woman and she immediately restored them to maggie's pocket while the men seated themselves and began to attack the contents of the kettle a stew of meat and potatoes which had been taken off the fire and turned out into a yellow platter chapter ix the gipsy queen abdicates maggie began to think that tom must be right about the gipsies they must certainly be thieves unless the man meant to return her thimble by and by all thieves except robin hood were wicked people the women now saw she was frightened we've got nothing nice for a lady to eat said the old woman in her coaxing tone and she's so hungry sweet little lady here my dear try if you can eat a bit o' this said the younger woman handing some of the stew on a brown dish with an iron spoon to maggie who dared not refuse it though fear had chased away her appetite if her father would but come by in the gig and take her up or even if jack the giantkiller or mr greatheart or st george who slew the dragon on the half pennies would happen to pass that way what you don't like the smell of it my dear said the young woman observing that maggie did not even take a spoonful of the stew try a bit come no thank you said maggie trying to smile in a friendly way i haven't time i think it seems getting darker i think i must go home now and come again another day and then i can bring you a basket with some jam tarts and things maggie rose from her seat when the old gipsy woman said stop a bit stop a bit little lady we'll take you home all safe when we've done supper you shall ride home like a lady maggie sat down again with little faith in this promise though she presently saw the tall girl putting a bridle on the donkey and throwing a couple of bags on his back now then little missis said the younger man rising and leading the donkey forward tell us where you live what's the name o' the place dorlcote mill is my home said maggie eagerly my father is mr tulliver he lives there what a big mill a little way this side o' st ogg's yes said maggie is it far off i think i should like to walk there if you please no no it'll be getting dark we must make haste and the donkey'll carry you as nice as can be you'll see he lifted maggie as he spoke and set her on the donkey here's your pretty bonnet said the younger woman putting it on maggie's head and you'll say we've been very good to you won't you and what a nice little lady we said you was oh yes thank you said maggie i'm very much obliged to you but i wish you'd go with me too ah you're fondest o' me aren't you said the woman but i can't go you'll go too fast for me it now appeared that the man also was to be seated on the donkey holding maggie before him and no nightmare had ever seemed to her more horrible when the woman had patted her on the back and said good bye the donkey at a strong hint from the man's stick set off at a rapid walk along the lane towards the point maggie had come from an hour ago maggie was completely terrified at this ride on a short paced donkey with a gipsy behind her who considered that he was earning half a crown two low thatched cottages the only houses they passed in this lane seemed to add to the dreariness they had no windows to speak of and the doors were closed it was probable that they were inhabited by witches and it was a relief to find that the donkey did not stop there at last oh sight of joy this lane the longest in the world was coming to an end and was opening on a broad highroad where there was actually a coach passing and there was a finger post at the corner she had surely seen that finger post before to st ogg's miles the gipsy really meant to take her home then he was probably a good man after all and might have been rather hurt at the thought that she didn't like coming with him alone this idea became stronger as she felt more and more certain that she knew the road quite well when as they reached a cross road maggie caught sight of some one coming on a horse which seemed familiar to her oh stop stop she cried out there's my father o father father the sudden joy was almost painful and before her father reached her she was sobbing great was mr tulliver's wonder for he had been paying a visit to a married sister and had not yet been home why what's the meaning o' this he said checking his horse while maggie slipped from the donkey and ran to her father's stirrup the little miss lost herself i reckon said the gipsy she'd come to our tent at the far end o' dunlow lane and i was bringing her where she said her home was it's a good way to come arter being on the tramp all day oh yes father he's been very good to bring me home said maggie a very kind good man here then my man said mr tulliver taking out five shillings it's the best day's work you ever did i couldn't afford to lose the little wench here lift her up before me why maggie how's this how's this he said as they rode along while she laid her head against her father and sobbed how came you to be rambling about and lose yourself o father sobbed maggie i ran away because i was so unhappy tom was so angry with me i couldn't bear it pooh pooh said mr tulliver soothingly you mustn't think o' running away from father what 'ud father do without his little wench oh no i never will again father never mr tulliver spoke his mind very strongly when he reached home that evening and maggie never heard one reproach from her mother or one taunt from tom about running away to be queen of the gipsies chapter x tom at school in due time tom found himself at king's lorton under the care of the rev walter stelling a big broad chested man not yet thirty with fair hair standing erect large light gray eyes and a deep bass voice the schoolmaster had made up his mind to bring tom on very quickly during the first half year but tom did not greatly enjoy the process though he made good progress in a very short time the boy was however very lonely and longed for playfellows in his secret heart he yearned to have maggie with him though when he was at home he always made it out to be a great favour on his part to let maggie trot by his side on his pleasure excursions and before this dreary half year was ended maggie actually came mrs stelling had given a general invitation for the little girl to come and stay with her brother so when mr tulliver drove over to king's lorton late in october maggie came too it was mr tulliver's first visit to see tom for the lad must learn he had said not to think too much about home well my lad the miller said to tom when mr stelling had left the room and maggie had begun to kiss tom freely you look rarely school agrees with you tom wished he had looked rather ill i don't think i am well father said tom i wish you'd ask mr stelling not to let me do euclid it brings on the tooth ache i think euclid my lad why what's that said mr tulliver oh i don't know it's definitions and axioms and triangles and things it's a book i've got to learn in there's no sense in it go go said mr tulliver you mustn't say so you must learn what your master tells you he knows what it's right for you to learn i'll help you now tom said maggie i'm come to stay ever so long if mrs stelling asks me i've brought my box and my pinafores haven't i father you help me you silly little thing said tom i should like to see you doing one of my lessons why i learn latin too girls never learn such things they're too silly i know what latin is very well said maggie confidently latin's a language there are latin words in the dictionary there's bonus a gift now you're just wrong there miss maggie said tom you think you're very wise but bonus means 'good' as it happens bonus bona bonum well that's no reason why it shouldn't mean 'gift' said maggie stoutly it may mean several things almost every word does there's 'lawn' it means the grass plot as well as the stuff handkerchiefs are made of well done little un said mr tulliver laughing while tom felt rather disgusted mrs stelling did not mention a longer time than a week for maggie's stay but mr stelling said that she must stay a fortnight now then come with me into the study maggie said tom as their father drove away what do you shake and toss your head now for you silly it makes you look as if you were crazy oh i can't help it said maggie don't tease me tom oh what books she exclaimed as she saw the bookcases in the study how i should like to have as many books as that why you couldn't read one of 'em said tom triumphantly they're all latin no they aren't said maggie i can read the back of this history of the decline and fall of the roman empire well what does that mean you don't know said tom wagging his head but i could soon find out said maggie why how i should look inside and see what it was about you'd better not miss maggie said tom seeing her hand on the volume mr stelling lets nobody touch his books without leave and i shall catch it if you take it out oh very well let me see all your books then said maggie turning to throw her arms round tom's neck and rub his cheek with her small round nose tom in the gladness of his heart at having dear old maggie to dispute with and crow over again seized her round the waist and began to jump with her round the large library table away they jumped with more and more vigour till at last reaching mr stelling's reading stand they sent it thundering down with its heavy books to the floor tom stood dizzy and aghast for a few minutes dreading the appearance of mr or mrs stelling oh i say maggie said tom at last lifting up the stand we must keep quiet here you know if we break anything mrs stelling'll make us cry peccavi what's that said maggie oh it's the latin for a good scolding said tom is she a cross woman said maggie i believe you said tom with a nod i think all women are crosser than men said maggie aunt glegg's a great deal crosser than uncle glegg and mother scolds me more than father does well you'll be a woman some day said tom so you needn't talk but i shall be a clever woman said maggie with a toss oh i dare say and a nasty conceited thing everybody'll hate you but you oughtn't to hate me tom it'll be very wicked of you for i shall be your sister yes but if you're a nasty disagreeable thing i shall hate you oh but tom you won't i shan't be disagreeable i shall be very good to you and i shall be good to everybody you won't hate me really will you tom oh bother never mind come it's time for me to learn my lessons see here what i've got to do tom went on drawing maggie towards him and showing her his theorem while she pushed her hair behind her ears and prepared herself to help him in euclid it's nonsense she said after a few moments reading and very ugly stuff nobody need want to make it out ah there now miss maggie said tom drawing the book away and wagging his head at her you see you're not so clever as you thought you were oh said maggie pouting i dare say i could make it out if i'd learned what goes before as you have but that's what you just couldn't miss wisdom said tom for it's all the harder when you know what goes before but get along with you now i must go on with this here's the latin grammar see what you can make of that maggie found the latin grammar quite soothing for she delighted in new words and quickly found that there was an english key at the end which would make her very wise about latin at slight expense after a short period of silence tom called out now then magsie give us the grammar o tom it's such a pretty book she said as she jumped out of the large armchair to give it him i could learn latin very soon i don't think it's at all hard oh i know what you've been doing said tom you've been reading the english at the end any donkey can do that here come and hear if i can say this stand at that end of the table illustration here magsie come and hear if i can say this maggie obeyed and took the open book where do you begin tom oh i begin at 'appellativa arborum' because i say all over again what i've been learning this week tom sailed along pretty well for three lines and then he stuck fast there you needn't laugh at me tom for you didn't remember it at all you see phee e e h i told you girls couldn't learn latin very well then said maggie pouting i can say it as well as you can and you don't mind your stops for you ought to stop twice as long at a semicolon as you do at a comma and you make the longest stops where there ought to be no stops at all oh well don't chatter let me go on it was a very happy fortnight to maggie this visit to tom she was allowed to be in the study while he had his lessons and in time got very deep into the examples in the latin grammar mr stelling liked her prattle immensely and they were on the best of terms she told tom she should like to go to school to mr stelling as he did and learn just the same things she knew she could do euclid for she had looked into it again and she saw what abc meant they were the names of the lines i'm sure you couldn't do it now said tom and i'll just ask mr stelling if you could i don't mind said she i'll ask him myself mr stelling she said that same evening when they were in the drawing room couldn't i do euclid and all tom's lessons if you were to teach me instead of him no you couldn't said tom indignantly girls can't do euclid can they sir they can pick up a little of everything i dare say said mr stelling but they couldn't go far into anything they're quick and shallow tom delighted with this wagged his head at maggie behind mr stelling's chair as for maggie she had hardly ever been so angry she had been so proud to be called quick all her little life and now it appeared that this quickness showed what a poor creature she was it would have been better to be slow like tom ha ha miss maggie said tom when they were alone you see it's not such a fine thing to be quick you'll never go far into anything you know and maggie had no spirit for a retort but when she was fetched away in the gig by luke and the study was once more quite lonely for tom he missed her grievously still the dreary half year did come to an end at last how glad tom was to see the last yellow leaves fluttering before the cold wind the dark afternoons and the first december snow seemed to him far livelier than the august sunshine and that he might make himself the surer about the flight of the days that were carrying him homeward he stuck twenty one sticks deep in a corner of the garden when he was three weeks from the holidays and pulled one up every day with a great wrench throwing it to a distance but it was worth buying even at the heavy price of the latin grammar the happiness of seeing the bright light in the parlour at home as the gig passed over the snow covered bridge the happiness of passing from the cold air to the warmth and the kisses and the smiles of home chapter xi the new schoolfellow father said tom one evening near the end of the holidays uncle glegg says lawyer wakem is going to send his son to mr stelling you won't like me to go to school with wakem's son will you father it's no matter for that my boy said mr tulliver don't you learn anything bad of him that's all the lad's a poor deformed creatur it's a sign wakem thinks high o' mr stelling as he sends his son to him and wakem knows meal from bran lawyer and rascal though he is it was a cold wet january day on which tom went back to school if he had not carried in his pocket a parcel of sugar candy there would have been no ray of pleasure to enliven the gloom well tulliver we're glad to see you again said mr stelling heartily on his arrival take off your wrappings and come into the study till dinner you'll find a bright fire there and a new companion tom felt in an uncomfortable flutter as he took off his woollen comforter and other wrappings he had seen philip wakem at st ogg's but had always turned his eyes away from him as quickly as possible for he knew that for several reasons his father hated the wakem family with all his heart here is a new companion for you to shake hands with tulliver said mr stelling on entering the study master philip wakem you already know something of each other i imagine for you are neighbours at home tom looked confused while philip rose and glanced at him timidly tom did not like to go up and put out his hand and he was not prepared to say how do you do on so short a notice mr stelling wisely turned away and closed the door behind him he knew that boys' shyness only wears off in the absence of their elders philip was at once too proud and too timid to walk towards tom he thought or rather felt that tom did not like to look at him so they remained without shaking hands or even speaking while tom went to the fire and warmed himself every now and then casting glances at philip who seemed to be drawing absently first one object and then another on a piece of paper he had before him what was he drawing wondered tom after a spell of silence he was quite warm now and wanted something new to be going forward suddenly he walked across the hearth and looked over philip's paper why that's a donkey with panniers and a spaniel and partridges in the corn he exclaimed oh my buttons i wish i could draw like that i'm to learn drawing this half i wonder if i shall learn to make dogs and donkeys oh you can do them without learning said philip i never learned drawing never learned said tom in amazement why when i make dogs and horses and those things the heads and the legs won't come right though i can see how they ought to be very well i can make houses and all sorts of chimneys chimneys going all down the wall and windows in the roof and all that but i dare say i could do dogs and horses if i was to try more he added oh yes said philip it's very easy you've only to look well at things and draw them over and over again what you do wrong once you can alter the next time but haven't you been taught anything said tom yes said philip smiling i've been taught latin and greek and mathematics and writing and such things oh but i say you don't like latin though do you said tom pretty well i don't care much about it said philip but i've done with the grammar he added i don't learn that any more then you won't have the same lessons as i shall said tom with a sense of disappointment no but i dare say i can help you i shall be very glad to help you if i can tom did not say thank you for he was quite absorbed in the thought that wakem's son did not seem so spiteful a fellow as might have been expected i say he said presently do you love your father yes said philip colouring deeply don't you love yours oh yes i only wanted to know said tom rather ashamed of himself now he saw philip colouring and looking uncomfortable shall you learn drawing now he said by way of changing the subject no said philip my father wishes me to give all my time to other things now what latin and euclid and those things said tom yes said philip who had left off using his pencil and was resting his head on one hand while tom was leaning forward on both elbows and looking at the dog and the donkey and you don't mind that said tom with strong curiosity no i like to know what everybody else knows i can study what i like by and by i can't think why anybody should learn latin said tom it's no good it's part of the education of a gentleman said philip all gentlemen learn the same things what do you think sir john crake the master of the harriers knows latin said tom he learnt it when he was a boy of course said philip but i dare say he's forgotten it oh well i can do that then said tom readily oh i don't mind latin said philip unable to choke a laugh i can remember things easily and there are some lessons i'm very fond of i'm very fond of greek history and everything about the greeks i should like to have been a greek and fought the persians and then have come home and written tragedies or else have been listened to by everybody for my wisdom like socrates and have died a grand death why were the greeks great fighters said tom who saw a vista in this direction is there anything like david and goliath and samson in the greek history those are the only bits i like in the history of the jews oh there are very fine stories of that sort about the greeks about the heroes of early times who killed the wild beasts as samson did and in the odyssey that's a beautiful poem there's a more wonderful giant than goliath polypheme who had only one eye in the middle of his forehead and ulysses a little fellow but very wise and cunning got a red hot pine tree and stuck it into this one eye and made him roar like a thousand bulls oh what fun said tom jumping away from the table and stamping first with one leg and then the other i say can you tell me all about those stories because i shan't learn greek you know shall i he added pausing in his stamping with a sudden alarm lest the contrary might be possible does every gentleman learn greek will mr stelling make me begin with it do you think no i should think not very likely not said philip but you may read those stories without knowing greek i've got them in english oh but i don't like reading i'd sooner have you tell them me but only the fighting ones you know my sister maggie is always wanting to tell me stories but they're stupid things girls' stories always are can you tell a good many fighting stories oh yes said philip lots of them besides the greek stories i can tell you about richard coeur de lion and saladin and about william wallace and robert bruce and james douglas i know no end you're older than i am aren't you said tom why how old are you i'm fifteen i'm only going in fourteen said tom but i thrashed all the fellows at jacobs' that's where i was before i came here and i beat 'em all at bandy and climbing and i wish mr stelling would let us go fishing i could show you how to fish you could fish couldn't you it's only standing and sitting still you know philip winced under this allusion to his unfitness for active sports and he answered almost crossly i can't bear fishing i think people look like fools sitting watching a line hour after hour or else throwing and throwing and catching nothing ah but you wouldn't say they looked like fools when they landed a big pike i can tell you said tom wakem's son it was plain had his disagreeable points and must be kept in due check chapter xii the duke of wellington as time went on philip and tom found many common interests and became on the whole good comrades but they had occasional tiffs as was to be expected and at one time had a serious difference which promised to be final this occurred shortly before maggie's second visit to tom she was going to a boarding school with lucy and wished to see tom before setting out when maggie came she could not help looking with growing interest at the new schoolfellow although he was the son of that wicked lawyer wakem who made her father so angry she had arrived in the middle of school hours and had sat by while philip went through his lessons with mr stelling tom some weeks before had sent her word that philip knew no end of stories not stupid stories like hers and she was convinced now that he must be very clever she hoped he would think her rather clever too when she came to talk to him i think philip wakem seems a nice boy tom she said when they went out of the study together into the garden he couldn't choose his father you know and i've read of very bad men who had good sons as well as good parents who had bad children and if philip is good i think we ought to be the more sorry for him because his father is not a good man you like him don't you oh he's a queer fellow said tom curtly and he's as sulky as can be with me because i told him one day his father was a rogue and i'd a right to tell him so for it was true and he began it with calling me names but you stop here by yourself a bit magsie will you i've got something i want to do upstairs can't i go too said maggie who in this first day of meeting again loved tom's very shadow no it's something i'll tell you about by and by not yet said tom skipping away in the afternoon the boys were at their books in the study preparing the morrow's lessons that they might have a holiday in the evening in honour of maggie's arrival tom was hanging over his latin grammar and philip at the other end of the room was busy with two volumes that excited maggie's curiosity he did not look at all as if he were learning a lesson she sat on a low stool at nearly a right angle with the two boys watching first one and then the other i say magsie said tom at last shutting his books i've done my lessons now come upstairs with me what is it said maggie when they were outside the door it isn't a trick you're going to play me now no no maggie said tom in his most coaxing tone it's something you'll like ever so he put his arm round her neck and she put hers round his waist and twined together in this way they went upstairs i say magsie you must not tell anybody you know said tom else i shall get fifty lines is it alive said maggie thinking that tom kept a ferret oh i shan't tell you said he now you go into that corner and hide your face while i reach it out he added as he locked the bedroom door behind them i'll tell you when to turn round you mustn't squeal out you know oh but if you frighten me i shall said maggie beginning to look rather serious you won't be frightened you silly thing said tom go and hide your face and mind you don't peep of course i shan't peep said maggie disdainfully and she buried her face in the pillow like a person of strict honour but tom looked round warily as he walked to the closet then he stepped into the narrow space and almost closed the door maggie kept her face buried until tom called out now then magsie nothing but very careful study could have enabled tom to present so striking a figure as he did to maggie when she looked up with some burnt cork he had made himself a pair of black eyebrows that met over his nose and were matched by a blackness about the chin he had wound a red handkerchief round his cloth cap to give it the air of a turban and his red comforter across his breast as a scarf an amount of red which with the frown on his brow and the firmness with which he grasped a real sword as he held it with its point resting on the ground made him look very fierce and bloodthirsty indeed maggie looked bewildered for a moment and tom enjoyed that moment keenly but in the next she laughed clapped her hands together and said o tom you've made yourself like bluebeard at the show it was clear she had not been struck with the presence of the sword it was not unsheathed her foolish mind required a more direct appeal to its sense of the terrible and tom prepared for his master stroke frowning fiercely he carefully drew the sword a real one from its sheath and pointed it at maggie o tom please don't cried maggie in a tone of dread shrinking away from him into the opposite corner i shall scream i'm sure i shall oh don't i wish i'd never come upstairs illustration o tom please don't cried maggie the corners of tom's mouth showed an inclination to a smile that was immediately checked slowly he let down the scabbard on the floor lest it should make too much noise and then said sternly i'm the duke of wellington march stamping forward with the right leg a little bent and the sword still pointed towards maggie who trembling and with tear filled eyes got upon the bed as the only means of widening the space between them tom happy in this spectator even though it was only maggie proceeded to such an exhibition of the cut and thrust as would be expected of the duke of wellington tom i will not bear it i will scream said maggie at the first movement of the sword you'll hurt yourself you'll cut your head off one two said tom firmly though at two his wrist trembled a little three came more slowly and with it the sword swung downwards and maggie gave a loud shriek the sword had fallen with its edge on tom's foot and in a moment after he had fallen too maggie leaped from the bed still shrieking and soon there was a rush of footsteps towards the room mr stelling from his upstairs study was the first to enter he found both the children on the floor tom had fainted and maggie was shaking him by the collar of his jacket screaming with wild eyes she thought he was dead poor child and yet she shook him as if that would bring him back to life in another minute she was sobbing with joy because tom had opened his eyes she couldn't sorrow yet that he had hurt his foot it seemed as if all happiness lay in his being alive in a very short time the wounded hero was put to bed and a surgeon was fetched who dressed the wound with a serious face which greatly impressed every one chapter xiii philip and maggie poor tom bore his severe pain like a hero but there was a terrible dread weighing on his mind so terrible that he dared not ask the question which might bring the fatal yes he dared not ask the surgeon or mr stelling shall i be lame sir it had not occurred to either of these gentlemen to set the lad's mind at rest with hopeful words but philip watched the surgeon out of the house and waylaid mr stelling to ask the very question that tom had not dared to ask for himself i beg your pardon sir but does mr askern say tulliver will be lame oh no oh no said mr stelling only for a little while did he tell tulliver so sir do you think no nothing was said to him on the subject then i may go and tell him sir yes to be sure now you mention it i dare say he may be troubling about that go to his bedroom but be very quiet it had been philip's first thought when he heard of the accident will tulliver be lame it will be very hard for him if he is and tom's offences against himself were all washed out by that pity mr askern says you'll soon be all right again tulliver did you know he said rather timidly as he stepped gently up to tom's bed i've just been to ask mr stelling and he says you'll walk as well as ever again by and by tom looked up with that stopping of the breath which comes with a sudden joy then he gave a long sigh and turned his blue gray eyes straight on philip's face as he had not done for a fortnight or more as for maggie the bare idea of tom's being always lame overcame her and she clung to him and cried afresh don't be a little silly magsie said tom tenderly feeling very brave now i shall soon get well good bye tulliver said philip putting out his small delicate hand which tom clasped with his strong fingers i say said tom ask mr stelling to let you come and sit with me sometimes till i get up again wakem and tell me about robert bruce you know after that philip spent all his time out of lesson hours with tom and maggie tom liked to hear fighting stories as much as ever but he said he was sure that those great fighters who did so many wonderful things and came off unhurt wore excellent armour from head to foot which made fighting easy work one day soon after philip had been to visit tom he and maggie were in the study alone together while tom's foot was being dressed philip was at his books and maggie went and leaned on the table near him to see what he was doing for they were quite old friends now and perfectly at home with each other what are you reading about in greek she said it's poetry i can see that because the lines are so short it's about the lame man i was telling you of yesterday he answered resting his head on his hand and looking at her as if he were not at all sorry to stop maggie continued to lean forward resting on her arms while her dark eyes got more and more fixed and vacant as if she had quite forgotten philip and his book maggie said philip after a minute or two still leaning on his elbow and looking at her if you had had a brother like me do you think you should have loved him as well as tom maggie started a little and said what philip repeated his question oh yes better she answered immediately no not better because i don't think i could love you better than tom but i should be so sorry so sorry for you philip coloured maggie young as she was felt her mistake hitherto she had behaved as if she were quite unconscious of philip's deformity but you are so very clever philip and you can play and sing she added quickly i wish you were my brother i'm very fond of you and you would stay at home with me when tom went out and you would teach me everything wouldn't you greek and everything but you'll go away soon and go to school maggie said philip and then you'll forget all about me and not care for me any more and then i shall see you when you're grown up and you'll hardly take any notice of me oh no i shan't forget you i'm sure said maggie shaking her head very seriously i never forget anything and i think about everybody when i'm away from them i think about poor yap he's got a lump in his throat and luke says he'll die only don't you tell tom because it will vex him so you never saw yap he's a queer little dog nobody cares about him but tom and me do you care as much about me as you do about yap maggie said philip smiling rather sadly oh yes i should think so said maggie laughing i'm very fond of you maggie i shall never forget you said philip and when i'm very unhappy i shall always think of you and wish i had a sister with dark eyes just like yours why do you like my eyes said maggie well pleased she had never heard of any one but her father speak of her eyes as if they had merit i don't know said philip they're not like any other eyes they seem trying to speak trying to speak kindly i don't like other people to look at me much but i like you to look at me maggie why i think you're fonder of me than tom is said maggie then wondering how she could convince philip that she could like him just as well although he was crooked she said should you like me to kiss you as i do tom i will if you like yes very much nobody kisses me maggie put her arm round his neck and kissed him there now she said i shall always remember you and kiss you when i see you again if it's ever so long but i'll go now because i think mr askern's done with tom's foot when their father came the second time maggie said to him o father philip wakem is so very good to tom he is such a clever boy and i do love him and you love him too tom don't you say you love him she added entreatingly tom coloured a little as he looked at his father and said i shan't be friends with him when i leave school father but we've made it up now since my foot has been bad and he's taught me to play at draughts and i can beat him well well said mr tulliver if he's good to you try and make him amends and be good to him he's a poor crooked creatur and takes after his dead mother but don't you be getting too thick with him he's got his father's blood in him too by the time tom had reached his last quarter at king's lorton the years had made striking changes in him he was a tall youth now and wore his tail coat and his stand up collars maggie too was tall now with braided and coiled hair she was almost as tall as tom though she was only thirteen and she really looked older than he did at last the day came when tom was to say good bye to his tutor and maggie came over to king's lorton to fetch him home mr stelling put his hand on tom's shoulder and said god bless you my boy let me know how you get on then he pressed maggie's hand but there were no audible good byes tom had so often thought how joyful he should be the day he left school for good and now that the great event had come his school years seemed like a holiday that had
