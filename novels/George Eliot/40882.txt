departed from the old coach roads the great roadside inns were still brilliant with well polished tankards the smiling glances of pretty barmaids and the repartees of jocose hostlers the mail still announced itself by the merry notes of the horn the hedge cutter or the rick thatcher might still know the exact hour by the unfailing yet otherwise meteoric apparition of the pea green tally ho or the yellow independent and elderly gentlemen in pony chaises quartering nervously to make way for the rolling swinging swiftness had not ceased to remark that times were finely changed since they used to see the pack horses and hear the tinkling of their bells on this very highway in those days there were pocket boroughs a birmingham unrepresented in parliament and compelled to make strong representations out of it unrepealed corn laws three and sixpenny letters a brawny and many breeding pauperism and other departed evils but there were some pleasant things too which have also departed non omnia grandior tas qu fugiamus habet says the wise goddess you have not the best of it in all things o youngsters the elderly man has his enviable memories and not the least of them is the memory of a long journey in mid spring or autumn on the outside of a stage coach posterity may be shot like a bullet through a tube by atmospheric pressure from winchester to newcastle that is a fine result to have among our hopes but the slow old fashioned way of getting from one end of our country to the other is the better thing to have in the memory the tube journey can never lend much to picture and narrative it is as barren as an exclamatory o whereas the happy outside passenger seated on the box from the dawn to the gloaming gathered enough stories of english life enough of english labors in town and country enough aspects of earth and sky to make episodes for a modern odyssey suppose only that his journey took him through that central plain watered at one extremity by the avon at the other by the trent as the morning silvered the meadows with their long lines of bushy willows marking the water courses or burnished the golden corn ricks clustered near the long roofs of some midland homestead he saw the full uddered cows driven from their pasture to the early milking perhaps it was the shepherd head servant of the farm who drove them his sheep dog following with a heedless unofficial air as of a beadle in undress the shepherd with a slow and slouching walk timed by the walk of grazing beasts moved aside as if unwillingly throwing out a monosyllabic hint to his cattle his glance accustomed to rest on things very near the earth seemed to lift itself with difficulty to the coachman mail or stage coach for him belonged to the mysterious distant system of things called gover'ment which whatever it might be was no business of his any more than the most outlying nebula or the coal sacks of the southern hemisphere his solar system was the parish the master's temper and the casualties of lambing time were his region of storms he cut his bread and bacon with his pocket knife and felt no bitterness except in the matter of pauper laborers and the bad luck that sent contrarious seasons and the sheep rot he and his cows were soon left behind and the homestead too with its pond overhung by elder trees its untidy kitchen garden and cone shaped yew tree arbor but everywhere the bushy hedgerows wasted the land with their straggling beauty shrouded the grassy borders of the pastures with catkined hazels and tossed their long blackberry branches on the corn fields perhaps they were white with may or starred with pale pink dog roses perhaps the urchins were already nutting among them or gathering the plenteous crabs it was worth the journey only to see those hedgerows the liberal homes of unmarketable beauty of the purple blossomed ruby berried nightshade of the wild convolvulus climbing and spreading in tendriled strength till it made a great curtain of pale green hearts and white trumpets of the many tubed honey suckle which in its most delicate fragrance hid a charm more subtle and penetrating than beauty even if it were winter the hedgerows showed their coral the scarlet haws the deep crimson hips with lingering brown leaves to make a resting place for the jewels of the hoar frost such hedgerows were often as tall as the laborers' cottages dotted along the lanes or clustered into a small hamlet their little dingy windows telling like thick filmed eyes of nothing but the darkness within the passenger on the coach box bowled along above such a hamlet saw chiefly the roofs of it probably it turned its back on the road and seemed to lie away from everything but its own patch of earth and sky away from the parish church by long fields and green lanes away from all intercourse except that of tramps if its face could be seen it was most likely dirty but the dirt was protestant dirt and the big bold gin breathing tramps were protestant tramps there was no sign of superstition near no crucifix or image to indicate a misguided reverence the inhabitants were probably so free from superstition that they were in much less awe of the parson than of the overseer yet they were saved from the excess of protestantism by not knowing how to read and by the absence of handlooms and mines to be the pioneers of dissent they were kept safely in the via media of indifference and could have registered themselves in the census by a big black mark as members of the church of england but there were trim cheerful villages too with a neat or handsome parsonage and gray church set in the midst there was the pleasant tinkle of the blacksmith's anvil the patient cart horses waiting at his door the basket maker peeling his willow wands in the sunshine the wheelwright putting his last touch to a blue cart with red wheels here and there a cottage with bright transparent windows showing pots full of blooming balsams or geraniums and little gardens in front all double daisies or dark wallflowers at the well clean and comely women carrying yoked buckets and toward the free school small britons dawdling on and handling their marbles in the pockets of unpatched corduroys adorned with brass buttons the land around was rich and marly great corn stacks stood in the rick yards for the rick burners had not found their way hither the homesteads were those of rich farmers who paid no rent or had the rare advantage of a lease and could afford to keep the corn till prices had risen the coach would be sure to overtake some of them on their way to their outlying fields or to the market town sitting heavily on their well groomed horses or weighing down one side of an olive green gig they probably thought of the coach with some contempt as an accommodation for people who had not their own gigs or who wanting to travel to london and such distant places belonged to the trading and less solid part of the nation the passenger on the box could see that this was the district of protuberant optimists sure that old england was the best of all possible countries and that if there were any facts which had not fallen under their own observation they were facts not worth observing the district of clean little market towns without manufactures of fat livings an aristocratic clergy and low poor rates but as the day wore on the scene would change the land would begin to be blackened with coal pits the rattle of handlooms to be heard in hamlets and villages here were powerful men walking queerly with knees bent outward from squatting in the mine going home to throw themselves down in their blackened flannel and sleep through the daylight then rise and spend much of their high wages at the ale house with their fellows of the benefit club here the pale eager faces of the handloom weavers men and women haggard from sitting up late at night to finish the week's work hardly begun till the wednesday everywhere the cottages and the small children were dirty for the languid mothers gave their strength to the loom pious dissenting women perhaps who took life patiently and thought that salvation depended chiefly on predestination and not at all on cleanliness the gables of dissenting chapels now made a visible sign of religion and of a meeting place to counterbalance the ale house even in the hamlets but if a couple of old termagants were seen tearing each other's caps it was a safe conclusion that if they had not received the sacraments of the church they had not at least given in to schismatic rites and were free from the errors of voluntaryism the breath of the manufacturing town which made a cloudy day and a red gloom by night on the horizon diffused itself over all the surrounding country filling the air with eager unrest here was a population not convinced that old england was as good as possible here were multitudinous men and women aware that their religion was not exactly the religion of their rulers who might therefore be better than they were and who if better might alter many things which now made the world perhaps more painful than it need be and certainly more sinful yet there were the gray steeples too and the churchyards with their grassy mounds and venerable headstones sleeping in the sunlight there were broad fields and homesteads and fine old woods covering a rising ground or stretching far by the roadside allowing only peeps at the park and mansion which they shut in from the working day world in these midland districts the traveller passed rapidly from one phase of english life to another after looking down on a village dingy with coal dust noisy with the shaking of looms he might skirt a parish all of fields high hedges and deep rutted lanes after the coach had rattled over the pavement of a manufacturing town the scenes of riots and trades union meetings it would take him in another ten minutes into a rural region where the neighborhood of the town was only felt in the advantages of a near market for corn cheese and hay and where men with a considerable banking account were accustomed to say that they never meddled with politics themselves the busy scenes of the shuttle and the wheel of the roaring furnace of the shaft and the pulley seemed to make but crowded nests in the midst of the large spaced slow moving life of homesteads and far away cottages and oak sheltered parks looking at the dwellings scattered amongst the woody flats and the plowed uplands under the low gray sky which overhung them with an unchanging stillness as if time itself were pausing it was easy for the traveller to conceive that town and country had no pulse in common except where the handlooms made a far reaching straggling fringe about the great centres of manufacture that till the agitation about the catholics in ' rural englishmen had hardly known more of catholics than of the fossil mammals and that their notion of reform was a confused combination of rick burners trades unions nottingham riots and in general whatever required the calling out of the yeomanry it was still easier to see that for the most part they resisted the rotation of crops and stood by their fallows and the coachman would perhaps tell how in one parish an innovating farmer who talked of sir humphrey davy had been fairly driven out by popular dislike as if he had been a confounded radical and how the parson having one sunday preached from the words break up your fallow ground the people thought he had made the text out of his own head otherwise it would never have come so pat on a matter of business but when they found it in the bible at home some said it was an argument for fallows else why should the bible mention fallows but a few of the weaker sort were shaken and thought it was an argument that fallows should be done away with else the bible would have said let your fallows lie and the next morning the parson had a stroke of apoplexy which as coincident with a dispute about fallows so set the parish against the innovating farmer and the rotation of crops that he could stand his ground no longer and transferred his lease the coachman was an excellent travelling companion and commentator on the landscape he could tell the names of sites and persons and explain the meaning of groups as well as the shade of virgil in a more memorable journey he had as many stories about parishes and the men and women in them as the wanderer in the excursion only his style was different his view of life had originally been genial such as became a man who was well warmed within and without and held a position of easy undisputed authority but the recent initiation of railways had embittered him he now as in a perpetual vision saw the ruined country strewn with shattered limbs and regarded mr huskisson's death as a proof of god's anger against stephenson why every inn on the road would be shut up and at that word the coachman looked before him with the blank gaze of one who had driven his coach to the outermost edge of the universe and saw his leaders plunging into the abyss still he would soon relapse from the high prophetic strain to the familiar one of narrative he knew whose the land was wherever he drove what noblemen had half ruined themselves by gambling who made handsome returns of rent and who was at daggers drawn with his eldest son he perhaps remembered the fathers of actual baronets and knew stories of their extravagant or stingy housekeeping whom they had married whom they had horsewhipped whether they were particular about preserving their game and whether they had had much to do with canal companies about any actual landed proprietor he could also tell whether he was a reformer or an anti reformer that was a distinction which had turned up in latter times and along with it the paradox very puzzling to the coachman's mind that there were men of old family and large estate who voted for the bill he did not grapple with the paradox he let it pass with all the discreetness of an experienced theologian or learned scholiast preferring to point his whip at some object which could raise no questions no such paradox troubled our coachman when leaving the town of treby magna behind him he drove between the hedges for a mile or so crossed the queer long bridge over the river lapp and then put his horses to a swift gallop up the hill by the low nestled village of little treby till they were on the fine level road skirted on one side by grand larches oaks and wych elms which sometimes opened so far as to let the traveller see that there was a park behind them how many times in the year as the coach rolled past the neglected looking lodges which interrupted the screen of trees and showed the river winding through a finely timbered park had the coachman answered the same questions or told the same things without being questioned that oh that was transome court a place there had been a fine sight of lawsuits about generations back the heir of the transome name had somehow bargained away the estate and it fell to the durfeys very distant connections who only called themselves transomes because they had got the estate but the durfeys' claim had been disputed over and over again and the coachman if he had been asked would have said though he might have to fall down dead the next minute that property didn't always get into the right hands however the lawyers had found their luck in it and people who inherited estates that were lawed about often lived in them as poorly as a mouse in a hollow cheese and by what he could make out that had been the way with these present durfeys or transomes as they called themselves as for mr transome he was as poor half witted a fellow as you'd wish to see but she was master had come of a high family and had a spirit you might see it in her eye and the way she sat her horse forty years ago when she came into this country they said she was a pictur' but her family was poor and so she took up with a hatchet faced fellow like this transome and the eldest son had been just such another as his father only worse a wild sort of half natural who got into bad company they said his mother hated him and wished him dead for she'd got another son quite of a different cut who had gone to foreign parts when he was a youngster and she wanted her favorite to be heir but heir or no heir lawyer jermyn had had his picking out of the estate not a door in his big house but what was the finest polished oak all got off the transome estate if anybody liked to believe he paid for it they were welcome however lawyer jermyn had sat on that box seat many and many a time he had made the wills of most people thereabout the coachman would not say that lawyer jermyn was not the man he would choose to make his own will some day it was not so well for a lawyer to be over honest else he might not be up to other people's tricks and as for the transome business there had been ins and outs in time gone by so that you couldn't look into it straight backward at this mr sampson everybody in north loamshire knew sampson's coach would screw his features into a grimace expressive of entire neutrality and appear to aim his whip at a particular spot on the horse's flank if the passenger was curious for further knowledge concerning the transome affairs sampson would shake his head and say there had been fine stories in his time but he never condescended to state what the stories were some attributed this reticence to a wise incredulity others to a want of memory others to simple ignorance but at least sampson was right in saying that there had been fine stories meaning ironically stories not altogether creditable to the parties concerned and such stories often come to be fine in a sense that is not ironical for there is seldom any wrong doing which does not carry along with it some downfall of blindly climbing hopes some hard entail of suffering some quickly satiated desire that survives with the life in death of old paralytic vice to see itself cursed by its woeful progeny some tragic mark of kinship in the one brief life to the far stretching life that went before and to the life that is to come after such as has raised the pity and terror of men ever since they began to discern between will and destiny but these things are often unknown to the world for there is much pain that is quite noiseless and vibrations that make human agonies are often a mere whisper in the roar of hurrying existence there are glances of hatred that stab and raise no cry of murder robberies that leave man or woman forever beggared of peace and joy yet kept secret by the sufferer committed to no sound except that of low moans in the night seen in no writing except that made on the face by the slow months of suppressed anguish and early morning tears many an inherited sorrow that has marred a life has been breathed into no human ear the poets have told us of a dolorous enchanted forest in the under world the thorn bushes there and the thick barked stems have human histories hidden in them the power of unuttered cries dwells in the passionless seeming branches and the red warm blood is darkly feeding the quivering nerves of a sleepless memory that watches through all dreams these things are a parable chapter i he left me when the down upon his lip lay like the shadow of a hovering kiss beautiful mother do not grieve he said i will be great and build our fortunes high and you shall wear the longest train at court and look so queenly all the lords shall say 'she is a royal changeling there is some crown lacks the right head since hers wears naught but braids' o he is coming now but i am gray and he on the first of september in the memorable year some one was expected at transome court as early as two o'clock in the afternoon the aged lodge keeper had opened the heavy gate green as the tree trunks were green with nature's powdery paint deposited year after year already in the village of little treby which lay on the side of a steep hill not far off the lodge gates the elder matrons sat in their best gowns at the few cottage doors bordering the road that they might be ready to get up and make their courtesy when a travelling carriage should come in sight and beyond the village several small boys were stationed on the look out intending to run a race to the barn like old church where the sexton waited in the belfry ready to set the one bell in joyful agitation just at the right moment the old lodge keeper had opened the gate and left it in the charge of his lame wife because he was wanted at the court to sweep away the leaves and perhaps to help in the stables for though transome court was a large mansion built in the fashion of queen anne's time with a park and grounds as fine as any to be seen in loamshire there were very few servants about it especially it seemed there must be a lack of gardeners for except on the terrace surrounded with a stone parapet in front of the house where there was a parterre kept with some neatness grass had spread itself over the gravel walks and over all the low mounds once carefully cut as black beds for the shrubs and larger plants many of the windows had the shutters closed and under the grand scotch fir that stooped toward one corner the brown fir needles of many years lay in a small stone balcony in front of two such darkened windows all round both near and far there were grand trees motionless in the still sunshine and like all large motionless things seemed to add to the stillness here and there a leaf fluttered down petals fell in a silent shower a heavy moth fluttered by and when it settled seemed to fall wearily the tiny birds alighted on the walks and hopped about in perfect tranquillity even a stray rabbit sat nibbling a leaf that was to its liking in the middle of a grassy space with an air that seemed quite impudent in so timid a creature no sound was to be heard louder than a sleepy hum and the soft monotony of running water hurrying on to the river that divided the park standing on the south or east side of the house you would never have guessed that an arrival was expected but on the west side where the carriage entrance was the gates under the stone archway were thrown open and so was the double door of the entrance hall letting in the warm light on the scagliola pillars the marble statues and the broad stone staircase with its matting worn into large holes and stronger sign of expectation than all from one of the doors that surrounded the entrance hall there came forth from time to time a lady who walked lightly over the polished stone floor and stood on the door steps and watched and listened she walked lightly for her figure was slim and finely formed though she was between fifty and sixty she was a tall proud looking woman with abundant gray hair dark eyes and eyebrows and a somewhat eagle like yet not unfeminine face her tight fitting black dress was much worn the fine lace of her cuffs and collar and of the small veil that fell backward over her high comb was visibly mended but rare jewels flashed on her hands which lay on her folded black clad arms like finely cut onyx cameos meantime mrs transome went to the door steps watching and listening in vain each time she returned to the same room it was a moderate sized comfortable room with low ebony bookshelves round it and it formed an ante room to a large library of which a glimpse could be seen through an open doorway partly obstructed by a heavy tapestry curtain drawn on one side there was a great deal of tarnished gilding and dinginess on the walls and furniture of this smaller room but the pictures above the bookcases were all of a cheerful kind portraits in pastel of pearly skinned ladies with hair powder blue ribbons and low bodices a splendid portrait in oils of a transome in the gorgeous dress of the restoration another of a transome in his boyhood with his hand on the neck of a small pony and a large flemish battle piece where war seemed only a picturesque blue and red accident in a vast sunny expanse of plain and sky probably such cheerful pictures had been chosen because this was mrs transome's usual sitting room it was certainly for this reason that near the chair in which she seated herself each time she re entered there hung a picture of a youthful face which bore a strong resemblance to her own a beardless but masculine face with rich brown hair hanging low on the forehead and undulating beside each cheek down to the loose white cravat near this same chair were her writing table with vellum covered account books on it the cabinet in which she kept her neatly arranged drugs her basket for her embroidery a folio volume of architectural engravings from which she took her embroidery patterns a number of the north loamshire herald and the cushion for her fat blenheim which was too old and sleepy to notice its mistress's restlessness for just now mrs transome could not abridge the sunny tedium of the day by the feeble interest of her usual indoor occupations her consciousness was absorbed by memories and prospects and except that she walked to the entrance door to look out she sat motionless with folded arms involuntarily from time to time turning toward the portrait close by her and as often when its young brown eyes met hers turning away again with self checking resolution at last prompted by some sudden thought or by some sound she rose and went hastily beyond the tapestry curtain into the library she paused near the door without speaking apparently she only wished to see that no harm was being done a man nearer seventy than sixty was in the act of ranging on a large library table a series of shallow drawers some of them containing dried insects others mineralogical specimens his pale mild eyes receding lower jaw and slight frame could never have expressed much vigor either bodily or mental but he had now the unevenness of gait and feebleness of gesture which tell of a past paralytic seizure his threadbare clothes were thoroughly brushed his soft white hair was carefully parted and arranged he was not a neglected looking old man and at his side a fine black retriever also old sat on its haunches and watched him as he went to and fro but when mrs transome appeared within the doorway her husband paused in his work and shrank like a timid animal looked at in a cage where flight was impossible he was conscious of a troublesome intention for which he had been rebuked before that of disturbing all his specimens with a view to a new arrangement after an interval in which his wife stood perfectly still observing him he began to put back the drawers in their places in the row of cabinets which extended under the bookshelves at one end of the library when they were all put back and closed mrs transome turned away and the frightened old man seated himself with nimrod the retriever on an ottoman peeping at him again a few minutes after she saw that he had his arm round nimrod's neck and was uttering his thoughts to the dog in a loud whisper as little children do to any object near them when they believe themselves unwatched at last the sound of the church bell reached mrs transome's ear and she knew that before long the sound of wheels must be within hearing but she did not at once start up and walk to the entrance door she sat still quivering and listening her lips became pale her hands were cold and trembling was her son really coming she was far beyond fifty and since her early gladness in this best loved boy the harvest of her life had been scanty could it be that now when her hair was gray when sight had become one of the day's fatigues when her young accomplishments seemed almost ludicrous like the tone of her first harpsichord and the words of the song long browned with age she was going to reap an assured joy to feel that the doubtful deeds of her life were justified by the result since a kind providence had sanctioned them to be no longer tacitly pitied by her neighbors for her lack of money her imbecile husband her graceless eldest born and the loneliness of her life but to have at her side a rich clever possibly a tender son yes but there were the fifteen years of separation and all that had happened in that long time to throw her into the background of her son's memory and affection and yet did not men sometimes become more filial in their feeling when experience had mellowed them and they had themselves become fathers still if mrs transome had expected only her son she would have trembled less she expected a little grandson also and there were reasons why she had not been enraptured when her son had written to her only when he was on the eve of returning that he already had an heir born to him but the facts must be accepted as they stood and after all the chief thing was to have her son back again such pride such affection such hopes as she cherished in this fifty sixth year of her life must find their gratification in him or nowhere once more she glanced at the portrait the young brown eyes seemed to dwell on her pleasantly but turning from it with a sort of impatience and saying aloud of course he will be altered she rose almost with difficulty and walked more slowly than before across the hall to the entrance door already the sound of wheels was loud upon the gravel the momentary surprise of seeing that it was only a post chaise without a servant or much luggage that was passing under the stone archway and then wheeling round against the flight of stone steps was at once merged in the sense that there was a dark face under a red travelling cap looking at her from the window she saw nothing else she was not even conscious that the small group of her own servants had mustered or that old hickes the butler had come forward to open the chaise door she heard herself called mother and felt a light kiss on each cheek but stronger than all that sensation was the consciousness which no previous thought could prepare her for that this son who had come back to her was a stranger three minutes before she had fancied that in spite of all changes wrought by fifteen years of separation she should clasp her son again as she had done at their parting but in the moment when their eyes met the sense of strangeness came upon her like a terror it was not hard to understand that she was agitated and the son led her across the hall to the sitting room closing the door behind them then he turned toward her and said smiling you would not have known me eh mother it was perhaps the truth if she had seen him in a crowd she might have looked at him without recognition not however without startled wonder for though the likeness to herself was no longer striking the years had overlaid it with another likeness which would have arrested her before she answered him his eyes with a keen restlessness as unlike as possible to the lingering gaze of the portrait had travelled quickly over the room alighting on her as she said everything is changed harold i am an old woman you see but straighter and more upright than some of the young ones said harold inwardly however feeling that age had made his mother's face very anxious and eager the old women at smyrna are like sacks you've not got clumsy and shapeless how is it i have the trick of getting fat here harold lifted his arm and spread out his plump hand i remember my father was as thin as a herring how is my father where is he mrs transome just pointed to the curtained doorway and let her son pass through it alone she was not given to tears but now under the pressure of emotion that could find no other vent they burst forth she took care that they should be silent tears and before harold came out of the library again they were dried mrs transome had not the feminine tendency to seek influence through pathos she had been used to rule in virtue of acknowledged superiority the consciousness that she had to make her son's acquaintance and that her knowledge of the youth of nineteen might help her little in interpreting the man of thirty four had fallen like lead on her soul but in this new acquaintance of theirs she cared especially that her son who had seen a strange world should feel that he was come home to a mother who was to be consulted on all things and who could supply his lack of the local experience necessary to an english landholder her part in life had been that of the clever sinner and she was equipped with the views the reasons and the habits which belonged to that character life would have little meaning for her if she were to be gently thrust aside as a harmless elderly woman and besides there were secrets which her son must never know so by the time harold came from the library again the traces of tears were not discernible except to a very careful observer and he did not observe his mother carefully his eyes only glanced at her on their way to the north loamshire herald lying on the table near her which he took up with his left hand as he said gad what a wreck poor father is paralysis eh terribly shrunk and shaken crawls about among his books and beetles as usual though well it's a slow and easy death but he's not much over sixty five is he sixty seven counting by birthdays but your father was born old i think said mrs transome a little flushed with the determination not to show any unasked for feeling her son did not notice her all the time he had been speaking his eyes had been running down the columns of the newspaper but your little boy harold where is he how is it he has not come with you oh i left him behind in town said harold still looking at the paper my man dominic will bring him with the rest of the luggage ah i see it is young debarry and not my old friend sir maximus who is offering himself as candidate for north loamshire yes you did not answer me when i wrote to you to london about your standing there is no other tory candidate spoken of and you would have all the debarry interest i hardly think that said harold significantly why jermyn says a tory candidate can never be got in without it but i shall not be a tory candidate mrs transome felt something like an electric shock what then she said almost sharply you will not call yourself a whig god forbid i'm a radical mrs transome's limbs tottered she sank into a chair here was a distinct confirmation of the vague but strong feeling that her son was a stranger to her here was a revelation to which it seemed almost as impossible to adjust her hopes and notions of a dignified life as if her son had said that he had been converted to mahometanism at smyrna and had four wives instead of one son shortly to arrive under the care of dominic for the moment she had a sickening feeling that it was of no use that the long delayed good fortune had come at last all of no use though the unloved durfey was dead and buried and though harold had come home with plenty of money there were rich radicals she was aware as there were rich jews and dissenters but she had never thought of them as county people sir francis burdett had been generally regarded as a madman it was better to ask no questions but silently to prepare herself for anything else there might be to come will you go to your rooms harold and see if there is anything you would like to have altered yes let us go said harold throwing down the newspaper in which he had been rapidly reading almost every advertisement while his mother had been going through her sharp inward struggle uncle lingon is on the bench still i see he went on as he followed her across the hall is he at home will he be here this evening he says you must go to the rectory when you want to see him you must remember you have come back to a family with old fashioned notions your uncle thought i ought to have you to myself in the first hour or two he remembered that i had not seen my son for fifteen years ah by jove fifteen years so it is said harold taking his mother's hand and drawing it under his arm for he had perceived that her words were charged with an intention and you are as straight as an arrow still you will carry the shawls i have brought you as well as ever they walked up the broad stone steps together in silence under the shock of discovering her son's radicalism mrs transome had no impulse to say one thing rather than another as in a man who had just been branded on the forehead all wonted motives would be uprooted harold on his side had no wish opposed to filial kindness but his busy thoughts were determined by habits which had no reference to any woman's feelings and even if he could have conceived what his mother's feeling was his mind after that momentary arrest would have darted forward on its usual course i have given you the south rooms harold said mrs transome as they passed along a corridor lit from above and lined with old family pictures i thought they would suit you best as they all open into each other and this middle one will make a pleasant sitting room for you gad the furniture is in a bad state said harold glancing around at the middle room which they had just entered the moths seem to have got into the carpets and hangings i had no choice except moths or tenants who would pay rent said mrs transome we have been too poor to keep servants for uninhabited rooms what you've been rather pinched eh you find us living as we have been living these twelve years ah you've had durfey's debts as well as the lawsuits confound them it will make a hole in sixty thousand pounds to pay off the mortgages however he's gone now poor fellow and i suppose i should have spent more in buying an english estate some time or other i always meant to be an englishman and thrash a lord or two who thrashed me at eton i hardly thought you could have meant that harold when i found you had married a foreign wife would you have had me wait for a consumptive lackadaisical englishwoman who would have hung all her relations around my neck i hate english wives they want to give their opinion about everything they interfere with a man's life i shall not marry again mrs transome bit her lip and turned away to draw up a blind she would not reply to words which showed how completely any conception of herself and her feelings was excluded from her son's inward world as she turned round again she said i suppose you have been used to great luxury these rooms look miserable to you but you can soon make any alterations you like oh i must have a private sitting room fitted up for myself down stairs and the rest are bedrooms i suppose he went on opening a side door ah i can sleep here a night or two but there's a bedroom down stairs with an ante room i remember that would do for my man dominic and the little boy i should like to have that your father has slept there for years he will be like a distracted insect and never know where to go if you alter the track he has to walk in that's a pity i hate going up stairs there is the steward's room it is not used and might be turned into a bedroom i can't offer you my room for i sleep up stairs mrs transome's tongue could be a whip upon occasion but the lash had not fallen on a sensitive spot no i'm determined not to sleep up stairs we'll see about the steward's room to morrow and i dare say i shall find a closet of some sort for dominic it's a nuisance he had to stay behind for i shall have nobody to cook for me ah there's the old river i used to fish in i often thought when i was at smyrna that i would buy a park with a river through it as much like the lapp as possible gad what fine oaks those are opposite some of them must come down though i've held every tree sacred on the demesne as i told you harold i trusted to your getting the estate some time and releasing it and i determined to keep it worth releasing a park without fine timber is no better than a beauty without teeth and hair bravo mother said harold putting his hand on her shoulder ah you've had to worry yourself about things that don't properly belong to a woman my father being weakly we'll set all that right you shall have nothing to do now but to be grandmamma on satin cushions you must excuse me from the satin cushions that is a part of the old woman's duty i am not prepared for i am used to be chief bailiff and to sit in the saddle two or three hours every day there are two farms on our hands besides the home farm phew ew jermyn manages the estate badly then that will not last under my reign said harold turning on his heel and feeling in his pockets for the keys of his portmanteaus which had been brought up perhaps when you've been in england a little longer said mrs transome coloring as if she had been a girl you will understand better the difficulty there is in letting farms these times i understand the difficulty perfectly mother to let farms a man must have the sense to see what will make them inviting to farmers and to get sense supplied on demand is just the most difficult transaction i know of i suppose if i ring there's some fellow who can act as valet and learn to attend to my hookah there is hickes the butler and there is jabez the footman those are all the men in the house they were here when you left oh i remember jabez he was a dolt i'll have old hickes he was a neat little machine of a butler his words used to come like the clicks of an engine he must be an old machine now though you seem to remember some things about home wonderfully well harold never forget places and people how they look and what can be done with them all the country round here lies like a map in my brain a deuced pretty country too but the people were a stupid set of old whigs and tories i suppose they are much as they were i am at least harold you are the first of your family that ever talked of being a radical i did not think i was taking care of our old oaks for that i always thought radicals' houses stood staring above poor sticks of young trees and iron hurdles yes but the radical sticks are growing mother and half the tory oaks are rotting said harold with gay carelessness you've arranged for jermyn to be early to morrow he will be here to breakfast at nine but i leave you to hickes now we dine in an hour mrs transome went away and shut herself in her own dressing room it had come to pass now this meeting with the son who had been the object of so much longing whom she had longed for before he was born for whom she had sinned from whom she had wrenched herself with pain at their parting and whose coming again had been the one great hope of her years the moment was gone by there had been no ecstasy no gladness even hardly half an hour had passed and few words had been spoken yet with that quickness in weaving new futures which belongs to women whose actions have kept them in habitual fear of consequences mrs transome thought she saw with all the clearness of demonstration that her son's return had not been a good for her in the sense of making her any happier she stood before a tall mirror going close to it and looking at her face with hard scrutiny as if it were unrelated to herself no elderly face can be handsome looked at in that way every little detail is startlingly prominent and the effect of the whole is lost she saw the dried up complexion and the deep lines of bitter discontent about the mouth i am a hag she said to herself she was accustomed to give her thoughts a very sharp outline an ugly old woman who happens to be his mother that is what he sees in me as i see a stranger in him i shall count for nothing i was foolish to expect anything else she turned away from the mirror and walked up and down her room what a likeness she said in a loud whisper yet perhaps no one will see it besides me she threw herself into a chair and sat with a fixed look seeing nothing that was actually present but inwardly seeing with painful vividness what had been present with her a little more than thirty years ago the little round limbed creature that had been leaning against her knees and stamping tiny feet and looking up at her with gurgling laughter she had thought that the possession of this child would give unity to her life and make some gladness through the changing years that would grow as fruit out of these early maternal caresses but nothing had come just as she had wished the mother's early raptures had lasted but a short time and even while they lasted there had grown up in the midst of them a hungry desire like a black poisonous plant feeding in the sunlight the desire that her first rickety ugly imbecile child should die and leave room for her darling of whom she could be proud such desires make life a hideous lottery where every day may turn up a blank where men and women who have the softest beds and the most delicate eating who have a very large share of that sky and earth which some are born to have no more of than the fraction to be got in a crowded entry yet grow haggard fevered and restless like those who watch in other lotteries day after day year after year had yielded blanks new cares had come bringing other desires for results quite beyond her grasp which must also be watched for in the lottery and all the while the round limbed pet had been growing into a strong youth who liked many things better than his mother's caresses and who had a much keener consciousness of his independent existence than of his relation to her the lizard's egg that white rounded passive prettiness had become a brown darting determined lizard the mother's love is at first an absorbing delight blunting all other sensibilities it is an expansion of the animal existence it enlarges the imagined range for self to move in but in after years it can only continue to be joy on the same terms as other long lived love that is by much suppression of self and power of living in the experience of another mrs transome had darkly felt the pressure of that unchangeable fact yet she had clung to the belief that somehow the possession of this son was the best thing she lived for to believe otherwise would have made her memory too ghastly a companion some time or other by some means the estate she was struggling to save from the grasp of the law would be harold's somehow the hated durfey the imbecile eldest who seemed to have become tenacious of a despicable squandering life would be got rid of vice might kill him meanwhile the estate was burdened there was no good prospect for any heir harold must go and make a career for himself and this was what he was bent on with a precocious clearness of perception as to the conditions on which he could hope for any advantages in life like most energetic natures he had a strong faith in his luck he had been gay at their parting and had promised to make his fortune and in spite of past disappointments harold's possible fortune still made some ground for his mother to plant her hopes in his luck had not failed him yet nothing had turned out according to her expectations her life had been like a spoiled shabby pleasure day in which the music and the processions are all missed and nothing is left at evening but the weariness of striving after what has been failed of harold had gone with the embassy to constantinople under the patronage of a high relative his mother's cousin he was to be diplomatist and work his way upward in public life but his luck had taken another shape he had saved the life of an armenian banker who in gratitude had offered him a prospect which his practical mind had preferred to the problematic promises of diplomacy and high born cousinship harold had become a merchant and banker at smyrna and let the years pass without caring to find the possibility of visiting his early home and had shown no eagerness to make his life at all familiar to his mother asking for letters about england but writing scantily about himself mrs transome had kept up the habit of writing to her son but gradually the unfruitful years had dulled her hopes and yearnings increasing anxieties about money had worried her and she was more sure of being fretted by bad news about her dissolute eldest son than of hearing anything to cheer her from harold she had begun to live merely in small immediate cares and occupations and like all eager minded women who advance in life without any activity of tenderness or any large sympathy she had contracted small rigid habits of thinking and acting she had her ways which must not be crossed and had learned to fill up the great void of life with giving small orders to tenants insisting on medicines for infirm cottagers winning small triumphs in bargains and personal economies and parrying ill natured remarks of lady debarry's by lancet edged epigrams so her life had gone on till more than a year ago when that desire which had been so hungry when she was a blooming young mother was at last fulfilled at last when her hair was gray and her face looked bitter restless and unenjoying like her life the news came from jersey that durfey the imbecile son was dead now harold was heir to the estate now the wealth he had gained could release the land from its burdens now he would think it worth while to return home a change had come over her life and the sunlight breaking the clouds at evening was pleasant though the sun must sink before long hopes affections the sweeter part of her memories started from their wintry sleep and it once more seemed a great good to have had a second son who in some ways had cost her dearly but again there were conditions she had not reckoned on when the good tidings had been sent to harold and he had announced that he would return so soon as he could wind up his affairs he had for the first time informed his mother that he had been married that his greek wife was no longer living but that he should bring home a little boy the finest and most desirable of heirs and grandsons harold seated in his distant smyrna home considered that he was taking a rational view of what things must have become by this time at the old place in england when he figured his mother as a good elderly lady who would necessarily be delighted with the possession on any terms of a healthy grandchild and would not mind much about the particulars of a long concealed marriage mrs transome had torn up that letter in a rage but in the months which had elapsed before harold could actually arrive she had prepared herself as well as she could to suppress all reproaches or queries which her son might resent and to acquiesce in his evident wishes the return was still looked for with longing affection and satisfied pride would again warm her later years she was ignorant what sort of man harold had become now and of course he must be changed in many ways but though she told herself this still the image that she knew the image fondness clung to necessarily prevailed over the negatives insisted on by her reason and so it was that when she had moved to the door to meet him she had been sure that she should clasp her son again and feel that he was the same who had been her boy her little one the loved child of her passionate youth an hour seemed to have changed everything for her a woman's hopes are woven of sunbeams a shadow annihilates them the shadow which had fallen over mrs transome in this first interview with her son was the presentiment of her powerlessness if things went wrong if harold got unpleasantly disposed in a certain direction where her chief dread had always lain she seemed to foresee that her words would be of no avail the keenness of her anxiety in this matter had served as insight and harold's rapidity decision and indifference to any impressions in others which did not further or impede his own purposes had made themselves felt by her as much as she would have felt the unmanageable strength of a great bird which had alighted near her and allowed her to stroke its wing for a moment because food lay near her under the cold weight of these thoughts mrs transome shivered that physical reaction roused her from her reverie and she could now hear the gentle knocking at the door to which she had been deaf before notwithstanding her activity and the fewness of her servants she had never dressed herself without aid nor would that small neat exquisitely clean old woman who now presented herself have wished that her labor should be saved at the expense of such a sacrifice on her lady's part the small old woman was mrs hickes the butler's wife who acted as housekeeper lady's maid and superintendent of the kitchen the large stony scene of inconsiderable cooking forty years ago she had entered mrs transome's service when that lady was beautiful miss lingon and her mistress still called her denner as she had done in the old days the bell has rung then denner without my hearing it said mrs transome rising yes madam said denner reaching from a wardrobe an old black velvet dress trimmed with much mended point in which mrs transome was wont to look queenly of an evening denner had still strong eyes of that short sighted kind which sees through the narrowest chink between the eyelashes the physical contrast between the tall eagle faced dark eyed lady and the little peering waiting woman who had been round featured and of pale mealy complexion from her youth up had doubtless had a strong influence in determining denner's feeling toward her mistress which was of that worshipful sort paid to a goddess in ages when it was not thought necessary or likely that a goddess should be very moral there were different orders of beings so ran denner's creed and she belonged to another order than that to which her mistress belonged she had a mind as sharp as a needle and would have seen through and through the ridiculous pretensions of a born servant who did not submissively accept the rigid fate which had given her born superiors she would have called such pretensions the wrigglings of a worm that tried to walk on its tail there was a tacit understanding that denner knew all her mistress's secrets and her speech was plain and unflattering yet with wonderful subtlety of instinct she never said anything which mrs transome could feel humiliated by as by familiarity from a servant who knew too much denner identified her own dignity with that of her mistress she was a hard headed godless little woman but with a character to be reckoned on as you reckon on the qualities of iron peering into mrs transome's face she saw clearly that the meeting with the son had been a disappointment in some way she spoke with a refined accent in a low quick monotonous tone mr harold is dressed he shook me by the hand in the corridor and was very pleasant what an alteration denner no likeness to me now handsome though spite of his being so browned and stout there's a fine presence about mr harold i remember you used to say madam there were some people you would always know were in the room though they stood round a corner and others you might never see till you ran against them that's as true as truth and as for likenesses thirty five and sixty are not much alike only to people's memories mrs transome knew perfectly that denner had divined her thoughts i don't know how things will go on now but it seems something too good to happen that they will go on well i am afraid of ever expecting anything good again that's weakness madam things don't happen because they're bad or good else all eggs would be addled or none at all and at the most it is but six to the dozen there's good chances and bad chances and nobody's luck is pulled only by one string what a woman you are denner you talk like a french infidel it seems to me you are afraid of nothing i have been full of fears all my life always seeing something or other hanging over me that i couldn't bear to happen well madam put a good face on it and don't seem to be on the look out for crows else you'll set other people watching here you have a rich son come home and the debts will all be paid and you have your health and can ride about and you've such a face and figure and will have if you live to be eighty that everybody is cap in hand to you before they know you who are let me fasten up your veil a little higher there's a good deal of pleasure in life for you yet nonsense there's no pleasure for old women unless they get it out of tormenting other people what are your pleasures denner besides being a slave to me oh there's pleasure in knowing one's not a fool like half the people one sees about and managing one's husband is some pleasure and doing all one's business well why if i've only got some orange flowers to candy i shouldn't like to die till i see them all right then there's the sunshine now and then i like that as the cats do i look upon it life is like our game at whist when banks and his wife come to the still room of an evening i don't enjoy the game much but i like to play my cards well and see what will be the end of it and i want to see you make the best of your hand madam for your luck has been mine these forty years now but i must go and see how kitty dishes up the dinner unless you have any more commands no denner i am going down immediately as mrs transome descended the stone staircase in her old black velvet and point her appearance justified denner's personal compliment she had that high born imperious air which would have marked her as an object of hatred and reviling by a revolutionary mob her person was too typical of social distinctions to be passed by with indifference by any one it would have fitted an empress in her own right who had had to rule in spite of faction to dare the violation of treaties and dread retributive invasions to grasp after new territories to be defiant in desperate circumstances and to feel a woman's hunger of the heart forever unsatisfied yet mrs transome's cares and occupations had not been at all of an imperial sort for thirty years she had led the monotonous narrowing life which used to be the lot of our poorer gentry who never went to town and were probably not on speaking terms with two out of the five families whose parks lay within the distance of a drive when she was young she had been thought wonderfully clever and accomplished and had been rather ambitious of intellectual superiority had secretly picked out for private reading the higher parts of dangerous french authors and in company had been able to talk of mr burke's style or of chateaubriand's eloquence had laughed at the lyrical ballads and admired mr southey's thalaba she always thought that the dangerous french writers were wicked and that her reading of them was a sin but many sinful things were highly agreeable to her and many things which she did not doubt to be good and true were dull and meaningless she found ridicule of biblical characters very amusing and she was interested in stories of illicit passion but she believed all the while that truth and safety lay in due attendance on prayers and sermons in the admirable doctrines and ritual of the church of england equally remote from puritanism and popery in fact in such a view of this world and the next as would preserve the existing arrangements of english society quite unshaken keeping down the obtrusiveness of the vulgar and the discontent of the poor the history of the jews she knew ought to be preferred to any profane history the pagans of course were vicious and their religions quite nonsensical considered as religions but classical learning came from the pagans the greeks were famous for sculpture the italians for painting the middle ages were dark and papistical but now christianity went hand in hand with civilization and the providential government of the world though a little confused and entangled in foreign countries in our favored land was clearly seen to be carried forward on tory and church of england principles sustained by the succession of the house of brunswick and by sound english divines for miss lingon had had a superior governess who held that a woman should be able to write a good letter and to express herself with propriety on general subjects and it is astonishing how effective this education appeared in a handsome girl who sat supremely well on horseback sang and played a little painted small figures in water colors had a naughty sparkle in her eyes when she made a daring quotation and an air of serious dignity when she recited something from her store of correct opinions but however such a stock of ideas may be made to tell in elegant society and during a few seasons in town no amount of bloom and beauty can make them a perennial source of interest in things not personal and the notion that what is true and in general good for mankind is stupid and drug like is not a safe theoretic basis in circumstances of temptation and difficulty mrs transome had been in her bloom before this century began and in the long painful years since then what she had once regarded as her knowledge and accomplishments had become as valueless as old fashioned stucco ornaments of which the substance was never worth anything while the form is no longer to the taste of any living mortal crosses mortifications money cares conscious blame worthiness had changed the aspect of the world for her there was anxiety in the morning sunlight there was unkind triumph or disapproving pity in the glances of greeting neighbors there was advancing age and a contracting prospect in the changing seasons as they came and went and what could then sweeten the days to a hungry much exacting self like mrs transome's under protracted ill every living creature will find something that makes a comparative ease and even when life seems woven of pain will convert the fainter pang into a desire mrs transome whose imperious will had availed little to ward off the great evils of her life found the opiate for her discontent in the exertion of her will about smaller things she was not cruel and could not enjoy thoroughly what she called the old woman's pleasure of tormenting but she liked every little sign of power her lot had left her she liked that a tenant should stand bareheaded below her as she sat on horseback she liked to insist that work done without her orders should be undone from beginning to end she liked to be courtesied and bowed to by all the congregation as she walked up the little barn of a church she liked to change a laborer's medicine fetched from the doctor and substitute a prescription of her own if she had only been more haggard and less majestic those who had glimpses of her outward life might have said she was a tyrannical griping harridan with a tongue like a razor no one said exactly that but they never said anything like the full truth about her or divined what was hidden under that outward life a woman's keen sensibility and dread which lay screened behind all her petty habits and narrow notions as some quivering thing with eyes and throbbing heart may lie crouching behind withered rubbish the sensibility and dread had palpitated all the faster in the prospect of her son's return and now that she had seen him she said to herself in her bitter way it is a lucky eel that escapes skinning the best happiness i shall ever know will be to escape the worst misery chapter ii a jolly parson of the good old stock by birth a gentleman yet homely too suiting his phrase to hodge and margery whom he once christened and has married since a little lax in doctrine and in life not thinking god was captious in such things as what a man might drink on holidays but holding true religion was to do as you'd be done by which could never mean that he should preach three sermons in a week harold transome did not choose to spend the whole evening with his mother it was his habit to compress a great deal of effective conversation into a short space of time asking rapidly all the questions he wanted to get answered and diluting no subject with irrelevancies paraphrase or repetitions he volunteered no information about himself and his past life at smyrna but answered pleasantly enough though briefly whenever his mother asked for any detail he was evidently ill satisfied as to his palate trying red pepper to everything then asking if there were any relishing sauces in the house and when hickes brought various home filled bottles trying several finding them failures and finally falling back from his plate in despair yet he remained good humored saying something to his father now and then for the sake of being kind and looking on with a pitying shrug as he saw him watch hickes cutting his food mrs transome thought with some bitterness that harold showed more feeling for her feeble husband who had never cared in the least about him than for her who had given him more than the usual share of mother's love an hour after dinner harold who had already been turning over the leaves of his mother's account books said i shall just cross the park to the parsonage to see my uncle lingon very well he can answer more questions for you yes said harold quite deaf to the innuendo and accepting the words as a simple statement of the fact i want to hear all about the game and the north loamshire hunt i'm fond of sport we had a great deal of it at smyrna and it keeps down my fat the reverend john lingon became very talkative over his second bottle of port which was opened on his nephew's arrival he was not curious about the manners of smyrna or about harold's experience but he unbosomed himself very freely as to what he himself liked and disliked which of the farmers he suspected of killing the foxes what game he had bagged that very morning what spot he would recommend as a new cover and the comparative flatness of all existing sport compared with cock fighting under which old england had been prosperous and glorious while so far as he could see it had gained little by the abolition of a practice which sharpened the faculties of men gratified the instincts of the fowl and carried out the designs of heaven in its admirable device of spurs from these main topics which made his points of departure and return he rambled easily enough at any new suggestion or query so that when harold got home at a late hour he was conscious of having gathered from amidst the pompous full toned triviality of his uncle's chat some impressions which were of practical importance among the rector's dislikes it appeared was mr matthew jermyn a fat handed glib tongued fellow with a scented cambric handkerchief one of your educated low bred fellows a foundling who got his latin for nothing at christ's hospital one of your middle class upstarts who want to rank with gentlemen and think they'll do it with kid gloves and new furniture but since harold meant to stand for the county mr lingon was equally emphatic as to the necessity of his not quarrelling with jermyn till the election was over jermyn must be his agent harold must wink hard till he found himself safely returned and even then it might be well to let jermyn drop gently and raise no scandal he himself had no quarrel with the fellow a clergyman should have no quarrels and he made it a point to be able to take wine with any man he met at table and as to the estate and his sister's going too much by jermyn's advice he never meddled with business it was not his duty as a clergyman that he considered was the meaning of melchisedec and the tithe a subject into which he had gone to some depth thirty years ago when he preached the visitation sermon the discovery that harold meant to stand on the liberal side nay that he boldly declared himself a radical was rather startling but to his uncle's good humor beatified by the sipping of port wine nothing could seem highly objectionable provided it did not disturb that operation in the course of half an hour he had brought himself to see that anything really worthy to be called british toryism had been entirely extinct since the duke of wellington and sir robert peel had passed the catholic emancipation bill that whiggery with its rights of man stopping short at ten pound householders and its policy of pacifying a wild beast with a bite was a ridiculous monstrosity that therefore since an honest man could not call himself a tory which it was in fact as impossible to be now as to fight for the old pretender and could still less become that execrable monstrosity a whig there remained but one course open to him why lad if the world was turned into a swamp i suppose we should leave off shoes and stockings and walk about like cranes whence it followed plainly enough that in these hopeless times nothing was left to men of sense and good family but to retard the national ruin by declaring themselves radicals and take the inevitable process of changing everything out of the hands of beggarly demagogues and purse proud tradesmen it is true the rector was helped to this chain of reasoning by harold's remarks but he soon became quite ardent in asserting the conclusion if the mob can't be turned back a man of family must try and head the mob and save a few homes and hearths and keep the country up on its last legs as long as he can and you're a man of family my lad dash it you're a lingon whatever else you may be and i'll stand by you i've no great interest i'm a poor parson i've been forced to give up hunting my pointers and a glass of good wine are the only decencies becoming my station that i can allow myself but i'll give you my countenance i'll stick to you as my nephew there's no need for me to change sides exactly i was born a tory and i shall never be a bishop but if anybody says you're in the wrong i shall say 'my nephew is in the right he has turned radical to save his country if william pitt had been living now he'd have done the same for what did he say when he was dying not 'oh save my party' but 'oh save my country heaven' that was what they dinned in our ears about peel and the duke and now i'll turn it round upon them they shall be hoist with their own petard yes yes i'll stand by you harold did not feel sure that his uncle would thoroughly retain this satisfactory thread of argument in the uninspired hours of the morning but the old gentleman was sure to take the facts easily in the end and there was no fear of family coolness or quarrelling on this side harold was glad of it he was not to be turned aside from any course he had chosen but he disliked all quarrelling as an unpleasant expenditure of energy that could have no good practical result he was at once active and luxurious fond of mastery and good natured enough to wish that every one about him should like his mastery not caring greatly to know other people's thoughts and ready to despise them as blockheads if their thoughts differed from his and yet solicitous that they should have no colorable reason for slight thoughts about him the blockheads must be forced to respect him hence in proportion as he foresaw his equals in the neighborhood would be indignant with him for his political choice he cared keenly about making a good figure before them in every other way his conduct as a landholder was to be judicious his establishment was to be kept up generously his imbecile father treated with careful regard his family relations entirely without scandal he knew that affairs had been unpleasant in his youth that there had been ugly lawsuits and that his scapegrace brother durfey had helped to lower still farther the depressed condition of the family all this must be retrieved now that events had made harold the head of the transome name jermyn must be used for the election and after that if he must be got rid of it would be well to shake him loose quietly his uncle was probably right on both these points but harold's expectation that he should want to get rid of jermyn was founded on other reasons than his scented handkerchief and his charity school latin if the lawyer had been presuming on mrs transome's ignorance as a woman and on the stupid rakishness of the original heir the new heir would prove to him that he had calculated rashly otherwise harold had no prejudice against him in his boyhood and youth he had seen jermyn frequenting transome court but had regarded him with that total indifference with which youngsters are apt to view those who neither deny them pleasure nor give them any jermyn used to smile at him and speak to him affably but harold half proud half shy got away from such patronage as soon as possible he knew jermyn was a man of business his father his uncle and sir maximus debarry did not regard him as a gentleman and their equal he had known no evil of the man but he saw now that if he were really a covetous upstart there had been a temptation for him in the management of the transome affairs and it was clear that the estate was in a bad condition when mr jermyn was ushered into the breakfast room the next morning harold found him surprisingly little altered by the fifteen years he was gray but still remarkably handsome fat but tall enough to bear that trial to man's dignity there was as strong a suggestion of toilette about him as if he had been five and twenty instead of nearly sixty he chose always to dress in black and was especially addicted to black satin waistcoats which carried out the general sleekness of his appearance and this together with his white fat but beautifully shaped hands which he was in the habit of rubbing gently on his entrance into a room gave him very much the air of a lady's physician harold remembered with some amusement his uncle's dislike of those conspicuous hands but as his own were soft and dimpled and as he too was given to the innocent practice of rubbing those members his suspicions were not yet deepened i congratulate you mrs transome said jermyn with a soft and deferential smile all the more he added turning toward harold now i have the pleasure of actually seeing your son i am glad to perceive that an eastern climate has not been unfavorable to him no said harold shaking jermyn's hand carelessly and speaking with more than his usual brusqueness the question is whether the english climate will agree with me it's deuced shifting and damp and as for the food it would be the finest thing in the world for this country if the southern cooks would change their religion get persecuted and fly to england as the old silk weavers did there are plenty of foreign cooks for those who are rich enough to pay for them i suppose said mrs transome but they are unpleasant people to have about one's house gad i don't think so said harold the old servants are sure to quarrel with them that's no concern of mine the old servants will have to put up with my man dominic who will show them how to cook and do everything else in a way that will rather astonish them old people are not so easily taught to change all their ways harold well they can give up and watch the young ones said harold thinking only at that moment of old mrs hickes and dominic but his mother was not thinking of them only you have a valuable servant it seems said jermyn who understood mrs transome better than her son did and wished to smoothen the current of their dialogue oh one of those wonderful southern fellows that make one's life easy he's of no country in particular i don't know whether he's most of a jew a greek an italian or a spaniard he speaks five or six languages one as well as another he's cook valet major domo and secretary all in one and what's more he's an affectionate fellow i can trust to his attachment that's a sort of human specimen that doesn't grow here in england i fancy i should have been badly off if i could not have brought dominic they sat down to breakfast with such slight talk as this going on each of the party was preoccupied and uneasy harold's mind was busy constructing probabilities about what he should discover of jermyn's mismanagement or dubious application of funds and the sort of self command he must in the worst case exercise in order to use the man as long as he wanted him jermyn was closely observing harold with an unpleasant sense that there was an expression of acuteness and determination about him which would make him formidable he would certainly have preferred at that moment that there had been no second heir of the transome name to come back upon him from the east mrs transome was not observing the two men rather her hands were cold and her whole person shaken by their presence she seemed to hear and see what they said and did with preternatural acuteness and yet she was also seeing and hearing what had been said and done many years before and feeling a dim terror about the future there were piteous sensibilities in this faded woman who thirty four years ago in the splendor of her bloom had been imperious to one of these men and had rapturously pressed the other as an infant to her bosom and now knew that she was of little consequence to either of them well what are the prospects about election said harold as the breakfast was advancing there are two whigs and one conservative likely to be in the field i know what is your opinion of the chances mr jermyn had a copious supply of words which often led him into periphrase but he cultivated a hesitating stammer which with a handsome impassiveness of face except when he was smiling at a woman or when the latent savageness of his nature was thoroughly roused he had found useful in many relations especially in business no one could have found out that he was not at his ease my opinion he replied is in a state of balance at present this division of the county you are aware contains one manufacturing town of the first magnitude and several smaller ones the manufacturing interest is widely dispersed so far a there is a presumption a in favor of the two liberal candidates still with a careful canvass of the agricultural districts such as those we have round us at treby magna i think a the auguries a would not be unfavorable to the return of a conservative a fourth candidate of good position who should coalesce with mr debarry a here mr jermyn hesitated for the third time and harold broke in that will not be my line of action so we need not discuss it if i put up it will be as a radical and i fancy in any county that would return whigs there would be plenty of voters to be combed off by a radical who offered himself with good pretensions there was the slightest possible quiver discernible across jermyn's face otherwise he sat as he had done before with his eyes fixed abstractedly on the frill of a ham before him and his hand trifling with his fork he did not answer immediately but when he did he looked round steadily at harold i'm delighted to perceive that you have kept yourself so thoroughly acquainted with english politics oh of course said harold impatiently i'm aware how things have been going on in england i always meant to come back ultimately i suppose i know the state of europe as well as if i'd been stationary at little treby for the last fifteen years if a man goes to the east people seem to think he gets turned into something like the one eyed calender in the 'arabian nights' yet i should think there are some things which people who have been stationary at little treby could tell you harold said mrs transome it did not signify about your holding radical opinions at smyrna but you seem not to imagine how your putting up as a radical will affect your position here and the position of your family no one will visit you and then the sort of people who will support you you really have no idea what an impression it conveys when you say you are a radical there are none of our equals who will not feel that you have disgraced yourself pooh said harold rising and walking along the room but mrs transome went on with growing anger in her voice it seems to me that a man owes something to his birth and station and has no right to take up this notion or other just as it suits his fancy still less to work at the overthrow of his class that was what every one said of lord grey and my family at least is as good as lord grey's you have wealth now and might distinguish yourself in the county and if you had been true to your colors as a gentleman you would have had all the greater opportunity because the times are so bad the debarrys and lord wyvern would have set all the more store by you for my part i can't conceive what good you propose to yourself i only entreat you to think again before you take any decided step mother said harold not angrily or with any raising of his voice but in a quick impatient manner as if the scene must be got through as quickly as possible it is natural that you should think in this way women very properly don't change their views but keep to the notions in which they have been brought up it doesn't signify what they think they are not called upon to judge or to act you must leave me to take my own course in these matters which properly belong to men beyond that i will gratify any wish you may choose to mention you shall have a new carriage and a pair of bays all to yourself you shall have the house done up in first rate style and i am not thinking of marrying but let us understand that there shall be no further collision between us on subjects on which i must be master of my own actions and you will put the crown to the mortifications of my life harold i don't know who would be a mother if she could foresee what a slight thing she will be to her son when she is old mrs transome here walked out of the room by the nearest way the glass door open toward the terrace mr jermyn had risen too and his hands were on the back of his chair he looked quite impassive it was not the first time he had seen mrs transome angry but now for the first time he thought the outburst of her temper would be useful to him she poor woman knew quite well that she had been unwise and that she had been making herself disagreeable to harold to no purpose but half the sorrows of women would be averted if they could repress the speech they know to be useless nay the speech they have resolved not to utter harold continued his walking a moment longer and then said to jermyn you smoke no i always defer to the ladies mrs jermyn is peculiarly sensitive in such matters and doesn't like tobacco harold who underneath all the tendencies which had made him a liberal had intense personal pride thought confound the fellow with his mrs jermyn does he think we are on a footing for me to know anything about his wife well i took my hookah before breakfast he said aloud so if you like we'll go into the library my father never gets up till midday i find sit down sit down said harold as they entered the handsome spacious library but he himself continued to stand before a map of the county which he had opened from a series of rollers occupying a compartment among the bookshelves the first question mr jermyn now you know my intentions is whether you will undertake to be my agent in this election and help me through there's no time to be lost and i don't want to lose my chance as i may not have another for seven years i understand he went on flashing a look straight at jermyn that you have not taken any conspicuous course in politics and i know that labron is agent for the debarrys oh a my dear sir a man necessarily has his political convictions but of what use is it for a professional man a of some education to talk of them in a little country town there really is no comprehension of public questions in such places party feeling indeed was quite asleep here before the agitation about the catholic relief bill it is true that i concurred with our incumbent in getting up a petition against the reform bill but i did not state my reasons the weak points in that bill are a too palpable and i fancy you and i should not differ much on that head the fact is when i knew that you were to come back to us i kept myself in reserve though i was much pressed by the friends of sir james clement the ministerial candidate who is however you will act for me that's settled said harold certainly said jermyn inwardly irritated by harold's rapid manner of cutting him short which of the liberal candidates as they call themselves has the better chance eh i was going to observe that sir james clement has not so good a chance as mr garstin supposing that a third liberal candidate presents himself there are two senses in which a politician can be liberal here mr jermyn smiled sir james clement is a poor baronet hoping for an appointment and can't be expected to be liberal in that wider sense which commands majorities i wish this man were not so much of a talker thought harold he'll bore me we shall see he said aloud what can be done in the way of combination i'll come down to your office after one o'clock if it will suit you perfectly ah and you'll have all the lists and papers and necessary information ready for me there i must get up a dinner for the tenants and we can invite whom we like besides the tenants just now i'm going over one of the farms on hand with the bailiff by the way that's a desperately bad business having three farms unlet how comes that about eh that is precisely what i wanted to say a few words about to you you have observed already how strongly mrs transome takes certain things to heart you can imagine that she has been severely tried in many ways mr transome's want of health mr durfey's habits a yes yes she is a woman for whom i naturally entertain the highest respect and she has had hardly any gratification for many years except the sense of having affairs to a certain extent in her own hands she objects to changes she will not have a new style of tenants she likes the old stock of farmers who milk their own cows and send their younger daughters out to service all this makes it difficult to do the best with the estate i am aware things are not as they ought to be for in point of fact improved agricultural management is a matter in which i take considerable interest and the farm which i myself hold on the estate you will see i think to be in a superior condition but mrs transome is a woman of strong feeling and i would urge you my dear sir to make the changes which you have but which i had not the right to insist on as little painful to her as possible i shall know what to do sir never fear said harold much offended you will pardon i hope a perhaps undue freedom of suggestion from a man of my age who has been so long in a close connection with the family affairs a i have never considered that connection simply in a light of business a damn him i'll soon let him know that i do thought harold but in proportion as he found jermyn's manners annoying he felt the necessity of controlling himself he despised all persons who defeated their own projects by the indulgence of momentary impulses i understand i understand he said aloud you've had more awkward business on your hands than usually falls to the share of a family lawyer we shall set everything right by degrees but now as to the canvassing i've made arrangements with a first rate man in london who understands these matters thoroughly a solicitor of course he has carried no end of men into parliament i'll engage him to meet us at duffield say when the conversation after this was driven carefully clear of all angles and ended with determined amicableness when harold in his ride an hour or two afterward encountered his uncle shouldering a gun and followed by one black and one liver spotted pointer his muscular person with its red eagle face set off by a velveteen jacket and leather leggings mr lingon's first question was well lad how have you got on with jermyn oh i don't think i shall like the fellow he's a sort of amateur gentleman but i must make use of him i expect whatever i get out of him will only be something short of fair pay for what he has got out of us but i shall see ay ay use his gun to bring down your game and after that beat the thief with the butt end that's wisdom and justice and pleasure all in one talking between ourselves as uncle and nephew but i say harold i was going to tell you now i come to think of it this is rather a nasty business your calling yourself a radical i've been turning it over in after dinner speeches but it looks awkward it's not what people are used to it wants a good deal of latin to make it go down i shall be worried about it at the sessions and i can think of nothing neat enough to carry about in my pocket by way of answer nonsense uncle i remember what a good speechifier you always were you'll never be at a loss you only want a few more evenings to think of it but you'll not be attacking the church and the institutions of the country you'll not be going those lengths you'll keep up the bulwarks and so on eh no i shan't attack the church only the incomes of the bishops perhaps to make them eke out the incomes of the poor clergy well well i have no objection to that nobody likes our bishop he's all greek and greediness too proud to dine with his own father you may pepper the bishops a little but you'll respect the constitution handed down etc and you'll rally round the throne and the king god bless him and the usual toasts eh of course of course i am a radical only in rooting out abuses that's the word i wanted my lad said the vicar slapping harold's knee that's a spool to wind a speech on abuses is the very word and if anybody shows himself offended he'll put the cap on for himself i remove the rotten timbers said harold inwardly amused and substitute fresh oak that's all well done my boy by george you'll be a speaker but i say harold i hope you've got a little latin left this young debarry is a tremendous fellow at the classics and walks on stilts to any length he's one of the new conservatives old sir maximus doesn't understand him at all that won't do at the hustings said harold he'll get knocked off his stilts pretty quickly there bless me it's astonishing how well you're up in the affairs of the country my boy but rub up a few quotations 'quod turpe bonis decebat crispinum' and that sort of thing just to show debarry what you could do if you liked but you want to ride on yes i have an appointment at treby good bye he's a cleverish chap muttered the vicar as harold rode away when he's had plenty of english exercise and brought out his knuckle a bit he'll be a lingon again as he used to be i must go and see how arabella takes his being a radical it's a little awkward but a clergyman must keep peace in a family confound it i'm not bound to love toryism better than my own flesh and blood and the manor i shoot over that's a heathenish brutus like sort of thing as if providence couldn't take care of the country without my quarrelling with my own sister's son chapter iii 'twas town yet country too you felt the warmth of clustering houses in the wintry time supped with a friend and went by lantern home yet from your chamber window you could hear the tiny bleat of new yeaned lambs or see the children bend beside the hedgerow banks to pluck the primroses treby magna on which the reform bill had thrust the new honor of being a polling place had been at the beginning of the century quite a typical old market town lying in pleasant sleepiness among green pastures with a rush fringed river meandering through them its principal street had various handsome and tall windowed brick houses with walled gardens behind them and at the end where it widened into the market place there was the cheerful rough stuccoed front of that excellent inn the marquis of granby where the farmers put up their gigs not only on fair and market days but on exceptional sundays when they came to church and the church was one of those fine old english structures worth travelling to see standing in a broad churchyard with a line of solemn yew trees beside it and lifting a majestic tower and spire far above the red and purple roofs of the town it was not large enough to hold all the parishioners of a parish which stretched over distant villages and hamlets but then they were never so unreasonable as to wish to be all in at once and had never complained that the space of a large side chapel was taken up by the tombs of the debarrys and shut in by a handsome iron screen for when the black benedictines ceased to pray and chant in this church when the blessed virgin and st gregory were expelled the debarrys as lords of the manor naturally came next to providence and took the place of the saints long before that time indeed there had been a sir maximus debarry who had been at the fortifying of the old castle which now stood in ruins in the midst of the green pastures and with its sheltering wall toward the north made an excellent strawyard for the pigs of wace co brewers of the celebrated treby beer wace co did not stand alone in the town as prosperous traders on a large scale to say nothing of those who had retired from business and in no country town of the same small size as treby was there a larger proportion of families who had handsome sets of china without handles hereditary punch bowls and large silver ladles with a queen anne's guinea in the centre such people naturally took tea and supped together frequently and as there was no professional man or tradesman in treby who was not connected by business if not by blood with the farmers of the district the richer sort of these were much invited and gave invitations in their turn they played at whist ate and drank generously praised mr pitt and the war as keeping up prices and religion and were very humorous about each other's property having much the same coy pleasure in allusions to their secret ability to purchase as blushing lasses sometimes have in jokes about their secret preferences the rector was always of the debarry family associated only with county people and was much respected for his affability a clergyman who would have taken tea with the townspeople would have given a dangerous shock to the mind of a treby churchman such was the old fashioned grazing brewing wool packing cheese loading life of treby magna until there befell new conditions complicating its relation with the rest of the world and gradually awakening in it that higher consciousness which is known to bring higher pains first came the canal next the working of the coal mines at sproxton two miles off the town and thirdly the discovery of a saline spring which suggested to a too constructive brain the possibility of turning treby magna into a fashionable watering place so daring an idea was not originated by a native trebian but by a young lawyer who came from a distance knew the dictionary by heart and was probably an illegitimate son of somebody or other the idea although it promised an increase of wealth to the town was not well received at first ladies objected to seeing objects drawn about in hand carriages the doctor foresaw the advent of unsound practitioners and most retail tradesmen concurred with him that new doings were usually for the advantage of new people the more unanswerable reasoners urged that treby had prospered without baths and it was yet to be seen how it would prosper with them while a report that the proposed name for them was bethesda spa threatened to give the whole affair a blasphemous aspect even sir maximus debarry who was to have an unprecedented return for the thousands he would lay out on a pump room and hotel regarded the thing as a little too new and held back for some time but the persuasive powers of the young lawyer mr matthew jermyn together with the opportune opening of a stone quarry triumphed at last the handsome buildings were erected an excellent guide book and descriptive cards surmounted by vignettes were printed and treby magna became conscious of certain facts in its own history of which it had previously been in contented ignorance but it was all in vain the spa for some mysterious reason did not succeed some attributed the failure to the coal mines and the canal others to the peace which had had ruinous effects on the country and others who disliked jermyn to the original folly of the plan among these last was sir maximus himself who never forgave the too persuasive attorney it was jermyn's fault not only that a useless hotel had been built but that he sir maximus being straitened for money had at last let the building with the adjacent land lying on the river on a long lease on the supposition that it was to be turned into a tape manufactory a bitter thing to any gentleman and especially to the representative of one of the oldest families in england in this way it happened that treby magna gradually passed from being simply a respectable market town the heart of a great rural district where the trade was only such as had close relations with the local landed interest and took on the more complex life brought by mines and manufactures which belong more directly to the great circulating system of the nation than to the local system to which they had been superadded and in this way it was that trebian dissent gradually altered its character formerly it had been of a quiescent well to do kind represented architecturally by a small venerable dark pewed chapel built by presbyterians but long occupied by a sparse congregation of independents who were as little moved by doctrinal zeal as their church going neighbors and did not feel themselves deficient in religious liberty inasmuch as they were not hindered from occasionally slumbering in their pews and were not obliged to go regularly to the weekly prayer meeting but when stone pits and coal pits made new hamlets that threatened to spread up to the very town when the tape weavers came with their news reading inspectors and book keepers the independent chapel began to be filled with eager men and women to whom the exceptional possession of religious truth was the condition which reconciled them to a meagre existence and made them feel in secure alliance with the unseen but supreme rule of a world in which their own visible part was small there were dissenters in treby now who could not be regarded by the church people in the light of old neighbors to whom the habit of going to chapel was an innocent unenviable inheritance along with a particular house and garden a tan yard or a grocery business dissenters who in their turn without meaning to be in the least abusive spoke of the high bred rector as a blind leader of the blind and dissent was not the only thing that the times had altered prices had fallen poor rates had risen rent and tithe were not elastic enough and the farmer's fat sorrow had become lean he began to speculate on causes and to trace things back to that causeless mystery the cessation of one pound notes thus when political agitation swept in a current through the country treby magna was prepared to vibrate the catholic emancipation bill opened the eyes of neighbors and made them aware how very injurious they were to each other and to the welfare of mankind generally mr tiliot the church spirit merchant knew now that mr nuttwood the obliging grocer was one of those dissenters deists socinians papists and radicals who were in league to destroy the constitution a retired old london tradesman who was believed to understand politics said that thinking people must wish george iii were alive again in all his early vigor of mind and even the farmers became less materialistic in their view of causes and referred much to the agency of the devil and the irish romans the rector the reverend augustus debarry really a fine specimen of the old fashioned aristocratic clergyman preaching short sermons understanding business and acting liberally about his tithe had never before found himself in collision with dissenters but now he began to feel that these people were a nuisance in the parish that his brother sir maximus must take care lest they should get land to build more chapels and that it might not have been a bad thing if the law had furnished him as a magistrate with a power of putting a stop to the political sermons of the independent preacher which in their way were as pernicious sources of intoxication as the beerhouses the dissenters on their side were not disposed to sacrifice the cause of truth and freedom to a temporizing mildness of language but they defended themselves from the charge of religious indifference and solemnly disclaimed any lax expectations that catholics were likely to be saved urging on the contrary that they were not too hopeful about protestants who adhered to a bloated and worldly prelacy thus treby magna which had lived quietly through the great earthquakes of the french revolution and the napoleonic wars which had remained unmoved by the rights of man and saw little in mr cobbett's weekly register except that he held eccentric views about potatoes began at last to know the higher pains of a dim political consciousness and the development had been greatly helped by the recent agitation about the reform bill tory whig and radical did not perhaps become clearer in their definition of each other but the names seemed to acquire so strong a stamp of honor or infamy that definitions would only have weakened the impression as to the short and easy method of judging opinions by the personal character of those who held them it was liable to be much frustrated in treby it so happened in that particular town that the reformers were not all of them large hearted patriots or ardent lovers of justice indeed one of them in the very midst of the agitation was detected in using unequal scales a fact to which many tories pointed with disgust as showing plainly enough without further argument that the cry for a change in the representative system was hollow trickery again the tories were far from being all oppressors disposed to grind down the working classes into serfdom and it was undeniable that the inspector at the tape manufactory who spoke with much eloquence on the extension of the suffrage was a more tyrannical personage than open handed mr wace whose chief political tenet was that it was all nonsense to give men votes when they had no stake in the country on the other hand there were some tories who gave themselves a great deal of leisure to abuse hypocrites radicals dissenters and atheism generally but whose inflamed faces theistic swearing and frankness in expressing a wish to borrow certainly did not mark them out strongly as holding opinions likely to save society the reformers had triumphed it was clear that the wheels were going whither they were pulling and they were in fine spirits for exertion but if they were pulling toward the country's ruin there was the more need for others to hang on behind and get the wheels to stick if possible in treby as elsewhere people were told they must rally at the coming election but there was now a large number of waverers men of flexible practical minds who were not such bigots as to cling to any views when a good tangible reason could be urged against them while some regarded it as the most neighborly thing to hold a little with both sides and were not sure that they should rally or vote at all it seemed an invidious thing to vote for one gentleman rather than another these social changes in treby parish are comparatively public matters and this history is chiefly concerned with the private lot of a few men and women but there is no private life which has not been determined by a wider public life from the time when the primeval milkmaid had to wander with the wanderings of her clan because the cow she milked was one of a herd which had made the pastures bare even in that conservatory existence where the fair camellia is sighed for by the noble young pine apple neither of them needing to care about the frost or rain outside there is a nether apparatus of hot water pipes liable to cool down on a strike of the gardeners or a scarcity of coal and the lives we are about to look back upon do not belong to those conservatory species they are rooted in the common earth having to endure all the ordinary chances of past and present weather as to the weather of the zadkiel of that time had predicted that the electrical condition of the clouds in the political hemisphere would produce unusual perturbations in organic existence and he would perhaps have seen a fulfillment of his remarkable prophecy in that mutual influence of dissimilar destinies which we shall see gradually unfolding itself for if the mixed political conditions of treby magna had not been acted on by the passing of the reform bill mr harold transome would not have presented himself as a candidate for north loamshire treby would not have been a polling place mr matthew jermyn would not have been on affable terms with a dissenting preacher and his flock and the venerable town would not have been placarded with handbills more or less complimentary and retrospective conditions in this case essential to the where and the what without which as the learned know there can be no event whatever for example it was through these conditions that a young man named felix holt made a considerable difference in the life of harold transome though nature and fortune seemed to have done what they could to keep the lots of the two men quite aloof from each other felix was heir to nothing better than a quack medicine his mother lived up a back street in treby magna and her sitting room was ornamented with her best tea tray and several framed testimonials to the virtues of holt's cathartic lozenges and holt's restorative elixir there could hardly have been a lot less like harold transome's than this of the quack doctor's son except in the superficial facts that he called himself a radical that he was the only son of his mother and that he had lately returned to his home with ideas and resolves not a little disturbing to that mother's mind but mrs holt unlike mrs transome was much disposed to reveal her troubles and was not without a counsellor into whose ear she could pour them on this second of september when mr harold transome had had his first interview with jermyn and when the attorney went back to his office with new views of canvassing in his mind mrs holt had put on her bonnet as early as nine o'clock in the morning and had gone to see the reverend rufus lyon minister of the independent chapel usually spoken of as malthouse yard chapter iv a pious and painful preacher fuller mr lyon lived in a small house not quite so good as the parish clerk's adjoining the entry which led to the chapel yard the new prosperity of dissent at treby had led to an enlargement of the chapel which absorbed all extra funds and left none for the enlargement of the minister's income he sat this morning as usual in a low up stairs room called his study which by means of a closet capable of holding his bed served also as a sleeping room the bookshelves did not suffice for his store of old books which lay about him in piles so arranged as to leave narrow lanes between them for the minister was much given to walking about during his hours of meditation and very narrow passages would serve for his small legs unencumbered by any other drapery than his black silk stockings and the flexible though prominent bows of black ribbon that tied his knee breeches he was walking about now with his hands clasped behind him an attitude in which his body seemed to bear about the same proportion to his head as the lower part of a stone hermes bears to the carven image that crowns it his face looked old and worn yet the curtain of hair that fell from his bald crown and hung about his neck retained much of its original auburn tint and his large brown short sighted eyes were still clear and bright at the first glance every one thought him a very odd looking rusty old man the free school boys often hooted after him and called him revelations and to many respectable church people old lyon's little legs and large head seemed to make dissent additionally preposterous but he was too short sighted to notice those who tittered at him too absent from the world of small facts and petty impulses in which titterers live with satan to argue against on matters of vital experience as well as of church government with great texts to meditate on which seemed to get deeper as he tried to fathom them it had never occurred to him to reflect what sort of image his small person made on the retina of a light minded beholder the good rufus had his ire and his egoism but they existed only as the red heat which gave force to his belief and his teaching he was susceptible concerning the true office of deacons in the primitive church and his small nervous body was jarred from head to foot by the concussion of an argument to which he saw no answer in fact the only moments when he could be said to be really conscious of his body were when he trembled under the pressure of some agitating thought he was meditating on the text for his sunday morning sermon and all the people said amen a mere mustard seed of a text which had split at first only into two divisions what was said and who said it but these were growing into a many branched discourse and the preacher's eyes dilated and a smile played about his mouth till as his manner was when he felt happily inspired he had begun to utter his thoughts aloud in the varied measure and cadence habitual to him changing from a rapid but distinct undertone to a loud emphatic rallentando my brethren do you think that great shout was raised in israel by each man's waiting to say 'amen' till his neighbors had said amen do you think there will be a great shout for the right the shout of a nation as of one man rounded and whole like the voice of the archangel that bound together all the listeners of earth and heaven if every christian of you peeps round to see what his neighbors in good coats are doing or else puts his hat before his face that he may shout and never be heard but this is what you do when the servant of god stands up to deliver his message do you lay your souls beneath the word as you set out your plants beneath the falling rain no one of you sends his eyes to all corners he smothers his soul with small questions 'what does brother y think' 'is this doctrine high enough for brother z' 'will the church members be pleased' and another here the door was opened and old lyddy the minister's servant put in her head to say in a tone of despondency finishing with a groan here is mrs holt wanting to speak to you she says she comes out of season but she's in trouble lyddy said mr lyon falling at once into a quiet conversational tone if you are wrestling with the enemy let me refer you to ezekiel the thirteenth and twenty second and beg of you not to groan it is a stumbling block and offence to my daughter she would take no broth yesterday because she said you had cried into it thus you cause the truth to be lightly spoken of and make the enemy rejoice if your faceache gives him an advantage take a little warm ale with your meat i do not grudge the money if i thought my drinking warm ale would hinder poor dear miss esther from speaking light but she hates the smell of it answer not again lyddy but send up mistress holt to me lyddy closed the door immediately i lack grace to deal with these weak sisters said the minister again thinking aloud and walking their needs lie too much out of the track of my meditations and take me often unawares mistress holt is another who darkens counsel by words without knowledge and angers the reason of the natural man lord give me patience my sins were heavier to bear than this woman's folly come in mrs holt come in he hastened to disencumber a chair of matthew henry's commentary and begged his visitor to be seated she was a tall elderly woman dressed in black with a light brown front and a black band over her forehead she moved the chair a little and seated herself in it with some emphasis looking fixedly at the opposite wall with a hurt and argumentative expression mr lyon had placed himself in the chair against his desk and waited with the resolute resignation of a patient who is about to undergo an operation but his visitor did not speak you have something on your mind mrs holt he said at last indeed i have sir else i shouldn't be here speak freely it's well known to you mr lyon that my husband mr holt came from the north and was a member in malthouse yard long before you began to be pastor of it which was seven year ago last michaelmas it's the truth mr lyon and i'm not that woman to sit here and say it if it wasn't true certainly it is true and if my husband had been alive when you'd come to preach upon trial he'd have been as good a judge of your gifts as mr nuttwood or mr muscat though whether he'd have agreed with some that your doctrine wasn't high enough i can't say for myself i've my opinion about high doctrine was it my preaching you came to speak about said the minister hurrying in the question no mr lyon i'm not that woman but this i will say for my husband died before your time that he had a wonderful gift in prayer as the old members well know if anybody likes to ask 'em not believing my words and he believed himself that the receipt for the cancer cure which i've sent out in bottles till this very last april before september as now is and have bottles standing by me he believed it was sent to him in answer to prayer and nobody can deny it for he prayed most regular and read out of the green baize bible mrs holt paused appearing to think that mr lyon had been successfully confuted and should show himself convinced has any one been aspersing your husband's character said mr lyon with a slight initiative toward that relief of groaning for which he had reproved lyddy sir they daredn't for though he was a man of prayer he didn't want skill and knowledge to find things out for himself and that's what i used to say to my friends when they wondered at my marrying a man from lancashire with no trade nor fortune but what he'd got in his head but my husband's tongue 'ud have been a fortune to anybody and there was many a one said it was as good as a dose of physic to hear him talk not but what that got him into trouble in lancashire but he always said if the worst came to the worst he could go and preach to the blacks but he did better than that mr lyon for he married me and this i will say that for age and conduct and managing mistress holt interrupted the minister these are not the things whereby we may edify one another let me beg of you to be as brief as you can my time is not my own well mr lyon i've a right to my own character and i'm one of your congregation though i'm not a church member for i was born in the general baptist connection and as for being saved without works there's a many i dare say can't do without that doctrine but i thank the lord i never needed to put myself on a level with the thief on the cross i've done my duty and more if anybody comes to that for i've gone without my bit of meat to make broth for a sick neighbor and if there's any of the church members say they've done the same i'd ask them if they had the sinking at the stomach as i have for i've ever strove to do the right thing and more for good natured i always was and i little thought after being respected by everybody i should come to be reproached by my own son and my husband said when he was a dying 'mary' he said 'the elixir and the pills and the cure will support you for they've a great name in all the country round and you'll pray for a blessing on them' and so i've done mr lyon and to say they're not good medicines when they've been taken for fifty miles round by high and low rich and poor and nobody speaking against 'em but dr lukin it seems to me it's a flying in the face of heaven for if it was wrong to take the medicines couldn't the blessed lord have stopped it mrs holt was not given to tears she was much sustained by conscious unimpeachableness and by an argumentative tendency which usually checks the too great activity of the lachrymal gland nevertheless her eyes had become moist her fingers played on her knee in an agitated manner and she finally plucked a bit of her gown and held it with great nicety between her thumb and finger mr lyon however by listening attentively had begun partly to divine the source of her trouble am i wrong in gathering from what you say mistress holt that your son has objected in some way to your sale of your late husband's medicines mr lyon he's masterful beyond everything and he talks more than his father did i've got my reason mr lyon and if anybody talks sense i can follow him but felix talks so wild and contradicts his mother and what do you think he says after giving up his 'prenticeship and going off to study at glasgow and getting through all the bit of money his father saved for his bringing up what has all his learning come to he says i'd better never open my bible for it's as bad poison to me as the pills are to half the people as swallow 'em you'll not speak of this again mr lyon i don't think ill enough of you to believe that for i suppose a christian can understand the word o' god without going to glasgow and there's texts upon texts about ointment and medicine and there's one as might have been for a receipt of my husband's it's just as if it was a riddle and holt's elixir was the answer your son uses rash words mistress holt said the minister but it is quite true that we may err in giving a too private interpretation to the scripture the word of god has to satisfy the larger needs of his people like the rain and the sunshine which no man must think to be meant for his own patch of seed ground solely will it not be well that i should see your son and talk with him on these matters he was at chapel i observe and i suppose i am to be his pastor that was what i wanted to ask you mr lyon for perhaps he'll listen to you and not talk you down as he does his poor mother for after we'd been to chapel he spoke better of you than he does of most he said you was a fine old fellow and an old fashioned puritan he uses dreadful language mr lyon but i saw he didn't mean you ill for all that he calls most folks's religion rottenness and yet another time he'll tell me i ought to feel myself a sinner and do god's will and not my own but it's my belief he says first one thing and then another only to abuse his mother or else he's going off his head and must be sent to a 'sylum but if he writes to the north loamshire herald first to tell everybody the medicines are good for nothing how can i ever keep him and myself tell him i shall feel favored if he will come and see me this evening said mr lyon not without a little prejudice in favor of the young man whose language about the preacher in malthouse yard did not seem to him to be altogether dreadful meanwhile my friend i counsel you to send up a supplication which i shall not fail to offer also that you may receive a spirit of humility and submission so that you may not be hindered from seeing and following the divine guidance in this matter by any false lights of pride and obstinacy of this more when i have spoken with your son i'm not proud or obstinate mr lyon i never did say i was everything that was bad and i never will and why this trouble should be sent on me above everybody else for i haven't told you all he's made himself a journeyman to mr prowd the watchmaker after all this learning and he says he'll go with patches on his knees and he shall like himself the better and as for him having little boys to teach they'll come in all weathers with dirty shoes if it's madness mr lyon it's no use your talking to him we shall see perhaps it may even be the disguised working of grace within him we must not judge rashly many eminent servants of god have been led by ways as strange then i'm sorry for their mothers that's all mr lyon and all the more if they'd been well spoken on women for not my biggest enemy whether it's he or she if they'll speak the truth can turn round and say i've deserved this trouble and when everybody gets their due and people's doings are spoke of on the house tops as the bible says they will be it'll be known what i've gone through with those medicines the pounding and the pouring and the letting stand and the weighing up early and down late there's nobody knows yet but one that's worthy to know and the pasting o' the printed labels right side upwards there's few women would have gone through with it and it's reasonable to think it'll be made up to me for if there's promised and purchased blessings i should think this trouble is purchasing 'em for if my son felix doesn't have a strait waistcoat put on him he'll have his way but i say no more i wish you good morning mr lyon and thank you though i well know it's your duty to act as you're doing and i never troubled you about my own soul as some do who look down on me for not being a church member farewell mistress holt farewell i pray that a more powerful teacher than i am may instruct you the door was closed and the much tried rufus walked about again saying aloud groaningly this woman has sat under the gospel all her life and she is as blind as a heathen and as proud and stiff necked as a pharisee yet she is one of the souls i watch for 'tis true that even sara the chosen mother of god's people showed a spirit of unbelief and perhaps of selfish anger and it is a passage that bears the unmistakable signet 'doing honor to the wife or woman as unto the weaker vessel' for therein is the greatest check put on the ready scorn of the natural man chapter v st citizen sir there's a hurry in the veins of youth that makes a vice of virtue by excess d citizen what if the coolness of our tardier veins be loss of virtue st citizen all things cool with time the sun itself they say till heat shall find a general level nowhere in excess d citizen 'tis a poor climax to my weaker thought that future middlingness in the evening when mr lyon was expecting the knock at the door that would announce felix holt he occupied his cushionless arm chair in the sitting room and was skimming rapidly in his short sighted way by the light of one candle the pages of a missionary report emitting occasionally a slight hm m that appeared to be expressive of criticism rather than of approbation the room was dismally furnished the only objects indicating an intention of ornament being a bookcase a map of the holy land an engraved portrait of dr doddridge and a black bust with a colored face which for some reason or other was covered with green gauze yet any one whose attention was quite awake must have been aware even on entering of certain things that were incongruous with the general air of sombreness and privation there was a delicate scent of dried rose leaves the light by which the minister was reading was a wax candle in a white earthenware candle stick and the table on the opposite side of the fireplace held a dainty work basket frilled with blue satin felix holt when he entered was not in an observant mood and when after seating himself at the minister's invitation near the little table which held the work basket he stared at the wax candle opposite to him he did so without any wonder or consciousness that the candle was not of tallow but the minister's sensitiveness gave another interpretation to the gaze which he divined rather than saw and in alarm lest this inconsistent extravagance should obstruct his usefulness he hastened to say you are doubtless amazed to see me with a wax light my young friend but this undue luxury is paid for with the earnings of my daughter who is so delicately framed that the smell of tallow is loathsome to her i heeded not the candle sir i thank heaven i am not a mouse to have a nose that takes note of wax or tallow the loud abrupt tones made the old man vibrate a little he had been stroking his chin gently before with a sense that he must be very quiet and deliberate in his treatment of the eccentric young man but now quite unreflectingly he drew forth a pair of spectacles which he was in the habit of using when he wanted to observe his interlocutor more closely than usual and i myself in fact am equally indifferent he said as he opened and adjusted his glasses so that i have a sufficient light on my book here his large eyes looked discerningly through the spectacles 'tis the quality of the page you care about not of the candle said felix smiling pleasantly enough at his inspector you're thinking that you have a roughly written page before you now that was true the minister accustomed to the respectable air of provincial townsmen and especially to the sleek well clipped gravity of his own male congregation felt a slight shock as his glasses made perfectly clear to him the shaggy headed large eyed strong limbed person of this questionable young man without waistcoat or cravat but the possibility supported by some of mrs holt's words that a disguised work of grace might be going on in the son of whom she complained so bitterly checked any hasty interpretations i abstain from judging by the outward appearance only he answered with his usual simplicity i myself have experienced that when the spirit is much exercised it is difficult to remember neck bands and strings and such small accidents of our vesture which are nevertheless decent and needful so long as we sojourn in the flesh and you too my young friend as i gather from your mother's troubled and confused report are undergoing some travail of mind you will not i trust object to open yourself fully to me as to an aged pastor who has himself had much inward wrestling and has especially known much temptation from doubt as to doubt said felix loudly and brusquely as before if it is those absurd medicines and gulling advertisements that my mother has been talking of to you and i suppose it is i've no more doubt about them than i have about pocket picking i know there's a stage of speculation in which a man may doubt whether a pickpocket is blameworthy but i'm not one of your subtle fellows who keep looking at the world through their own legs if i allowed the sale of those medicines to go on and my mother to live out of the proceeds when i can keep her by the honest labor of my hands i've not the least doubt that i should be a rascal i would fain enquire more particularly into your objection to these medicines said mr lyon gravely notwithstanding his conscientiousness and a certain originality in his own mental disposition he was too little used to high principle quite dissociated from sectarian phraseology to be as immediately in sympathy with it as he would otherwise have been i know they have been well reported of and many wise persons have tried remedies providentially discovered by those who are not regular physicians and have found a blessing in the use of them i may mention the eminent mr wesley who though i hold not altogether with his arminian doctrine nor with the usages of his institutions was nevertheless a man of god and the journals of various christians whose names have left a sweet savor might be cited in the same sense moreover your father who originally concocted these medicines and left them as a provision for your mother was as i understand a man whose walk was not unfaithful my father was ignorant said felix bluntly he knew neither the complication of the human system nor the way in which drugs counteract each other ignorance is not so damnable as humbug but when it prescribes pills it may happen to do more harm i know something about these things i was 'prentice for five miserable years to a stupid brute of a country apothecary my poor father left money for that he thought nothing could be finer for me no matter i know that the cathartic pills are a drastic compound which may be as bad as poison to half the people who swallow them that the elixir is an absurd farrago of a dozen incompatible things and that the cancer cure might as well be bottled ditch water mr lyon rose and walked up and down the room his simplicity was strongly mixed with sagacity as well as sectarian prejudice and he did not rely at once on a loud spoken integrity satan might have flavored it with ostentation presently he asked in a rapid low tone how long have you known this young man well put sir said felix i've known it a good deal longer than i have acted upon it like plenty of other things but you believe in conversion yea verily so do i i was converted by six weeks' debauchery the minister started young man he said solemnly going up close to felix and laying a hand on his shoulder speak not lightly of the divine operations and restrain unseemly words i'm not speaking lightly said felix if i had not seen that i was making a hog of myself very fast and that pig wash even if i could have got plenty of it was a poor sort of thing i should never have looked life fairly in the face to see what was to be done with it i laughed out loud at last to think that a poor devil like me in a scotch garret with my stockings out at heel and a shilling or two to be dissipated upon with a smell of raw haggis mounting from below and old women breathing gin as they passed me on the stairs wanting to turn my life into easy pleasure then i began to see what else it could be turned into not much perhaps this world is not a very fine place for a good many of the people in it but i've made up my mind it shan't be the worse for me if i can help it they may tell me i can't alter the world that there must be a certain number of sneaks and robbers in it and if i don't lie and filch somebody else will well then somebody else shall for i won't that's the upshot of my conversion mr lyon if you want to know it mr lyon removed his hand from felix's shoulder and walked about again did you sit under any preacher at glasgow young man no i heard most of the preachers once but i never wanted to hear them twice the good rufus was not without a slight rising of resentment at this young man's want of reverence it was not yet plain whether he wanted to hear twice the preacher in malthouse yard but the resentful feeling was carefully repressed a soul in so peculiar a condition must be dealt with delicately and now may i ask he said what course you mean to take after hindering your mother from making and selling these drugs i speak no more in their favor after what you have said god forbid that i should strive to hinder you from seeking whatsoever things are honest and honorable but your mother is advanced in years she needs comfortable sustenance you have doubtless considered how you may make her amends 'he that provideth not for his own ' i trust you respect the authority that so speaks and i will not suppose that after being tender of conscience toward strangers you will be careless toward your mother there be indeed some who taking a mighty charge on their shoulder must perforce leave their households to providence and to the care of humbler brethren but in such a case the call must be clear i shall keep my mother as well nay better than she has kept herself she has always been frugal with my watch and clock cleaning and teaching one or two little chaps that i've got to come to me i can earn enough as for me i can live on bran porridge i have the stomach of a rhinoceros but for a young man so well furnished as you who can questionless write a good hand and keep books were it not well to seek some higher situation as clerk or assistant i could speak to brother muscat who is well acquainted with all such openings any place in pendrell's bank i fear is now closed against such as are not churchmen it used not to be so but a year ago he discharged brother bodkin although he was a valuable servant still something might be found there are ranks and degrees and those who can serve in the higher must not unadvisedly change what seems to be a providential appointment your poor mother is not altogether excuse me mr lyon i've had all that out with my mother and i may as well save you any trouble by telling you that my mind has been made up about that a long while ago i'll take no employment that obliges me to prop up my chin with a high cravat and wear straps and pass the livelong day with a set of fellows who spend their spare money on shirt pins that sort of work is really lower than many handicrafts it only happens to be paid out of proportion that's why i set myself to learn the watchmaking trade my father was a weaver first of all it would have been better for him if he had remained a weaver i came home through lancashire and saw an uncle of mine who is a weaver still i mean to stick to the class i belong to people who don't follow the fashions mr lyon was silent a few moments this dialogue was far from plain sailing he was not certain of his latitude and longitude if the despiser of glasgow preachers had been arguing in favor of gin and sabbath breaking mr lyon's course would have been clearer well well he said deliberately it is true that st paul exercised the trade of tent making though he was learned in all the wisdom of the rabbis st paul was a wise man said felix why should i want to get into the middle class because i have some learning the most of the middle class are as ignorant as the working people about everything that doesn't belong to their own brummagem life that's how the workingmen are left to foolish devices and keep worsening themselves the best heads among them forsake their boon comrades and go in for a house with a high door step and a brass knocker mr lyon stroked his mouth and chin perhaps because he felt some disposition to smile and it would not be well to smile too readily at what seemed but a weedy resemblance of christian unworldliness on the contrary there might be a dangerous snare in an unsanctified outstepping of average christian practice nevertheless he observed gravely it is by such self advancement that many have been enabled to do good service to the cause of liberty and to the public well being the ring and the robe of joseph were no objects for a good man's ambition but they were the signs of that credit which he won by his divinely inspired skill and which enabled him to act as a saviour to his brethren oh yes your ringed and scented men of the people i won't be one of them let a man once throttle himself with a satin stock and he'll get new wants and new motives metamorphosis will have begun at his neck joint and it will go on till it has changed his likings first and then his reasoning which will follow his likings as the feet of a hungry dog follow his nose i'll have none of your clerkly gentility i might end by collecting greasy pence from poor men to buy myself a fine coat and a glutton's dinner on pretence of serving the poor men i'd sooner be paley's fat pigeon than a demagogue all tongue and stomach though here felix changed his voice a little i should like well enough to be another sort of demagogue if i could then you have a strong interest in the great political movements of these times said mr lyon with a perceptible flashing of the eyes i should think so i despise every man who has not or having it doesn't try to rouse it in other men right my young friend right said the minister in a deep cordial tone inevitably his mind was drawn aside from the immediate consideration of felix holt's spiritual interest by the prospect of political sympathy in those days so many instruments of god's cause in the fight for religious and political liberty held creeds that were painfully wrong and indeed irreconcilable with salvation that is my own view which i maintain in the face of some opposition from brethren who contend that a share in public movements is a hindrance to the closer walk and that the pulpit is no place for teaching men their duties as members of the commonwealth i have had much puerile blame cast upon me because i have uttered such names as brougham and wellington in the pulpit why not wellington as well as rabshakeh and why not brougham as well as balaam does god know less of men than he did in the days of hezekiah and moses is his arm shortened and is the world become too wide for his providence but they say there are no politics in the new testament well they're right enough there said felix with his usual unceremoniousness what you are of those who hold that a christian minister should not meddle with public matters in the pulpit said mr lyon coloring i am ready to join issue on that point not i sir said felix i should say teach any truth you can whether it's in the testament or out of it it's little enough anybody can get hold of and still less what he can drive into the skulls of a pence counting parcel tying generation such as mostly fill your chapels young man said mr lyon pausing in front of felix he spoke rapidly as he always did except when his words were specially weighted with emotion he overflowed with matter and in his mind matter was always completely organized into words i speak not on my own behalf for not only have i no desire that any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be but i am aware of much that should make me patient under a disesteem resting even on too hasty a construction i speak not as claiming reverence for my own age and office not to shame you but to warn you it is good that you should use plainness of speech and i am not of those who would enforce a submissive silence on the young that they themselves being elders may be heard at large but elihu was the youngest of job's friends yet was there a wise rebuke in his words and the aged eli was taught by a revelation to the boy samuel i have to keep a special watch over myself in this matter inasmuch as i have need of utterance which makes the thought within me seem as a pent up fire until i have shot it forth as it were in arrowy words each one hitting its mark therefore i pray for a listening spirit which is a great mark of grace nevertheless my young friend i am bound as i said to warn you the temptations that most beset those who have great natural gifts and are wise after the flesh are pride and scorn more particularly toward those weak things of the world which have been chosen to confound the things which are mighty the scornful nostril and the high head gather not the odors that lie on the track of truth the mind that is too ready at contempt and reprobation is here the door opened and mr lyon paused to look around but seeing only lyddy with the tea tray he went on is i may say as a clenched fist that can give blows but is shut up from receiving and holding aught that is precious though it were heaven sent manna i understand you sir said felix good humoredly putting out his hand to the little man who had come close to him as he delivered the last sentence with sudden emphasis and slowness but i'm not inclined to clench my fist at you well well said mr lyon shaking the proffered hand we shall see more of each other and i trust shall have much profitable communing you will stay and have a dish of tea with us we take the meal late on thursdays because my daughter is detained by giving a lesson in the french tongue but she is doubtless returned now and will presently come and pour out tea for us thank you i'll stay said felix not from any curiosity to see the minister's daughter but from a liking for the society of the minister himself for his quaint looks and ways and the transparency of his talk which gave a charm even to his weakness the daughter was probably some prim miss neat sensible pious but all in a small feminine way in which felix was no more interested than in dorcas meetings biographies of devout women and that amount of ornamental knitting which was not inconsistent with non conforming seriousness i'm perhaps a little too fond of banging and smashing he went on a phrenologist at glasgow told me i had large veneration another man there who knew me laughed out and said i was the most blasphemous iconoclast living 'that' says my phrenologist 'is because of his large ideality which prevents him from finding anything perfect enough to be venerated' of course i put my ears down and wagged my tail at that stroking yes yes i have had my own head explored with somewhat similar results it is i fear but a vain show of fulfilling the heathen precept 'know thyself' and too often leads to a self estimate which will subsist in the absence of that fruit by which alone the quality of the tree is made evident nevertheless esther my dear this is mr holt whose acquaintance i have now been making with more than ordinary interest he will take tea with us esther bowed slightly as she walked across the room to fetch the candle and place it near her tray felix rose and bowed also with an air of indifference which was perhaps exaggerated by the fact that he was inwardly surprised the minister's daughter was not the sort of person he expected she was quite incongruous with his notion of ministers' daughters in general and though he had expected something nowise delightful the incongruity repelled him a very delicate scent the faint suggestion of a garden was wafted as she went he would not observe her but he had a sense of an elastic walk the tread of small feet a long neck and a high crown of shining brown plaits and curls that floated backward things in short that suggested a fine lady to him and determined him to notice her as little as possible a fine lady was always a sort of spun glass affair not natural and with no beauty for him as art but a fine lady as the daughter of this rusty old puritan was especially offensive nevertheless continued mr lyon who rarely let drop any thread of discourse that phrenological science is not irreconcilable with the revealed dispensations and it is undeniable that we have our varying native dispositions which even grace will not obliterate i myself from my youth up have been given to question too curiously concerning the truth to examine and sift the medicine of the soul rather than to apply it if your truth happens to be such medicine as holt's pills and elixir the less you swallow of it the better said felix but truth vendors and medicine vendors usually recommend swallowing when a man sees his livelihood in a pill or a proposition he likes to have orders for the dose and not curious enquiries this speech verged on rudeness but it was delivered with a brusque openness that implied the absence of any personal intention the minister's daughter was now for the first time startled into looking at felix but her survey of this unusual speaker was soon made and she relieved her father from the need to reply by saying the tea is poured out father that was the signal for mr lyon to advance toward the table raise his right hand and ask a blessing at sufficient length for esther to glance at the visitor again there seemed to be no danger of his looking at her he was observing her father she had time to remark that he was a peculiar looking person but not insignificant which was the quality that most hopelessly consigned a man to perdition he was massively built the striking points in his face were large clear gray eyes and full lips will you draw up to the table mr holt said the minister in the act of rising felix pushed back his chair too suddenly against the rickety table close by him and down went the blue frilled work basket flying open and dispersing on the floor reels thimble muslin work a small sealed bottle of attar of rose and something heavier than these a duodecimo volume which fell near him between the table and the fender oh my stars said felix i beg your pardon esther had already started up and with wonderful quickness had picked up half the small rolling things while felix was lifting the basket and the book this last had opened and had its leaves crushed in falling and with the instinct of a bookish man he saw nothing more pressing to be done than to flatten the corners of the leaves byron's poems he said in a tone of disgust while esther was recovering all the other articles 'the dream' he'd better have been asleep and snoring what do you stuff your memory with byron miss lyon felix on his side was led at last to look straight at esther but it was with a strong denunciatory and pedagogic intention of course he saw more clearly than ever that she was a fine lady she reddened drew up her long neck and said as she retreated to her chair again i have a great admiration for byron mr lyon had paused in the act of drawing his chair to the tea table and was looking on at this scene wrinkling the corners of his eyes with a perplexed smile esther would not have wished him to know anything about the volume of byron but she was too proud to show any concern he is a worldly and vain writer i fear said mr lyon he knew scarcely anything of the poet whose books embodied the faith and ritual of many young ladies and gentlemen a misanthropic debauchee said felix lifting a chair with one hand and holding the book open in the other whose notion of a hero was that he should disorder his stomach and despise mankind his corsairs and renegades his alps and manfreds are the most paltry puppets that were ever pulled by the strings of lust and pride hand the book to me said mr lyon let me beg of you to put it aside till after tea father said esther however objectionable mr holt may find its pages they would certainly be made worse by being greased with bread and butter that is true my dear said mr lyon laying down the book on the small table behind him he saw that his daughter was angry ho ho thought felix her father is frightened at her how came he to have such a nice stepping long necked peacock for his daughter but she shall see that i am not frightened then he said aloud i should like to know how you will justify your admiration for such a writer miss lyon i should not attempt it with you mr holt said esther you have such strong words at command that they make the smallest argument seem formidable if i had ever met the giant cormoran i should have made a point of agreeing with him in his literary opinions esther had that excellent thing in woman a soft voice with clear fluent utterance her sauciness was always charming because it was without emphasis and was accompanied with graceful little turns of the head felix laughed at her thrust with young heartiness my daughter is a critic of words mr holt said the minister smiling complacently and often corrects mine on the ground of niceties which i profess are as dark to me as if they were the reports of a sixth sense which i possess not i am an eager seeker for precision and would fain find language subtle enough to follow the utmost intricacies of the soul's pathways but i see not why a round word that means some object made and blessed by the creator should be branded and banished as a malefactor oh your niceties i know what they are said felix in his usual fortissimo they'll go on your system of make believe 'rottenness' may suggest what is unpleasant so you'd better say 'sugar plums' or something else such a long way off the fact that nobody is obliged to think of it those are your roundabout euphuisms that dress up swindling till it looks as well as honesty and shoot with boiled peas instead of bullets i hate your gentlemanly speakers then you would not like mr jermyn i think said esther that reminds me father that to day when i was giving miss louisa jermyn her lesson mr jermyn came in and spoke to me with grand politeness and asked me at what times you were likely to be disengaged because he wished to make your better acquaintance and consult you on matters of importance he never took the least notice of me before can you guess the reason of his sudden ceremoniousness nay child said the minister ponderingly politics of course said felix he's on some committee an election is coming universal peace is declared and the foxes have a sincere interest in prolonging the lives of the poultry eh mr lyon isn't that it nay not so he is the close ally of the transome family who are blind hereditary tories like the debarrys and will drive their tenants to the poll as if they were sheep and it has even been hinted that the heir who is coming from the east may be another tory candidate and coalesce with the younger debarry it is said that he has enormous wealth and could purchase every vote in the county that has a price he is come said esther i heard miss jermyn tell her sister that she had seen him going out of her father's room 'tis strange said mr lyon something extraordinary must have happened said esther for mr jermyn to intend courting us miss jermyn said to me only the other day that she could not think how i came to be so well educated and ladylike she always thought dissenters were ignorant vulgar people i said so they were usually and church people also in small towns she considers herself a judge of what is ladylike and she is vulgarity personified with large feet and the most odious scent on her handkerchief and a bonnet that looks like 'the fashion' printed in capital letters one sort of fine ladyism is as good as another said felix no indeed pardon me said esther a real fine lady does not wear clothes that flare in people's eyes or use importunate scents or make a noise as she moves she is something refined and graceful and charming and never obtrusive oh yes said felix contemptuously and she reads byron also and admires childe harold gentlemen of unspeakable woes who employ a hairdresser and look seriously at themselves in the glass esther reddened and gave a little toss felix went on triumphantly a fine lady is a squirrel headed thing with small airs and small notions about as applicable to the business of life as a pair of tweezers to the clearing of a forest ask your father what those old persecuted emigrant puritans would have done with fine lady wives and daughters oh there is no danger of such msalliances said esther men who are unpleasant companions and make frights of themselves are sure to get wives tasteless enough to suit them esther my dear said mr lyon let not your playfulness betray you into disrespect toward those venerable pilgrims they struggled and endured in order to cherish and plant anew the seeds of a scriptural doctrine and of a pure discipline yes i know said esther hastily dreading a discourse on the pilgrim fathers oh they were an ugly lot felix burst in making mr lyon start miss medora wouldn't have minded if they had all been put into the pillory and lost their ears she would have said 'their ears did stick out so' i shouldn't wonder if that's a bust of one of them here felix with sudden keenness of observation nodded at the black bust with the gauze over its colored face no said mr lyon that is the eminent george whitfield who you well know had a gift of oratory as of one on whom the tongue of flame had rested visibly but providence doubtless for wise ends in relation to the inner man for i would not enquire too closely into minuti which carry too many plausible interpretations for any one of them to be stable providence i say ordained that the good man should squint and my daughter has not yet learned to bear with his infirmity she has put a veil over it suppose you had squinted yourself said felix looking at esther then doubtless you could have been more polite to me mr holt said esther rising and placing herself at her work table you seem to prefer what is unusual and ugly a peacock thought felix i should like to come and scold her every day and make her cry and cut her fine hair off felix rose to go and said i will not take up any more of your valuable time mr lyon i know that you have not many spare evenings that is true my young friend for i now go to sproxton one evening in the week i do not despair that we may some day need a chapel there though the hearers do not multiply save among the women and there is no work as yet begun among the miners themselves i shall be glad of your company in my walk thither to morrow at five o'clock if you would like to see how that population has grown of late years oh i've been to sproxton already several times i had a congregation of my own there last sunday evening what do you preach said mr lyon with brightened glance not exactly i went to the ale house mr lyon started i trust you are putting a riddle to me young man even as samson did to his companions from what you said but lately it cannot be that you are given to tippling and to taverns oh i don't drink much i order a pint of beer and i get into talk with the fellows over their pots and pipes somebody must take a little knowledge and common sense to them in this way else how are they to get it i go for educating the non electors so i put myself in the way of my pupils my academy is the beer house i'll walk with you to morrow with pleasure do so do so said mr lyon shaking hands with his odd acquaintance we shall understand each other better by and by i doubt not i wish you good evening miss lyon esther bowed very slightly without speaking that is a singular young man esther said the minister walking about after felix was gone i discern in him a love for whatsoever things are honest and true which i would fain believe to be an earnest of further endowment with the wisdom that is from on high it is true that as the traveller in the desert is often lured by a false vision of water and freshness to turn aside from the track which leads to the tried and established fountains so the evil one will take advantage of a natural yearning toward the better to delude the soul with a self flattering belief in a visionary virtue higher than the ordinary fruits of the spirit but i trust it is not so here i feel a great enlargement in this young man's presence notwithstanding a certain license in his language which i shall use my efforts to correct i think he is very coarse and rude said esther with a touch of temper in her voice but he speaks better english than most of our visitors what is his occupation watch and clock making by which together with a little teaching as i understand he hopes to maintain his mother not thinking it right that he should live by the sale of medicines whose virtues he distrusts it is no common scruple dear me said esther i thought he was something higher than that she was disappointed felix on his side as he strolled out in the evening air said to himself now by what fine meshes of circumstance did that queer devout old man with his awful creed which makes this world a vestibule with double doors to hell and a narrow stair on one side whereby the thinner sort may mount to heaven by what subtle play of flesh and spirit did he come to have a daughter so little in his own likeness married foolishly i suppose i'll never marry though i should have to live on raw turnips to subdue my flesh i'll never look back and say 'i had a fine purpose once i meant to keep my hands clean and my soul upright and to look truth in the face but pray excuse me i have a wife and children i must lie and simper a little else they'll starve' or 'my wife is nice she must have her bread well buttered and her feelings will be hurt if she is not thought genteel' that is the lot miss esther is preparing for some man or other i could grind my teeth at such self satisfied minxes who think they can tell everybody what is the correct thing and the utmost stretch of their ideas will not place them on a level with the intelligent fleas i should like to see if she could be made ashamed of herself chapter vi though she be dead yet let me think she lives and feed my mind that dies for want of her marlowe tamburlaine the great hardly any one in treby who thought at all of mr lyon and his daughter had not felt the same sort of wonder about esther as felix felt she was not much liked by her father's church and congregation the less serious observed that she had too many airs and graces and held her head much too high the stricter sort feared greatly that mr lyon had not been sufficiently careful in placing his daughter among god fearing people and that being led astray by the melancholy vanity of giving her exceptional accomplishments he had sent her to a french school and allowed her to take situations where she had contracted notions not only above her own rank but of too worldly a kind to be safe in any rank but no one knew what sort of woman her mother had been for mr lyon never spoke of his past domesticities when he was chosen as pastor at treby in it was understood that he had been a widower many years and he had no companion but the tearful and much exercised lyddy his daughter being still at school it was only two years ago that esther had come home to live permanently with her father and take pupils in the town within that time she had excited a passion in two young dissenting breasts that were clad in the best style of treby waistcoat a garment which at that period displayed much design both in the stuff and the wearer and she had secured an astonished admiration of her cleverness from the girls of various ages who were her pupils indeed her knowledge of french was generally held to give a distinction to treby itself as compared with other market towns but she had won little regard of any other kind wise dissenting matrons were divided between fear lest their sons should want to marry her and resentment that she should treat those undeniable young men with a distant scorn which was hardly to be tolerated in a minister's daughter not only because that parentage appeared to entail an obligation to show an exceptional degree of christian humility but because looked at from a secular point of view a poor minister must be below the substantial householders who keep him for at that time the preacher who was paid under the voluntary system was regarded by his flock with feelings not less mixed than the spiritual person who still took his tithe pig or his modus his gifts were admired and tears were shed under best bonnets at his sermons but the weaker tea was thought good enough for him and even when he went to preach a charity sermon in a strange town he was treated with home made wine and the smaller bedroom as the good churchman's reverence was often mixed with growling and was apt to be given chiefly to an abstract parson who was what a parson ought to be so the good dissenter sometimes mixed his approval of ministerial gifts with considerable criticism and cheapening of the human vessel which contained those treasures mrs muscat and mrs nuttwood applied the principle of christian equality by remarking that mr lyon had his oddities and that he ought not to allow his daughter to indulge in such unbecoming expenditure on her gloves shoes and hosiery even if she did pay for them out of her earnings as for the church people who engaged miss lyon to give lessons in their families their imaginations were altogether prostrated by the incongruity between accomplishments and dissent between weekly prayer meetings and a conversance with so lively and altogether worldly a language as the french esther's own mind was not free from a sense of irreconcilableness between the objects of her taste and the conditions of her lot she knew that dissenters were looked down upon by those whom she regarded as the most refined classes her favorite companions both in france and at an english school where she had been a junior teacher had thought it quite ridiculous to have a father who was a dissenting preacher and when an ardently admiring school fellow induced her parents to take esther as a governess to the younger children all her native tendencies toward luxury fastidiousness and scorn of mock gentility were strengthened by witnessing the habits of a well born and wealthy family yet the position of servitude was irksome to her and she was glad at last to live at home with her father for though throughout her girlhood she had wished to avoid this lot a little experience had taught her to prefer its comparative independence but she was not contented with her life she seemed to herself to be surrounded with ignoble uninteresting conditions from which there was no issue for even if she had been unamiable enough to give her father pain deliberately it would have been no satisfaction to her to go to treby church and visibly turn her back on dissent it was not religious differences but social differences that esther was concerned about and her ambitious taste would have been no more gratified in the society of the waces than in that of the muscats the waces spoke imperfect english and played whist the muscats spoke the same dialect and took in the evangelical magazine esther liked neither of these amusements she had one of those exceptional organizations which are quick and sensitive without being in the least morbid she was alive to the finest shades of manner to the nicest distinctions of tone and accent she had a little code of her own about scents and colors textures and behavior by which she secretly condemned or sanctioned all things and persons and she was well satisfied with herself for her fastidious taste never doubting that hers was the highest standard she was proud that the best born and handsomest girls at school had always said that she might be taken for a born lady her own pretty instep clad in a silk stocking her little heel just rising from a kid slipper her irreproachable nails and delicate wrist were the objects of delighted consciousness to her and she felt that it was her superiority which made her unable to use without disgust any but the finest cambric handkerchiefs and freshest gloves her money all went in the gratification of these nice tastes and she saved nothing from her earnings i can not say that she had pangs of conscience on this score for she felt sure that she was generous she hated all meanness would empty her purse impulsively on some sudden appeal to her pity and if she found out that her father had a want she would supply it with some pretty device of a surprise but then the good man so seldom had a want except the perpetual desire which she could never gratify of seeing her under convictions and fit to become a member of the church as for little mr lyon he loved and admired this unregenerate child more he feared than was consistent with the due preponderance of impersonal and ministerial regards he prayed and pleaded for her with tears humbling himself for her spiritual deficiencies in the privacy of his study and then came down stairs to find himself in timorous subjection to her wishes lest as he inwardly said he should give his teaching an ill savor by mingling it with outward crossing there will be queens in spite of salic or other laws of later date than adam and eve and here in this small dingy house of the minister in malthouse yard there was a light footed sweet voiced queen esther the stronger will always rule say some with an air of confidence which is like a lawyer's flourish forbidding exceptions or additions but what is strength is it blind wilfulness that sees no terrors no many linked consequences no bruises and wounds of those whose cords it tightens is it the narrowness of a brain that conceives no needs differing from its own and looks to no results beyond the bargains of to day that tugs with emphasis for every small purpose and thinks it weakness to exercise the sublime power of resolved renunciation there is a sort of subjection which is the peculiar heritage of largeness and of love and strength is often only another name for willing bondage to irremediable weakness esther had affection for her father she recognized the purity of his character and a quickness of intellect in him which responded to her own liveliness in spite of what seemed a dreary piety which selected everything that was least interesting and romantic in life and history but his old clothes had a smoky odor and she did not like to walk with him because when people spoke to him in the street it was his wont instead of remarking on the weather and passing on to pour forth in an absent manner some reflections that were occupying his mind about the traces of the divine government or about a peculiar incident narrated in the life of the eminent mr richard baxter esther had a horror of appearing ridiculous even in the eyes of vulgar trebians she fancied that she should have loved her mother better than she was able to love her father and she wished she could have remembered that mother more thoroughly but she had no more than a broken vision of the time before she was five years old the time when the word oftenest on her lips was mamma when a low voice spoke caressing french words to her and she in her turn repeated the words to her rag doll when a very small white hand different from any that came after used to pat her and stroke her and tie on her frock and pinafore and when at last there was nothing but sitting with a doll on a bed where mamma was lying till her father once carried her away where distinct memory began there was no longer the low caressing voice and the small white hand she knew that her mother was a frenchwoman that she had been in want and distress and that her maiden name was annette ledru her father had told her no more than this and once he had said my esther until you are a woman we will only think of your mother when you are about to be married and leave me we will speak of her and i will deliver to you her ring and all that was hers but without a great command laid upon me i cannot pierce my heart by speaking of that which was and is not esther had never forgotten these words and the older she became the more impossible she felt it that she should urge her father with questions about the past his inability to speak of that past to her depended on manifold causes partly it came from an initial concealment he had not the courage to tell esther that he was not really her father he had not the courage to renounce that hold on her tenderness which the belief in his natural fatherhood must help to give him or to incur any resentment that her quick spirit might feel at having been brought up under a false supposition but there were other things yet more difficult for him to be quite open about deep sorrows of his life as a christian minister that were hardly to be told to a girl twenty two years ago when rufus lyon was no more than thirty six years old he was the admired pastor of a large independent congregation in one of our southern seaport towns he was unmarried and had met all exhortations of friends who represented to him that a bishop ie the overseer of an independent church and congregation should be the husband of one wife by saying that st paul meant this particular as a limitation and not as an injunction that a minister was permitted to have one wife but that he rufus lyon did not wish to avail himself of that permission finding his studies and other labors of his vocation all absorbing and seeing that mothers in israel were sufficiently provided by those who had not been set apart for a more special work his church and congregation were proud of him he was put forward on platforms was made a deputation and was requested to preach anniversary sermons in far off towns wherever noteworthy preachers were discussed rufus lyon was almost sure to be mentioned as one who did honor to the independent body his sermons were said to be full of fire and while he had more of human knowledge than many of his brethren he showed in an eminent degree the marks of a true ministerial vocation but on a sudden this burning and shining light seemed to be quenched mr lyon voluntarily resigned his charge and withdrew from the town a terrible crisis had come upon him a moment in which religious doubt and newly awakened passion had rushed together in a common flood and had paralyzed his ministerial gifts his thirty six years had been a story of purely religious and studious fervor his passion had been for doctrines for argumentative conquest on the side of right the sins he had chiefly to pray against had been those of personal ambition under such forms as ambition takes in the mind of a man who has chosen the career of an independent preacher and those of a too restless intellect ceaselessly urging questions concerning the mystery of that which was assuredly revealed and thus hindering the due nourishment of the soul on the substance of the truth delivered even at that time of comparative youth his unworldliness and simplicity in small matters for he was keenly awake to the larger affairs of this world gave a certain oddity to his manners and appearance and though his sensitive face had much beauty his person altogether seemed so irrelevant to a fashionable view of things that well dressed ladies and gentlemen usually laughed at him as they probably did at mr john milton after the restoration and ribbons had come in and still more at that apostle of weak bodily presence who preached in the back streets of ephesus and elsewhere a new view of a religion that hardly anybody believed in rufus lyon was the singular looking apostle of the meeting in skipper's lane was it likely that any romance should befall such a man perhaps not but romance did befall him one winter's evening in mr lyon was returning from a village preaching he walked at his usual rapid rate with busy thoughts undisturbed by any sight more distinct than the bushes and the hedgerow trees black beneath a faint moonlight until something suggested to him that he had perhaps omitted to bring away with him a thin account book in which he recorded certain subscriptions he paused unfastened his outer coat and felt in all his pockets then he took off his hat and looked inside it the book was not to be found and he was about to walk on when he was startled by hearing a low sweet voice say with a strong foreign accent have pity on me sir searching with his short sighted eyes he perceived some one on a side bank and approaching he found a young woman with a baby on her lap she spoke again more faintly than before sir i die with hunger in the name of god take the little one there was no distrusting the pale face and the sweet low voice without pause mr lyon took the baby in his arms and said can you walk by my side young woman she rose but seemed tottering lean on me said mr lyon and so they walked slowly on the minister for the first time in his life carrying a baby nothing better occurred to him than to take his charge to his own house it was the simplest way of relieving the woman's wants and finding out how she could be helped further and he thought of no other possibilities she was too feeble for more words to be spoken between them till she was seated by his fireside his elderly servant was not easily amazed at anything her master did in the way of charity and at once took the baby while mr lyon unfastened the mother's damp bonnet and shawl and gave her something warm to drink then waiting by her till it was time to offer her more he had nothing to do but to notice the loveliness of her face which seemed to him as that of an angel with a benignity in its repose that carried a more assured sweetness than any smile gradually she revived lifted up her delicate hands between her face and the firelight and looked at the baby which lay opposite to her on the old servant's lap taking in spoonfuls with much content and stretching out naked feet toward the warmth then as her consciousness of relief grew into contrasting memory she lifted up her eyes to mr lyon who stood close by her and said in her pretty broken way i knew you had a good heart when you took your hat off you seemed to me as the image of the bien ami saint jean the grateful glance of those blue gray eyes with their long shadow making eyelashes was a new kind of good to rufus lyon it seemed to him as if a woman had never really looked at him before yet this poor thing was apparently a blind french catholic of delicate nurture surely judging from her hands he was in a tremor he felt that it would be rude to question her and he only urged her now to take a little food she accepted it with evident enjoyment looking at the child continually and then with a fresh burst of gratitude leaning forward to press the servant's hand and say oh you are good then she looked up at mr lyon again and said is there in the world a prettier marmot the evening passed a bed was made up for the strange woman and mr lyon had not asked her so much as her name he never went to bed himself that night he spent it in misery enduring a horrible assault of satan he thought a frenzy had seized him wild visions of an impossible future thrust themselves upon him he dreaded lest the woman had a husband he wished that he might call her his own that he might worship her beauty that she might love and caress him and what to the mass of men would have been only one of many allowable follies a transient fascination to be dispelled by daylight and contact with those common facts of which common sense is the reflex was to him a spiritual convulsion he was as one who raved and knew that he raved these mad wishes were irreconcilable with what he was and must be as a christian minister nay penetrating his soul as tropic heat penetrates the frame and changes for it all aspects and all flavors they were irreconcilable with that conception of the world which made his faith all the busy doubt which had before been mere impish shadows flitting around a belief that was strong with the strength of an unswerving moral bias had now gathered blood and substance the questioning spirit had become suddenly bold and blasphemous it no longer insinuated scepticism it prompted defiance it no longer expressed cool inquisitive thought but was the voice of a passionate mood yet he never ceased to regard it as the voice of the tempter the conviction which had been the law of his better life remained within him as a conscience the struggle of that night was an abridgment of all the struggles that came after quick souls have their intensest life in the first anticipatory sketch of what may or will be and the pursuit of their wish is the pursuit of that paradisiacal vision which only impelled them and is left farther and farther behind vanishing forever even out of hope in the moment which is called success the next morning mr lyon heard his guest's history she was the daughter of a french officer of considerable rank who had fallen in the russian campaign she had escaped from france to england with much difficulty in order to rejoin her husband a young englishman to whom she had become attached during his detention as a prisoner of war on parole at vesoul where she was living under the charge of some relatives and to whom she had been married without the consent of her family her husband had served in the hanoverian army had obtained his discharge in order to visit england on some business with the nature of which she was not acquainted and had been taken prisoner as a suspected spy a short time after their marriage he and his fellow prisoners had been moved to a town nearer the coast and she had remained in wretched uncertainty about him until at last a letter had come from him telling her that an exchange of prisoners had occurred that he was in england that she must use her utmost effort to follow him and that on arriving on english ground she must send him word under a cover which he enclosed bearing an address in london fearing the opposition of her friends she started unknown to them with a very small supply of money and after enduring much discomfort and many fears in waiting for a passage which she at last got in a small trading smack she arrived at southampton ill before she was able to write her baby was born and before her husband's answer came she had been obliged to pawn some clothes and trinkets he desired her to travel to london where he would meet her at the belle sauvage adding that he was himself in distress and unable to come to her when once she was in london they would take ship and quit the country arrived at the belle sauvage the poor thing waited three days in vain for her husband on the fourth a letter came in a strange hand saying that in his last moments he had desired this letter to be written to inform her of his death and recommend her to return to her friends she could choose no other course but she had soon been reduced to walking that she might save her pence to buy bread with and on the evening when she made her appeal to mr lyon she had pawned the last thing over and above needful clothing that she could persuade herself to part with the things she had not borne to part with were her marriage ring and a locket containing her husband's hair and bearing his baptismal name this locket she said exactly resembled one worn by her husband on his watch chain only that his bore the name annette and contained a lock of her hair the precious trifle now hung round her neck by a cord for she had sold the small gold chain which formerly held it the only guarantee of this story besides the exquisite candor of her face was a small packet of papers which she carried in her pocket consisting of her husband's few letters the letter which announced his death and her marriage certificate it was not so probable a story as that of many an inventive vagrant but mr lyon did not doubt it for a moment it was impossible to him to suspect this angelic faced woman but he had strong suspicions concerning her husband he could not help being glad that she had not retained the address he had desired her to send to in london as that removed any obvious means of learning particulars about him but enquiries might have been made at vesoul by letter and her friends there might have been appealed to a consciousness not to be quite silenced told mr lyon that this was the course he ought to take but it would have required an energetic self conquest and he was excused from it by annette's own disinclination to return to her relatives if any other acceptable possibility could be found he dreaded with a violence of feeling which surmounted all struggles lest anything should take her away and place such barriers between them as would make it unlikely or impossible that she should ever love him well enough to become his wife yet he saw with perfect clearness that unless he tore up his mad passion by the roots his ministerial usefulness would be frustrated and the repose of his soul would be destroyed this woman was an unregenerate catholic ten minutes' listening to her artless talk made that plain to him even if her position had been less equivocal to unite himself to such a woman was nothing less than a spiritual fall it was already a fall that he had wished there was no high purpose to which he owed an allegiance that he had longed to fly to some backwoods where there was no church to reproach him and where he might have this sweet woman to wife and to know the joys of tenderness those sensibilities which in most lives are diffused equally through the youthful years were aroused suddenly in mr lyon as some men have their special genius revealed to them by a tardy concurrence of conditions his love was the first love of a fresh young heart full of wonder and worship but what to one man is the virtue which he has sunk below the possibility of aspiring to is to another the backsliding by which he forfeits his spiritual crown the end was that annette remained in his house he had striven against himself so far as to represent her position to some chief matrons in his congregation praying and yet dreading that they would so take her by the hand as to impose on him that denial of his own longing not to let her go out of his sight which he found it too hard to impose on himself but they regarded the case coldly the woman was after all a vagrant mr lyon was observed to be surprisingly weak on the subject his eagerness seemed disproportionate and unbecoming and this young frenchwoman unable to express herself very clearly was no more interesting to those matrons and their husbands than other pretty young women suspiciously circumstanced they were willing to subscribe something to carry her on her way or if she took some lodgings they would give her a little sewing and endeavor to convert her from papistry if however she was a respectable person as she said the only proper thing for her was to go back to her own country and friends in spite of himself mr lyon exulted there seemed a reason now that he should keep annette under his own eyes he told himself that no real object would be served by his providing food and lodging for her elsewhere an expense which he could ill afford and she was apparently so helpless except as to the one task of attending to her baby that it would have been folly to think of her exerting herself for her own support but this course of his was severely disapproved by his church there were various signs that the minister was under some evil influence his preaching wanted its old fervor he seemed to shun the intercourse of his brethren and very mournful suspicions were entertained a formal remonstrance was presented to him but he met it as if he had already determined to act in anticipation of it he admitted that external circumstances conjoined with a peculiar state of mind were likely to hinder the fruitful exercise of his ministry and he resigned it there was much sorrowing much expostulation but he declared that for the present he was unable to unfold himself more fully he only wished to state solemnly that annette ledru though blind in spiritual things was in a worldly sense a pure and virtuous woman no more was to be said and he departed to a distant town here he maintained himself annette and the child with the remainder of his stipend and with the wages he earned as a printer's reader annette was one of those angelic faced helpless women who take all things as manna from heaven the good image of the well beloved saint john wished her to stay with him and there was nothing else that she wished for except the unattainable yet for a whole year mr lyon never dared to tell annette that he loved her he trembled before this woman he saw that the idea of his being her lover was too remote from her mind for her to have any idea that she ought not to live with him she had never known never asked the reason why he gave up his ministry she seemed to entertain as little concern about the strange world in which she lived as a bird in its nest an avalanche had fallen over the past but she sat warm and uncrushed there was food for many morrows and her baby flourished she did not seem even to care about a priest or about having her child baptized and on the subject of religion mr lyon was as timid and shrank as much from speaking to her as on the subject of his love he dreaded anything that might cause her to feel a sudden repulsion toward him he dreaded disturbing her simple gratitude and content in these days his religious faith was not slumbering it was awake and achingly conscious of having fallen in a struggle he had had a great treasure committed to him and had flung it away he held himself a backslider his unbelieving thoughts never gained the full ear and consent of his soul his prayers had been stifled by the sense that there was something he preferred to complete obedience they had ceased to be anything but intermittent cries and confessions and a submissive presentiment rising at times even to an entreaty that some great discipline might come that the dull spiritual sense might be roused to full vision and hearing as of old and the supreme facts become again supreme in his soul mr lyon will perhaps seem a very simple personage with pitiably narrow theories but none of our theories are quite large enough for all the disclosures of time and to the end of men's struggles a penalty will remain for those who sink from the ranks of the heroes into the crowd for whom the heroes fight and die one day however annette learned mr lyon's secret the baby had a tooth coming and being large and strong now was noisily fretful mr lyon though he had been working extra hours and was much in need of repose took the child from its mother immediately on entering the house and walked about with it patting and talking soothingly to it the stronger grasp the new sensations were a successful anodyne and baby went to sleep on his shoulder but fearful lest any movement should disturb it he sat down and endured the bondage of holding it still against his shoulder you do nurse baby well said annette approvingly yet you never nursed before i came no said mr lyon i had no brothers and sisters why were you not married annette had never thought of asking that question before because i never loved any woman till now i thought i should never marry now i wish to marry annette started she did not see at once that she was the woman he wanted to marry what had flashed on her mind was that there might be a great change in mr lyon's life it was as if the lightning had entered into her dream and half awaked her do you think it foolish annette that i should wish to marry i did not expect it she said doubtfully i did not know you thought about it you know the woman i should like to marry i know her she said interrogatively blushing deeply it is you annette you whom i have loved better than my duty i forsook everything for you mr lyon paused he was about to do what he felt would be ignoble to urge what seemed like a claim can you love me annette will you be my wife annette trembled and looked miserable do not speak forget it said mr lyon rising suddenly and speaking with loud energy no no i do not want it i do not wish it the baby awoke as he started up he gave the child into annette's arms and left her his work took him away early the next morning and the next again they did not need to speak much to each other the third day mr lyon was too ill to go to work his frame had been overwrought he had been too poor to have sufficiently nourishing food and under the shattering of his long deferred hope his health had given away they had no regular servant only occasional help from an old woman who lit the fires and put on the kettles annette was forced to be the sick nurse and this sudden demand on her shook away some of her torpor the illness was a serious one and the medical man one day hearing mr lyon in his delirium raving with an astonishing fluency in biblical language suddenly looked round with increased curiosity at annette and asked if she were the sick man's wife or some other relative no no relation said annette shaking her head he has been good to me how long have you lived with him more than a year was he a preacher once yes when did he leave off being a preacher soon after he took care of me is that his child sir said annette coloring indignantly i am a widow the doctor she thought looked at her oddly but he asked no more questions when the sick man was getting better and able to enjoy invalid's food he observed one day while he was taking some broth that annette was looking at him he paused to look at her in return and was struck with a new expression in her face quite distinct from the merely passive sweetness which usually characterized it she laid her little hand on his which was now transparently thin and said i am getting very wise i have sold some of the books to make money the doctor told me where and i have looked into the shops where they sell caps and bonnets and pretty things and i can do all that and get more money to keep us and when you are well enough to get up we will go out and be married shall we not see and la petite the baby had never been named anything else shall call you papa and then we shall never part mr lyon trembled this illness something else perhaps had made a great change in annette a fortnight after that they were married the day before he had ventured to ask her if she felt any difficulty about her religion and if she would consent to have la petite baptized and brought up as a protestant she shook her head and said very simply no in france in other days i would have minded but all is changed i never was fond of religion but i knew it was right j'aimais les fleurs les bals la musique et mon mari qui tait beau but all that is gone away there is nothing of my religion in this country but the good god must be here for you are good i leave all to you it was clear that annette regarded her present life as a sort of death to the world an existence on a remote island where she had been saved from wreck she was too indolent mentally too little interested to acquaint herself with any secrets of the isle the transient energy the more vivid consciousness and sympathy which had been stirred in her during mr lyon's illness had soon subsided into the old apathy to everything except her child she withered like a plant in strange air and the three years of life that remained were but a slow and gentle death those three years were to mr lyon a period of such self suppression and life in another as few men know strange that the passion for this woman which he felt to have drawn him aside from the right as much as if he had broken the most solemn vows for that only was right to him which he held the best and highest the passion for a being who had no glimpse of his thoughts induced a more thorough renunciation than he had ever known in the time of his complete devotion to his ministerial career he had no flattery now either from himself or the world he knew that he had fallen and his world had forgotten him or shook their heads at his memory the only satisfaction he had was the satisfaction of his tenderness which meant untiring work untiring patience untiring wakefulness even to the dumb signs of feeling in a creature whom he alone cared for the day of parting came and he was left with little esther as the one visible sign of that four years' break in his life a year afterward he entered the ministry again and lived with the utmost sparingness that esther might be so educated as to be able to get her own bread in case of his death her probable facility in acquiring french naturally suggested his sending her to a french school which would give her a special advantage as a teacher it was a protestant school and french protestantism had the high recommendation of being non prelatical it was understood that esther would contract no papistical superstitions and this was perfectly true but she contracted as we see a good deal of non papistical vanity mr lyon's reputation as a preacher and devoted pastor had revived but some dissatisfaction beginning to be felt by his congregation at a certain laxity detected by them in his views as to the limits of salvation which he had in one sermon even hinted might extend to unconscious recipients of mercy he had found it desirable seven years ago to quit this ten years' pastorate and accept a call from the less important church in malthouse yard treby magna this was rufus lyon's history at that time unknown in its fullness to any human being besides himself we can perhaps guess what memories they were that relaxed the stringency of his doctrine on the point of salvation in the deepest of all senses his heart said though she be dead yet let me think she lives and feed my mind that dies for want of her chapter vii m it was but yesterday you spoke him well you've changed your mind so soon n not i 'tis he that changing to my thought has changed my mind no man puts rotten apples in his pouch because their upper side looked fair to him constancy in mistake is constant folly the news that the rich heir of the transomes was actually come back and had been seen at treby was carried to some one else who had more reasons for being interested in it than the reverend rufus lyon was yet conscious of having it was owing to this that at three o'clock two days afterward a carriage and pair with coachman and footman in crimson and drab passed through the lodge gates at transome court inside there was a hale good natured looking man of sixty whose hands rested on a knotted stick held between his knees and a blue eyed well featured lady fat and middle aged a mountain of satin lace and exquisite muslin embroidery they were not persons of a highly remarkable appearance but to most trebians they seemed absolutely unique and likely to be known anywhere if you had looked down upon them from the box of sampson's coach he would have said after lifting his hat sir maximus and his lady did you see thinking it needless to add the surname we shall find her greatly elated doubtless lady debarry was saying she has been in the shade so long ah poor thing said sir maximus a fine woman she was in her bloom i remember the first county ball she attended we were all ready to fight for the sake of dancing with her i always liked her from that time i never swallowed the scandal about her myself if we are to be intimate with her said lady debarry i wish you would avoid making such allusions sir maximus i should not like selina and harriet to hear them my dear i should have forgotten all about the scandal only you remind me of it sometimes retorted the baronet smiling and taking out his snuff box these sudden turns of fortune are often dangerous to an excitable constitution said lady debarry not choosing to notice her husband's epigram poor lady alicia methurst got heart disease from a sudden piece of luck the death of her uncle you know if mrs transome was wise she would go to town she can afford it now and consult dr truncheon i should say myself he would order her digitalis i have often guessed exactly what a prescription would be but it certainly was one of her weak points to think she understood medicine better than other people she's a healthy woman enough surely see how upright she is and she rides about like a girl of twenty she is so thin that she makes me shudder pooh she's slim and active women are not bid for by the pound pray don't be so coarse sir maximus laughed and showed his good teeth which made his laughter very becoming the carriage stopped and they were soon ushered to mrs transome's sitting room where she was working at her worsted embroidery a little daily embroidery had been a constant element in mrs transome's life but that soothing occupation of taking stitches to produce what neither she nor any one else wanted was then the resource of many a well born and unhappy woman she received much warm congratulation and pressure of her hand with perfect composure of manner but she became paler than usual and her hands turned quite cold the debarrys did not yet know what harold's politics were well our lucky youngster is come in the nick of time said sir maximus if he'll stand he and philip can run in harness together and keep out both the whigs it is really quite a providential thing his returning just now said lady debarry i couldn't help thinking that something would occur to prevent philip from having such a man as peter garstin for his colleague i call my friend harold a youngster said sir maximus for you know i remember him only as he was when that portrait was taken that is a long while ago said mrs transome my son is much altered as you may imagine there was a confused sound of voices in the library while this talk was going on mrs transome chose to ignore that noise but her face from being pale began to flush a little yes yes on the outside i dare say but he was a fine fellow i always liked him and if anybody should ask me what i should choose for the good of the country i couldn't have thought of anything better than having a young transome for a neighbor who will take an active part the transomes and the debarrys were always on the right side together in old days of course he'll stand he has made up his mind to it the need for an answer to this embarrassing question was deferred by the increase of inarticulate sounds accompanied by a bark from the library and the sudden appearance at the tapestry hung doorway of old mr transome with a cord around his waist playing a very poor paced horse for a black maned little boy about three years old who was urging him on with loud encouraging noises and occasional thumps from a stick which he wielded with difficulty the old man paused with a vague smile at the doorway while the baronet got up to speak to him nimrod snuffed at his master's legs to ascertain that he was not hurt and the little boy finding something new to be looked at let go the cord and came round in front of the company dragging his stick and standing at a safe war dancing distance as he fixed his great black eyes on lady debarry dear me what a splendid little boy mrs transome why it cannot be can it be that you have the happiness to be a grandmamma yes that is my son's little boy indeed said lady debarry really amazed i never heard you speak of his marriage he has brought you home a daughter in law then no said mrs transome coldly she is dead o o oh said lady debarry in a tone ludicrously undecided between condolence satisfaction and general mistiness how very singular i mean that we should not have heard of mr harold's marriage but he's a charming little fellow come to me you round cheeked cherub the black eyes continued fixed as if by a sort of fascination on lady debarry's face and her affable invitation was unheeded at last putting his head forward and pouting his lips the cherub gave forth with marked intention the sounds nau o oom many times repeated apparently they summed up his opinion of lady debarry and may perhaps have meant naughty old woman but his speech was a broken lisping polyglot of hazardous interpretation then he turned to pull at the blenheim spaniel which being old and peevish gave a little snap go go harry let poor puff alone he'll bite you said mrs transome stooping to release her aged pet her words were too suggestive for harry immediately laid hold of her arm with his teeth and bit with all his might happily the stuffs upon it were some protection but the pain forced mrs transome to give a low cry and sir maximus who had now turned to reseat himself shook the little rascal off whereupon he burst away and trotted into the library again i fear you are hurt said lady debarry with sincere concern what a little savage do have your arm attended to my dear i recommend fomentation don't think of me oh thank you it is nothing said mrs transome biting her lip and smiling alternately it will soon go off the pleasures of being a grandmamma you perceive the child has taken a dislike to me but he makes quite a new life for mr transome they were playfellows at once bless my heart said sir maximus it is odd to think of harold having been a family man so long i made up my mind he was a young bachelor what an old stager i am to be sure and whom has he married i hope we shall soon have the pleasure of seeing mrs harold transome sir maximus occupied with old mr transome had not overheard the previous conversation on that subject she is no longer living lady debarry hastily interposed but now my dear sir maximus we must not hinder mrs transome from attending to her arm i am sure she is in pain don't say another word my dear we shall see you again you and mr harold will come and dine with us on thursday say yes only yes sir maximus is longing to see him and philip will be down yes yes said sir maximus he must lose no time in making philip's acquaintance tell him philip is a fine fellow carried everything before him at oxford and your son must be returned along with him for north loamshire you said he meant to stand i will write and let you know if harold has any engagement for thursday he would of course be happy otherwise said mrs transome evading the question if not thursday the next day the very first day he can the visitors left and mrs transome was almost glad of the painful bite which had saved her from being questioned further about harold's politics this is the last visit i shall receive from them she said to herself as the door closed behind them and she rang for denner that poor creature is not happy sir maximus said lady debarry as they drove along something annoys her about her son i hope there is nothing unpleasant in his character either he kept his marriage a secret from her or she was ashamed of it he is thirty four at least by this time after living in the east so long he may have become a sort of person one would not care to be intimate with and that savage boy he doesn't look like a lady's child pooh my dear said sir maximus women think so much of those minuti in the present state of the country it is our duty to look at a man's position and politics philip and my brother are both of that opinion and i think they know what's right if any man does we are bound to regard every man of our party as a public instrument and to pull all together the transomes have always been a good tory family but it has been a cipher of late years this young fellow coming back with a fortune to give the family a head and a position is a clear gain to the county and with philip he'll get into the right hands of course he wants guiding having been out of the country so long all we have to ask is whether a man's a tory and will make a stand for the good of the country that's the plain english of the matter and i do beg of you my dear to set aside all these gossiping niceties and exert yourself like a woman of sense and spirit as you are to bring the right people together here sir maximus gave a deep cough took out his snuff box and tapped it he had made a serious marital speech an exertion to which he was rarely urged by anything smaller than a matter of conscience and this outline of the whole duty of a tory was a matter of conscience with him though the duffield watchman had pointed expressly to sir maximus debarry amongst others in branding the co operation of the tories as a conscious selfishness and reckless immorality which however would be defeated by the co operation of all the friends of truth and liberty who the watchman trusted would subordinate all non political differences in order to return representatives pledged to support the present government i am sure sir maximus lady debarry answered you could not have observed that anything was wanting in my manners to mrs transome no no my dear but i say this by way of caution never mind what was done at smyrna or whether transome likes to sit with his heels tucked up we may surely wink at a few things for the sake of the public interest if god almighty does and if he didn't i don't know what would have become of the country government could never have been carried on and many a good battle would have been lost that's the philosophy of the matter and common sense too good sir maximus gave a deep cough and tapped his box again inwardly remarking that if he had not been such a lazy fellow he might have made as good a figure as his son philip but at this point the carriage which was rolling by a turn toward treby magna passed a well dressed man who raised his hat to sir maximus and called to the coachman to stop excuse me sir maximus said this personage standing uncovered at the carriage door but i have just learned something of importance at treby which i thought you would like to know as soon as possible ah what's that something about garstin or clement said sir maximus seeing the other draw a poster from his pocket no rather worse i fear you will think a new radical candidate i got this by a stratagem from the printer's boy they're not posted yet a radical said sir maximus in a tone of incredulous disgust as he took the folded bill what fool is he he'll have no chance they say he's richer than garstin harold transome shouted sir maximus as he read the name in three inch letters i don't believe it it's a trick it's a squib why why we've just been to his place eh do you know any more speak sir speak don't deal out your story like a damned mountebank who wants to keep people gaping sir maximus pray don't give way so said lady debarry i'm afraid there's no doubt about it sir said christian after getting the bill i met mr labron's clerk and he said he had just had the whole story from jermyn's clerk the ram inn is engaged already and a committee is being made up he says jermyn goes like a steam engine when he has a mind although he makes such long winded speeches jermyn be hanged for a two faced rascal tell mitchell to drive on it's of no use to stay chattering here jump up on the box and go home with us i may want you you see i was right sir maximus said the baronet's wife i had an instinct that we should find him an unpleasant person fudge if you had such a fine instinct why did you let us go to transome court and make fools of ourselves would you have listened to me but of course you will not have him to dine with you dine with me i should think not i'd sooner he should dine off me i see how it is clearly enough he has become a regular beast among those mahometans he's got neither religion nor morals left he can't know any thing about english politics he'll go and cut his own nose off as a landholder and never know however he won't get in he'll spend his money for nothing i fear he is a very licentious man said lady debarry we know now why his mother seemed so uneasy i should think she reflects a little poor creature it's a confounded nuisance we didn't meet christian on our way instead of coming back but better now than later he's an uncommonly adroit useful fellow that factotum of philip's i wish phil would take my man and give me christian i'd make him house steward he might reduce the accounts a little perhaps sir maximus would not have been so sanguine as to mr christian's economical virtues if he had seen that gentleman relaxing himself the same evening among the other distinguished dependents of the family and frequenters of the steward's room but a man of sir maximus's rank is like those antediluvian animals whom the system of things condemned to carry such a huge bulk that they really could not inspect their bodily appurtenance and had no conception of their own tails their parasites doubtless had a merry time of it and often did extremely well when the high bred saurian himself was ill at ease treby manor measured from the front saloon to the remotest shed was as large as a moderate sized village and there were certainly more lights burning in it every evening more wine spirits and ale drunk more waste and more folly than could be found in some large villages there was fast revelry in the steward's room and slow revelry in the scotch bailiff's room short whist costume and flirtation in the housekeeper's room and the same at a lower price in the servants' hall a select olympian feast in the private apartment of the cook who was a much grander person than her ladyship and wore gold and jewelry to a vast amount of suet a gambling group in the stables and the coachman perhaps the most innocent member of the establishment tippling in majestic solitude by a fire in the harness room for sir maximus as every one said was a gentleman of the right sort condescended to no mean enquiries greeted his head servants with a good evening gentlemen when he met them in the park and only snarled in a subdued way when he looked over the accounts willing to endure some personal inconvenience in order to keep up the institutions of the country to maintain his hereditary establishment and do his duty in that station of life the station of the long tailed saurian to which it had pleased providence to call him the focus of brilliancy at treby manor that evening was in no way the dining room where sir maximus sipped his port under some mental depression as he discussed with his brother the reverend augustus the sad fact that one of the oldest names in the county was to be on the wrong side not in the drawing room where miss debarry and miss selina quietly elegant in their dress and manners were feeling rather dull than otherwise having finished mr bulwer's eugene aram and being thrown back on the last great prose work of mr southey while their mamma slumbered a little on the sofa no the centre of eager talk and enjoyment was the steward's room where mr scales house steward and head butler a man most solicitous about his boots wristbands the roll of his whiskers and other attributes of a gentleman distributed cigars cognac and whiskey to various colleagues and guests who were discussing with that freedom of conjecture which is one of our inalienable privileges as britons the probable amount of harold transome's fortune concerning which fame had already been busy long enough to have acquired vast magnifying power the chief part in this scene was undoubtedly mr christian's although he had hitherto been comparatively silent but he occupied two chairs with so much grace throwing his right leg over the seat of the second and resting his right hand on the back he held his cigar and displayed a splendid seal ring with such becoming nonchalance and had his gray hair arranged with so much taste that experienced eyes would at once have seen even the great scales himself to be but a secondary character why said mr crowder an old respectable tenant though much in arrear as to his rent who condescended frequently to drink in the steward's room for the sake of the conversation why i suppose they get money so fast in the east it's wonderful why he went on with a hesitating look toward mr scales this transome p'r'aps got a matter of a hundred thousand a hundred thousand my dear sir fiddle stick's end of a hundred thousand said mr scales with a contempt very painful to be borne by a modest man well said mr crowder giving way under torture as the all knowing butler puffed and stared at him perhaps not so much as that not so much sir i tell you that a hundred thousand pounds is a bagatelle well i know it's a big sum said mr crowder deprecatingly here there was a general laugh all the other intellects present were more cultivated than mr crowder's bagatelle is the french for trifle my friend said mr christian don't talk over people's heads so scales i shall have hard work to understand you myself soon come that's a good one said the head gardener who was a ready admirer i should like to hear the thing you don't understand christian he's a first rate hand at sneering said mr scales rather nettled don't be waspie man i'll ring the bell for lemons and make some punch that's the thing for putting people up to the unknown tongues said mr christian starting up and slapping scales's shoulder as he passed him what i mean mr crowder is this here mr scales paused to puff and pull down his waistcoat in a gentlemanly manner and drink he was wont in this way to give his hearers time for meditation come then speak english i'm not against being taught said the reasonable crowder what i mean is that in a large way of trade a man turns his capital over almost as soon as he can turn himself bless your soul i know something about these matters eh brent to be sure you do few men more said the gardener who was the person appealed to not that i've had anything to do with commercial families myself i've those feelings that i look to other things besides lucre but i can't say that i've not been intimate with parties who have been less nice than i am myself and knowing what i know i shouldn't wonder if transome had as much as five hundred thousand bless your soul sir people who get their money out of land are as long scraping five pounds together as your trading men are in turning five pounds into a hundred that's a wicked thing though said mr crowder meditatively however he went on retreating from this difficult ground trade or no trade the transomes have been poor enough this many a long year i've a brother a tenant on their estate i ought to know a little bit about that they've kept up no establishment at all said mr scales with disgust they've even let their kitchen gardens i suppose it was the son's gambling i've seen something of that a man who has always lived in first rate families is likely to know a thing or two on that subject ah but it wasn't gambling did the first mischief said mr crowder with a slight smile feeling that it was his turn to have some superiority new comers don't know what happened in this country twenty and thirty years ago i'm turned fifty myself and my father lived under sir maximus's father but if anybody from london can tell me more than i know about this country side i'm willing to listen what was it then if it wasn't gambling said mr scales with some impatience i don't pretend to know it was law law that's what it was not but what the transomes always won and always lost said the too ready scales yes yes i think we all know the nature of law there was the last suit of all made the most noise as i understood continued mr crowder but it wasn't tried hereabout they said there was a deal o' false swearing some young man pretended to be the true heir let me see i can't justly remember the names he'd got two he swore he was one man and they swore he was another however lawyer jermyn won it they say he'd win a game against the old one himself and the young fellow turned out to be a scamp stop a bit his name was scaddon henry scaddon mr christian here let a lemon slip from his hand into the punch bowl with a splash which sent some of the nectar into the company's faces hallo what a bungler i am he said looking as if he were quite jarred by this unusual awkwardness of his go on with your tale mr crowder a scamp named henry scaddon well that's the tale said mr crowder he was never seen nothing of anymore it was a deal talked of at the time and i've sat by and my father used to shake his head and always when this mrs transome was talked of he used to shake his head and say she carried things with a high hand once but lord it was before the battle of waterloo and i'm a poor hand at tales i don't see much good in 'em myself but if anybody'll tell me a cure for the sheep rot i'll thank him here mr crowder relapsed into smoking and silence a little discomfited that the knowledge of which he had been delivered had turned out rather a shapeless and insignificant birth well well bygones should be bygones there are secrets in most good families said mr scales winking and this young transome coming back with a fortune to keep up the establishment and have things done in a decent and gentlemanly way it would all have been right if he'd not been this sort of radical madman but now he's done for himself i heard sir maximus say at dinner that he would be excommunicated and that's a pretty strong word i take it what does it mean scales said mr christian who loved tormenting ay what's the meaning insisted mr crowder encouraged by finding that even christian was in the dark well it's a law term speaking in a figurative sort of way meaning that a radical was no gentleman perhaps it's partly accounted for by his getting his money so fast and in foreign countries said mr crowder tentatively it's reasonable to think he'd be against the land and this country eh sircome sircome was an eminent miller who had considerable business transactions at the manor and appreciated mr scales's merits at a handsome percentage on the yearly account he was a highly honorable tradesman but in this and in other matters submitted to the institutions of his country for great houses as he observed must have great butlers he replied to his friend crowder sententiously i say nothing before i bring words to market i should like to see 'em a bit scarcer there's the land and there's trade i hold with both i swim with the stream hey day mr sircome that's a radical maxim said mr christian who knew that mr sircome's last sentence was his favorite formula i advise you to give it up else it will injure the quality of your flour a radical maxim said mr sircome in a tone of angry astonishment i should like to hear you prove that it's as old as my grandfather anyhow i'll prove it in one minute said the glib christian reform has set in by the will of the majority that's the rabble you know and the respectability and good sense of the country which are in the minority are afraid of reform running on too fast so the stream must be running toward reform and radicalism and if you swim with it mr sircome you're a reformer and a radical and your flour is objectionable and not full weight and being tried by scales will be found wanting there was a roar of laughter this pun upon scales was highly appreciated by every one except the miller and butler the latter pulled down his waistcoat and puffed and stared in rather an excited manner mr christian's wit in general seemed to him a poor kind of quibbling what a fellow you are for fence christian said the gardener hang me if i don't think you're up to everything that's a compliment you might pay old nick if you come to that said mr sircome who was in the painful position of a man deprived of his formula yes yes said mr scales i'm no fool myself and could parry a thrust if i liked but i shouldn't like it to be said of me that i was up to everything i'll keep a little principle if you please to be sure said christian ladling out the punch what would justice be without scales the laughter was not quite so full throated as before such excessive cleverness was a little satanic a joke's a joke among gentlemen said the butler getting exasperated i think there has been quite liberties enough taken with my name but if you must talk about names i've heard of a party before now calling himself a christian and being anything but it come that's beyond a joke said the surgeon's assistant a fast man whose chief scene of dissipation was the manor let it drop scales yes i dare say it's beyond a joke i'm not a harlequin to talk nothing but jokes i leave that to other christians who are up to everything and have been everywhere to the hulks for what i know and more than that they come from nobody knows where and try to worm themselves into gentlemen's confidence to the prejudice of their betters there was a stricter sequence in mr scales's angry eloquence than was apparent some chief links being confined to his own breast as is often the case in energetic discourse the company were in a state of expectation there was something behind worth knowing and something before them worth seeing in the general decay of other fine british pugnacious sports a quarrel between gentlemen was all the more exciting and though no one would himself have liked to turn on scales no one was sorry for the chance of seeing him put down but the amazing christian was unmoved he had taken out his handkerchief and was rubbing his lips carefully after a slight pause he spoke with perfect coolness i don't intend to quarrel with you scales such talk as this is not profitable to either of us it makes you purple in the face you are apoplectic you know and it spoils good company better tell a few fibs about me behind my back it will heat you less and do me more harm i'll leave you to it i shall go and have a game of whist with the ladies as the door closed behind the questionable christian mr scales was in a state of frustration that prevented speech every one was rather embarrassed that's an uncommon sort o' fellow said mr crowder in an undertone to his next neighbor the gardener why mr philip picked him up in foreign parts didn't he he was a courier said the gardener he's had a deal of experience and i believe by what i can make out for he's been pretty free with me sometimes there was a time when he was in that rank of life that he fought a duel ah that makes him such a cool chap said mr crowder he's what i call an overbearing fellow said mr sircome also sotto voce to his next neighbor mr filmore the surgeon's assistant he runs you down with a sort of talk that's neither here nor there he's got a deal too many samples in his pocket for me all i know is he's a wonderful hand at cards said mr filmore whose whiskers and shirt pin were quite above the average i wish i could play cart as he does it's beautiful to see him he can make a man look pretty blue he'll empty his pocket for him in no time that's none to his credit said mr sircome the conversation had in this way broken up into tte tte and the hilarity of the evening might be considered a failure still the punch was drunk the accounts were duly swelled and notwithstanding the innovating spirit of the time sir maximus debarry's establishment was kept up in sound hereditary british manner chapter viii rumor doth double like the voice and echo shakespeare the mind of a man is as a country which was once open to squatters who have bred and multiplied and become masters of the land but then happeneth a time when new and hungry comers dispute the land and there is trial of strength and the stronger wins nevertheless the first squatters be they who have prepared the ground and the crops to the end will be sequent though chiefly on the nature of the soil as of light sand mixed loam or heavy clay yet somewhat on the primal labor and sowing that talkative maiden rumor though in the interest of art she is figured as a youthful winged beauty with flowing garments soaring above the heads of men and breathing world thrilling news through a gracefully curved trumpet is in fact a very old maid who puckers her silly face by the fireside and really does no more than chirp a wrong guess or a lame story into the ear of a fellow gossip all the rest of the work attributed to her is done by the ordinary working of those passions against which men pray in the litany with the help of a plentiful stupidity against which we have never yet had any authorized form of prayer when mr scales's strong need to make an impressive figure in conversation together with his very slight need of any other premise than his own sense of his wide general knowledge and probable infallibility led him to specify five hundred thousand as the lowest admissible amount of harold transome's commercially acquired fortune it was not fair to put this down to poor old miss rumor who had only told scales that the fortune was considerable and again when the curt mr sircome found occasion at treby to mention the five hundred thousand as a fact that folks seemed pretty sure about this expansion of the butler into folks was entirely due to mr sircome's habitual preference for words which could not be laid hold of or give people a handle over him it was in this simple way that the report of harold transome's fortune spread and was magnified adding much lustre to his opinion in the eyes of liberals and compelling even men of the opposite party to admit that it increased his eligibility as a member for north loamshire it was observed by a sound thinker in these parts that property was ballast and when once the aptness of that metaphor had been perceived it followed that a man was not fit to navigate the sea of politics without a great deal of such ballast and that rightly understood whatever increased the expense of election inasmuch as it virtually raised the property qualification was an unspeakable boon to the country meanwhile the fortune that was getting larger in the imagination of constituents was shrinking a little in the imagination of its owner it was hardly more than a hundred and fifty thousand and there were not only the heavy mortgages to be paid off but also a large amount of capital was needed in order to repair the farm buildings all over the estate to carry out extensive drainage and make allowances to in coming tenants which might remove the difficulties of newly letting the farms in a time of agricultural depression the farms actually tenanted were held by men who had begged hard to succeed their fathers in getting a little poorer every year on land which was also getting poorer where the highest rate of increase was in the arrears of rent and where the master in crushed hat and corduroys looked pitiably lean and care worn by the side of pauper laborers who showed that superior assimilating power often observed to attend nourishment by the public money mr goffe of rabbit's end had never had it explained to him that according to the true theory of rent land must inevitably be given up when it would not yield a profit equal to the ordinary rate of interest so that from want of knowing what was inevitable and not from a titanic spirit of opposition he kept on his land he often said to himself with a melancholy wipe of his sleeve across his brow that he didn't know which a way to turn and he would have been still more at a loss on the subject if he had quitted rabbit's end with a wagonful of furniture and utensils a file of receipts a wife with five children and a shepherd dog in low spirits it took no long time for harold transome to discover this state of things and to see moreover that except on the demesne immediately around the house the timber had been mismanaged the woods had been recklessly thinned and there had been insufficient planting he had not yet thoroughly investigated the various accounts kept by his mother by jermyn and by banks the bailiff but what had been done with the large sums which had been received for timber was a suspicious mystery to him he observed that the farm held by jermyn was in first rate order that a good deal had been spent on the buildings and that the rent had stood unpaid mrs transome had taken an opportunity of saying that jermyn had had some of the mortgage deeds transferred to him and that his rent was set against so much interest harold had only said in his careless yet decisive way oh jermyn be hanged it seems to me if durfey hadn't died and made room for me jermyn would have ended by coming to live here and you would have had to keep the lodge and open the gate for his carriage but i shall pay him off mortgages and all by and by i'll owe him nothing not even a curse mrs transome said no more harold did not care to enter fully into the subject with his mother the fact that she had been active in the management of the estate had ridden about it continually had busied herself with accounts had been head bailiff of the vacant farms and had yet allowed things to go wrong was set down by him simply to the general futility of women's attempts to transact men's business he did not want to say anything to annoy her he was only determined to let her understand as quietly as possible that she had better cease all interference mrs transome did understand this and it was very little that she dared to say on business though there was a fierce struggle of her anger and pride with a dread which was nevertheless supreme as to the old tenants she only observed on hearing harold burst forth about their wretched condition that with the estate so burdened the yearly loss by arrears could better be borne than the outlay and sacrifice necessary in order to let the farms anew i was really capable of calculating harold she ended with a touch of bitterness it seems easy to deal with farmers and their affairs when you only see them in print i dare say but it's not quite so easy when you live among them you have only to look at sir maximus's estate you will see plenty of the same thing the times have been dreadful and old families like to keep their old tenants but i dare say that is toryism it's a hash of odds and ends if that is toryism my dear mother however i wish you had kept three more old tenants for then i should have had three more fifty pound voters and in a hard run one may be beaten by a head but harold added smiling and handing her a ball of worsted which had fallen a woman ought to be a tory and graceful and handsome like you i should hate a woman who took up my opinions and talked for me i'm an oriental you know i say mother shall we have this room furnished with rose color i notice that it suits your bright gray hair harold thought it was only natural that his mother should have been in a sort of subjection to jermyn throughout the awkward circumstances of the family it was the way of women and all weak minds to think that what they had been used to was unalterable and any quarrel with a man who managed private affairs was necessarily a formidable thing he himself was proceeding very cautiously and preferred not even to know too much just at present lest a certain personal antipathy he was conscious of toward jermyn and an occasional liability to exasperation should get the better of a calm and clear sighted resolve not to quarrel with the man while he could be of use harold would have been disgusted with himself if he had helped to frustrate his own purpose and his strongest purpose now was to get returned for parliament to make a figure there as a liberal member and to become on all grounds a personage of weight in north loamshire how howard transome came to be a liberal in opposition to all the traditions of his family was a more subtle enquiry than he had ever cared to follow out the newspapers undertook to explain it the north loamshire herald witnessed with a grief and disgust certain to be shared by all persons who were actuated by wholesome british feeling an example of defection in the inheritor of a family name which in times past had been associated with attachment to right principle and with the maintenance of our constitution in church and state and pointed to it as an additional proof that men who had passed any large portion of their lives beyond the limits of our favored country usually contracted not only a laxity of feeling toward protestantism nay toward religion itself a latitudinarian spirit hardly distinguishable from atheism but also a levity of disposition inducing them to tamper with those institutions by which alone great britain had risen to her pre eminence among the nations such men infected with outlandish habits intoxicated with vanity grasping at momentary power by flattery of the multitude fearless because godless liberal because un english were ready to pull one stone from under another in the national edifice till the great structure tottered to its fall on the other hand the duffield watchman saw in this signal instance of self liberation from the trammels of prejudice a decisive guarantee of intellectual pre eminence united with a generous sensibility to the claims of man as man which had burst asunder and cast off by a spontaneous exertion of energy the cramping out worn shell of hereditary bias and class interest but these large minded guides of public opinion argued from wider data than could be furnished by any knowledge of the particular case concerned harold transome was neither the dissolute cosmopolitan so vigorously sketched by the tory herald nor the intellectual giant and moral lobster suggested by the liberal imagination of the watchman twenty years ago he had been a bright active good tempered lad with sharp eyes and a good aim he delighted in success and in predominance but he did not long for an impossible predominance and become sour and sulky because it was impossible he played at the games he was clever in and usually won all other games he let alone and thought them of little worth at home and at eton he had been side by side with his stupid elder brother durfey whom he despised and he very early began to reflect that since this caliban in miniature was older than himself he must carve out his own fortune that was a nuisance and on the whole the world seemed rather ill arranged at eton especially where there were many reasons why harold made no great figure he was not sorry the money was wanting to send him to oxford he did not see the good of oxford he had been surrounded by many things during his short life of which he had distinctly said to himself that he did not see the good and he was not disposed to venerate on the strength of any good that others saw he turned his back on home very cheerfully though he was rather fond of his mother and very fond of transome court and the river where he had been used to fish but he said to himself as he passed the lodge gates i'll get rich somehow and have an estate of my own and do what i like with it this determined aiming at something not easy but clearly possible marked the direction in which harold's nature was strong he had the energetic will and muscle the self confidence the quick perception and the narrow imagination which make what is admiringly called the practical mind since then his character had been ripened by a various experience and also by much knowledge which he had set himself deliberately to gain but the man was no more than the boy writ large with an extensive commentary the years had nourished an inclination to as much opposition as would enable him to assert his own independence and power without throwing himself into that tabooed condition which robs power of its triumph and this inclination had helped his shrewdness in forming judgments which were at once innovating and moderate he was addicted at once to rebellion and to conformity and only an intimate personal knowledge could enable any one to predict where his conformity would begin the limit was not defined by theory but was drawn in an irregular zigzag by early disposition and association and his resolution of which he had never lost hold to be a thorough englishman again some day had kept up the habit of considering all his conclusions with reference to english politics and english social conditions he meant to stand up for every change that the economical condition of the country required and he had an angry contempt for men with coronets on their coaches but too small a share of brains to see when they had better make a virtue of necessity his respect was rather for men who had no coronets but who achieved a just influence by furthering all measures which the common sense of the country and the increasing self assertion of the majority peremptorily demanded he could be such a man himself in fact harold transome was a clever frank good natured egoist not stringently consistent but without any disposition to falsity but with a pride that was moulded in an individual rather than an hereditary form unspeculative unsentimental unsympathetic fond of sensual pleasures but disinclined to all vice and attached as a healthy clear sighted person to all conventional morality construed with a certain freedom like doctrinal articles to which the public order may require subscription a character is apt to look but indifferently written out in this way reduced to a map our premises seem insignificant but they make nevertheless a very pretty freehold to live in and walk over and so if harold transome had been among your acquaintances and you had observed his qualities through the medium of his agreeable person bright smile and a certain easy charm which accompanies sensuousness when unsullied by coarseness through the medium also of the many opportunities in which he would have made himself useful or pleasant to you you would have thought him a good fellow highly acceptable as a guest a colleague or a brother in law whether all mothers would have liked him as a son is another question it is a fact perhaps kept a little too much in the background that mothers have a self larger than their maternity and that when their sons have become taller than themselves and are gone from them to college or into the world there are wide spaces of their time which are not filled with praying for their boys reading old letters and envying yet blessing those who are attending to their shirt buttons mrs transome was certainly not one of those bland adoring and gently tearful women after sharing the common dream that when a beautiful man child was born to her her cup of happiness would be full she had travelled through long years apart from that child to find herself at last in the presence of a son of whom she was afraid who was utterly unmanageable by her and to whose sentiments in any given case she possessed no key yet harold was a kind son he kissed his mother's brow offered her his arm let her choose what she liked for the house and garden asked her whether she would have bays or grays for her new carriage and was bent on seeing her make as good a figure in the neighborhood as any other woman of her rank she trembled under this kindness it was not enough to satisfy her still if it should ever cease and give place to something else she was too uncertain about harold's feelings to imagine clearly what that something would be the finest threads such as no eye sees if bound cunningly about the sensitive flesh so that the movement to break them would bring torture may make a worse bondage than any fetters mrs transome felt the fatal thread about her and the bitterness of this helpless bondage mingled itself with the new elegancies of the dining and drawing rooms and all the household changes which harold had ordered to be brought about with magical quickness nothing was as she had once expected it would be if harold had shown the least care to have her stay in the room with him if he had really cared for her opinion if he had been what she had dreamed he would be in the eyes of those people who had made her world if all the past could be dissolved and leave no solid trace of itself mighty ifs that were all impossible she would have tasted some joy but now she began to look back with regret to the days when she sat in loneliness among the old drapery and still longed for something that might happen yet save in a bitter little speech or in a deep sigh heard by no one besides denner she kept all these things hidden in her heart and went out in the autumn sunshine to overlook the alterations in the pleasure grounds very much as a happy woman might have done one day however when she was occupied in this way an occasion came on which she chose to express indirectly a part of her inward care she was standing on the broad gravel in the afternoon the long shadows lay on the grass the light seemed the more glorious because of the reddened and golden trees the gardeners were busy at their pleasant work the newly turned soil gave out an agreeable fragrance and little harry was playing with nimrod round old mr transome who sat placidly on a low garden chair the scene would have made a charming picture of english domestic life and the handsome majestic gray haired woman obviously grandmamma would have been especially admired but the artist would have felt it requisite to turn her face toward her husband and little grandson and to have given her an elderly amiability of expression which would have divided remark with his exquisite rendering of her indian shawl mrs transome's face was turned the other way and for this reason she only heard an approaching step and did not see whose it was yet it startled her it was not quick enough to be her son's step and besides harold was away at duffield it was mr jermyn's chapter ix a woman naturally born to fears king john methinks some unborn sorrow ripe in fortune's womb is coming toward me and my inward soul with nothing trembles king richard ii matthew jermyn approached mrs transome taking off his hat and smiling she did not smile but said you knew harold was not at home yes i came to see you to know if you had any wishes that i could further since i have not had an opportunity of consulting you since he came home let us walk toward the rookery then they turned together mr jermyn still keeping his hat off and holding it behind him the air was so soft and agreeable that mrs transome had nothing but a large veil over her head they walked for a little while in silence till they were out of sight under tall trees and treading noiselessly on falling leaves what jermyn was really most anxious about was to learn from mrs transome whether anything had transpired that was significant of harold's disposition toward him which he suspected to be very far from friendly jermyn was not naturally flinty hearted at five and twenty he had written verses and had got himself wet through in order not to disappoint a dark eyed woman whom he was proud to believe in love with him but a family man with grown up sons and daughters a man with a professional position and complicated affairs that make it hard to ascertain the exact relation between property and liabilities necessarily thinks of himself and what may be impending harold is remarkably acute and clever he began at last since mrs transome did not speak if he gets into parliament i have no doubt he will distinguish himself he has a quick eye for business of all kinds that is no comfort to me said mrs transome to day she was more conscious than usual of that bitterness which was always in her mind in jermyn's presence but which was carefully suppressed suppressed because she could not endure that the degradation she inwardly felt should ever become visible or audible in acts or words of her own should ever be reflected in any word or look of his for years there had been a deep silence about the past between them on her side because she remembered on his because he more and more forgot i trust he is not unkind to you in any way i know his opinions pain you but i trust you find him in everything else disposed to be a good son oh to be sure good as men are disposed to be to women giving them cushions and carriages and recommending them to enjoy themselves and then expecting them to be contented under contempt and neglect i have no power over him remember that none jermyn turned to look in mrs transome's face it was long since he had heard her speak to him as if she were losing her self command has he shown any unpleasant feeling about your management of affairs my management mrs transome said with concentrated rage flashing a fierce look at jermyn she checked herself she felt as if she were lighting a torch to flare on her own past folly and misery it was a resolve which had become a habit that she would never quarrel with this man never tell him what she saw him to be she had kept her woman's pride and sensibility intact through all her life there had vibrated the maiden need to have her hand kissed and be the object of chivalry and so she sank into silence again trembling jermyn felt annoyed nothing more there was nothing in his mind corresponding to the intricate meshes of sensitiveness in mrs transome's he was anything but stupid yet he always blundered when he wanted to be delicate or magnanimous he constantly sought to soothe others by praising himself moral vulgarity cleaved to him like an hereditary odor he blundered now my dear mrs transome he said in a tone of bland kindness you are agitated you appear angry with me yet i think if you consider you will see that you have nothing to complain of in me unless you will complain of the inevitable course of man's life i have always met your wishes both in happy circumstances and in unhappy ones i should be ready to do so now if it were possible every sentence was as pleasant to her as if it had been cut in her bared arm some men's kindness and love making are more exasperating more humiliating than others' derision but the pitiable woman who has once made herself secretly dependent on a man who is beneath her in feeling must bear that humiliation for fear of worse coarse kindness is at least better than coarse anger and in all private quarrels the duller nature is triumphant by reason of its dullness mrs transome knew in her inmost soul that those relations which had sealed her lips on jermyn's conduct in business matters had been with him a ground for presuming that he should have impunity in any lax dealing into which circumstances had led him she knew that she herself had endured all the more privation because of his dishonest selfishness and now harold's long deferred heirship and his return with startlingly unexpected penetration activity and assertion of mastery had placed them both in the full presence of a difficulty which had been prepared by the years of vague uncertainty as to issues in this position with a great dread hanging over her which jermyn knew and ought to have felt that he had caused her she was inclined to lash him with indignation to scorch him with the words that were just the fit names for his doings inclined all the more when he spoke with an insolent blandness ignoring all that was truly in her heart but no sooner did the words you have brought it on me rise within her than she heard within also the retort you brought it on yourself not for all the world beside could she bear to hear that retort uttered from without what did she do with strange sequence to all that rapid tumult after a few moments' silence she said let me take your arm he gave it immediately putting on his hat and wondering for more than twenty years mrs transome had never chosen to take his arm i have but one thing to ask make me a promise what is it that you will never quarrel with harold you must know that it is my wish not to quarrel with him but make a vow fix it in your mind as a thing not to be done bear anything from him rather than quarrel with him a man can't make a vow not to quarrel said jermyn who was already a little irritated by the implication that harold might be disposed to use him roughly a man's temper may get the better of him at any moment i am not prepared to bear anything good god said mrs transome taking her hand from his arm is it possible you don't feel how horrible it would be as she took away her hand jermyn let his arm fall put both his hands in his pockets and shrugging his shoulders said i shall use him as he uses me jermyn had turned round his savage side and the blandness was out of sight it was this that had always frightened mrs transome there was a possibility of fierce insolence in this man who was to pass with those nearest to her as her indebted servant but whose brand she secretly bore she was as powerless with him as she was with her own son this woman who loved rule dared not speak another word of attempted persuasion they were both silent taking the nearest way into the sunshine again there was a half formed wish in both their minds even in the mother's that harold transome had never been born we are working hard for the election said jermyn recovering himself as they turned into the sunshine again i think we shall get him returned and in that case he will be in high good humor everything will be more propitious than you are apt to think you must persuade yourself he added smiling at her that it is better for a man of his position to be in parliament on the wrong side than not to be in at all never said mrs transome i am too old to learn to call bitter sweet and sweet bitter but what i may think or feel is of no consequence now i am as unnecessary as a chimney ornament and in this way they parted on the gravel in that pretty scene where they had met mrs transome shivered as she stood alone all around her where there had once been brightness and warmth there were white ashes and the sunshine looked dreary as it fell on them mr jermyn's heaviest reflections in riding homeward turned on the possibility of incidents between himself and harold transome which would have disagreeable results requiring him to raise money and perhaps causing scandal which in its way might also help to create a monetary deficit a man of sixty with a wife whose duffield connections were of the highest respectability with a family of tall daughters an expensive establishment and a large professional business owed a great deal more to himself as the mainstay of all those solidities than to feelings and ideas which were quite unsubstantial there were many unfortunate coincidences which placed mr jermyn in an uncomfortable position just now he had not been much to blame he considered if it had not been for a sudden turn of affairs no one would have complained he defied any man to say that he had intended to wrong people he was able to refund to make reprisals if they could be fairly demanded only he would certainly have preferred that they should not be demanded a german poet was entrusted with a particularly fine sausage which he was to convey to the donor's friend at paris in the course of a long journey he smelled the sausage he got hungry and desired to taste it he pared a morsel off then another and another in successive moments of temptation till at last the sausage was humanly speaking at an end the offence had not been premeditated the poet had never loved meanness but he loved sausage and the result was undeniably awkward so it was with matthew jermyn he was far from liking that ugly abstraction rascality but he had liked other things which had suggested nibbling he had to do many things in law and in daily life which in the abstract he would have condemned and indeed he had never been tempted by them in the abstract here in fact was the inconvenience he had sinned for the sake of particular concrete things and particular concrete consequences were likely to follow but he was a man of resolution who having made out what was the best course to take under a difficulty went straight to his work the election must be won that would put harold in good humor give him something to do and leave himself more time to prepare for any crisis he was in anything but low spirits that evening it was his eldest daughter's birthday and the young people had a dance papa was delightful stood up for a quadrille and a country dance told stories at supper and made humorous quotations from his early readings if these were latin he apologized and translated to the ladies so that a deaf lady visitor from duffield kept her trumpet up continually lest she should lose any of mr jermyn's conversation and wished that her niece maria had been present who was young and had a good memory still the party was smaller than usual for some families in treby refused to visit jermyn now that he was concerned for a radical candidate chapter x he made love neither with roses nor with apples nor with locks of hair theocritus one sunday afternoon felix holt rapped at the door of mr lyon's house although he could hear the voice of the minister preaching in the chapel he stood with a book under his arm apparently confident that there was someone in the house to open the door for him in fact esther never went to chapel in the afternoon that exercise made her head ache in these september weeks felix had got rather intimate with mr lyon they shared the same political sympathies and though to liberals who had neither freehold nor copyhold nor leasehold the share in a county election consisted chiefly of that prescriptive amusement of the majority known as looking on there was still something to be said on the occasion if not to be done perhaps the most delightful friendships are those in which there is much agreement much disputation and yet more personal liking and the advent of the public spirited contradictory yet affectionate felix into treby life had made a welcome epoch to the minister to talk with this young man who though hopeful had a singularity which some might at once have pronounced heresy but which mr lyon persisted in regarding as orthodoxy in the making was like a good bite to strong teeth after a too plentiful allowance of spoon meat to cultivate his society with a view to checking his erratic tendencies was a laudable purpose but perhaps if felix had been rapidly subdued and reduced to conformity little mr lyon would have found the conversation much flatter esther had not seen so much of their new acquaintance as her father had but she had begun to find him amusing and also rather irritating to her woman's love of conquest he always opposed and criticised her and besides that he looked at her as if he never saw a single detail about her person quite as if she were a middle aged woman in a cap she did not believe that he had ever admired her hands or her long neck or her graceful movements which had made all the girls at school call her calypso doubtless from their familiarity with telmaque felix ought properly to have been a little in love with her never mentioning it of course because that would have been disagreeable and his being a regular lover was out of the question but it was quite clear that instead of feeling any disadvantage on his own side he held himself to be immeasurably her superior and what was worse esther had a secret consciousness that he was her superior she was all the more vexed at the suspicion that he thought slightly of her and wished in her vexation that she could have found more fault with him that she had not been obliged to admire more and more the varying expressions of his open face and his deliciously good humored laugh always loud at a joke against himself besides she could not help having her curiosity roused by the unusual combinations both in his mind and in his outward position and she had surprised herself as well as her father one day by suddenly starting up and proposing to walk with him when he was going to pay an afternoon visit to mrs holt to try and soothe her concerning felix what a mother he has she said to herself when they came away again but rude and queer as he is i cannot say there is anything vulgar about him yet i don't know if i saw him by the side of a finished gentleman esther wished that finished gentleman were among her acquaintances he would certainly admire her and make her aware of felix's inferiority on this particular sunday afternoon when she heard the knock at the door she was seated in the kitchen corner between the fire and the window reading rn certainly in her well fitting light blue dress she almost always wore some shade of blue with her delicate sandaled slipper stretched toward the fire her little gold watch which had cost her nearly a quarter's earnings visible at her side her slender fingers playing with a shower of brown curls and a coronet of shining plaits at the summit of her head she was a remarkable cinderella when the rap came she colored and was going to shut her book and put it out of the way on the window ledge behind her but she desisted with a little toss laid it open on the table beside her and walked to the outer door which opened into the kitchen there was rather a mischievous gleam in her face the rap was not a small one it came probably from a large personage with a vigorous arm good afternoon miss lyon said felix taking off his cloth cap he resolutely declined the expensive ugliness of a hat and in a poked cap and without a cravat made a figure at which his mother cried every sunday and thought of with a slow shake of the head at several passages in the minister's prayer dear me it is you mr holt i fear you will have to wait some time before you can see my father the sermon is not ended yet and there will be the hymn and the prayer and perhaps other things to detain him well will you let me sit down in the kitchen i don't want to be a bore oh no said esther with her pretty light laugh i always give you credit for not meaning it pray come in if you don't mind waiting i was sitting in the kitchen the kettle is singing quite prettily it is much nicer than the parlor not half so ugly there i agree with you how very extraordinary but if you prefer the kitchen and don't want to sit with me i can go into the parlor i came on purpose to sit with you said felix in his blunt way but i thought it likely you might be vexed at seeing me i wanted to talk to you but i've got nothing pleasant to say as your father would have it i'm not given to prophesy smooth things to prophesy deceit i understand said esther sitting down pray be seated you thought i had no afternoon sermon so you came to give me one yes said felix seating himself sideways in a chair not far off her and leaning over the back to look at her with his large clear gray eyes and my text is something you said the other day you said you didn't mind about people having right opinions so that they had good taste now i want you to see what shallow stuff that is oh i don't doubt it if you say so i know you are a person of right opinions but by opinions you mean men's thoughts about great subjects and by taste you mean their thoughts about small ones dress behavior amusements ornaments well yes or rather their sensibilities about those things it comes to the same thing thoughts opinions knowledge are only a sensibility to facts and ideas if i understand a geometrical problem it is because i have a sensibility to the way in which lines and figures are related to each other and i want you to see that the creature who has the sensibilities that you call taste and not the sensibilities that you call opinions is simply a lower pettier sort of thing an insect that notices the shaking of the table but never notices the thunder very well i am an insect yet i notice that you are thundering at me no you are not an insect that is what exasperates me at your making a boast of littleness you have enough understanding to make it wicked that you should add one more to the women who hinder men's lives from having any nobleness in them esther colored deeply she resented this speech yet she disliked it less than many felix had addressed to her what is my horrible guilt she said rising and standing as she was wont with one foot on the fender and looking at the fire if it had been any one but felix who was near her it might have occurred to her that this attitude showed her to advantage but she had only a mortified sense that he was quite indifferent to what others praised her for why do you read this mawkish stuff on a sunday for example he said snatching up rn and running his eye over the pages why don't you always go to chapel mr holt and read howe's 'living temple' and join the church there's just the difference between us i know why i don't do those things i distinctly see that i can do something better i have other principles and should sink myself by doing what i don't recognize as the best i understand said esther as lightly as she could to conceal her bitterness i am a lower kind of being and could not so easily sink myself not by entering into your father's ideas if a woman really believes herself to be a lower kind of being she should place herself in subjection she should be ruled by the thoughts of her father or husband if not let her show her power of choosing something better you must know that your father's principles are greater and worthier than what guides your life you have no reason but idle fancy and selfish inclination for shirking his teaching and giving your soul up to trifles you are kind enough to say so but i am not aware that i have ever confided my reasons to you why what worth calling a reason could make any mortal hang over this trash idiotic immorality dressed up to look fine with a little bit of doctrine tacked to it like a hare's foot on a dish to make believe the mess is not cat's flesh look here 'est ce ma faute si je trouve partout les bornes si ce qui est fini n'a pour moi aucune valeur' yes sir distinctly your fault because you're an ass your dunce who can't do his sums always has a taste for the infinite sir do you know what a rhomboid is oh no i don't value these things with limits 'cependant j'aime la monotonie des sentimens de la vie et si j'avais encore la folie de croire au bonheur ' oh pray mr holt don't go on reading with that dreadful accent it sets one's teeth on edge esther smarting helplessly under the previous lashes was relieved by this diversion of criticism there it is said felix throwing the book on the table and getting up to walk about you are only happy when you can spy a tag or a tassel loose to turn the talk and get rid of any judgment that must carry grave action after it i think i have borne a great deal of talk without turning it not enough miss lyon not all that i came to say i want you to change of course i am a brute to say so i ought to say you are perfect another man would perhaps but i say i want you to change how am i to oblige you by joining the church no but by asking yourself whether life is not as solemn a thing as your father takes it to be in which you may be either a blessing or a curse to many you know you have never done that you don't care to be better than a bird trimming its feathers and pecking about after what pleases it you are discontented with the world because you can't get just the small things that suit your pleasure not because it's a world where myriads of men and women are ground by wrong and misery and tainted with pollution esther felt her heart swelling with mingled indignation at this liberty wounded pride at this depreciation and acute consciousness that she could not contradict what felix said he was outrageously ill bred but she felt that she should be lowering herself by telling him so and manifesting her anger in that way she would be confirming his accusation of a littleness that shrank from severe truth and besides through all her mortification there pierced a sense that this exasperation of felix against her was more complimentary than anything in his previous behavior she had self command enough to speak with her usual silvery voice pray go on mr holt relieve yourself of these burning truths i am sure they must be troublesome to carry unuttered yes they are said felix pausing and standing not far off her i can't bear to see you going the way of the foolish women who spoil men's lives men can't help loving them and so they make themselves slaves to the petty desires of petty creatures that's the way those who might do better spend their lives for nought get checked in every great effort toil with brain and limb for things that have no more to do with a manly life than tarts and confectionery that's what makes women a curse and life is stunted to suit their littleness that's why i'll never love if i can help it and if i love i'll bear it and never marry the tumult of feeling in esther's mind mortification anger the sense of a terrible power over her that felix seemed to have as his angry words vibrated through her was getting almost too much for her self control she felt her lips quivering but her pride which feared nothing so much as the betrayal of her emotion helped her to a desperate effort she pinched her own hand hard to overcome her tremor and said in a tone of scorn i ought to be very much obliged to you for giving me your confidence so freely ah now you are offended with me and disgusted with me i expected it would be so a woman doesn't like a man who tells her the truth i think you boast a little too much of your truth telling mr holt said esther flashing out at last that virtue is apt to be easy to people when they only wound others and not themselves telling the truth often means no more than taking a liberty yes i suppose i should have been taking a liberty if i had tried to drag you back by the skirt when i saw you running into a pit you should really found a sect preaching is your vocation it is a pity you should ever have an audience of only one i see i have made a fool of myself i thought you had a more generous mind that you might be kindled to a better ambition but i've set your vanity aflame nothing else i'm going good bye good bye said esther not looking at him he did not open the door immediately he seemed to be adjusting his cap and pulling it down esther longed to be able to throw a lasso round him and compel him to stay that she might say what she chose to him her very anger made this departure irritating especially as he had the last word and that a very bitter one but soon the latch was lifted and the door closed behind him she ran up to her bedroom and burst into tears poor maiden there was a strange contradiction of impulses in her mind in those first moments she could not bear that felix should not respect her yet she could not bear that he should see her bend before his denunciation she revolted against his assumption of superiority yet she felt herself in a new kind of subjection to him he was ill bred he was rude he had taken an unwarrantable liberty yet his indignant words were a tribute to her he thought she was worth more pains than the women of whom he took no notice it was excessively impertinent in him to tell her of his resolving not to love not to marry as if she cared about that as if he thought himself likely to inspire an affection that would incline any woman to marry him after such eccentric steps as he had taken had he ever for a moment imagined that she had thought of him in the light of a man who would make love to her but did he love her one little bit and was that the reason why he wanted her to change esther felt less angry at that form of freedom though she was quite sure that she did not love him and that she could never love any one who was so much of a pedagogue and master to say nothing of his oddities but he wanted her to change for the first time in her life esther felt herself seriously shaken in her self contentment she knew there was a mind to which she appeared trivial narrow selfish every word felix had said to her seemed to have burned itself into her memory she felt as if she should forevermore be haunted by self criticism and never do anything to satisfy those fancies on which she had simply piqued herself before without being dogged by inward questions her father's desire for her conversion had never moved her she saw that he adored her all the while and he never checked her unregenerate acts as if they degraded her on earth but only mourned over them as unfitting her for heaven unfitness for heaven spoken of as jerusalem and glory the prayers of a good little father whose thoughts and motives seemed to her like the life of dr doddridge which she was content to leave unread did not attack her self respect and self satisfaction but now she had been stung stung even into a new consciousness concerning her father was it true that his life was so much worthier than her own she could not change for anything felix said but she told herself he was mistaken if he supposed her incapable of generous thoughts she heard her father coming into the house she dried her tears tried to recover herself hurriedly and went down to him you want your tea father how your forehead burns she said gently kissing his brow and then putting her cool hand on it mr lyon felt a little surprise such spontaneous tenderness was not quite common with her it reminded him of her mother my sweet child he said gratefully thinking with wonder of the treasures still left in our fallen nature chapter xi truth is the precious harvest of the earth but once when harvest waved upon a land the noisome cankerworm and caterpillar locusts and all the swarming foul born broods fastened upon it with swift greedy jaws and turned the harvest into pestilence until men said what profits it to sow felix was going to sproxton that sunday afternoon he always enjoyed his walk to that outlying hamlet it took him by a short cut through a corner of sir maximus debarry's park then across a piece of common broken here and there into red ridges below dark masses of furze and for the rest of the way alongside of the canal where the sunday peacefulness that seemed to rest on the bordering meadows and pastures was hardly broken if a horse pulled into sight along the towing path and a boat with a little curl of blue smoke issuing from its tin chimney came slowly gliding behind felix retained something of his boyish impression that the days in a canal boat were all like sundays but the horse if it had been put to him would probably have preferred a more judaic or scotch rigor with regard to canal boats or at least that the sunday towing should be done by asses as a lower order this canal was only a branch of the grand trunk and ended among the coal pits where felix crossing a network of black tram roads soon came to his destination that public institute of sproxton known to its frequenters chiefly as chubb's but less familiarly as the sugar loaf or the new pits this last being the name for the more modern and lively nucleus of the sproxton hamlet the other nucleus known as the old pits also supported its public but it had something of the forlorn air of an abandoned capital and the company at the blue cow was of an inferior kind equal of course in the fundamental attributes of humanity such as desire for beer but not equal in ability to pay for it when felix arrived the great chubb was standing at the door mr chubb was a remarkable publican none of your stock bonifaces red bloated jolly and joking he was thin and sallow and was never as his constant guests observed seen to be the worse or the better for liquor indeed as among soldiers an eminent general was held to have a charmed life chubb was held by the members of the benefit club to have a charmed sobriety a vigilance over his own interest that resisted all narcotics his very dreams as stated by himself had a method in them beyond the waking thoughts of other men pharaoh's dream he observed was nothing to them and as lying so much out of ordinary experience they were held particularly suitable for narration on sunday evenings when the listening colliers well washed and in their best coats shook their heads with a sense of peculiar edification which belongs to the inexplicable mr chubb's reasons for becoming landlord of the sugar loaf were founded on the severest calculation having an active mind and being averse to bodily labor he had thoroughly considered what calling would yield him the best livelihood with the least possible exertion and in that sort of line he had seen that a public amongst miners who earned high wages was a fine opening he had prospered according to the merits of such judicious calculation was already a forty shilling freeholder and was conscious of a vote for the county he was not one of those mean spirited men who found the franchise embarrassing and would rather have been without it he regarded his vote as part of his investment and meant to make the best of it he called himself a straight forward man and at suitable moments expressed his views freely in fact he was known to have one fundamental division for all opinion my idee and humbug when felix approached mr chubb was standing as usual with his hands nervously busy in his pockets his eyes glancing around with a detective expression at the black landscape and his lipless mouth compressed yet in constant movement on a superficial view it might be supposed that so eager seeming a personality was unsuited to the publican's business but in fact it was a great provocative to drinking like the shrill biting talk of a vixenish wife it would have compelled you to take a little something by way of dulling your sensibility hitherto notwithstanding felix drank so little ale the publican treated him with high civility the coming election was a great opportunity for applying his political idee which was that society existed for the sake of the individual and that the name of that individual was chubb now for a conjunction of absurd circumstances inconsistent with that idea it happened that sproxton hereto had been somewhat neglected in the canvass the head member of the company that worked the mines was mr peter garstin and the same company received the rent from the sugar loaf hence as the person who had the most power of annoying mr chubb and being of detriment to him mr garstin was naturally the candidate for whom he had reserved his vote but where there is this intention of ultimately gratifying a gentleman by voting for him in an open british manner on the day of the poll a man whether publican or pharisee mr chubb used this generic classification of mankind as one that was sanctioned by scripture is all the freer in his relation with those deluded persons who take him for what he is not and imagine him to be a waverer but for some time opportunity had seemed barren there were but three dubious votes besides mr chubb's in the small district of which the sugar loaf could be regarded as the centre of intelligence and inspiration the colliers of course had no votes and did not need political conversion consequently the interests of sproxton had only been tacitly cherished in the breasts of candidates but ever since it had been known that a radical candidate was in the field that in consequence of this mr debarry had coalesced with mr garstin and that sir james clement the poor baronet had retired mr chubb had been occupied with the most ingenious mental combinations in order to ascertain what possibilities of profit to the sugar loaf might lie in this altered state of the canvass he had a cousin in another county also a publican but in a larger way and resident in a borough and from him mr chubb had gathered more detailed political information than he could find in the loamshire newspapers he was now enlightened enough to know that there was a way of using voteless miners and navvies at nominations and elections he approved of that it entered into his political idee and indeed he would have been for extending the franchise to this class at least in sproxton if any one had observed that you must draw a line somewhere mr chubb would have concurred at once and would have given permission to draw it at a radius of two miles from his own tap from the first sunday evening when felix had appeared at the sugar loaf mr chubb had made up his mind that this 'cute man who kept himself sober was an electioneering agent that he was hired for some purpose or other there was not a doubt a man didn't come and drink nothing without a good reason in proportion as felix's purpose was not obvious to chubb's mind it must be deep and this growing conviction had even led the publican on the last sunday evening privately to urge his mysterious visitor to let a little ale be chalked up for him it was of no consequence felix knew his man and had taken care not to betray too soon that his real object was so to win the ear of the best fellows about him as to induce them to meet him on a saturday evening in the room where mr lyon or one of his deacons habitually held his wednesday preachings only women and children three old men a journeyman tailor and a consumptive youth attended those preachings not a collier had been won from the strong ale of the sugar loaf not even a navvy from the muddier drink of the blue cow felix was sanguine he saw some pleasant faces among the miners when they were washed on sundays they might be taught to spend their wages better at all events he was going to try he had great confidence in his powers of appeal and it was quite true that he never spoke without arresting attention there was nothing better than a dame school in the hamlet he thought that if he could move the fathers whose blackened week day persons and flannel caps ornamented with tallow candles by way of plume were a badge of hard labor for which he had a more sympathetic fibre than for any ribbon in the buttonhole if he could move these men to save something from their drink and pay a school master for their boys a greater service would be done them than if mr garstin and his company were persuaded to establish a school i'll lay hold of them by their fatherhood said felix i'll take one of their little fellows and set him in the midst till they can show there's something they love better than swilling themselves with ale extension of the suffrage can never mean anything for them but extension of boozing one must begin somewhere i'll begin at what is under my nose i'll begin at sproxton that's what a man would do if he had a red hot superstition can't one work for sober truth as hard as for megrims felix holt had his illusions like other young men though they were not of a fashionable sort referring neither to the impression his costume and horsemanship might make on beholders nor to the ease with which he would pay the jews when he gave a loose to his talents and applied himself to work he had fixed his choice on a certain mike brindle not that brindle was his real name each collier had his sobriquet as the man whom he would induce to walk part of the way home with him this very evening and get to invite some of his comrades for the next saturday brindle was one of the head miners he had a bright good natured face and had given especial attention to certain performances with a magnet which felix carried in his pocket mr chubb who had also his illusions smiled graciously as the enigmatic customer came up to the door step well sir sunday seems to be your day i begin to look for you on a sunday now yes i'm a workingman sunday is my holiday said felix pausing at the door since the host seemed to expect this ah sir there's many ways of working i look at it you're one of those as work with your brains that's what i do myself one may do a good deal of that and work with one's hands too ah sir said mr chubb with a certain bitterness in his smile i've that sort of head that i've often wished i was stupider i use things up sir i see into things a deal too quick i eat my dinner as you may say at breakfast time that's why i hardly ever smoke a pipe no sooner do i stick a pipe in my mouth than i puff and puff till it's gone before other folks' are well lit and then where am i i might as well have let it alone in this world it's better not to be too quick but you know what it is sir not i said felix rubbing the back of his head with a grimace i generally feel myself rather a blockhead the world's a largish place and i haven't turned everything inside out yet ah that's your deepness i think we understand one another and about this here election i lay two to one we should agree if we was to come to talk about it ah said felix with an air of caution you're none of a tory eh sir you won't go to vote for debarry that was what i said at the very first go off says i he's no tory i think i was right sir eh certainly i'm no tory no no you don't catch me wrong in a hurry well between you and me i care no more for the debarrys than i care for johnny groats i live on none o' their land and not a pot's worth did they ever send to the sugar loaf i'm not frightened at the debarrys there's no man more independent than me i'll plump or i'll split for them as treat me the handsomest and are the most of what i call gentlemen that's my idee and in the way of hatching for any man them are fools that don't employ me we mortals sometimes cut a pitiable figure in our attempts at display we may be sure of our own merits yet fatally ignorant of the point of view from which we are regarded by our neighbor our fine patterns in tattooing may be far from throwing him into a swoon of admiration though we turn ourselves all round to show them thus it was with mr chubb yes said felix dryly i should think there are some sorts of work for which you are just fitted ah you see that well we understand one another you're no tory no more am i and if i'd got four hands to show at a nomination the debarrys shouldn't have one of 'em my idee is there's a deal too much of their scutchins and their moniments in treby church what's their scutchins mean they're a sign with little liquor behind 'em that's how i take it there's nobody can give account of 'em as i ever heard mr chubb was hindered from further explaining his views as to the historical element in society by the arrival of new guests who approached in two groups the foremost group consisted of well known colliers in their good sunday beavers and colored handkerchiefs serving as cravats with the long ends floating the second group was a more unusual one and caused mr chubb to compress his mouth and agitate the muscles about it in rather an excited manner first came a smartly dressed personage on horseback with a conspicuous expansive shirt front and figured satin stock he was a stout man and gave a strong sense of broadcloth a wild idea shot through mr chubb's brain could this grand visitor be harold transome excuse him he had been given to understand by his cousin from the distant borough that a radical candidate in the condescension of canvassing had even gone the length of eating bread and treacle with the children of an honest freeman and declaring his preference for that simple fare mr chubb's notion of a radical was that he was a new and agreeable kind of lick spittle who fawned on the poor instead of on the rich and so was likely to send customers to a public so that he argued well enough from the premises at his command the mounted man of broadcloth had followers several shabby looking men and sproxton boys of all sizes whose curiosity had been stimulated by unexpected largesse a stranger on horseback scattering half pence on a sunday was so unprecedented that there was no knowing what he might do next and the smallest hindmost fellows in sealskin caps were not without hope that an entirely new order of things had set in everyone waited outside for the stranger to dismount and mr chubb advanced to take the bridle well mr chubb were the first words when the great man was safely out of the saddle i've often heard of your fine tap and i'm come to taste it walk in sir pray walk in said mr chubb giving the horse to the stable boy i shall be proud to draw for you if anybody's been praising me i think my ale will back him all entered in the rear of the stranger except the boys who peeped in at the window won't you please to walk into the parlor sir said mr chubb obsequiously no no i'll sit down here this is what i like to see said the stranger looking round at the colliers who eyed him rather shyly a bright hearth where workingmen can enjoy themselves however i'll step into the other room for three minutes just to speak half a dozen words with you mr chubb threw open the parlor door and then stepping back took the opportunity of saying in a low tone to felix do you know this gentleman not i no mr chubb's opinion of felix holt sank from that moment the parlor door was closed but no one sat down or ordered beer i say master said mike brindle going up to felix don't you think that's one o' the 'lection men very likely i heared a chap say they're up and down everywhere said brindle and now's the time they say when a man can get beer for nothing ay that's sin' the reform said a big red whiskered man called dredge that's brought the 'lections and the drink into these parts for afore that it was all kep' up the lord knows wheer well but the reform's niver come anigh sprox'on said a gray haired but stalwart man called old sleck i don't believe nothing about'n i don't don't you said brindle with some contempt well i do there's folks won't believe beyond the end o' their own pickaxes you can't drive nothing into 'em not if you split their skulls i know for certain sure from a chap in the cartin' way as he's got money and drink too only for hollering eh master what do you say brindle ended turning with some deference to felix should you like to know all about the reform said felix using his opportunity if you would i can tell you ay ay tell's you know i'll be bound said several voices at once ah but it will take some little time and we must be quiet the cleverest of you those who are looked up to in the club must come and meet me at peggy button's cottage next saturday at seven o'clock after dark and brindle you must bring that little yellow haired lad of yours and anybody that's got a little boy a very little fellow who won't understand what is said may bring him but you must keep it close you know we don't want fools there but everybody who hears me may come i shall be at peggy button's why that's where the wednesday preachin' is said dredge i've been aforced to give my wife a black eye to hinder her from going to the preachin' lors a massy she thinks she knows better nor me and i can't make head nor tail of her talk why can't you let the woman alone said brindle with some disgust i'd be ashamed to beat a poor crawling thing 'cause she likes preaching no more i did beat her afore not if she scrat' me said dredge in vindication but if she jabbers at me i can't abide it howsomever i'll bring my jack to peggy's o' saturday his mother shall wash him he is but four year old and he'll swear and square at me a good un if i set him on there you go blatherin' said brindle intending a mild rebuke this dialogue which was in danger of becoming too personal was interrupted by the reopening of the parlor door and the reappearance of the impressive stranger with mr chubb whose countenance seemed unusually radiant sit you down here mr johnson said chubb moving an arm chair this gentleman is kind enough to treat the company he added looking round and what's more he'll take a cup with 'em and i think there's no man but what'll say that's a honor the company had nothing equivalent to a hear hear at command but they perhaps felt the more as they seated themselves with an expectation unvented by utterance there was a general satisfactory sense that the hitherto shadowy reform had at length come to sproxton in a good round shape with broadcloth and pockets felix did not intend to accept the treating but he chose to stay and hear taking his pint as usual capital ale capital ale said mr johnson as he set down his glass speaking in a quick smooth treble now he went on with a certain pathos in his voice looking at mr chubb who sat opposite there's some satisfaction to me in finding an establishment like this at the pits for what would higher wages do for the workingman if he couldn't get a good article for his money why gentlemen here he looked round i've been into ale houses where i've seen a fine fellow of a miner or a stone cutter come in and have to lay down money for beer that i should be sorry to give to my pigs here mr johnson leaned forward with squared elbows hands placed on his knees and a defiant shake of the head aw like at the blue cow fell in the irrepressible dredge in a deep bass but he was rebuked by a severe nudge from brindle yes yes you know what it is my friend said mr johnson looking at dredge and restoring his self satisfaction but it won't last much longer that's one good thing bad liquor will be swept away with other bad articles trade will prosper and what's trade now without steam and what is steam without coal and mark you this gentlemen there's no man and no government can make coal a loud haw haw showed that this fact was appreciated nor freeston' nayther said a wide mouthed wiry man called gills who wished for an exhaustive treatment of the subject being a stone cutter nor freestone as you say else i think if coal could be made above ground honest fellows who are the pith of our population would not have to bend their backs and sweat in a pit six days out of the seven no no i say as this country prospers it has more and more need of you sirs it can do without a pack of lazy lords and ladies but it can never do without brave colliers and the country will prosper i pledge you my word sirs this country will rise to the tiptop of everything and there isn't a man in it but what shall have his joint in the pot and his spare money jingling in his pocket if we only exert ourselves to send the right men to parliament men who will speak up for the collier and the stone cutter and the navvy mr johnson waved his hand liberally and will stand no nonsense this is a crisis and we must exert ourselves we've got reform gentlemen but now the thing is to make reform work it's a crisis i pledge you my word it's a crisis mr johnson threw himself back as if from the concussion of that great noun he did not suppose that one of his audience knew what a crisis meant but he had large experience in the effect of uncomprehended words and in this case the colliers were thrown into a state of conviction concerning they did not know what which was a fine preparation for hitting out or any other act carrying a due sequence to such a conviction felix felt himself in danger of getting into a rage there is hardly any mental misery worse than that of having our own serious phrases our own rooted beliefs caricatured by a charlatan or a hireling he began to feel the sharp lower edge of his tin pint measure and to think it a tempting missile mr johnson certainly had some qualifications as an orator after this impressive pause he leaned forward again and said in a lowered tone looking round i think you all know the good news there was a movement of shoe soles on the quarried floor and a scrape of some chair legs but no other answer the good news i mean is that a first rate man mr transome of transome court has offered himself to represent you in parliament sirs i say you in particular for what he has at heart is the welfare of the workingman of the brave fellows that wield the pickaxe and the saw and the hammer he's rich has more money than garstin but he doesn't want to keep it to himself what he wants is to make a good use of it gentlemen he's come back from foreign parts with his pockets full of gold he could buy up the debarrys if they were worth buying but he's got something better to do with his money he means to use it for the good of the workingmen in these parts i know there are some men who put up for parliament and talk a little too big they may say they want to befriend the colliers for example but i should like to put a question to them i should like to ask them 'what colliers' there are colliers up at newcastle and there are colliers down in wales will it do any good to honest tom who is hungry in sproxton to hear that jack at newcastle has his belly full of beef and pudding it ought to do him good felix burst in with his loud abrupt voice in odd contrast with glib mr johnson's if he knows it's a bad thing to be hungry and not have enough to eat he ought to be glad that another fellow who is not idle is not suffering in the same way every one was startled the audience was much impressed with the grandeur the knowledge and the power of mr johnson his brilliant promises confirmed the impression that reform had at length reached the new pits and reform if it were good for anything must at last resolve itself into spare money meaning sport and drink and keeping away from work for several days in the week these brave men of sproxton liked felix as one of themselves only much more knowing as a workingman who had seen many distant parts but who must be very poor since he never drank more than a pint or so they were quite inclined to hear what he had got to say on another occasion but they were rather irritated by his interruption at the present moment mr johnson was annoyed but he spoke with the same glib quietness as before though with an expression of contempt i call it a poor spirited thing to take up a man's straight forward words and twist them what i meant to say was plain enough that no man can be saved from starving by looking on while others eat i think that's common sense eh sirs there was again an approving haw haw to hear anything said and understand it was a stimulus that had the effect of wit mr chubb cast a suspicious and viperous glance at felix who felt that he had been a simpleton for his pains well then continued mr johnson i suppose i may go on but if there is any one here better able to inform the company than i am i give way i give way sir said mr chubb magisterially no man shall take the words out of your mouth in this house and he added looking pointedly at felix company that's got no more orders to give and wants to turn up rusty to them that has had better be making room than filling it love an' 'armony's the word on our club's flag an' love an' 'armony's the meaning of 'the sugar loaf william chubb' folks of a different mind had better seek another house of call very good said felix laying down his money and taking his cap i'm going he saw clearly enough that if he said more there would be a disturbance which could have no desirable end when the door had closed behind him mr johnson said what is that person's name does anybody know it said mr chubb a few noes were heard i've heard him speak like a downright reformer else i should have looked a little sharper after him but you may see he's nothing partic'lar it looks rather bad that no one knows his name said mr johnson he's most likely a tory in disguise a tory spy you must be careful sirs of men who come to you and say they're radicals and yet do nothing for you they'll stuff you with words no lack of words but words are wind now a man like transome comes forward and says to the workingmen of this country 'here i am ready to serve you and speak for you in parliament and to get the laws made all right for you and in the meanwhile if there's any of you who are my neighbors who want a day's holiday or a cup to drink with friends or a copy of the king's likeness why i'm your man i'm not a paper handbill all words and no substance nor a man with land and nothing else i've got bags of gold as well as land' i think you know what i mean by the king's likeness here mr johnson took a half crown out of his pocket and held the head toward the company well sirs there are some men who like to keep this pretty picture a great deal too much to themselves i don't know whether i'm right but i think i've heard of such a one not a hundred miles from here i think his name was spratt and he managed some company's coal pits haw haw spratt spratt's his name was rolled forth to an accompaniment of scraping shoe soles a screwing fellow by what i understand a domineering fellow who would expect men to do as he liked without paying them for it i think there's not an honest man wouldn't like to disappoint such an upstart there was a murmur which was interpreted by mr chubb i'll answer for 'em sir now listen to me here's garstin he's one of the company you work under what's garstin to you who sees him and when they do see him they see a thin miserly fellow who keeps his pockets buttoned he calls himself a whig yet he'll split votes with a tory he'll drive with the debarrys now gentlemen if i said i'd got a vote and anybody asked me what i should do with it i should say 'i'll plump for transome' you've got no votes and that's a shame but you will have some day if such men as transome are returned and then you'll be on a level with the first gentleman in the land and if he wants to sit in parliament he must take off his hat and ask your leave but though you haven't got a vote you can give a cheer for the right man and transome's not a man like garstin if you lost a day's wages by giving a cheer for transome he'll make you amends that's the way a man who has no vote can serve himself and his country he can lift up his hand and shout 'transome forever' 'hurray for transome' let the workingmen let the colliers and navvies and stone cutters who between you and me have a good deal too much the worst of it as things are now let them join together and give their hands and voices for the right man and they'll make the great people shake in their shoes a little and when you shout for transome remember you shout for more wages and more of your rights and you shout to get rid of rats and sprats and such small animals who are the tools the rich make use of to squeeze the blood out of the poor man i wish there'd be a row i'd pommel him said dredge who was generally felt to be speaking to the question no no my friend there you're a little wrong no pommelling no striking first there you have the law and the constable against you a little rolling in the dust and knocking hats off a little pelting with soft things that'll stick and not bruise all that doesn't spoil the fun if a man is to speak when you don't like to hear him it is but fair you should give him something he doesn't like in return and the same if he's got a vote and doesn't use it for the good of the country i see no harm in splitting his coat in a quiet way a man must be taught what's right if he doesn't know it but no kicks no knocking down no pommelling it 'ud be good fun though if so be said old sleck allowing himself an imaginative pleasure well well if a spratt wants you to say garstin it's some pleasure to think you can say transome now my notion is this you are men who can put two and two together i don't know a more solid lot of fellows than you are and what i say is let the honest men in this country who've got no vote show themselves in a body when they have got the chance why sirs for every tory sneak that's got a vote there's fifty five fellows who must stand by and be expected to hold their tongues but i say let 'em hiss the sneaks let 'em groan at the sneaks and the sneaks will be ashamed of themselves the men who've got votes don't know how to use them there's many a fool with a vote who is not sure in his mind whether he shall poll say for debarry or garstin or transome whether he'll plump or whether he'll split a straw will turn him let him know your mind if he doesn't know his own what's the reason debarry gets returned because people are frightened at the debarrys what's that to you you don't care for the debarrys if people are frightened at the tories we'll turn round and frighten them you know what a tory is one who wants to drive the workingman as he'd drive cattle that's what a tory is and a whig is no better if he's like garstin a whig wants to knock the tory down and get the whip that's all but transome's neither whig nor tory he's the workingman's friend the collier's friend the friend of the honest navvy and if he gets into parliament let me tell you it will be better for you i don't say it will be the better for overlookers and screws and rats and sprats but it will be the better for every good fellow who takes his pot at the sugar loaf mr johnson's exertions for the political education of the sproxton men did not stop here which was the more disinterested in him as he did not expect to see them again and could only set on foot an organization by which their instruction could be continued without him in this he was quite successful a man known among the butties as pack who had already been mentioned by mr chubb presently joined the party and had a private audience of mr johnson that he might be instituted as the shepherd of this new flock that's a right down genelman said pack as he took the seat vacated by the orator who had ridden away what's his trade think you said gills the wiry stone cutter trade said mr chubb he one of the top sawyers of the country he works with his head you may see that let's have our pipes then said old sleck i'm pretty well tired o' jaw so am i said dredge it's wriggling work like follering a stoat it makes a man dry i'd as lief hear preaching on'y there's naught to be got by't i shouldn't know which end i stood on if it wasn't for the tickets and the treatin' chapter xii oh sir 'twas that mixture of spite and over fed merriment which passes for humor with the vulgar in their fun they have much resemblance to a turkey cock it has a cruel beak and a silly iteration of ugly sounds it spreads its tail in self glorification but shows you the wrong side of the ornament liking admiration but knowing not what is admirable this sunday evening which promised to be so memorable in the experience of the sproxton miners had its drama also for those unsatisfactory objects to mr johnson's moral sense the debarrys certain incidents occurring at treby manor caused an excitement there which spread from the dining room to the stables but no one underwent such agitating transitions of feeling as mr scales at six o'clock that superior butler was chuckling in triumph at having played a fine and original practical joke on his rival mr christian some two hours after that time he was frightened sorry and even meek he was on the brink of a humiliating confession his cheeks were almost livid his hair was flattened for want of due attention from his fingers and the fine roll of his whiskers which was too firm to give way seemed only a sad reminiscence of past splendor and felicity his sorrow came about in this wise after service on that sunday morning mr philip debarry had left the rest of the family to go home in the carriage and had remained at the rectory to lunch with his uncle augustus that he might consult him touching some letters of importance he had returned the letters to his pocket book but had not returned the book to his pocket and he finally walked away leaving the enclosure of private papers and bank notes on his uncle's escritoire after his arrival at home he was reminded of his omission and immediately dispatched christian with a note begging his uncle to seal up the pocket book and send it by the bearer this commission which was given between three and four o'clock happened to be very unwelcome to the courier the fact was that mr christian who had been remarkable through life for that power of adapting himself to circumstances which enables a man to fall safely on all fours in the most hurried expulsions and escapes was not exempt from bodily suffering a circumstance to which there is no known way of adapting one's self so as to be perfectly comfortable under it or to push it off on to other people's shoulders he did what he could he took doses of opium when he had an access of nervous pains and he consoled himself as to future possibilities by thinking that if the pains ever became intolerably frequent a considerable increase in the dose might put an end to them altogether he was neither cato nor hamlet and though he had learned their soliloquies at his first boarding school he would probably have increased his dose without reciting those master pieces next to the pain itself he disliked that any one should know of it defective health diminished a man's market value he did not like to be the object of the sort of pity he himself gave to a poor devil who was forced to make a wry face or give in altogether he had felt it expedient to take a slight dose this afternoon and still he was not altogether relieved at the time he set off for the rectory on returning with the valuable case safely deposited in his hind pocket he felt increasing bodily uneasiness and took another dose thinking it likely that he looked rather pitiable he chose not to proceed to the house by the carriage road the servants often walked in the park on a sunday and he wished to avoid any meeting he would make a circuit get into the house privately and after delivering his packet to mr debarry shut himself up till the ringing of the half hour bell but when he reached an elbowed seat under some sycamores he felt so ill at ease that he yielded to the temptation of throwing himself on it to rest a little he looked at his watch it was but five he had done his errand quickly hitherto and mr debarry had not urged haste but in less than ten minutes he was in a sound sleep certain conditions of his system had determined a stronger effect than usual from the opium as he had expected there were servants strolling in the park but they did not all choose the most frequented part mr scales in pursuit of a light flirtation with the younger lady's maid had preferred a more sequestered walk in the company of that agreeable nymph and it happened to be this pair of all others who alighted on the sleeping christian a sight which at the very first moment caused mr scales a vague pleasure as at an incident that must lead to something clever on his part to play a trick and make some one or other look foolish was held the most pointed form of wit throughout the back regions of the manor and served as a constant substitute for theatrical entertainment what the farce wanted in costume or make up it gained in the reality of the mortification which excited the general laughter and lo here was the offensive the exasperatingly cool and superior christian caught comparatively helpless with his head hanging on his shoulder and one coat tail hanging out heavily below the elbow of the rustic seat it was this coat tail which served as a suggestion to mr scales's genius putting his finger up in warning to mrs cherry and saying hush be quiet i see a fine bit of fun he took a knife from his pocket stepped behind the unconscious christian and quickly cut off the pendent coat tail scales knew nothing of the errand to the rectory and as he noticed that there was something in the pocket thought it was probably a large cigar case so much the better he had no time to pause he threw the coat tail as far as he could and noticed that it fell among the elms under which they had been walking then beckoning to mrs cherry he hurried away with her toward the more open part of the park not daring to explode in laughter until it was safe from the chance of waking the sleeper and then the vision of the graceful well appointed mr christian who sneered at scales about his get up having to walk back to the house with only one tail to his coat was a source of so much enjoyment to the butler that the fair cherry began to be quite jealous of the joke still she admitted that it really was funny tittered intermittently and pledged herself to secrecy mr scales explained to her that christian would try to creep in unobserved but that this must be made impossible and he requested her to imagine the figure this interloping fellow would cut when everybody was asking what had happened hallo christian where's your coat tail would become a proverb at the manor where jokes kept remarkably well without the aid of salt and mr christian's comb would be cut so effectually that it would take a long time to grow again exit scales laughing and presenting a fine example of dramatic irony to any one in the secret of fate when christian awoke he was shocked to find himself in the twilight he started up shook himself missed something and soon became aware what it was he missed he did not doubt that he had been robbed and he at once foresaw that the consequences would be highly unpleasant in no way could the cause of the accident be so represented to mr philip debarry as to prevent him from viewing his hitherto unimpeachable factotum in a new and unfavorable light and though mr christian did not regard his present position as brilliant he did not see his way to anything better a man nearly fifty who is not always quite well is seldom ardently hopeful he is aware that this is a world in which merit is often overlooked with the idea of robbery in full possession of his mind to peer about and search in the dimness even if it had occurred to him would have seemed a preposterous waste of time and energy he knew it was likely that mr debarry's pocket book had important and valuable contents and that he should deepen his offence by deferring his announcement of the unfortunate fact he hastened back to the house relieved by the obscurity from that mortification of his vanity on which the butler had counted indeed to scales himself the affair had already begun to appear less thoroughly jocose than he had anticipated for he observed that christian's non appearance before dinner had caused mr debarry some consternation and he had gathered that the courier had been sent on a commission to the rectory my uncle must have detained him for some reason or other he heard mr philip say but it is odd if he were less trusty about commissions or had ever seemed to drink too much i should be uneasy altogether the affair was not taking the turn mr scales had intended at last when dinner had been removed and the butler's chief duties were at an end it was understood that christian had entered without his coat tail looking serious and even agitated that he had asked leave at once to speak to mr debarry and that he was even then in parley with the gentleman in the dining room scales was in alarm it must have been some property of mr debarry's that had weighted the pocket he took a lantern got a groom to accompany him with another lantern and with the utmost practical speed reached the fatal spot in the park he searched under the elms he was certain that the pocket had fallen there and he found the pocket but he found it empty and in spite of further search did not find the contents though he had first consoled himself with thinking that they had fallen out and would be lying not far off he returned with the lanterns and the coat tail and a most uncomfortable consciousness in that great seat of a butler's emotion the stomach he had no sooner re entered than he was met by mrs cherry pale and anxious who drew him aside to say that if he didn't tell everything she would that the constables were to be sent for that there had been no end of bank notes and letters and things in mr debarry's pocket book which christian was carrying in that very pocket scales had cut off that the rector was sent for the constable was coming and they should all be hanged mr scales's own intellect was anything but clear as to the possible issues crest fallen and with the coat tail in his hands as an attestation that he was innocent of anything more than a joke he went and made his confession his story relieved christian a little but did not relieve mr debarry who was more annoyed at the loss of the letters and the chance of their getting into hands that might make use of them than at the loss of the bank notes nothing could be done for the present but that the rector who was a magistrate should instruct the constables and that the spot in the park indicated by scales should again be carefully searched this was done but in vain and many of the family at the manor had disturbed sleep that night chapter xiii give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me to this submission richard ii meanwhile felix holt had been making his way back from sproxton to treby in some irritation and bitterness of spirit for a little while he walked slowly along the direct road hoping that mr johnson would overtake him in which case he would have the pleasure of quarrelling with him and telling him what he thought of his intentions in coming to cant at the sugar loaf but he presently checked himself in this folly and turned off again toward the canal that he might avoid the temptation of getting into a passion to no purpose where's the good he thought of pulling at such a tangled skein as this electioneering trickery as long as three fourths of the men in this country see nothing in an election but self interest and nothing in self interest but some form of greed one might as well try to purify the proceedings of the fishes and say to a hungry cod fish 'my good friend abstain don't goggle your eyes so or show such a stupid gluttonous mouth or think the little fishes are worth nothing except in relation to your own inside' he'd be open to no argument short of crimping him i should get into a rage with this fellow and perhaps end by thrashing him there's some reason in me as long as i keep my temper but my rash humor is drunkenness without wine i shouldn't wonder if he upsets all my plans with these colliers of course he's going to treat them for the sake of getting up a posse at the nomination and speechifyings they'll drink double and never come near me on a saturday evening i don't know what sort of man transome really is it's no use my speaking to anybody else but if i could get at him he might put a veto on this thing though when once the men have been promised and set a going the mischief is likely to be past mending hang the liberal cod fish i shouldn't have minded so much if he'd been a tory felix went along in the twilight struggling in this way with the intricacies of life which would certainly be greatly simplified if corrupt practices were the invariable mark of wrong opinions when he had crossed the common and had entered the park the overshadowing trees deepened the gray gloom of the evening it was useless to try and keep the blind path and he could only be careful that his steps should be bent in the direction of the park gate he was striding along rapidly now whistling bannockburn in a subdued way as an accompaniment to his inward discussion when something smooth and soft on which his foot alighted arrested him with an unpleasant startling sensation and made him stoop to examine the object he was treading on he found it to be a large leather pocket book swelled by its contents and fastened with a sealed ribbon as well as a clasp in stooping he saw about a yard off something whitish and square lying on the dark grass this was an ornamental note book of pale leather stamped with gold apparently it had burst open in falling and out of the pocket formed by the cover there protruded a small gold chain about four inches long with various seals and other trifles attached to it by a ring at the end felix thrust the chain back and finding that the clasp of the note book was broken he closed it and thrust it into his side pocket walking along under some annoyance that fortune had made him the finder of articles belonging most probably to one of the family at treby manor he was much too proud a man to like any contact with the aristocracy and he could still less endure coming within speech of their servants some plan must be devised by which he could avoid carrying these things up to the manor himself he thought at first of leaving them at the lodge but he had a scruple against placing property of which the ownership was after all uncertain in the hands of persons unknown to him it was possible that the large pocket book contained papers of high importance and that it did not belong to any of the debarry family he resolved at last to carry his findings to mr lyon who would perhaps be good natured enough to save him from the necessary transactions with the people at the manor by undertaking those transactions himself with this determination he walked straight to malthouse yard and waited outside the chapel until the congregation was dispersing when he passed along the aisle to the vestry in order to speak to the minister in private but mr lyon was not alone when felix entered mr nuttwood the grocer who was one of the deacons was complaining to him about the obstinate demeanor of the singers who had declined to change the tunes in accordance with a change in the selection of hymns and had stretched short metre into long out of pure wilfulness and defiance irreverently adapting the most sacred monosyllables to a multitude of quavers arranged it was to be feared by some musician who was inspired by conceit rather than by the true spirit of psalmody come in my friend said mr lyon smiling at felix and then continuing in a faint voice while he wiped the perspiration from his brow and bald crown brother nuttwood we must be content to carry a thorn in our sides while the necessities of our imperfect state demand that there should be a body set apart and called a choir whose special office it is to lead the singing not because they are more disposed to the devout uplifting of praise but because they are endowed with better vocal organs and have attained more of the musician's art for all office unless it be accompanied by peculiar grace becomes as it were a diseased organ seeking to make itself too much of a centre singers specially so called are it must be confessed an anomaly among us who seek to reduce the church to its primitive simplicity and to cast away all that may obstruct the direct communion of spirit with spirit they are so headstrong said mr nuttwood in a tone of sad perplexity that if we dealt not warily with them they might end in dividing the church even now that we have had the chapel enlarged brother kemp would side with them and draw the half part of the members after him i cannot but think it a snare when a professing christian has a bass voice like brother kemp's it makes him desire to be heard of men but the weaker song of the humble may have more power in the ear of god do you think it any better vanity to flatter yourself that god likes to hear you though men don't said felix with unwarrantable bluntness the civil grocer was prepared to be scandalized by anything that came from felix in common with many hearers in malthouse yard he already felt an objection to a young man who was notorious for having interfered in a question of wholesale and retail which should have been left to providence old mr holt being a church member had probably had leadings which were more to be relied on than his son's boasted knowledge in any case a little visceral disturbance and inward chastisement to the consumers of questionable medicines would tend less to obscure the divine glory than a show of punctilious morality in one who was not a professor besides how was it to be known that the medicines would not be blessed if taken with due trust in a higher influence a christian must consider not the medicines alone in their relation to our frail bodies which are dust but the medicines with omnipotence behind them hence a pious vendor will look for leadings and he is likely to find them in the cessation of demand and the disproportion of expenses and returns the grocer was thus on his guard against the presumptuous disputant mr lyon may understand you sir he replied he seems to be fond of your conversation but you have too much of the pride of human learning for me i follow no new lights then follow an old one said felix mischievously disposed toward a sleek tradesman follow the light of the old fashioned presbyterians that i've heard sing at glasgow the preacher gives out the psalm and then everybody sings a different tune as it happens to turn up in their throats it's a domineering thing to set a tune and expect everybody else to follow it it's a denial of private judgment hush hush my young friend said mr lyon hurt by this levity which glanced at himself as well as at the deacon play not with paradoxes that caustic which you handle in order to scorch others may happen to sear your own fingers and make them dead to the quality of things 'tis difficult enough to see our way and keep our torch steady in this dim labyrinth to whirl the torch and dazzle the eyes of our fellow seekers is a poor daring and may end in total darkness you yourself are a lover of freedom and a bold rebel against usurping authority but the right to rebellion is the right to seek a higher rule and not to wander in mere lawlessness wherefore i beseech you seem not to say that liberty is license and i apprehend though i am not endowed with an ear to seize those earthly harmonies which to some devout souls have seemed as it were the broken echoes of the heavenly choir i apprehend that there is a law in music disobedience whereunto would bring us in our singing to the level of shrieking maniacs or howling beasts so that herein we are well instructed how true liberty can be nought but the transfer of obedience from the will of one or of a few men to that will which is the norm or rule for all men and though the transfer may sometimes be but an erroneous direction of search yet is the search good and necessary to the ultimate finding and even as in music where all obey and concur to one end so that each has the joy of contributing to a whole whereby he is ravished and lifted up into the courts of heaven so will it be in that crowning time of the millennial reign when our daily prayer will be fulfilled and one law shall be written on all hearts and be the very structure of all thought and be the principle of all action tired even exhausted as the minister had been when felix holt entered the gathering excitement of speech gave more and more energy to his voice and manner he walked away from the vestry table he paused and came back to it he walked away again then came back and ended with his deepest toned largo keeping his hands clasped behind him while his brown eyes were bright with the lasting youthfulness of enthusiastic thought and love but to any one who had no share in the energies that were thrilling his little body he would have looked queer enough no sooner had he finished his eager speech than he held out his hand to the deacon and said in his former faint tone of fatigue god be with you brother we shall meet to morrow and we will see what can be done to subdue these refractory spirits when the deacon was gone felix said forgive me mr lyon i was wrong and you are right yes yes my friend you have that mark of grace within you that you are ready to acknowledge the justice of a rebuke sit down you have something to say some packet there they sat down at a corner of the small table and felix drew the note book from his pocket to lay it down with the pocket book saying i've had the ill luck to be the finder of these things in the debarrys' park most likely they belong to one of the family at the manor or to some grandee who is staying there i hate having anything to do with such people they'll think me a poor rascal and offer me money you are a known man and i thought you would be kind enough to relieve me by taking charge of these things and writing to debarry not mentioning me and asking him to send some one for them i found them on the grass in the park this evening about half past seven in the corner we cross going to sproxton stay said mr lyon this little book is open we may venture to look in it for some sign of ownership there be others who possess property and might be crossing that end of the park besides the debarrys as he lifted the note book close to his eyes the chain again slipped out he arrested it and held it in his hand while he examined some writing which appeared to be a name on the inner leather he looked long as if he were trying to decipher something that was partly rubbed out and his hands began to tremble noticeably he made a movement in an agitated manner as if he were going to examine the chain and seals which he held in his hand but he checked himself closed his hand again and rested it on the table while with the other hand he pressed the sides of the note book together felix observed his agitation and was much surprised but with a delicacy of which he was capable under all his abruptness he said you are overcome with fatigue sir i was thoughtless to tease you with these matters at the end of sunday when you have been preaching three sermons mr lyon did not speak for a few moments but at last he said it is true i am overcome it was a name i saw a name that called up a past sorrow fear not i will do what is needful with these things you may trust them to me with trembling fingers he replaced the chain and tied both the large pocket book and the note book in his handkerchief he was evidently making a great effort over himself but when he had gathered the knot of the handkerchief in his hand he said give me your arm to the door my friend i feel ill doubtless i am over wearied the door was already open and lyddy was watching for her master's return felix therefore said good night and passed on sure that this was what mr lyon would prefer the minister's supper of warm porridge was ready by the kitchen fire where he always took it on a sunday evening and afterward smoked his weekly pipe up the broad chimney the one great relaxation he allowed himself smoking he considered was a recreation of the travailled spirit which if indulged in might endear this world to us by the ignoble bonds of mere sensuous ease daily smoking might be lawful but it was not expedient and in this esther concurred with a doctrinal eagerness that was unusual in her it was her habit to go to her own room professedly to bed very early on sundays immediately on her return from chapel that she might avoid her father's pipe but this evening she had remained at home under a true plea of not feeling well and when she heard him enter she ran out of the parlor to meet him father you are ill she said as he tottered to the wicker bottomed arm chair while lyddy stood by shaking her head no my dear he answered feebly as she took off his hat and looked in his face enquiringly i am weary let me lay these things down for you said esther touching the bundle in the handkerchief no they are matters which i have to examine he said laying them on the table and putting his arm across them go you to bed lyddy not me sir if ever a man looked as if he was struck with death it's you this very night as here is nonsense lyddy said esther angrily go to bed when my father desires it i will stay with him lyddy was electrified by surprise at this new behavior of miss esther's she took her candle silently and went go you too my dear said mr lyon tenderly giving his hand to esther when lyddy was gone it is your wont to go early why are you up let me lift your porridge from before the fire and stay with you father you think i'm so naughty that i don't like doing anything for you said esther smiling rather sadly at him child what has happened you have become the image of your mother to night said the minister in a loud whisper the tears came and relieved him while esther who had stooped to lift the porridge from the fender paused on one knee and looked up at him she was very good to you asked esther softly yes dear she did not reject my affection she thought not scorn of my love she would have forgiven me if i had erred against her from very tenderness could you forgive me child father i have not been good to you but i will be i will be said esther laying her head on his knee he kissed her head go to bed dear i would be alone when esther was lying down that night she felt as if the little incidents between herself and her father on this sunday had made it an epoch very slight words and deeds may have a sacramental efficacy if we can cast our self love behind us in order to say or do them and it has been well believed through many ages that the beginning of compunction is the beginning of a new life that the mind which sees itself blameless may be called dead in trespasses in trespasses on the love of others in trespasses on their weakness in trespasses on all those great claims which are the image of our own need but esther persisted in assuring herself that she was not bending to any criticism from felix she was full of resentment against his rudeness and yet more against his too harsh conception of her character she was determined to keep as much at a distance from him as possible chapter xiv this man's metallic at a sudden blow his soul rings hard i cannot lay my palm trembling with life upon that jointed brass i shudder at the cold unanswering touch but if it press me in response i'm bruised the next morning when the debarrys including the rector who had ridden over to the manor early were still seated at breakfast christian came in with a letter saying that it had been brought by a man employed at the chapel in malthouse yard who had been ordered by the minister to use all speed and care in the delivery the letter was addressed to sir maximus stay christian it may possibly refer to the lost pocket book said philip debarry who was beginning to feel rather sorry for his factotum as a reaction from previous suspicions and indignation sir maximus opened the letter and felt for his glasses but then said here you read it phil the man writes a hand like small print philip cast his eyes over it and then read aloud in a tone of satisfaction sir i send this letter to apprise you that i have now in my possession certain articles which last evening at about half past seven o'clock were found lying on the grass at the western extremity of your park the articles are a well filled pocket book of brown leather fastened with a black ribbon and with a seal of red wax a small note book covered with gilded vellum whereof the clasp was burst and from out whereof had partly escaped a small chain with seals and a locket attached the locket bearing on the back a device and round the face a female name whereof i request that you will further my effort to place these articles in the right hands by ascertaining whether any person within your walls claims them as his property and by sending that person to me if such be found for i will on no account let them pass from my care save into that of one who declaring himself to be the owner can state to me what is the impression on the seal and what the device and name upon the locket i am sir yours to command in all right dealing malthouse yard oct rufus lyon well done old lyon said the rector i didn't think that any composition of his would ever give me so much pleasure what an old fox it is said sir maximus why couldn't he send the things to me at once along with the letter no no max he uses a justifiable caution said the rector a refined and rather severe likeness of his brother with a ring of fearlessness and decision in his voice which startled all flaccid men and unruly boys what are you going to do phil he added seeing his nephew rise to write of course those other matters are yours i suppose said mr debarry looking at christian yes sir i shall send you with a letter to the preacher you can describe your own property and the seal uncle was it your coat of arms no it was this head of achilles here i can take it off the ring and you can carry it christian but don't lose that for i've had it ever since eighteen hundred i should like to send my compliments with it the rector went on looking at his brother and beg that since he has so much wise caution at command he would exercise a little in more public matters instead of making himself a firebrand in my parish and teaching hucksters and tape weavers that it's their business to dictate to statesmen how did dissenters and methodists and quakers and people of that sort first come up uncle said miss selina a radiant girl of twenty who had given much time to the harp dear me selina said her elder sister harriet whose forte was general knowledge don't you remember 'woodstock' they were in cromwell's time oh holdenough and those people yes but they preached in the churches they had no chapels tell me uncle gus i like to be wise said selina looking up at the face which was smiling down on her with a sort of severe benignity phil says i'm an ignorant puss the seeds of nonconformity were sown at the reformation my dear when some obstinate man made scruples about surplices and the place of the communion table and other trifles of that sort but the quakers came up about cromwell's time and the methodists only in the last century the first methodists were regular clergymen the more's the pity but all those wrong things why didn't government put them down ah to be sure fell in sir maximus in a cordial tone of corroboration because error is often strong and government is often weak my dear well phil have you finished your letter yes i will read it to you said philip turning and leaning over the back of his chair with the letter in his hand there is a portrait of mr philip debarry still to be seen at treby manor and a very fine bust of him at rome where he died fifteen years later a convert to catholicism his face would have been plain but for the exquisite setting of his hazel eyes which fascinated even the dogs of the household the other features though slight and irregular were redeemed from triviality by the stamp of gravity and intellectual preoccupation in his face and bearing as he read aloud his voice was what his uncle's might have been if it had been modulated by delicate health and a visitation of self doubt sir in reply to the letter with which you have favored me this morning i beg to state that the articles you describe were lost from the pocket of my servant who is the bearer of this letter to you and is the claimant of the vellum note book and the gold chain the large leathern pocket book is my own property and the impression on the wax a helmeted head of achilles was made by my uncle the reverend augustus debarry who allows me to forward this seal to you in proof that i am not making a mistaken claim i feel myself under deep obligation to you sir for the care and trouble you have taken in order to restore to its right owner a piece of property which happens to be of particular importance to me and i shall consider myself doubly fortunate if at any time you can point out to me some method by which i may procure you as lively a satisfaction as i am now feeling in that full and speedy relief from anxiety which i owe to your considerate conduct i remain sir your obliged and faithful servant philip debarry you know best phil of course said sir maximus pushing his plate from him by way of interjection but it seems to me you exaggerate preposterously every little service a man happens to do for you why should you make a general offer of that sort how do you know what he will be asking you to do stuff and nonsense tell willis to send him a few head of game you should think twice before you give a blank check of that sort to one of these quibbling meddlesome radicals you are afraid of my committing myself to 'the bottomless perjury of an et cetera' said philip smiling as he turned to fold his letter but i think i am not doing any mischief at all events i could not be content to say less and i have a notion that he would regard a present of game just now as an insult i should in his place yes yes you but you don't make yourself a measure of dissenting preachers i hope said sir maximus rather wrathfully what do you say gus phil is right said the rector in an absolute tone i would not deal with a dissenter or put profits into the pocket of a radical which i might put into the pocket of a good churchman and a quiet subject but if the greatest scoundrel in the world made way for me or picked my hat up i would thank him so would you max pooh i didn't mean that one shouldn't behave like a gentleman said sir maximus in some vexation he had great pride in his son's superiority even to himself but he did not quite trust the dim vision opened by phil's new words and new notions he could only submit in silence while the letter was delivered to christian with the order to start for malthouse yard immediately meanwhile in that somewhat dim locality the possible claimant of the note book and the chain was thought of and expected with palpitating agitation mr lyon was seated in his study looking haggard and already aged from a sleepless night he was so afraid lest his emotion should deprive him of the presence of mind necessary to the due attention to particulars in the coming interview that he continued to occupy his sight and touch with the objects which had stirred the depths not only of memory but of dread once again he unlocked a small box which stood beside his desk and took from it a little oval locket and compared this with one which hung with the seals on the stray gold chain there was the same device in enamel on the back of both clasped hands surrounded with blue flowers both had round the face a name in gold italics on a blue ground the name on the locket taken from the drawer was maurice the name on the locket which hung with the seals was annette and within the circle of this name there was a lover's knot of light brown hair which matched a curl that lay in the box the hair in the locket which bore the name of maurice was of a very dark brown and before returning it to the drawer mr lyon noted the color and quality of this hair more carefully than ever then he recurred to the note book undoubtedly there had been something probably a third name beyond the names maurice christian which had themselves been rubbed and slightly smeared as if by accident and from the very first examination in the vestry mr lyon could not prevent himself from transferring the mental image of the third name in faint lines to the rubbed leather the leaves of the note book seemed to have been recently inserted they were of fresh white paper and only bore some abbreviations in pencil with a notation of small sums nothing could be gathered from the comparison of the writing in the book with that of the yellow letters which lay in the box the smeared name had been carefully printed and so bore no resemblance to the signature of those letters and the pencil abbreviations and figures had been made too hurriedly to bear any decisive witness i will ask him to write to write a description of the locket had been one of mr lyon's thoughts but he faltered in that intention his power of fulfilling it must depend on what he saw in this visitor of whose coming he had a horrible dread at the very time he was writing to demand it in that demand he was obeying the voice of his rigid conscience which had never left him perfectly at rest under his one act of deception the concealment from esther that he was not her natural father the assertion of a false claim upon her let my path be henceforth simple he had said to himself in the anguish of that night let me seek to know what is and if possible to declare it if he was really going to find himself face to face with the man who had been annette's husband and who was esther's father if that wandering of his from the light had brought the punishment of a blind sacrilege as the issue of a conscious transgression he prayed that he might be able to accept all consequences of pain to himself but he saw other possibilities concerning the claimant of the book and chain his ignorance and suspicions as to the history and character of annette's husband made it credible that he had laid a plan for convincing her of his death as a means of freeing himself from a burdensome tie but it seemed equally probable that he was really dead and that these articles of property had been a bequest or a payment or even a sale to their present owner indeed in all these years there was no knowing into how many hands such pretty trifles might have passed and the claimant might after all have no connection with the debarrys he might not come on this day or the next there might be more time left for reflection and prayer all these possibilities which would remove the pressing need for difficult action mr lyon represented to himself but he had no effective belief in them his belief went with his strongest feeling and in these moments his strongest feeling was dead he trembled under the weight that seemed already added to his own sin he felt himself already confronted by annette's husband and esther's father perhaps the father was a gentleman on a visit to the debarrys there was no hindering the pang with which the old man said to himself the child will not be sorry to leave this poor home and i shall be guilty in her sight he was walking about among the rows of books when there came a loud rap at the outer door the rap shook him so that he sank into his chair feeling almost powerless lyddy presented herself here's ever such a fine man from the manor wants to see you sir dear heart dear heart shall i tell him you're too bad to see him show him up said mr lyon making an effort to rally when christian appeared the minister half rose leaning on an arm of his chair and said be seated sir seeing nothing but that a tall man was entering i've brought you a letter from mr debarry said christian in an off hand manner the rusty little man in his dismal chamber seemed to the ulysses of the steward's room a pitiable sort of human curiosity to whom a man of the world would speak rather loudly in accommodation to an eccentricity which was likely to be accompanied with deafness one cannot be eminent in everything and if mr christian had dispersed his faculties in study that would have enabled him to share unconventional points of view he might have worn a mistaken kind of boot and been less competent to win at cart or at betting or in any other contest suitable to a person of figure as he seated himself mr lyon opened the letter and held it close to his eyes so that his face was hidden but at the word servant he could not avoid starting and looking off the letter toward the bearer christian knowing what was in the letter conjectured that the old man was amazed to learn that so distinguished looking a personage was a servant he leaned forward with his elbows on his knees balanced his cane on his fingers and began a whispering whistle the minister checked himself finished the reading of the letter and then slowly and nervously put on his spectacles to survey this man between whose fate and his own there might be a terrible collision the word servant had been a fresh caution to him he must do nothing rashly esther's lot was deeply concerned here is the seal mentioned in the letter said christian mr lyon drew the pocket book from his desk and after comparing the seal with the impression said it is right sir i deliver the pocket book to you he held it out with the seal and christian rose to take them saying carelessly the other things the chain and the little book are mine your name then is maurice christian a spasm shot through mr lyon it had seemed possible that he might hear another name and be freed from the worse half of his anxiety his next words were not wisely chosen but escaped him impulsively and you have no other name what do you mean said christian sharply be so good as to reseat yourself christian did not comply i'm rather in a hurry sir he said recovering his coolness if it suits you to restore to me those small articles of mine i shall be glad but i would rather leave them behind than be detained he had reflected that the minister was simply a punctilious old bore the question meant nothing else but mr lyon had wrought himself up to the task of finding out then and there if possible whether or not this were annette's husband how could he lay himself and his sin before god if he wilfully declined to learn the truth nay sir i will not detain you unreasonably he said in a firmer tone than before how long have these articles been your property oh for more than twenty years said christian carelessly he was not altogether easy under the minister's persistence but for that very reason he showed no more impatience you have been in france and in germany i have been in most countries on the continent be so good as to write me your name said mr lyon dipping a pen in ink and holding it out with a piece of paper christian was much surprised but not now greatly alarmed in his rapid conjectures as to the explanation of the minister's curiosity he had alighted on one which might carry advantage rather than inconvenience but he was not going to commit himself before i oblige you there sir he said laying down the pen and looking straight at mr lyon i must know exactly the reasons you have for putting these questions to me you are a stranger to me an excellent person i dare say but i have no concern about you farther than to get from you those small articles do you still doubt that they are mine you wished i think that i should tell you what the locket is like it has a pair of hands and blue flowers on one side and the name annette round the hair on the other side that is all i have to say if you wish for anything more from me you will be good enough to tell me why you wish it now then sir what is your concern with me the cool stare the hard challenging voice with which these words were uttered made them fall like the beating cutting chill of heavy hail on mr lyon he sank back in his chair in utter irresolution and helplessness how was it possible to lay bare the sad and sacred past in answer to such a call as this the dread with which he had thought of this man's coming the strongly confirmed suspicion that he was really annette's husband intensified the antipathy created by his gestures and glances the sensitive little minister knew instinctively that words which would cost him efforts as painful as the obedient footsteps of a wounded bleeding hound that wills a foreseen throe would fall on this man as the pressure of tender fingers falls on a brazen glove and esther if this man was her father every additional word might help to bring down irrevocable perhaps cruel consequences on her a thick mist seemed to have fallen where mr lyon was looking for the track of duty the difficult question how far he was to care for consequences in seeking and avowing the truth seemed anew obscured all these things like the vision of a coming calamity were compressed into a moment of consciousness nothing could be done to day everything must be deferred he answered christian in a low apologetic tone it is true sir you have told me all i can demand i have no sufficient reason for detaining your property further he handed the note book and chain to christian who had been observing him narrowly and now said in a tone of indifference as he pocketed the articles very good sir i wish you a good morning good morning said mr lyon feeling while the door closed behind his guest that mixture of uneasiness and relief which all procrastination of difficulty produces in minds capable of strong forecast the work was still to be done he had still before him the task of learning everything that could be learned about this man's relation to himself and esther christian as he made his way back along malthouse lane was thinking this old fellow has got some secret in his head it's not likely he can know anything about me it must be about bycliffe but bycliffe was a gentleman how should he ever have had anything to do with such a seedy old ranter as that chapter xv and doubt shall be as lead upon the feet of thy most anxious will mr lyon was careful to look in at felix as soon as possible after christian's departure to tell him that his trust was discharged during the rest of the day he was somewhat relieved from agitating reflections by the necessity of attending to his ministerial duties the rebuke of rebellious singers being one of them and on his return from the monday evening prayer meeting he was so overcome with weariness that he went to bed without taking note of any objects in his study but when he rose the next morning his mind once more eagerly active was arrested by philip debarry's letter which still lay open on his desk and was arrested by precisely that portion which had been unheeded the day before i shall consider myself doubly fortunate if at any time you can point out to me some method by which i may procure you as lively a satisfaction as i am now feeling in that full and speedy relief from anxiety which i owe to your considerate conduct to understand how these words could carry the suggestion they actually had for the minister in a crisis of peculiar personal anxiety and struggle we must bear in mind that for many years he had walked through life with the sense of having for a space been unfaithful to what he esteemed the highest trust ever committed to man the ministerial vocation in a mind of any nobleness a lapse into transgression against an object still regarded as supreme issues in a new and purer devotedness chastised by humility and watched over by a passionate regret so it was with that ardent spirit which animated the little body of rufus lyon once in his life he had been blinded defeated hurried along by rebellious impulse he had gone astray after his own desires and had let the fire die out on the altar and as the true penitent hating his self besotted error asks from all coming life duty instead of joy and service instead of ease so rufus was perpetually on the watch lest he should ever again postpone to some private affection a great public opportunity which to him was equivalent to a command now here was an opportunity brought by a combination of that unexpected incalculable kind which might be regarded as the divine emphasis invoking especial attention to trivial events an opportunity of securing what rufus lyon had often wished for as a means of honoring truth and exhibiting error in the character of a stammering halting short breathed usurper of office and dignity what was more exasperating to a zealous preacher with whom copious speech was not a difficulty but a relief who never lacked argument but only combatants and listeners than to reflect that there were thousands on thousands of pulpits in this kingdom supplied with handsome sounding boards and occupying an advantageous position in buildings far larger than the chapel in malthouse yard buildings sure to be places of resort even as the markets were if only from habit and interest and that these pulpits were filled or rather made vacuous by men whose privileged education in the ancient centres of instruction issued in twenty minutes' formal reading of tepid exhortation or probably infirm deductions from premises based on rotten scaffolding and it is in the nature of exasperation gradually to concentrate itself the sincere antipathy of a dog toward cats in general necessarily takes the form of indignant barking at the neighbor's black cat which makes daily trespass the bark at imagined cats though a frequent exercise of the canine mind is yet comparatively feeble mr lyon's sarcasm was not without an edge when he dilated in general on an elaborate education for teachers which issued in the minimum of teaching but it found a whetstone in the particular example of that bad system known as the rector of treby magna there was nothing positive to be said against the rev augustus debarry his life could not be pronounced blameworthy except for its negatives and the good rufus was too pure minded not to be glad of that he had no delight in vice as discrediting wicked opponents he shrank from dwelling on the images of cruelty or grossness and his indignation was habitually inspired only by those moral and intellectual mistakes which darken the soul but do not injure or degrade the temple of the body if the rector had been a less respectable man rufus would have more reluctantly made him an object of antagonism but as an incarnation of soul destroying error dissociated from those baser sins which have no good repute even with the worldly it would be an argumentative luxury to get into close quarters with him and fight with a dialectic short sword in the eyes of the treby world sending also a written account thereof to the chief organs of dissenting opinion vice was essentially stupid a deaf and eyeless monster insusceptible to demonstration the spirit might work on it by unseen ways and the unstudied sallies of sermons were often as the arrows which pierced and awakened the brutified conscience but illuminated thought finely divided speech were the choicer weapons of the divine armory which whoso could wield must be careful not to leave idle here then was the longed for opportunity here was an engagement an expression of a strong wish on the part of philip debarry if it were in his power to procure a satisfaction to rufus lyon how had that man of god and exemplary independent minister mr ainsworth of persecuted sanctity conducted himself when a similar occasion had befallen him at amsterdam he had thought of nothing but the glory of the highest cause and had converted the offer of recompense into a public debate with a jew on the chief mysteries of the faith here was a model the case was nothing short of a heavenly indication and he rufus lyon would seize the occasion to demand a public debate with the rector on the constitution of the true church what if he were inwardly torn by doubt and anxiety concerning his own private relations and the facts of his past life that danger of absorption within the narrow bounds of self only urged him the more toward action which had a wider bearing and might tell on the welfare of england at large it was decided before the minister went down to breakfast that morning he had written the following letter to mr philip debarry sir referring to your letter of yesterday i find the following words i shall consider myself doubly fortunate if at any time you can point out to me some method by which i may procure you as lively a satisfaction as i am now feeling in that full and speedy relief from anxiety which i owe to your considerate conduct i am not unaware sir that in the usage of the world there are words of courtesy so called which are understood by those amongst whom they are current to have no precise meaning and to constitute no bond of obligation i will not now insist that this is an abuse of language wherein our fallible nature requires the strictest safeguards against laxity and misapplication for i do not apprehend that in writing the words i have above quoted you were open to the reproach of using phrases which while seeming to carry a specific meaning were really no more than what is called a polite form i believe sir that you used these words advisedly sincerely and with an honorable intention of acting on them as a pledge should such action be demanded no other supposition on my part would correspond to the character you bear as a young man who aspires albeit mistakenly to engraft the finest fruits of public virtue on a creed and institutions whereof the sap is composed rather of human self seeking than of everlasting truth wherefore i act on this my belief in the integrity of your written word i beg you to procure for me as it is doubtless in your power that i may be allowed a public discussion with your near relative the rector of this parish the reverend augustus debarry to be held in the large room of the free school or in the assembly room of the marquis of granby these being the largest covered spaces at our command for i presume he would neither allow me to speak within his church nor would consent himself to speak within my chapel and the probable inclemency of the approaching season forbids an assured expectation that we could discourse in the open air the subjects i desire to discuss are first the constitution of the true church and secondly the bearing thereupon of the english reformation confidently expecting that you will comply with this request which is the sequence of your expressed desire i remain sir yours with the respect offered to a sincere withstander rufus lyon malthouse yard after writing this letter the good rufus felt that serenity and elevation of mind which is infallibly brought by a preoccupation with the wider relations of things already he was beginning to sketch the course his argument might most judiciously take in the coming debate his thoughts were running into sentences and marking off careful exceptions in parentheses and he had come down and seated himself at the breakfast table quite automatically without expectation of toast or coffee when esther's voice and touch recalled to him an inward debate of another kind in which he felt himself much weaker again there arose before him the image of that cool hard eyed worldly man who might be this dear child's father and one against whose rights he had himself grievously offended always as the image recurred to him mr lyon's heart sent forth a prayer for guidance but no definite guidance had yet made itself visible for him it could not be guidance it was a temptation that said let the matter rest seek to know no more know only what is thrust upon you the remembrance that in his time of wandering he had wilfully remained in ignorance of facts which he might have enquired after deepened the impression that it was now an imperative duty to seek the fullest attainable knowledge and the enquiry might possibly issue in a blessed repose by putting a negative on all his suspicions but the more vividly all the circumstances became present to him the more unfit he felt himself to set about any investigation concerning this man who called himself maurice christian he could seek no confidant or helper among the brethren he was obliged to admit to himself that the members of his church with whom he hoped to go to heaven were not easy to converse with on earth touching the deeper secrets of his experience and were still less able to advise him as to the wisest procedure in a case of high delicacy with a worldling who had a carefully trimmed whisker and a fashionable costume for the first time in his life it occurred to the minister that he should be glad of an adviser who had more worldly than spiritual experience and that it might not be inconsistent with his principles to seek some light from one who had studied human law but it was a thought to be paused upon and not followed out rashly some other guidance might intervene esther noticed that her father was in a fit of abstraction that he seemed to swallow his coffee and toast quite unconsciously and that he vented from time to time a low guttural interjection which was habitual with him when he was absorbed by an inward discussion she did not disturb him by remarks and only wondered whether anything unusual had occurred on sunday evening but at last she thought it needful to say you recollect what i told you yesterday father nay child what said mr lyon rousing himself that mr jermyn asked me if you would probably be at home this morning before one o'clock esther was surprised to see her father start and change color as if he had been shaken by some sudden collision before he answered assuredly i do not intend to move from my study after i have once been out to hand this letter to zachary shall i tell lyddy to take him up at once to your study if he comes if not i shall have to stay in my own room because i shall be at home all this morning and it is rather cold now to sit without a fire yes my dear let him come up to me unless indeed he should bring a second person which might happen seeing that in all likelihood he is coming as hitherto on electioneering business and i could not well accommodate two visitors up stairs when mr lyon went out to zachary the pew opener to give him a second time the commission of carrying a letter to treby manor esther gave her injunction to lyddy that if one gentleman came he was to be shown up stairs if two they were to be shown into the parlor but she had to resolve several questions before lyddy clearly saw what was before her as that if it was the gentleman as came on thursday in the pepper and salt coat was he to be shown up stairs and the gentleman from the manor yesterday as went out whistling had miss esther heard about him there seemed no end of these great folks coming to malthouse yard since there was talk of the election but they might be poor lost creatures the most of 'em whereupon lyddy shook her head and groaned under an edifying despair as to the future lot of gentlemen callers esther always avoided asking questions of lyddy who found an answer as she found a key by pouring out a pocketful of miscellanies but she had remarked so many indications that something had happened to cause her father unusual excitement and mental preoccupation that she could not help connecting with them the fact of this visit from the manor which he had not mentioned to her she sat down in the dull parlor and took up her netting for since sunday she had felt unable to read when she was alone being obliged in spite of herself to think of felix holt to imagine what he would like her to be and what sort of views he took of life so as to make it seem valuable in the absence of all elegance luxury gayety or romance had he yet reflected that he had behaved very rudely to her on sunday perhaps not perhaps he had dismissed her from his mind with contempt and at that thought esther's eyes smarted unpleasantly she was fond of netting because it showed to advantage both her hand and her foot and across this image of felix holt's indifference and contempt there passed the vaguer image of a possible somebody who would admire her hands and feet and delight in looking at their beauty and long yet not dare to kiss them life would be much easier in the presence of such a love but it was precisely this longing after her own satisfaction that felix had reproached her with did he want her to be heroic that seemed impossible without some great occasion her life was a heap of fragments and so were her thoughts some great energy was needed to bind them together esther was beginning to lose her complacency at her own wit and criticism to lose the sense of superiority in an awakening need of reliance on one whose vision was wider whose nature was purer and stronger than her own but then she said to herself that one must be tender to her not rude and predominating in his manners a man with any chivalry in him could never adopt a scolding tone toward a woman that is toward a charming woman but felix had no chivalry in him he loved lecturing and opinion too well ever to love any woman in this way esther strove to see that felix was thoroughly in the wrong at least if he did not come again expressly to show that he was sorry chapter xvi trueblue these men have no votes why should i court them grayfox no votes but power trueblue what over charities grayfox no over brains which disturbs the canvass in a natural state of things the average price of a vote at paddlebrook is nine and sixpence throwing the fifty pound tenants who cost nothing into the divisor but these talking men cause an artificial rise of prices the expected important knock at the door came about twelve o'clock and esther could hear that there were two visitors immediately the parlor door was opened and the shaggy haired cravatless image of felix holt which was just then full in the mirror of esther's mind was displaced by the highly contrasted appearance of a personage whose name she guessed before mr jermyn had announced it the perfect morning costume of that day differed much from our present ideal it was essential that a gentleman's chin should be well propped that his collar should have a voluminous roll that his waistcoat should imply much discrimination and that his buttons should be arranged in a manner which would now expose him to general contempt and it must not be forgotten that at the distant period when treby magna first knew the excitements of an election there existed many other anomalies now obsolete besides short waisted coats and broad stiffeners but we have some notions of beauty and fitness which withstand the centuries and quite irrespective of dates it would be pronounced that at the age of thirty four harold transome was a striking and handsome man he was one of those people as denner remarked to whose presence in the room you could not be indifferent if you do not hate or dread them you must find the touch of their hands nay their very shadows agreeable esther felt a pleasure quite new to her as she saw his finely embrowned face and full bright eyes turned toward her with an air of deference by which gallantry must commend itself to a refined woman who is not absolutely free from vanity harold transome regarded women as slight things but he was fond of slight things in the intervals of business and he held it among the chief arts of life to keep these pleasant diversions within such bounds that they should never interfere with the course of his serious ambition esther was perfectly aware as he took a chair near her that he was under some admiring surprise at her appearance and manner how could it be otherwise she believed that in the eyes of a well bred man no young lady in treby could equal her she felt a glow of delight at the sense that she was being looked at my father expected you she said to mr jermyn i delivered your letter to him yesterday he will be down immediately she disentangled her foot from her netting and wound it up i hope you are not going to let us disturb you said harold noticing her action we come to discuss election affairs and we particularly desire to interest the ladies i have no interest with any one who is not already on the right side said esther smiling i am happy to see at least that you wear the liberal colors i fear i must confess that it is more from love of blue than from love of liberalism yellow opinions could only have brunettes on their side esther spoke with her usual pretty fluency but she had no sooner uttered the words than she thought how angry they would have made felix if my cause is to be recommended by the becomingness of my colors then i am sure you are acting in my interest by wearing them esther rose to leave the room must you really go said harold preparing to open the door for her yes i have an engagement a lesson at half past twelve said esther bowing and floating out like a blue robed naad but not without a suffused blush as she passed through the doorway it was a pity the room was so small harold transome thought this girl ought to walk in a house where there were halls and corridors but he had soon dismissed this chance preoccupation with esther for before the door was closed again mr lyon had entered and harold was entirely bent on what had been the object of his visit the minister though no elector himself had considerable influence over liberal electors and it was the part of wisdom in a candidate to cement all political adhesion by a little personal regard if possible garstin was a harsh and wiry fellow he seemed to suggest that sour whey which some say was the original meaning of whig in the scottish and it might suggest the theoretic advantages of radicalism if it could be associated with a more generous presence what would conciliate the personal regard of old mr lyon became a curious problem to harold now the little man made his appearance but canvassing makes a gentleman acquainted with many strange animals together with the ways of catching and taming them and thus the knowledge of natural history advances amongst the aristocracy and wealthy commoners of our land i am very glad to have secured this opportunity of making your personal acquaintance mr lyon said harold putting out his hand to the minister when jermyn had mentioned his name i am to address the electors here in the market place to morrow and i should have been sorry to do so without first paying my respects privately to my chief friends as there may be points on which they particularly wish me to explain myself you speak civilly sir and reasonably said mr lyon with a vague short sighted gaze in which a candidate's appearance evidently went for nothing pray be seated gentlemen it is my habit to stand he placed himself at a right angle with his visitors his worn look of intellectual eagerness slight frame and rusty attire making an odd contrast with their flourishing persons unblemished costume and comfortable freedom from excitement the group was fairly typical of the difference between the men who are animated by ideas and the men who are expected to apply them then he drew forth his spectacles and began to rub them with the thin end of his coat tail he was inwardly exercising great self mastery suppressing the thought of his personal needs which jermyn's presence tended to suggest in order that he might be equal to the larger duties of this occasion i am aware mr jermyn has told me said harold what good service you have done me already mr lyon the fact is a man of intellect like you was especially needed in my case the race i am running is really against garstin only who calls himself a liberal though he cares for nothing and understands nothing except the interests of the wealthy traders and you have been able to explain the difference between liberal and liberal which as you and i know is something like the difference between fish and fish your comparison is not unapt sir said mr lyon still holding his spectacles in his hand at this epoch when the mind of the nation has been strained on the passing of one measure where a great weight has to be moved we require not so much selected instruments as abundant horse power but it is an unavoidable evil of these massive achievements that they encourage a coarse undiscriminatingness obstructive of more nicely wrought results and an exaggerated expectation inconsistent with the intricacies of our fallen and struggling condition i say not that compromise is unnecessary but it is an evil attendant on our imperfection and i would pray every one to mark that where compromise broadens intellect and conscience are thrust into narrower room wherefore it has been my object to show our people that there are many who have helped to draw the car of reform whose ends are but partial and who forsake not the ungodly principle of selfish alliances but would only substitute syria for egypt thinking chiefly of their own share in peacocks gold and ivory just so said harold who was quick at new languages and still quicker at translating other men's generalities into his own special and immediate purposes men who will be satisfied if they can only bring in a plutocracy buy up the land and stick the old crests on their new gateways now the practical point to secure against these false liberals at present is that our electors should not divide their votes as it appears that many who vote for debarry are likely to split their votes in favor of garstin it is of the first consequence that my voters should give me plumpers if they divide their votes they can't keep out debarry and they may help to keep out me i feel some confidence in asking you to use your influence in this direction mr lyon we candidates have to praise ourselves more than is graceful but you are aware that while i belong by my birth to the classes that have their roots in tradition and all the old loyalties my experience has lain chiefly among those who make their own career and depend on the new rather than the old i have had the advantage of considering the national welfare under varied lights i have wider views than those of a mere cotton lord on questions connected with religious liberty i would stop short at no measure that was not thorough i hope not sir i hope not said mr lyon gravely finally putting on his spectacles and examining the face of the candidate whom he was preparing to turn into a catechumen for the good rufus conscious of his political importance as an organ of persuasion felt it his duty to catechise a little and also to do his part toward impressing a probable legislator with a sense of his responsibility but the latter branch of duty somewhat obstructed the catechising for his mind was so urged by considerations which he held in danger of being overlooked that the questions and answers bore a very slender proportion to his exposition it was impossible to leave the question of church rates without noting the grounds of their injustice and without a brief enumeration of reasons why mr lyon for his own part would not present that passive resistance to a legal imposition which had been adopted by the friends whose heroism in this regard was nevertheless worthy of all honor comprehensive talkers are apt to be tiresome when we are not athirst for information but to be quite fair we must admit that superior reticence is a good deal due to the lack of matter speech is often barren but silence also does not necessarily brood over a full nest your still fowl blinking at you without remark may all the while be sitting on one addled nest egg and when it takes to cackling will have nothing to announce but that addled delusion harold transome was not at all a patient man but in matters of business he was quite awake to his cue and in this case it was perhaps easier to listen than to answer questions but jermyn who had plenty of work on his hands took an opportunity of rising and saying as he looked at his watch i must really be at the office in five minutes you will find me there mr transome you have probably still many things to say to mr lyon i beseech you sir said the minister changing color and by a quick movement laying his hand on jermyn's arm i beseech you to favor me with an interview on some private business this evening if it were possible mr lyon like others who are habitually occupied with impersonal subjects was liable to this impulsive sort of action he snatched at the details of life as if they were darting past him as if they were like the ribbons at his knees which would never be tied all day if they were not tied on the instant through these spasmodic leaps out of his abstractions into real life it constantly happened that he suddenly took a course which had been the subject of too much doubt with him ever to have been determined on by continuous thought and if jermyn had not startled him by threatening to vanish just when he was plunged in politics he might never have made up his mind to confide in a worldly attorney an odd man as mrs muscat observed to have such a gift in the pulpit but there's one knows better than we do which in a lady who rarely felt her judgment at a loss was a concession that showed much piety jermyn was surprised at the little man's eagerness by all means he answered quite cordially could you come to my office at eight o'clock for several reasons i must beg you to come to me oh very good i'll walk out and see you this evening if possible i shall have much pleasure in being of any use to you jermyn felt that in the eyes of harold he was appearing all the more valuable when his services were thus in request he went out and mr lyon easily relapsed into politics for he had been on the brink of a favorite subject on which he was at issue with his fellow liberals at that time when faith in the efficacy of political change was at fever heat in ardent reformers many measures which men are still discussing with little confidence on either side were then talked about and disposed of like property in near reversion crying abuses bloated paupers bloated pluralists and other corruptions hindering men from being wise and happy had to be fought against and slain such a time is a time of hope afterward when the corpses of those monsters have been held up to the public wonder and abhorrence and yet wisdom and happiness do not follow but rather a more abundant breeding of the foolish and unhappy comes a time of doubt and despondency but in the great reform year hope was mighty the prospect of reform had even served the voters instead of drink and in one place at least there had been a dry election and now the speakers at reform banquets were exuberant in congratulation and promise liberal clergymen of the establishment toasted liberal catholic clergymen without any allusion to scarlet and catholic clergymen replied with a like tender reserve some dwelt on the abolition of all abuses and on millennial blessedness generally others whose imaginations were less suffused with exhalations of the dawn insisted chiefly on the ballot box now on this question of the ballot the minister strongly took the negative side our pet opinions are usually those which place us in a minority of a minority amongst our own party very happily else those poor opinions born with no silver spoon in their mouths how would they get nourished and fed so it was with mr lyon and his objection to the ballot but he had thrown out a remark on the subject which was not quite clear to his hearer who interpreted it according to his best calculation of probabilities i have no objection to the ballot said harold but i think that is not the sort of thing we have to work at just now we shouldn't get it and other questions are imminent then sir you would vote for the ballot said mr lyon stroking his chin certainly if the point came up i have too much respect for the freedom of the voter to oppose anything which offers a chance of making that freedom more complete mr lyon looked at the speaker with a pitying smile and a subdued h'm m m which harold took for a sign of satisfaction he was soon undeceived you grieve me sir you grieve me much and i pray you to reconsider this question for it will take you to the root as i think of political morality i engage to show to any impartial mind duly furnished with the principles of public and private rectitude that the ballot would be pernicious and that if it were not pernicious it would still be futile i will show first that it would be futile as a preservative from bribery and illegitimate influence and secondly that it would be in the worst kind pernicious as shutting the door against those influences whereby the soul of a man and the character of a citizen are duly educated for their great functions be not alarmed if i detain you sir it is well worth the while confound this old man thought harold i'll never make a canvassing call on a preacher again unless he has lost his voice from a cold he was going to excuse himself as prudently as he could by deferring the subject till the morrow and inviting mr lyon to come to him in the committee room before the time appointed for his public speech but he was relieved by the opening of the door lyddy put in her head to say if you please sir here's mr holt wants to know if he may come in and speak to the gentleman he begs your pardon but you're to say 'no' if you don't like him to come nay show him in at once lyddy a young man mr lyon went on speaking to harold whom a representative ought to know no voter but a man of ideas and study he is thoroughly welcome said harold truthfully enough though he felt little interest in the voteless man of ideas except as a diversion from the subject of the ballot he had been standing for the last minute or two feeling less of a victim in that attitude and more able to calculate on means of escape mr holt sir said the minister as felix entered is a young friend of mine whose opinions on some points i hope to see altered but who has a zeal for public justice which i trust he will never lose i am glad to see mr holt said harold bowing he perceived from the way in which felix bowed to him and turned to the most distant spot in the room that the candidate's shake of the hand would not be welcome here a formidable fellow he thought capable of mounting a cart in the market place to morrow and cross examining me if i say anything that doesn't please him mr lyon said felix i have taken a liberty with you in asking to see mr transome when he is engaged with you but i have to speak to him on a matter which i shouldn't care to make public at present and it is one on which i am sure you will back me i heard that mr transome was here so i ventured to come i hope you will both excuse me as my business refers to some electioneering measures which are being taken by mr transome's agents pray go on said harold expecting something unpleasant i'm not going to speak against treating voters said felix i suppose buttered ale and grease of that sort to make the wheels go belong to the necessary humbug of representation but i wish to ask you mr transome whether it is with your knowledge that agents of yours are bribing rough fellows who are no voters the colliers and navvies at sproxton with the chance of extra drunkenness that they may make a posse on your side at the nomination and polling certainly not said harold you are aware my dear sir that a candidate is very much at the mercy of his agents as to the means by which he is returned especially when many years' absence has made him a stranger to the men actually conducting business but are you sure of your facts as sure as my senses can make me said felix who then briefly described what had happened on sunday i believed that you were ignorant of all this mr transome he ended and that was why i thought some good might be done by speaking to you if not i should be tempted to expose the whole affair as a disgrace to the radical party i'm a radical myself and mean to work all my life long against privilege monopoly and oppression but i would rather be a livery servant proud of my master's title than i would seem to make common cause with scoundrels who turn the best hopes of men into by words for cant and dishonesty your energetic protest is needless here sir said harold offended at what sounded like a threat and was certainly premature enough to be in bad taste in fact this error of behavior in felix proceeded from a repulsion which was mutual it was a constant source of irritation to him that the public men on his side were on the whole not conspicuously better than the public men on the other side that the spirit of innovation which with him was a part of religion was in many of its mouthpieces no more of a religion than the faith in rotten boroughs and he was thus predisposed to distrust harold transome harold in his turn disliked impracticable notions of loftiness and purity disliked all enthusiasm and he thought he saw a very troublesome vigorous incorporation of that nonsense in felix but it would be foolish to exasperate him in any way if you choose to accompany me to jermyn's office he went on the matter shall be enquired into in your presence i think you will agree with me mr lyon that this will be the most satisfactory course doubtless said the minister who liked the candidate very well and believed that he would be amenable to argument and i would caution my young friend against a too great hastiness of words and action david's cause against saul was a righteous one nevertheless not all who clave unto david were righteous men the more was the pity sir said felix especially if he winked at their malpractices mr lyon smiled shook his head and stroked his favorite's arm deprecatingly it is rather too much for any man to keep the consciences of all his party said harold if you had lived in the east as i have you would be more tolerant for example of an active industrious selfishness such as we have here though it may not always be quite scrupulous you would see how much better it is than an idle selfishness i have heard it said a bridge is a good thing worth helping to make though half the men who worked at it were rogues oh yes said felix scornfully give me a handful of generalities and analogies and i'll undertake to justify burke and hare and prove them benefactors of their species i'll tolerate no nuisances but such as i can't help and the question now is not whether we can do away with all the nuisances in the world but with a particular nuisance under our noses then we had better cut the matter short as i propose by going at once to jermyn's said harold in that case i must bid you good morning mr lyon i would fain said the minister looking uneasy i would fain have had a further opportunity of considering that question of the ballot with you the reasons against it need not be urged lengthily they only require complete enumeration to prevent any seeming hiatus where an opposing fallacy might thrust itself in never fear sir said harold shaking mr lyon's hand cordially there will be opportunities shall i not see you in the committee room to morrow i think not said mr lyon rubbing his brow with a sad remembrance of his personal anxieties but i will send you if you will permit me a brief writing on which you can meditate at your leisure i shall be delighted good bye harold and felix went out together and the minister going up to his dull study asked himself whether under the pressure of conflicting experience he had faithfully discharged the duties of the past interview if a cynical sprite were present riding on one of the motes in that dusty room he may have made himself merry at the illusions of the little minister who brought so much conscience to bear on the production of so slight an effect i confess to smiling myself being sceptical as to the effect of ardent appeals and nice distinctions on gentlemen who are got up both inside and out as candidates in the style of the period but i never smiled at mr lyon's trustful energy without falling to penitence and veneration immediately after for what we call illusions are often in truth a wider vision of past and recent realities a willing movement of a man's soul with the larger sweep of the world's forces a movement toward a more assured end than the chances of a single life we see human heroism broken into units and say this unit did little might as well not have been but in this way we might break up a great army into units in this way we might break the sunlight into fragments and think that this and the other might be cheaply parted with let us rather raise a monument to the soldiers whose brave hearts only kept the ranks unbroken and met death a monument to the faithful who were not famous and who are precious as the continuity of the sunbeams is precious though some of them fall unseen and on barrenness at present looking back on that day at treby it seem to me that the sadder illusion lay with harold transome who was trusting in his own skill to shape the success of his own morrows ignorant of what many yesterdays had determined for him beforehand chapter xvii it is a good and soothfast saw half roasted never will be raw no dough is dried once more to meal no crock new shapen by the wheel you can't turn curds to milk again nor now by wishing back to then and having tasted stolen honey you can't buy innocence for money jermyn was not particularly pleased that some chance had apparently hindered harold transome from making other canvassing visits immediately after leaving mr lyon and so had sent him back to the office earlier than he had been expected to come the inconvenient chance he guessed at once to be represented by felix holt whom he knew very well by trebian report to be a young man with so little of the ordinary christian motives as to making an appearance and getting on in the world that he presented no handle to any judicious and respectable person who might be willing to make use of him harold transome on his side was a great deal annoyed at being worried by felix in an enquiry about electioneering details the real dignity and honesty there was in him made him shrink from this necessity of satisfying a man with a troublesome tongue it was as if he were to show indignation at the discovery of one barrel with a false bottom when he had invested his money in a manufactory where a larger or smaller number of such barrels had always been made a practical man must seek a good end by the only possible means that is to say if he is to get into parliament he must not be too particular it was not disgraceful to be neither a quixote nor a theorist aiming to correct the moral rules of the world but whatever actually was or might prove to be disgraceful harold held in detestation in this mood he pushed on unceremoniously to the inner office without waiting to ask questions and when he perceived that jermyn was not alone he said with haughty quickness a question about the electioneering at sproxton can you give your attention to it at once here is mr holt who has come to me about the business a yes a certainly said jermyn who as usual was the more cool and deliberate because he was vexed he was standing and as he turned round his broad figure concealed the person who was seated writing at the bureau mr holt a will doubtless a make a point of saving a busy man's time you can speak at once this gentleman here jermyn made a slight backward movement of the head is one of ourselves he is a true blue i have simply to complain said felix that one of your agents has been sent on a bribing expedition to sproxton with what purpose you sir may know better than i do mr transome it appears was ignorant of the affair and does not approve it jermyn looking gravely and steadily at felix while he was speaking at the same time drew forth a small sheaf of papers from his side pocket and then as he turned his eyes slowly on harold felt in his waistcoat pocket for his pencil case i don't approve of it at all said harold who hated jermyn's calculated slowness and conceit in his own impenetrability be good enough to put a stop to it will you mr holt i know is an excellent liberal said jermyn just inclining his head to harold and then alternately looking at felix and docketing his bills but he is perhaps too inexperienced to be aware that no canvass a can be conducted without the action of able men who must a be trusted and not interfered with and as to any possibility of promising to put a stop a to any procedure a that depends if he had ever held the coachman's ribbons in his hands as i have in my younger days a he would know that stopping is not always easy i know very little about holding ribbons said felix but i saw clearly enough at once that more mischief had been done than could be well mended though i believe if it were heartily tried the treatment might be reduced and something might be done to hinder the men from turning out in a body to make a noise which might end in worse they might be hindered from making a noise on our side said jermyn smiling that is perfectly true but if they made a noise on the other would your purpose be answered better sir harold was moving about in an irritated manner while felix and jermyn were speaking he preferred leaving the talk to the attorney of whose talk he himself liked to keep as clear as possible i can only say answered felix that if you make use of those heavy fellows when the drink is in them i shouldn't like your responsibility you might as well drive bulls to roar on our side as bribe a set of colliers and navvies to shout and groan a lawyer may well envy your command of language mr holt said jermyn pocketing his bills again and shutting up his pencil but he would not be satisfied with the accuracy a of your terms you must permit me to check your use of the word 'bribery' the essence of bribery is that it should be legally proved there is not such a thing a in rerum natura a as unproved bribery there has been no such thing as bribery at sproxton i'll answer for it the presence of a body of stalwart fellows on a the liberal side will tend to preserve order for we know that the benefit clubs from the pitchley district will show for debarry indeed the gentleman who has conducted the canvass at sproxton is experienced in parliamentary affairs and would not exceed a the necessary measures that a rational judgment would dictate what you mean the man who calls himself johnson said felix in a tone of disgust before jermyn chose to answer harold broke in saying quickly and peremptorily the long and short of it is this mr holt i shall desire and insist that whatever can be done by way of remedy shall be done will that satisfy you you see now some of the candidate's difficulties said harold breaking into his most agreeable smile i hope you will have some pity for me i suppose i must be content said felix not thoroughly propitiated i bid you good morning gentlemen when he was gone out and had closed the door behind him harold turning round and flashing in spite of himself an angry look at jermyn said and who is johnson an alias i suppose it seems you are fond of the name jermyn turned perceptibly paler but disagreeables of this sort between himself and harold had been too much in his anticipations of late for him to be taken by surprise he turned quietly round and just touched the shoulder of the person seated at the bureau who now rose on the contrary jermyn answered the johnson in question is this gentleman whom i have the pleasure of introducing to you as one of my most active helpmates in electioneering business mr johnson of bedford row london i am comparatively a novice a in these matters but he was engaged with james putty in two hardly contested elections and there could scarcely be a better initiation putty is one of the first men of the country as an agent a on the liberal side a eh johnson i think makepiece is a not altogether a match for him not quite of the same calibre a haud consimili ingenio a in tactics a and in experience makepiece is a wonderful man and so is putty said the glib johnson too vain not to be pleased with an opportunity of speaking even when the situation was rather awkward makepiece for scheming but putty for management putty knows men sir he went on turning to harold it's a thousand pities that you have not had his talents employed in your service he's beyond any man for saving a candidate's money does half the work with his tongue he'll talk of anything from the areopagus and that sort of thing down to the joke about 'where are you going paddy' you know what i mean sir 'back again says paddy' an excellent electioneering joke putty understands these things he has said to me 'johnson bear in mind there are two ways of speaking an audience will always like one is to tell them what they don't understand and the other is to tell them what they're used to' i shall never be the man to deny that i owe a great deal to putty i always say it was a most providential thing in the mugham election last year that putty was not on the tory side he managed the women and if you'll believe me sir one fourth of the men would never have voted if their wives hadn't driven them to it for the good of their families and as for speaking it's currently reported in our london circles that putty writes regularly for the times he has that kind of language and i needn't tell you mr transome that it's the apex which i take it means the tiptop and nobody can get higher than that i think i've belonged to a political debating society myself i've heard a little language in my time but when mr jermyn first spoke to me about having the honor to assist in your canvass of north loamshire here johnson played with his watch seals and balanced himself a moment on his toes the very first thing i said was 'and there's garstin has got putty no whig could stand against a whig' i said 'who had putty on his side i hope mr transome goes in for something of a deeper color' i don't say that as a general rule opinions go for much in a return mr transome it depends on who are in the field before you and on the skill of your agents but as a radical and a moneyed radical you are in a fine position sir and with care and judgment with care and judgment it had been impossible to interrupt johnson before without the most impolitic rudeness jermyn was not sorry that he should talk even if he made a fool of himself for in that solid shape exhibiting the average amount of human foibles he seemed less of the alias which harold had insinuated him to be and had all the additional plausibility of a lie with a circumstance harold had thrown himself with contemptuous resignation into a chair had drawn off one of his buff gloves and was looking at his hand but when johnson gave his iteration with a slightly slackened pace harold looked up at him and broke in well then mr johnson i shall be glad if you will use your care and judgment in putting an end as well as you can to this sproxton affair else it may turn out an ugly business excuse me sir i must beg you to look at the matter a little more closely you will see that it is impossible to take a single step backward at sproxton it was a matter of necessity to get the sproxton men else i know to a certainty the other side would have laid hold of them first and now i've undermined garstin's people they'll use their authority and give a little shabby treating but i've taken all the wind out of their sails but if by your orders i or mr jermyn here were to break promise with the honest fellows and offend chubb the publican what would come of it chubb would leave no stone unturned against you sir he would egg on his customers against you the colliers and navvies would be at the nomination and the election all the same or rather not all the same for they would be there against us and instead of hustling people good humoredly by way of a joke and counterbalancing debarry's cheers they'd help to kick the cheering and voting out of our men and instead of being let us say half a dozen ahead of garstin you'd be half a dozen behind him that's all i speak plain english to you mr transome though i've the highest respect for you as a gentleman of first rate talents and position but sir to judge of these things a man must know the english voter and the english publican and it would be a poor tale indeed here mr johnson's mouth took an expression at once bitter and pathetic that a gentleman like you to say nothing of the good of the country should have gone to the expense and trouble of a canvass for nothing but to find himself out of parliament at the end of it i've seen it again and again it looks bad in the cleverest man to have to sing small mr johnson's argument was not the less stringent because his idioms were vulgar it requires a conviction and resolution amounting to heroism not to wince at phrases that class our foreshadowed endurance among those common and ignominious troubles which the world is more likely to sneer at than to pity harold remained a few minutes in angry silence looking at the floor with one hand on his knee and the other on his hat as if he were preparing to start up as to undoing anything that's been done down there said johnson throwing in this observation as something into the bargain i must wash my hands of it sir i couldn't work knowingly against your interest and that young man who is just gone out you don't believe that he need be listened to i hope chubb the publican hates him chubb would guess he was at the bottom of your having the treating stopped and he'd set half a dozen of the colliers to duck him in the canal or break his head by mistake i'm an experienced man sir i hope i've put it clear enough certainly the exposition befits the subject said harold scornfully his dislike of the man johnson's personality being stimulated by causes which jermyn more than conjectured it's a damned unpleasant ravelled business that you and mr jermyn have knit up between you i've no more to say then sir if you've no more commands i don't wish to intrude i shall wish you good morning sir said johnson passing out quickly harold knew that he was indulging his temper and he would probably have restrained it as a foolish move if he had thought there was great danger in it but he was beginning to drop much of his caution and self mastery where jermyn was concerned under the growing conviction that the attorney had very strong reasons for being afraid of him reasons which would only be reinforced by any action hostile to the transome interest as for a sneak like this johnson a gentleman had to pay him not to please him harold had smiles at command in the right place but he was not going to smile when it was neither necessary nor agreeable he was one of those good humored yet energetic men who have the gift of anger hatred and scorn upon occasion though they are too healthy and self contented for such feelings to get generated in them without external occasion and in relation to jermyn the gift was coming into fine exercise a pardon me mr harold said jermyn speaking as soon as johnson went out but i am sorry a you should behave disobligingly to a man who has it in his power to do much service who in fact holds many threads in his hands i admit that a nemo mortalium omnibus horis sapit as we say a speak for yourself said harold i don't talk in tags of latin which might be learned by a school master's foot boy i find the king's english expresses my meaning better in the king's english then said jermyn who could be idiomatic enough when he was stung a candidate should keep his kicks till he's a member oh i suppose johnson will bear a kick if you bid him you're his principal i believe certainly thus far a he is my london agent but he is a man of substance and i shall know what he is if it's necessary i dare say but i must jump into the carriage again i've no time to lose i must go to hawkins at the factory will you go when harold was gone jermyn's handsome face gathered blackness he hardly ever wore his worst expression in the presence of others and but seldom when he was alone for he was not given to believe that any game would ultimately go against him his luck had been good new conditions might always turn up to give him new chances and if affairs threatened to come to an extremity between harold and himself he trusted to finding some sure resource he means to see to the bottom of everything if he can that's quite plain said jermyn to himself i believe he has been getting another opinion he has some new light about those annuities on the estate that are held in johnson's name he has inherited a deuced faculty for business there's no denying that but i shall beg leave to tell him that i've propped up the family i don't know where they would have been without me and if it comes to balancing i know into which scale the gratitude ought to go not that he's likely to feel any but he can feel something else and if he makes signs of setting the dogs on me i shall make him feel it the people named transome owe me a good deal more than i owe them in this way mr jermyn inwardly appealed against an unjust construction which he foresaw that his old acquaintance the law might put on certain items in his history i have known persons who have been suspected of under valuing gratitude and excluding it from the list of virtues but on closer observation it has been seen that if they have never felt grateful it has been for want of an opportunity and that far from despising gratitude they regard it as the virtue most of all incumbent on others toward them chapter xviii the little nameless unremembered acts of kindness and of love wordsworth tintern abbey jermyn did not forget to pay his visit to the minister in malthouse yard that evening the mingled irritation dread and defiance which he was feeling toward harold transome in the middle of the day depended on too many and far stretching causes to be dissipated by eight o'clock but when he left mr lyon's house he was in a state of comparative triumph in the belief that he and he alone was now in possession of facts which once grouped together made a secret that gave him new power over harold mr lyon in his need for help from one who had that wisdom of the serpent which he argued is not forbidden but is only of hard acquirement to dovelike innocence had been gradually led to pour out to the attorney all the reasons which made him desire to know the truth about the man who called himself maurice christian he had shown all the precious relics the locket the letters and the marriage certificate and jermyn had comforted him by confidently promising to ascertain without scandal or premature betrayals whether this man were really annette's husband or maurice christian bycliffe jermyn was not rash in making this promise since he had excellent reasons for believing that he had already come to a true conclusion on the subject but he wished both to know a little more of this man himself and to keep mr lyon in ignorance not a difficult precaution in an affair which it cost the minister so much pain to speak of an easy opportunity of getting an interview with christian was sure to offer itself before long might even offer itself to morrow jermyn had seen him more than once though hitherto without any reason for observing him with interest he had heard that philip debarry's courier was often busy in the town and it seemed specially likely that he would be seen there when the market was to be agitated by politics and the new candidate was to show his paces the world of which treby magna was the centre was naturally curious to see the young transome who had come from the east was as rich as a jew and called himself a radical characteristics all equally vague in the minds of various excellent ratepayers who drove to market in their taxed carts or in their hereditary gigs places at convenient windows had been secured beforehand for a few best bonnets but in general a radical candidate excited no ardent feminine partisanship even among the dissenters in treby if they were of the prosperous and long resident class some chapel going ladies were fond of remembering that their family had been church others objected to politics altogether as having spoiled old neighborliness and sundered friends who had kindred views as to cowslip wine and michaelmas cleaning others of the melancholy sort said it would be well if people would think less of reforming parliament and more of pleasing god irreproachable dissenting matrons like mrs muscat whose youth had been passed in a short waisted bodice and tight skirt had never been animated by the struggle for liberty and had a timid suspicion that religion was desecrated by being applied to the things of this world since mr lyon had been in malthouse yard there had been far too much mixing up of politics with religion but at any rate these ladies had never yet been to hear speechifying in the market place and they were not going to begin that practice esther however had heard some of her feminine acquaintances say that they intended to sit at the druggist's upper window and she was inclined to ask her father if he could think of a suitable place where she also might see and hear two inconsistent motives urged her she knew that felix cared earnestly for public questions and she supposed that he held it one of her deficiencies not to care about them well she would try to learn the secret of this ardor which was so strong in him that it animated what she thought the dullest form of life she was not too stupid to find it out but this self correcting motive was presently displaced by a motive of a different sort it had been a pleasant variety in her monotonous days to see a man like harold transome with a distinguished appearance and polished manners and she would like to see him again he suggested to her that brighter and more luxurious life on which her imagination dwelt without the painful effort it required to conceive the mental condition which would place her in complete sympathy with felix holt it was this less unaccustomed prompting of which she was chiefly conscious when she awaited her father's coming down to breakfast why indeed should she trouble herself so much about felix mr lyon more serene now that he had unbosomed his anxieties and obtained a promise of help was already swimming so happily in the deep water of polemics in expectation of philip debarry's answer to his challenge that in the occupation of making a few notes lest certain felicitous inspirations should be wasted he had forgotten to come down to breakfast esther suspecting his abstraction went up to his study and found him at his desk looking up with wonder at her interruption come father you have forgotten your breakfast it is true child i will come he said lingering to make some final strokes oh you naughty father said esther as he got up from his chair your coat collar is twisted your waistcoat is buttoned all wrong and you have not brushed your hair sit down and let me brush it again as i did yesterday he sat down obediently while esther took a towel which she threw over his shoulders and then brushed the thick long fringe of soft auburn hair this very trifling act which she had brought herself to for the first time yesterday meant a great deal in esther's little history it had been her habit to leave the mending of her father's clothes to lyddy she had not liked even to touch his cloth garments still less had it seemed a thing she would willingly undertake to correct his toilette and use a brush for him but having once done this under her new sense of faulty omission the affectionateness that was in her flowed so pleasantly as she saw how much her father was moved by what he thought a great act of tenderness that she quite longed to repeat it this morning as he sat under her hands his face had such a calm delight in it that she could not help kissing the top of his bald head and afterward when they were seated at breakfast she said merrily father i shall make a petit matre of you by and by your hair looks so pretty and silken when it is well brushed nay child i trust that while i would willingly depart from my evil habit of a somewhat slovenly forgetfulness in my attire i shall never arrive at the opposite extreme for though there is that in apparel which pleases the eye and i deny not that your neat gown and the color thereof which is that of certain little flowers that spread themselves in the hedgerows and make a blueness there as of the sky when it is deepened in the water i deny not i say that these minor strivings after a perfection which is as it were an irrecoverable yet haunting memory are a good in their proportion nevertheless the brevity of our life and the hurry and crush of the great battle with error and sin often oblige us to an advised neglect of what is less momentous this i conceive is the principle on which my friend felix holt acts and i cannot but think the light comes from the true fount though it shines through obstructions you have not seen mr holt since sunday have you father yes he was here yesterday he sought mr transome having a matter of some importance to speak upon with him and i saw him afterward in the street when he agreed that i should call for him this morning before i go into the market place he will have it mr lyon went on smiling that i must not walk about in the crowd without him to act as my special constable esther felt vexed with herself that her heart was suddenly beating with unusual quickness and that her last resolution not to trouble herself about what felix thought had transformed itself with magic swiftness into mortification that he evidently avoided coming to the house when she was there though he used to come on the slightest occasion he knew that she was always at home until the afternoon on market days that was the reason why he would not call for her father of course it was because he attributed such littleness to her that he supposed she would retain nothing else than a feeling of offence toward him for what he had said to her such distrust of any good in others such arrogance of immeasurable superiority was extremely ungenerous but presently she said i should have liked to hear mr transome speak but i suppose it is too late to get a place now i am not sure i would fain have you go if you desire it my dear said mr lyon who could not bear to deny esther any lawful wish walk with me to mrs holt's and we will learn from felix who will doubtless already have been out whether or not he could lead you in safety to friend lambert's esther was glad of the proposal because if it answered no other purpose it would be an easy way of obliging felix to see her and of showing him that it was not she who cherished offence but when later in the morning she was walking toward mrs holt's with her father they met mr jermyn who stopped them to ask in his most affable manner whether miss lyon intended to hear the candidate and whether she had secured a suitable place and he ended by insisting that his daughters who were presently coming in an open carriage should call for her if she would permit them it was impossible to refuse this civility and esther turned back to await the carriage pleased with the certainty of hearing and seeing yet sorry to miss felix there was another day for her to think of him with unsatisfied resentment mixed with some longings for a better understanding and in our spring time every day has its hidden growths in the mind as it has in the earth when the little folded blades are getting ready to pierce the ground chapter xix consistency i never changed my mind which is and always was to live at ease it was only in the time of summer fairs that the market place had ever looked more animated than it did under that autumn midday sun there were plenty of blue cockades and streamers faces at all the windows and a crushing buzzing crowd urging each other backward and forward round the small hustings in front of the ram inn which showed its more plebeian sign at right angles with the venerable marquis of granby sometimes there were scornful shouts sometimes a rolling cascade of cheers sometimes the shriek of a penny whistle but above all these fitful and feeble sounds the fine old church tower which looked down from above the trees on the other side of the narrow stream sent vibrating at every quarter the sonorous tones of its great bell the good queen bess two carriages with blue ribbons on the harness were conspicuous near the hustings one was jermyn's filled with the brilliantly attired daughters accompanied by esther whose quieter dress helped to mark her out for attention as the most striking of the group the other was harold transome's but in this there was no lady only the olive skinned dominic whose acute yet mild face was brightened by the occupation of amusing little harry and rescuing from his tyrannies a king charles puppy with big eyes much after the pattern of the boy's this trebian crowd did not count for much in the political force of the nation but it was not the less determined as to lending or not lending its ears no man was permitted to speak from the platform except harold and his uncle lingon though in the interval of expectation several liberals had come forward among these ill advised persons the one whose attempt met the most emphatic resistance was rufus lyon this might have been taken for resentment at the unreasonableness of the cloth that not content with pulpits from whence to tyrannize over the ears of men wishes to have the larger share of the platforms but it was not so for mr lingon was heard with much cheering and would have been welcomed again the rector of little treby had been a favorite in the neighborhood since the beginning of the century a clergyman thoroughly unclerical in his habits had a piquancy about him which made him a sort of practical joke he had always been called jack lingon or parson jack sometimes in older and less serious days even cock fighting jack he swore a little when the point of a joke seemed to demand it and was fond of wearing a colored bandana tied loosely over his cravat together with large brown leather leggings he spoke in a pithy familiar way that people could understand and had none of that frigid mincingness called dignity which some have thought a peculiar clerical disease in fact he was a charicter something cheerful to think of not entirely out of connection with sunday and sermons and it seemed in keeping that he should have turned sharp round in politics his opinions being only part of the excellent joke called parson jack when his red eagle face and white hair were seen on the platform the dissenters hardly cheered this questionable radical but to make amends all the tory farmers gave him a friendly hurray let's hear what old jack will say for himself was the predominant feeling among them he'll have something funny to say i'll bet a penny it was only lawyer labron's young clerks and their hangers on who were sufficiently dead to trebian traditions to assail the parson with various sharp edged interjections such as broken shells and cries of cock a doodle doo come now my lads he began in his full pompous yet jovial tones thrusting his hands into the stuffed out pockets of his greatcoat i'll tell you what i'm a parson you know i ought to return good for evil so here are some good nuts for you to crack in return for your shells there was a roar of laughter and cheering as he threw handfuls of nuts and filberts among the crowd come now you'll say i used to be a tory and some of you whose faces i know as well as i know the head of my own crab stick will say that's why i'm a good fellow but now i'll tell you something else it's for that very reason that i used to be a tory and am a good fellow that i go along with my nephew here who is a thorough going liberal for will anybody here come forward and say 'a good fellow has no need to tack about and change his road' no there's not one of you such a tom noddy what's good for one time is bad for another if anybody contradicts that ask him to eat pickled pork when he's thirsty and to bathe in the lapp there when the spikes of ice are shooting and that's the reason why the men who are the best liberals now are the very men who used to be the best tories there isn't a nastier horse than your horse that'll jib and back and turn round when there is but one road for him to go and that's the road before him and my nephew here he comes of a tory breed you know i'll answer for the lingons in the old tory times there was never a pup belonged to a lingon but would howl if a whig came near him the lingon blood is good rich old tory blood like good rich milk and that's why when the right time comes it throws up a liberal cream the best sort of tory turns to the best sort of radical there's plenty of radical scum i say beware of the scum and look but for the cream and here's my nephew some of the cream if there is any none of your whigs none of your painted water that looks as if it ran and it's standing still all the while none of your spinning jenny fellows a gentleman but up to all sorts of business i'm no fool myself i'm forced to wink a good deal for fear of seeing too much for a neighborly man must let himself be cheated a little but though i've never been out of my own country i know less about it than my nephew does you may tell what he is and only look at him there's one sort of fellow sees nothing but the end of his own nose and another sort that sees nothing but the hinder side of the moon but my nephew harold is of another sort he sees everything that's at hitting distance and he's not one to miss his mark a good looking man in his prime not a greenhorn not a shrivelled old fellow who'll come to speak to you and find he's left his teeth at home by mistake harold transome will do you credit if anybody says the radicals are a set of sneaks brummagem half pennies scamps who want to play pitch and toss with the property of the country you can say 'look at the member for north loamshire' and mind what you'll hear him say he'll go in for making everything right poor laws and charities and church he wants to reform 'em all perhaps you'll say 'there's that parson lingon talking about church reform why he belongs to the church himself he wants reforming too' well well wait a bit and you'll hear by and by that old parson lingon is reformed shoots no more cracks his joke no more has drunk his last bottle the dogs the old pointers will be sorry but you'll hear that the parson at little treby is a new man that's what church reform is sure to come to before long so now here are some more nuts for you lads and i leave you to listen to your candidate here he is give him a good hurray wave your hats and i'll begin hurray harold had not been quite confident beforehand as to the good effect of his uncle's introduction but he was soon reassured there was no acrid partisanship among the old fashioned tories who mustered strong about the marquis of granby and parson jack had put them in a good humor harold's only interruption came from his own party the oratorical clerk at the factory acting as the tribune of the dissenting interest and feeling bound to put questions might have been troublesome but his voice being unpleasantly sharp while harold's was full and penetrating the questioning was cried down harold's speech did it was not of the glib nonsensical sort not ponderous not hesitating which is as much as to say that it was remarkable among british speeches read in print the next day perhaps it would be neither pregnant nor conclusive which is saying no more than that its excellence was not of an abnormal kind but such as is usually found in the best efforts of eloquent candidates accordingly the applause drowned the opposition and content predominated but perhaps the moment of most diffusive pleasure from public speaking is that in which the speech ceases and the audience can turn to commenting on it the one speech sometimes uttered under great responsibility as to missiles and other consequences has given a text to twenty speakers who are under no responsibility even in the days of duelling a man was not challenged for being a bore nor does this quality apparently hinder him from being much invited to dinner which is the great index of social responsibility in a less barbarous age certainly the crowd in the market place seemed to experience this culminating enjoyment when the speaking on the platform in front of the ram had ceased and there were no less than three orators holding forth from the elevation of chance vehicles not at all to the prejudice of the talking among those who were on a level with their neighbors there was little ill humor among the listeners for queen bess was striking the last quarter before two and a savory smell from the inn kitchens inspired them with an agreeable consciousness that the speakers were helping to trifle away the brief time before dinner two or three of harold's committee had lingered talking to each other on the platform instead of re entering and jermyn after coming out to speak to one of them had turned to the corner near which the carriages were standing that he might tell the transome's coachman to drive round to the side door and signal to his own coachman to follow but a dialogue which was going on below induced him to pause and instead of giving the order to assume the air of a careless gazer christian whom the attorney had already observed looking out of a window at the marquis of granby was talking to dominic the meeting appeared to be one of new recognition for christian was saying you've not got gray as i have mr lenoni you're not a day older for the sixteen years but no wonder you didn't know me i'm bleached like a dried bone not so it is true i was confused a meenute i could put your face nowhere but after that naples came behind it and i said mr creesstian and so you reside at the manor and i am at transome court ah it's a thousand pities you're not on our side else we might have dined together at the marquis said christian eh could you manage it he added languidly knowing there was no chance of a yes no much obliged couldn't leave the leetle boy ahi arry arry pinch not poor moro while dominic was answering christian had stared about him as his manner was when he was being spoken to and had had his eyes arrested by esther who was leaning forward to look at mr harold transome's extraordinary little gypsy of a son but happening to meet christian's stare she felt annoyed drew back and turned away her head coloring who are those ladies said christian in a low tone to dominic as if he had been startled into a sudden wish for this information they are meester jermyn's daughters said dominic who knew nothing either of the lawyer's family or of esther christian looked puzzled a moment or two and was silent oh well au revoir he said kissing the tips of his fingers as the coachman having had jermyn's order began to urge on the horses does he see some likeness in the girl thought jermyn as he turned away i wish i hadn't invited her to come in the carriage as it happens chapter xx good earthenware pitchers sir of an excellent quaint pattern and sober color the market dinner at the marquis was in high repute in treby and its neighborhood the frequenters of this three and sixpenny ordinary liked to allude to it as men allude to anything which implies that they move in good society and habitually converse with those who are in the secret of the highest affairs the guests were not only such rural residents as had driven to market but some of the most substantial townsmen who had always assured their wives that business required this weekly sacrifice of domestic pleasure the poorer farmers who put up at the ram or the seven stars where there was no fish felt their disadvantage bearing it modestly or bitterly as the case might be and although the marquis was a tory house devoted to debarry it was too much to expect that such tenants of the transomes as had always been used to dine there should consent to eat a worse dinner and sit with worse company because they suddenly found themselves under a radical landlord opposed to the political party known as sir maxim's hence the recent political divisions had not reduced the handsome length of the table at the marquis and the many gradations of dignity from mr wace the brewer to the rich butcher from leek malton who always modestly took the lowest seat though without the reward of being asked to come up higher had not been abbreviated by any secessions to day there was an extra table spread for expected supernumeraries and it was at this that christian took his place with some of the younger farmers who had almost a sense of dissipation in talking to a man of his questionable station and unknown experience the provision was especially liberal and on the whole the presence of a minority destined to vote for transome was a ground for joking which added to the good humor of the chief talkers a respectable old acquaintance turned radical rather against his will was rallied with even greater gusto than if his wife had had twins twice over the best trebian tories were far too sweet blooded to turn against such old friends and to make no distinction between them and the radical dissenting papistical deistical set with whom they never dined and probably never saw except in their imagination but the talk was necessarily in abeyance until the more serious business of dinner was ended and the wine spirits and tobacco raised mere satisfaction into beatitude among the frequent though not regular guests whom every one was glad to see was mr nolan the retired london hosier a wiry old gentleman past seventy whose square tight forehead with its rigid hedge of gray hair whose bushy eyebrows sharp dark eyes and remarkable hooked nose gave a handsome distinction to his face in the midst of rural physiognomies he had married a miss pendrell early in life when he was a poor young londoner and the match had been thought as bad as ruin by her family but fifteen years ago he had had the satisfaction of bringing his wife to settle amongst her own friends and of being received with pride as a brother in law retired from business possessed of unknown thousands and of a most agreeable talent for anecdote and conversation generally no question had ever been raised as to mr nolan's extraction on the strength of his hooked nose or of his name being baruch hebrew names ran in the best saxon families the bible accounted for them and no one among the uplands and hedgerows of that district was suspected of having an oriental origin unless he carried a peddler's jewel box certainly whatever genealogical research might have discovered the worthy baruch nolan was so free from any distinctive marks of religious persuasion he went to church with so ordinary an irregularity and so often grumbled at the sermon that there was no ground for classing him otherwise than with good trebian churchmen he was generally regarded as a good looking old gentleman and a certain thin eagerness in his aspect was attributed to the life of the metropolis where narrow space had the same sort of effect on men as on thickly planted trees mr nolan always ordered his pint of port which after he had sipped it a little was wont to animate his recollections of the royal family and the various ministries which had been contemporary with the successive stages of his prosperity he was always listened to with interest a man who had been born in the year when good old king george came to the throne who had been acquainted with the nude leg of the prince regent and hinted at private reasons for believing that the princess charlotte ought not to have died had conversational matter as special to his auditors as marco polo could have had on his return from his asiatic travel my good sir he said to mr wace as he crossed his knees and spread his silk handkerchief over them transome may be returned or he may not be returned that's a question for north loamshire but it makes little difference to the kingdom i don't want to say things which may put younger men out of spirits but i believe this country has seen it's best days i do indeed i am sorry to hear it from one of your experience mr nolan said the brewer a large happy looking man i'd make a good fight myself before i'd leave a worse world for my boys than i've found for myself there isn't a greater pleasure than doing a bit of planting and improving one's buildings and investing one's money in some pretty acres of land and when it turns up here and there land you've known from a boy it's a nasty thought that these radicals are to turn things round so as one can calculate on nothing one doesn't like it for one's self and one doesn't like it for one's neighbors but somehow i believe it won't do if we can't trust the government just now there's providence and the good sense of the country and there's a right in things that's what i've always said there's a right in things the heavy end will get downmost and if church and king and every man being sure of his own are things good for this country there's a god above will take care of 'em it won't do my dear sir said mr nolan it won't do when peel and the duke turned round about the catholics in ' i saw it was all over with us we could never trust ministers any more it was to keep off a rebellion they said but i say it was to keep their places they're monstrously fond of place both of them that i know here mr nolan changed the crossing of his legs and gave a deep cough conscious of having made a point then he went on what we want is a king with a good will of his own if we'd had that we shouldn't have heard what we've heard to day reform would never have come to this pass when our good old king george iii heard his ministers talking about catholic emancipation he boxed their ears all round ah poor soul he did indeed gentlemen ended mr nolan shaken by a deep laugh of admiration well now that's something like a king said mr crowder who was an eager listener it was uncivil though how did they take it said mr timothy rose a gentleman farmer from leek malton against whose independent position nature had provided the safeguard of a spontaneous servility his large porcine cheeks round twinkling eyes and thumbs habitually twirling expressed a concentrated effort not to get into trouble and to speak everybody fair except when they were safely out of hearing take it they'd be obliged to take it said the impetuous young joyce a farmer of superior information have you ever heard of the king's prerogative i don't say but what i have said rose retreating i've nothing against it nothing at all no but the radicals have said young joyce winking the prerogative is what they want to clip close they want us to be governed by delegates from the trades unions who are to dictate to everybody and make everything square to their mastery they're a pretty set now these delegates said mr wace with disgust i once heard two of 'em spouting away they're a sort of fellow i'd never employ in my brewery or anywhere else i've seen it again and again if a man takes to tongue work it's all over with him 'everything's wrong' says he that's a big text but does he want to make everything right not he he'd lose his text 'we want every man's good' say they why they never knew yet what a man's good is how should they it's working for his victual not getting a slice of other people's ay ay said young joyce cordially i should just have liked all the delegates in the country mustered for our yeomanry to go into that's all they'd see where the strength of old england lay then you may tell what it is for a country to trust to trade when it breeds such spindling fellows as those that isn't the fault of trade my good sir said mr nolan who was often a little pained by the defects of provincial culture trade properly conducted is good for a man's constitution i could have shown you in my time weavers past seventy with all their faculties as sharp as a pen knife doing without spectacles it's the new system of trade that's to blame a country can't have too much trade if it's properly managed plenty of sound tories have made their fortune by trade you've heard of calibut co everybody has heard of calibut well sir i knew old mr calibut as well as i know you he was once a crony of mine in a city warehouse and now i'll answer for it he has a larger rent roll than lord wyvern bless your soul his subscriptions to charities would make a fine income for a nobleman and he's as good a tory as i am and as for his town establishment why how much butter do you think is consumed there annually mr nolan paused and then his face glowed with triumph as he answered his own question why gentlemen not less than two thousand pounds of butter during the few months the family is in town trade makes property my good sir and property is conservative as they say now calibut's son in law is lord fortinbras he paid me a large debt on his marriage it's all one web sir the prosperity of the country is one web to be sure said christian who smoking his cigar with his chair turned away from the table was willing to make himself agreeable in the conversation we can't do without nobility look at france when they got rid of the old nobles they were obliged to make new true very true said mr nolan who thought christian a little too wise for his position but could not resist the rare gift of an instance in point it's the french revolution that has done us harm here it was the same at the end of the last century but the war kept it off mr pitt saved us i knew mr pitt i had a particular interview with him once he joked me about getting the length of his foot 'mr nolan' said he 'there are those on the other side of the water whose name begins with n who would be glad to know what you know' i was recommended to send an account of that to the newspapers after his death poor man but i'm not fond of that kind of show myself mr nolan swung his upper leg a little and pinched his lip between his thumb and finger naturally pleased with his own moderation no no very right said mr wace cordially but you never said a truer word than that about property if a man's got a bit of property a stake in the country he'll want to keep things square where jack isn't safe tom's in danger but that's what makes it such an uncommonly nasty thing that a man like transome should take up with these radicals it's my belief he does it only to get into parliament he'll turn round when he gets there come dibbs there's something to put you in spirits added mr wace raising his voice a little and looking at a guest lower down you've got to vote for a radical with one side of your mouth and make a wry face with the other but he'll turn round by and by as parson jack says he's got the right sort of blood in him i don't care two straws who i vote for said dibbs sturdily i'm not going to make a wry face it stands to reason a man should vote for his landlord my farm's in good condition and i've got the best pasture on the estate the rot's never come nigh me let them grumble as are on the wrong side of the hedge i wonder if jermyn'll bring him in though said mr sircome the great miller he's an uncommon fellow for carrying things through i know he brought me through that suit about my weir it cost a pretty penny but he brought me through it's a bit of a pill for him too having to turn radical said mr wace they say he counted on making friends with sir maximus by this young one coming home and joining with mr philip but i'll bet a penny he brings transome in said mr sircome folks say he hasn't got many votes hereabout but toward duffield and all there where the radicals are everybody's for him eh mr christian come you're at the fountain head what do they say about it now at the manor when general attention was called to christian young joyce looked down at his own legs and touched the curves of his own hair as if measuring his own approximation to that correct copy of a gentleman mr wace turned his head to listen for christian's answer with that tolerance of inferiority which becomes men in places of public resort they think it will be a hard run between transome and garstin said christian it depends on transome's getting plumpers well i know i shall not split for garstin said mr wace it's nonsense for debarry's voters to split for a whig a man's either a tory or not a tory it seems reasonable there should be one of each side said mr timothy rose i don't like showing favor either way if one side can't lower the poor's rates and take off the tithe let the other try but there's this in it wace said mr sircome i'm not altogether against the whigs for they don't want to go so far as the radicals do and when they find they've slipped a bit too far they'll hold on all the tighter and the whigs have got the upper hand now and it's no use fighting with the current i run with the mr sircome checked himself looked furtively at christian and to divert criticisms ended with eh mr nolan there have been eminent whigs sir mr fox was a whig said mr nolan mr fox was a great orator he was very intimate with the prince of wales i've seen him and the duke of york too go home by daylight with their hats crushed mr fox was a great leader of opposition government requires an opposition the whigs should always be in opposition and the tories on the ministerial side that's what the country used to like 'the whigs for salt and mustard the tories for meat' mr gottlib the banker used to say to me mr gottlib was a worthy man when there was a great run on mr gottlib's bank in ' i saw a gentleman come in with bags of gold and say 'tell mr gottlib there's plenty more where that came from' it stopped the run gentlemen it did indeed this anecodote was received with great admiration but mr sircome returned to the previous question there now you see wace it's right there should be whigs as well as tories pitt and fox i've always heard them go together well i don't like garstin said the brewer i didn't like his conduct about the canal company of the two i like transome best if a nag is to throw me i say let him have some blood as for blood wace said mr salt the wool factor a bilious man who only spoke when there was a good opportunity of contradicting ask my brother in law labron a little about that these transomes are not the old blood well they're the oldest that's forthcoming i suppose said mr wace laughing unless you believe in mad old tommy trounsem i wonder where that old poaching fellow is now i saw him half drunk the other day said young joyce he'd got a flag basket with handbills in it over his shoulder i thought the old fellow was dead said mr wace hey why jermyn he went on merrily as he turned round and saw the attorney entering you radical how dare you show yourself in this tory house come this is going a bit too far we don't mind old harry managing our law for us that's his proper business from time immemorial but but a said jermyn smiling always ready to carry on a joke to which his slow manner gave the piquancy of surprise if he meddles with politics he must be a tory jermyn was not afraid to show himself anywhere in treby he knew many people were not exactly fond of him but a man can do without that if he is prosperous a provincial lawyer in those old fashioned days was as independent of personal esteem as if he had been a lord chancellor there was a good humored laugh at this upper end of the room as jermyn seated himself at about an equal angle between mr wace and christian we were talking about old tommy trounsem you remember him they say he's turned up again said mr wace ah said jermyn indifferently but a wace i'm very busy to day but i wanted to see you about that bit of land of yours at the corner of pod's end i've had a handsome offer for you i'm not at liberty to say from whom but an offer that ought to tempt you it won't tempt me said mr wace peremptorily if i've got a bit of land i'll keep it it's hard enough to get hereabouts then i'm to understand that you refuse all negotiation said jermyn who had ordered a glass of sherry and was looking around slowly as he sipped it till his eyes seemed to rest for the first time on christian though he had seen him at once on entering the room unless one of the confounded railways should come but then i'll stand out and make 'em bleed for it there was a murmur of approbation the railways were a public wrong much denunciated in treby a mr philip debarry at the manor now said jermyn suddenly questioning christian in a haughty tone of superiority which he often chose to use no said christian he is expected to morrow morning ah jermyn paused a moment or two and then said you are sufficiently in his confidence i think to carry a message to him with a small document mr debarry has often trusted me so far said christian with much coolness but if the business is yours you can probably find some one you know better there was a little winking and grimacing among those of the company who heard this answer a true a said jermyn not showing any offence if you decline but i think if you will do me the favor to step round to my residence on your way back and learn the business you will prefer carrying it yourself at my residence if you please not my office oh very well said christian i shall be very happy christian never allowed himself to be treated as a servant by anyone but his master and his master treated a servant more deferentially than an equal will it be five o'clock what hour shall we say said jermyn christian looked at his watch and said about five i can be there very good said jermyn finishing his sherry well a wace a so you will hear nothing about pod's end not i a mere pocket handkerchief not enough to swear by a here jermyn's face broke into a smile without a magnifying glass never mind it's mine into the bowels of the earth and up to the sky i can build the tower of babel on it if i like eh mr nolan a bad investment my good sir said mr nolan who enjoyed a certain flavor of infidelity in this smart reply and laughed much at it in his inward way see now how blind you tories are said jermyn rising if i had been your lawyer i'd have had you make another forty shilling freeholder with that land and all in time for this election but a the verbum sapientibus comes a little too late now jermyn was moving away as he finished speaking but mr wace called out after him we're not so badly off for votes as you are good sound votes that'll stand the revising barrister debarry at the top of the poll the lawyer was already out of the doorway chapter xxi 'tis grievous that with all amplification of travel both by sea and land a man can never separate himself from his past history mr jermyn's handsome house stood a little way out of the town surrounded by garden and lawn and plantations of hopeful trees as christian approached it he was in a perfectly easy state of mind the business he was going on was none of his otherwise than as he was well satisfied with any opportunity of making himself valuable to mr philip debarry as he looked at jermyn's length of wall and iron railing he said to himself these lawyers are the fellows for getting on in the world with the least expense of civility with this cursed conjuring secret of theirs called law they think everybody is frightened at them my lord jermyn seems to have his insolence as ready as his soft sawder he's as sleek as a rat and has as vicious a tooth i know the sort of vermin well enough i've helped to fatten one or two in this mood of conscious contemptuous penetration christian was shown by the footman into jermyn's private room where the attorney sat surrounded with massive oaken bookcases and other furniture to correspond from the thickest legged library table to the calendar frame and card rack it was the sort of a room a man prepares for himself when he feels sure of a long and respectable future he was leaning back in his leather chair against the broad window opening on the lawn and had just taken off his spectacles and let the newspaper fall on his knees in despair of reading by the fading light when the footman opened the door and said mr christian jermyn said good evening mr christian be seated pointing to a chair opposite himself and the window light the candles on the shelf john but leave the blinds alone he did not speak again till the man was gone out but appeared to be referring to a document which lay on the bureau before him when the door was closed he drew himself up again began to rub his hands and turned toward his visitor who seemed perfectly indifferent to the fact that the attorney was in shadow and that the light fell on himself a your name a is henry scaddon there was a start through christian's frame which he was quick enough almost simultaneously to try and disguise as a change of position he uncrossed his legs and unbuttoned his coat but before he had time to say anything jermyn went on with slow emphasis you were born on the sixteenth of december at blackheath your father was a cloth merchant in london he died when you were barely of age leaving an extensive business before you were five and twenty you had run through the greater part of the property and had compromised your safety by an attempt to defraud your creditors subsequently you forged a check on your father's elder brother who had intended to make you his heir here jermyn paused a moment and referred to the document christian was silent in you found it expedient to leave this country in a military disguise and were taken prisoner by the french on the occasion of an exchange of prisoners you had the opportunity of returning to your own country and to the bosom of your own family you were generous enough to sacrifice that prospect in favor of a fellow prisoner of about your own age and figure who had more pressing reasons than yourself for wishing to be on this side of the water you exchanged dress luggage and names with him and he passed to england instead of you as henry scaddon almost immediately afterward you escaped from your imprisonment after feigning an illness which prevented your exchange of names from being discovered and it was reported that you that is you under the name of your fellow prisoner were drowned in an open boat trying to reach a neapolitan vessel bound for malta nevertheless i have to congratulate you on the falsehood of that report and on the certainty that you are now after the lapse of more than twenty years seated here in perfect safety jermyn paused so long that he was evidently awaiting some answer at last christian replied in a dogged tone well sir i've heard much longer stories than that told quite as solemnly when there was not a word of truth in them suppose i deny the very peg you hang your statement on suppose i say i am not henry scaddon a in that case a said jermyn with wooden indifference you would lose the advantage which a may attach to your possession of henry scaddon's knowledge and at the same time if it were in the least a inconvenient to you that you should be recognized as henry scaddon your denial would not prevent me from holding the knowledge and evidence which i possess on that point it would only prevent us from pursuing the present conversation well sir suppose we admit for the sake of the conversation that your account of the matter is the true one what advantage have you to offer the man named henry scaddon the advantage a is problematical but it may be considerable it might in fact release you from the necessity of acting as courier or a valet or whatever other office you may occupy which prevents you from being your own master on the other hand my acquaintance with your secret is not necessarily a disadvantage to you to put the matter in a nutshell i am not inclined a gratuitously to do you any harm and i may be able to do you a considerable service which you want me to earn somehow said christian you offer me a turn in a lottery precisely the matter in question is of no earthly interest to you except a as it may yield you a prize we lawyers have to do with complicated questions and a legal subtleties which are never a fully known even to the parties immediately interested still less to the witnesses shall we agree then that you continue to retain two thirds of the name which you gained by exchange and that you oblige me by answering certain questions as to the experience of henry scaddon very good go on what articles of property once belonging to your fellow prisoner maurice christian bycliffe do you still retain this ring said christian twirling round the fine seal ring on his finger his watch and the little matters that hung with it and a case of papers i got rid of a gold snuff box once when i was hard up the clothes are all gone of course we exchanged everything it was all done in a hurry bycliffe thought we should meet again in england before long and he was mad to get there but that was impossible i mean that we should meet soon after i don't know what's become of him else i would give him up his papers and the watch and so on though you know it was i who did him the service and he felt that you were at vesoul together before being moved to verdun yes what else do you know about bycliffe oh nothing very particular said christian pausing and rapping his boot with his cane he'd been in the hanoverian army a high spirited fellow took nothing easily not over strong in health he made a fool of himself with marrying at vesoul and there was the devil to pay with the girl's relations and then when the prisoners were ordered off they had to part whether they ever got together again i don't know was the marriage all right then oh all on the square civil marriage church everything bycliffe was a fool a good natured proud headstrong fellow how long did the marriage take place before you left vesoul about three months i was witness to the marriage and you know no more about the wife not afterward i knew her very well before pretty annette annette ledru was her name she was of a good family and they had made up a fine match for her but she was one of your meek little diablesses who have a will of their own once in their lives the will to choose their own master bycliffe was not open to you about his other affairs oh no a fellow you wouldn't dare to ask a question of people told him everything but he told nothing in return if madame annette ever found him again she found her lord and master with a vengeance but she was a regular lapdog however her family shut her up made a prisoner of her to prevent her running away ah good much of what you have been so obliging as to say is irrelevant to any possible purpose of mine which in fact has only to do with a mouldy law case that might be aired some day you will doubtless on your own account maintain perfect silence on what has passed between us and with that condition duly preserved a it is possible that a the lottery you have put into as you observe may turn up a prize this then is all the business you have with me said christian rising all you will of course preserve carefully all the papers and other articles which have so many a recollections a attached to them oh yes if there's any chance of bycliffe turning up again i shall be sorry to have parted with the snuff box but i was hard up at naples in fact as you see i was obliged at last to turn courier an exceedingly agreeable life for a man of some a accomplishments and a no income said jermyn rising and reaching a candle which he placed against his desk christian knew this was a sign that he was expected to go but he lingered standing with one hand on the back of his chair at last he said rather sulkily i think you're too clever mr jermyn not to perceive that i'm not a man to be made a fool of well a it may perhaps be a still better guarantee for you said jermyn smiling that i see no use in attempting that a metamorphosis the old gentleman who ought never to have felt himself injured is dead now and i'm not afraid of creditors after more than twenty years certainly not a there may indeed be claims which can't assert themselves a legally which yet are molesting to a man of some reputation but you may perhaps be happily free from such fears jermyn drew round his chair toward the bureau and christian too acute to persevere uselessly said good day and left the room after leaning back in his chair to reflect a few minutes jermyn wrote the following letter dear johnson i learn from your letter received this morning that you intend returning to town on saturday while you are there be so good as to see medwin who used to be with batt cowley and ascertain from him indirectly and in the course of conversation on other topics whether in that old business in scaddon alias bycliffe or bycliffe alias scaddon before his imprisonment gave batt cowley any reason to believe that he was married and expected to have a child the question as you know is of no practical importance but i wish to draw up an abstract of the bycliffe case and the exact position in which it stood before the suit was closed by the death of the plaintiff in order that if mr harold transome desires it he may see how the failure of the last claim has secured the durfey transome title and whether there is a hair's breadth of chance that another claim should be set up of course there is not a shadow of such a chance for even if batt cowley were to suppose that they had alighted on a surviving representative of the bycliffes it would not enter their heads to set up a new claim since they brought evidence that the last life which suspended the bycliffe remainder was extinct before the case was closed a good twenty years ago still i want to show the present heir of the durfey transomes the exact condition of the family title to the estates so get me an answer from medwin on the above mentioned point i shall meet you at duffield next week we must get transome returned never mind his having been a little rough the other day but go on doing what you know is necessary for his interest his interest is mine which i need not say is john johnson's yours faithfully matthew jermyn when the attorney had sealed this letter and leaned back in his chair again he was inwardly saying now mr harold i shall shut up this affair in a private drawer till you choose to take any extreme measures which will force me to bring it out i have the matter entirely in my own power no one but old lyon knows about the girl's birth no one but scaddon can clench the evidence about bycliffe and i've got scaddon under my thumb no soul except myself and johnson who is a limb of myself knows that there is one half dead life which may presently leave the girl a new claim to the bycliffe heirship i shall learn through methurst whether batt cowley knew through bycliffe of this woman having come to england i shall hold all the threads between my thumb and finger i can use the evidence or i can nullify it and so if mr harold pushes me to extremity and threatens me with chancery and ruin i have an opposing threat which will either save me or turn into a punishment for him he rose put out his candles and stood with his back to the fire looking out on the dim lawn with its black twilight fringe of shrubs still meditating quick thought was gleaming over five and thirty years filled with devices more or less clever more or less desirable to be avowed those which might be avowed with impunity were not always to be distinguished as innocent by comparison with those which it was advisable to conceal in a profession where much that is noxious may be done without disgrace is a conscience likely to be without balm when circumstances have urged a man to overstep the line where his good technical information makes him aware that with discovery disgrace is likely to begin with regard to the transome affairs the family had been in pressing need of money and it had lain with him to get it for them was it to be expected that he would not consider his own advantage where he had rendered services such as are never fully paid if it came to a question of right and wrong instead of law the least justifiable things he had ever done had been done on behalf of the transomes it had been a deucedly unpleasant thing for him to get bycliffe arrested and thrown into prison as henry scaddon perhaps hastening the man's death in that way but if it had not been done by dint of his jermyn's exertions and tact he would like to know where the durfey transomes might have been by this time as for right or wrong if the truth were known the very possession of the estate by the durfey transomes was owing to law tricks that took place nearly a century ago when the original old durfey got his base fee but inward argument of this sort now as always was merged in anger in exasperation that harold precisely harold transome should have turned out to be the probable instrument of a visitation which would be bad luck not justice for is there any justice where ninety nine out of every hundred escape he felt himself beginning to hate harold as he had never just then jermyn's third daughter a tall slim girl wrapped in a white woollen shawl which she had hung over her blanket wise skipped across the lawn toward the greenhouse to get a flower jermyn was startled and did not identify the figure or rather he identified it falsely with another tall white wrapped figure which had sometimes set his heart beating quickly more than thirty years before for a moment he was fully back in those distant years when he and another bright eyed person had seen no reason why they should not indulge their passion and their vanity and determine for themselves how their lives should be made delightful in spite of unalterable external conditions the reasons had been unfolding themselves gradually ever since through all the years which had converted the handsome soft eyed slim young jermyn with a touch of sentiment into a portly lawyer of sixty for whom life had resolved itself into the means of keeping up his head among his professional brethren and maintaining an establishment into a gray haired husband and father whose third affectionate and expensive daughter now rapped at the window and called to him papa papa get ready for dinner don't you remember that the lukyns are coming chapter xxii her gentle looks shot arrows piercing him as gods are pierced with poison of sweet pity the evening of the market day had passed and felix had not looked in at malthouse yard to talk over the public events with mr lyon when esther was dressing the next morning she had reached a point of irritated anxiety to see felix at which she found herself devising little schemes for attaining that end in some way that would be so elaborate as to seem perfectly natural her watch had a long standing ailment of losing possibly it wanted cleaning felix would tell her if it merely wanted regulating whereas mr prowd might detain it unnecessarily and cause her useless inconvenience or could she not get a valuable hint from mrs holt about the home made bread which was something as sad as lyddy herself or if she came home that way at twelve o'clock felix might be going out she might meet him and not be obliged to call or but it would be very much beneath her to take any steps of this sort her watch had been losing for the last two months why should it not go on losing a little longer she could think of no devices that were not so transparent as to be undignified all the more undignified because felix chose to live in a way that would prevent any one from classing him according to his education and mental refinement which certainly are very high said esther inwardly coloring as if in answer to some contrary allegation else i should not think his opinion of any consequence but she came to the conclusion that she could not possibly call at mrs holt's it followed that up to a few minutes past twelve when she reached the turning toward mrs holt's she believed that she should go home the other way but at the last moment there is always a reason not existing before namely the impossibility of further vacillation esther turned the corner without any visible pause and in another minute was knocking at mrs holt's door not without an inward flutter which she was bent on disguising it's never you miss lyon who'd have thought of seeing you at this time is the minister ill i thought he looked creechy if you want help i'll put my bonnet on don't keep miss lyon at the door mother ask her to come in said the ringing voice of felix surmounting various small shufflings and babbling voices within it's my wish for her to come in i'm sure said mrs holt making way but what is there for her to come in to a floor worse than any public but step in pray if you're so inclined when i've been forced to take my bit of carpet up and have benches i don't see why i need mind nothing no more i only came to ask mr holt if he would look at my watch for me said esther entering and blushing a general rose color he'll do that fast enough said mrs holt with emphasis that's one of the things he will do excuse my rising miss lyon said felix i'm binding up job's finger job was a small fellow about five with a germinal nose large round blue eyes and red hair that curled close to his head like the wool on the back of an infantine lamb he had evidently been crying and the corners of his mouth were still dolorous felix held him on his knee as he bound and tied up very cleverly a tiny forefinger there was a table in front of felix and against the window covered with his watchmaking implements and some open books two benches stood at right angles on the sanded floor and six or seven boys of various ages up to twelve were getting their caps and preparing to go home they huddled themselves together and stood still when esther entered felix could not look up till he had finished his surgery but he went on speaking this is a hero miss lyon this is job tudge a bold briton whose finger hurts him but who doesn't mean to cry good morning boys don't lose your time get out into the air esther seated herself on the end of the bench near felix much relieved that job was the immediate object of attention and the other boys rushed out behind her with a brief chant of good morning did you ever see said mrs holt standing to look on how wonderful felix is at that small work with his large fingers and that's because he learned doctoring it isn't for want of cleverness he looks like a poor man miss lyon i've left off speaking else i should say it's a sin and a shame illustration felix holt and job tudge mother said felix who often amused himself and kept good humored by giving his mother answers that were unintelligible to her you have an astonishing readiness in the ciceronian antiphrasis considering you have never studied oratory there job thou patient man sit still if thou wilt and now we can look at miss lyon esther had taken off her watch and was holding it in her hand but he looked at her face or rather at her eyes as he said you want me to doctor your watch esther's expression was appealing and timid as it had never been before in felix's presence but when she saw the perfect calmness which to her seemed coldness of his clear gray eyes as if he saw no reason for attaching any emphasis to this first meeting a pang swift as an electric shock darted through her she had been very foolish to think so much of it it seemed to her as if her inferiority to felix made a gulf between them she could not at once rally her pride and self command but let her glance fall on her watch and said rather tremulously it loses it is very troublesome it has been losing a long while felix took the watch from her hand then looking round and seeing that his mother was gone out of the room he said very gently you look distressed miss lyon i hope there is no trouble at home felix was thinking of the minister's agitation on the previous sunday but i ought perhaps to beg your pardon for saying so much poor esther was quite helpless the mortification which had come like a bruise to all the sensibilities that had been in keen activity insisted on some relief her eyes filled instantly and a great tear rolled down while she said in a loud sort of whisper as involuntary as her tears i wanted to tell you that i was not offended that i am not ungenerous i thought you might think but you have not thought of it was there ever more awkward speaking or any behavior less like that of the graceful self possessed miss lyon whose phrases were usually so well turned and whose repartees were so ready for a moment there was silence esther had her two little delicately gloved hands clasped on the table the next moment she felt one hand of felix covering them both and pressing them firmly but he did not speak the tears were both on her cheeks now and she could look up at him his eyes had an expression of sadness in them quite new to her suddenly little job who had his mental exercises on the occasion called out impatiently she's tut her finger felix and esther laughed and drew their hands away and as esther took her handkerchief to wipe the tears from her cheeks she said you see job i am a naughty coward i can't help crying when i've hurt myself zoo soodn't kuy said job energetically being much impressed with a moral doctrine which had come to him after a sufficient transgression of it job is like me said felix fonder of preaching than of practice but let us look at this same watch he went on opening and examining it these little geneva toys are cleverly constructed to go always a little wrong but if you wind them up and set them regularly every night you may know at least that it's not noon when the hand points there felix chatted that esther might recover herself but now mrs holt came back and apologized you'll excuse my going away i know miss lyon but there were the dumplings to see to and what little i've got left on my hands now i like to do well not but what i've more cleaning to do than ever i had in my life before as you may tell soon enough if you look at this floor but when you've been used to doing things and they've been taken away from you it's as if your hands had been cut off and you felt the fingers as are of no use to you that's a great image mother said felix as he snapped the watch together and handed it to esther i never heard you use such an image before yes i know you've always some fault to find with what your mother says but if ever there was a woman could talk with the open bible before her and not be afraid it's me i never did tell stories and i never will though i know it's done miss lyon and by church members too when they have candles to sell as i could bring you to the proof but i never was one of 'em let felix say what he will about the printing on the tickets his father believed it was gospel truth and it's presumptuous to say it wasn't for as for curing how can anybody know there's no physic'll cure without a blessing and with a blessing i know i've seen a mustard plaister work when there was no more smell nor strength in the mustard than so much flour and reason good for the mustard had lain in paper nobody knows how long so i'll leave you to guess mrs holt looked hard out of the window and gave a slight inarticulate sound of scorn felix had leaned back in his chair with a resigned smile and was pinching job's ears esther said i think i had better go now not knowing what else to say yet not wishing to go immediately lest she should seem to be running away from mrs holt she felt keenly how much endurance there must be for felix and she had often been discontented with her father and called him tiresome where does job tudge live she said still sitting and looking at the droll little figure set off by a ragged jacket with a tail about two inches deep sticking out above the funniest of corduroys job has two mansions said felix he lives here chiefly but he has another home where his grandfather mr tudge the stone breaker lives my mother is very good to job miss lyon she has made him a little bed in a cupboard and she gives him sweetened porridge the exquisite goodness implied in these words of felix impressed esther the more because in her hearing his talk had usually been pungent and denunciatory looking at mrs holt she saw that her eyes had lost their bleak north easterly expression and were shining with some mildness on little job who had turned round toward her propping his head against felix well why shouldn't i be motherly to the child miss lyon said mrs holt whose strong powers of argument required the file of an imagined contradiction if there were no real one at hand i never was hard hearted and i never will be it was felix picked the child up and took to him you may be sure for there's nobody else master where he is but i wasn't going to beat the orphan child and abuse him because of that and him as straight as an arrow when he's stripped and me so fond of children and only had one of my own to live i'd three babies miss lyon but the blessed lord only spared felix and him the masterfulest and brownest of 'em all but i did my duty by him and i said he'll have more schooling than his father and he'll grow up a doctor and marry a woman with money to furnish as i was myself spoons and everything and i shall have the grandchildren to look up to me and be drove out in the gig sometimes like old mrs lukyn and you see what it's all come to miss lyon here's felix made a common man of himself and says he'll never be married which is the most unreasonable thing and him never easy but when he's got the child on his lap or when stop stop mother felix burst in pray don't use that limping argument again that a man should marry because he's fond of children that's a reason for not marrying a bachelor's children are always young they're immortal children always lisping waddling helpless and with a chance of turning out good the lord above may know what you mean and haven't other folks's children a chance of turning out good oh they grow out of it very fast here's job tudge now said felix turning the little one round on his knee and holding his head by the back job's limbs will get lanky this little fist that looks like a puff ball and can hide nothing bigger than a gooseberry will get large and bony and perhaps want to clutch more than its share these wide blue eyes that tell me more truth than job knows will narrow and narrow and try to hide truth that job would be better without knowing this little negative nose will become long and self asserting and this little tongue put out thy tongue job job awe struck under this ceremony put out a little red tongue very timidly this tongue hardly bigger than a rose leaf will get large and thick wag out of season do mischief brag and cant for gain or vanity and cut as cruelly for all its clumsiness as if it were a sharp edged blade big job will perhaps be naughty as felix speaking with the loud emphatic distinctness habitual to him brought out this terribly familiar word job's sense of mystification became too painful he hung his lip and began to cry see here said mrs holt you're frightening the innocent child with such talk and it's enough to frighten them that think themselves the safest look here job my man said felix setting the boy down and turning him toward esther go to miss lyon ask her to smile at you and that will dry up your tears like the sunshine job put his two brown fists on esther's lap and she stooped to kiss him then holding his face between her hands she said tell mr holt we don't mean to be naughty job he should believe in us more but now i must really go home esther rose and held out her hand to mrs holt who kept it while she said a little to esther's confusion i'm very glad it's took your fancy to come here sometimes miss lyon i know you're thought to hold your head high but i speak of people as i find 'em and i'm sure anybody had need be humble that comes where there's a floor like this for i've put by my best tea trays they're so out of all character i must look above for comfort now but i don't say i'm not worthy to be called on for all that felix had risen and moved toward the door that he might open it and shield esther from more last words on his mother's part good bye mr holt will mr lyon like for me to sit with him an hour this evening do you think why not he always likes to see you then i will come good bye she's a very straight figure said mrs holt how she carries herself but i doubt there's some truth in what our people say if she won't look at young muscat it's the better for him he'd need have a big fortune that marries her that's true mother said felix sitting down snatching up little job and finding a vent for some unspeakable feeling in the pretence of worrying him esther was rather melancholy as she went home yet happier withal than she had been for many days before she thought i need not mind having shown so much anxiety about his opinion he is too clear sighted to mistake our mutual position he is quite above putting a false interpretation on what i have done besides he had not thought of me at all i saw that plainly enough yet he was very kind there is something greater and better in him than i had imagined his behavior to day to his mother and me too i should call it the highest gentlemanliness only it seems in him to be something deeper but he has chosen an intolerable life though i suppose if i had a mind equal to his and if he loved me very dearly i should choose the same life esther felt that she had prefixed an impossible if to that result but now she had known felix her conception of what a happy love must be had become like a dissolving view in which the once dear images were gradually melting into new forms and new colors the favorite byronic heroes were beginning to look like last night's decorations seen in the sober dawn so fast does a little leaven spread within us so incalculable is one personality on another behind all esther's thoughts like an unacknowledged yet constraining presence there was the sense that if felix holt were to love her her life would be exalted into something quite new into a sort of difficult blessedness such as one may imagine in beings who are conscious of painfully growing into possession of higher powers it was quite true that felix had not thought the more of esther because of that sunday afternoon's interview which had shaken her mind to the very roots he had avoided intruding on mr lyon without special reason because he believed the minister to be preoccupied with some private care he had thought a great deal of esther with a mixture of strong disapproval and strong liking which both together made a feeling the reverse of indifference but he was not going to let her have any influence on his life even if his determination had not been fixed he would have believed that she would utterly scorn him in any other light than that of an acquaintance and the emotion she had shown to day did not change that belief but he was deeply touched by this manifestation of her better qualities and felt that there was a new tie of friendship between them that was the brief history felix would have given of his relation to esther and he was accustomed to observe himself but very close and diligent looking at living creatures even through the best microscope will leave room for new and contradictory discoveries felix found mr lyon particularly glad to talk to him the minister had never yet disburdened himself about his letter to mr philip debarry concerning the public conference and as by this time he had all the heads of his discussion thoroughly in his mind it was agreeable to recite them as well as to express his regret that time had been lost by mr debarry's absence from the manor which had prevented the immediate fulfillment of his pledge i don't see how he can fulfill it if the rector refuses said felix thinking it well to moderate the little man's confidence the rector is of a spirit that will not incur earthly impeachment and he cannot refuse what is necessary to his nephew's honorable discharge of an obligation said mr lyon my young friend it is a case wherein the prearranged conditions tend by such a beautiful fitness to the issue i have sought that i should have forever held myself a traitor to my charge had i neglected the indication chapter xxiii i will not excuse you you shall not be excused excuses shall not be admitted there's no excuse shall serve you shall not be excused henry iv when philip debarry had come home that morning and read the letters which had not been forwarded to him he laughed so heartily at mr lyon's that he congratulated himself on being in his private room otherwise his laughter would have awakened the curiosity of sir maximus and philip did not wish to tell any one the contents of the letter until he had shown them to his uncle he determined to ride over to the rectory to lunch for as lady mary was away he and his uncle might be tte tte the rectory was on the other side of the river close to the church of which it was the fitting companion a fine old brick and stone house with a great bow window opening from the library on to the deep turfed lawn one fat dog sleeping on the door stone another fat dog waddling on the gravel the autumn leaves duly swept away the lingering chrysanthemums cherished tall trees stooping or soaring in the most picturesque variety and a virginian creeper turning a little rustic hut into a scarlet pavilion it was one of those rectories which are among the bulwarks of our venerable institutions which arrest disintegrating doubt serve as a double embankment against popery and dissent and rally feminine instinct and affection to reinforce the decisions of masculine thought what makes you look so merry phil said the rector as his nephew entered the pleasant library something that concerns you said philip taking out the letter a clerical challenge here's an opportunity for you to emulate the divines of the sixteenth century and have a theological duel read this letter what answer have you sent the crazy little fellow said the rector keeping the letter in his hand and running over it again and again with brow knit but eyes gleaming without any malignity oh i sent no answer i awaited yours mine said the rector throwing down the letter on the table you don't suppose i'm going to hold a public debate with a schismatic of that sort i should have an infidel shoemaker next expecting me to answer blasphemies delivered in bad grammar but you see how he puts it said philip with all his gravity of nature he could not resist a slightly mischievous prompting though he had a serious feeling that he should not like to be regarded as failing to fulfill his pledge i think if you refuse i shall be obliged to offer myself nonsense tell him he is himself acting a dishonorable part in interpreting your words as a pledge to do any preposterous thing that suits his fancy suppose he had asked you to give him land to build a chapel on doubtless that would have given him a 'lively satisfaction' a man who puts a non natural strained sense on a promise is no better than a robber but he has not asked for land i dare say he thinks you won't object to his proposal i confess there's a simplicity and quaintness about the letter that rather pleases me let me tell you phil he's a crazy little firefly that does a great deal of harm in my parish he inflames the dissenters' minds on politics there's no end to the mischief done by these busy prating men they make the ignorant multitude the judges of the largest questions both political and religious till we shall soon have no institution left that is not on a level with the comprehension of a huckster or a drayman there can be nothing more retrograde losing all the results of civilization all the lessons of providence letting the windlass run down after men have been turning at it painfully for generations if the instructed are not to judge for the uninstructed why let us set dick stubbs to make our almanacs and have a president of the royal society elected by universal suffrage the rector had risen placed himself with his back to the fire and thrust his hands in his pockets ready to insist further on this wide argument philip sat nursing one leg listening respectfully as he always did though often listening to the sonorous echo of his own statements which suited his uncle's needs so exactly that he did not distinguish them from his own impressions true said philip but in special cases we have to do with special conditions you know i defend the casuists and it may happen that for the honor of the church in treby and a little also for my honor circumstances may demand a concession even to some notions of a dissenting preacher not at all i should be making a figure which my brother clergy might well take as an affront to themselves the character of the establishment has suffered enough already through the evangelicals with their extempore incoherence and their pipe smoking piety look at wimple the man who is vicar of shuttleton without his gown and bands anybody would take him for a grocer in mourning well i shall cut a still worse figure and so will you in the dissenting magazines and newspapers it will go the round of the kingdom there will be a paragraph headed 'tory falsehood and clerical cowardice' or else 'the meanness of the aristocracy and the incompetence of the beneficed clergy' there would be a worse paragraph if i were to consent to the debate of course it would be said that i was beaten hollow and that now the question had been cleared up at treba magna the church had not a sound leg to stand on besides the rector went on frowning and smiling it's all very well for you to talk phil but this debating is not so easy when a man's close upon sixty what one writes or says must be something good and scholarly and after all had been done this little lyon would buzz about one like a wasp and cross question and rejoin let me tell you a plain truth may be so worried and mauled by fallacies as to get the worst of it there's no such thing as tiring a talking machine like lyon then you absolutely refuse yes i do you remember that when i wrote my letter of thanks to lyon you approved my offer to serve him if possible certainly i remember it but suppose he had asked you to vote for civil marriage or to go and hear him preach every sunday but he has not asked that something as unreasonable though well said philip taking up mr lyon's letter and looking graver looking even vexed it is rather an unpleasant business for me i really felt obliged to him i think there's a sort of worth in the man beyond his class whatever may be the reason of the case i shall disappoint him instead of doing him the service i offered well that's a misfortune we can't help it the worst of it is i should be insulting him to say 'i will do anything else but not just this that you want' he evidently feels himself in company with luther and zwingle and calvin and considers our letters part of the history of protestantism yes yes i know it's rather an unpleasant thing phil you are aware that i would have done anything in reason to prevent you from becoming unpopular here i consider your character a possession to all of us i think i must call on him forthwith and explain and apologize no sit still i've thought of something said the rector with a sudden revival of spirits i've just seen sherlock coming in he is to lunch with me to day it would do no harm for him to hold the debate a curate and a young man he'll gain by it and it would release you from any awkwardness phil sherlock is not going to stay here long you know he'll soon have his title i'll put the thing to him he won't object if i wish it it's a capital idea it will do sherlock good he's a clever fellow but he wants confidence philip had not time to object before mr sherlock appeared a young divine of good birth and figure of sallow complexion and bashful address sherlock you have come in most opportunely said the rector a case has turned up in the parish in which you can be of eminent use i know that is what you have desired ever since you have been with me but i'm about so much myself that there really has not been sphere enough for you you are a studious man i know i dare say you have all the necessary matter prepared at your finger ends if not on paper mr sherlock smiled with rather a trembling lip willing to distinguish himself but hoping that the rector only alluded to a dialogue on baptism by aspersion or some other pamphlet suited to the purposes of the christian knowledge society but as the rector proceeded to unfold the circumstances under which his eminent service was to be rendered he grew more and more nervous you'll oblige me very much sherlock the rector ended by going into this thing zealously can you guess what time you will require because it will rest with us to fix the day i should be rejoiced to oblige you mr debarry but i really think i am not competent to that's your modesty sherlock don't let me hear any more of that i know filmore of corpus said you might be a first rate man if your diffidence didn't do you injustice and you can refer anything to me you know come you will set about the thing at once but phil you must tell the preacher to send a scheme of the debate all the different heads and he must agree to keep rigidly within the scheme there sit down at my desk and write the letter now thomas shall carry it philip sat down to write and the rector with his firm ringing voice went on at his ease giving indications to his agitated curate but you can begin at once preparing a good cogent clear statement and considering the probable points of assault you can look into jewel hall hooker whitgift and the rest you'll find them all here my library wants nothing in english divinity sketch the lower ground taken by usher and those men but bring all your force to bear on marking out the true high church doctrine expose the wretched cavils of the noncomformists and the noisy futility that belongs to schismatics generally i will give you a telling passage from burke on the dissenters and some good quotations which i brought together in two sermons of my own on the position of the english church in christendom how long do you think it will take you to bring your thoughts together you can throw them afterward into the form of an essay we'll have the thing printed it will do you good with the bishop with all mr sherlock's timidity there was fascination for him in this distinction he reflected that he could take coffee and sit up late and perhaps produce something rather fine it might be a first step toward that eminence which it was no more than his duty to aspire to even a polemical fame like that of a philpotts must have had a beginning mr sherlock was not insensible to the pleasure of turning sentences successfully and it was a pleasure not always unconnected with preferment a diffident man likes the idea of doing something remarkable which will create belief in him without any immediate display of brilliancy celebrity may blush and be silent and win a grace the more thus mr sherlock was constrained trembling all the while and much wishing that his essay were already in print i think i could hardly be ready under a fortnight very good just write that phil and tell him to fix the precise day and place and then we'll go to lunch the rector was quite satisfied he had talked himself into thinking that he should like to give sherlock a few useful hints look up his own earlier sermons and benefit the curate by his criticism when the argument had been got into shape he was a healthy natured man but that was not at all a reason why he should not have those sensibilities to the odor of authorship which belong to almost everybody who is not expected to be a writer and especially to that form of authorship which is called suggestion and consists in telling another man that he might do a great deal with a given subject by bringing a sufficient amount of knowledge reasoning and wit to bear upon it philip would have had some twinges of conscience about the curate if he had not guessed that the honor thrust upon him was not altogether disagreeable the church might perhaps have had a stronger supporter but for himself he had done what he was bound to do he had done his best toward fulfilling mr lyon's desire chapter xxiv if he come not the play is marred midsummer night's dream rufus lyon was very happy on that mild november morning appointed for the great conference in the larger room at the free school between himself and the reverend theodore sherlock ba the disappointment of not contending with the rector in person which had at first been bitter had been gradually lost sight of in the positive enjoyment of an opportunity for debating on any terms mr lyon had two grand elements of pleasure on such occasions confidence in the strength of his case and confidence in his own power of advocacy not to use his own phrase not that he glorified himself herein for speech and exposition were so easy to him that if he argued forcibly he believed it to be simply because the truth was forcible he was not proud of moving easily in his native medium a panting man thinks of himself as a clever swimmer but a fish swims much better and takes his performance as a matter of course whether mr sherlock were that panting self gratulating man remained a secret philip debarry much occupied with his electioneering affairs had only once had an opportunity of asking his uncle how sherlock got on and the rector had said curtly i think he'll do i've supplied him well with references i advise him to read only and decline everything else as out of order lyon will speak to a point and then sherlock will read it will be all the more telling it will give variety but on this particular morning peremptory business connected with the magistracy called the rector away due notice had been given and the feminine world of treby magna was much more agitated by the prospect than by that of any candidate's speech mrs pendrell at the bank mrs tiliot and the church ladies generally felt bound to hear the curate who was known apparently by an intuition concerning the nature of curates to be a very clever young man and he would show them what learning had to say on the right side one or two dissenting ladies were not without emotion at the thought that seated on the front benches they should be brought near to old church friends and have a longer greeting than had taken place since the catholic emancipation mrs muscat who had been a beauty and was as nice in her millinery as any trebian lady belonging to the establishment reflected that she should put on her best embroidered collar and that she should ask mrs tiliot where it was in duffield that she once got her bed hanging dyed so beautifully when mrs tiliot was mary salt the two ladies had been bosom friends but mr tiliot looked higher and higher since his gin had become so famous and in the year ' he had in mr muscat's hearing spoken of dissenters as sneaks a personality which could not be overlooked the debate was to begin at eleven for the rector would not allow the evening to be chosen when low men and boys might want to be admitted out of mere mischief this was one reason why the female part of the audience outnumbered the males but some chief trebians were there even men whose means made them as independent of theory as mr pendrell and mr wace encouraged by reflecting that they were not in a place of worship and would not be obliged to stay longer than they chose there was a muster of all dissenters who could spare the morning time and on the back benches were all the aged churchwomen who shared the remnants of the sacrament wine and who were humbly anxious to neglect nothing ecclesiastical or connected with going to a better place at eleven the arrival of listeners seemed to have ceased mr lyon was seated on the school tribune or dais at his particular round table another round table with a chair awaited the curate with whose superior position it was quite in keeping that he should not be the first on the ground a couple of extra chairs were placed farther back and more than one important personage had been requested to act as chairman but no churchman would place himself in a position so equivocal as to dignity of aspect and so unequivocal as to the obligation of sitting out the discussion and the rector had beforehand put a veto on any dissenting chairman mr lyon sat patiently absorbed in his thoughts with his notes in minute handwriting lying before him seeming to look at the audience but not seeing them every one else was contented that there should be an interval in which there could be a little neighborly talk esther was particularly happy seated on a side bench near her father's side of the tribune with felix close behind her so that she could turn her head and talk to him he had been very kind ever since that morning when she had called at his home more disposed to listen indulgently to what she had to say and less blind to her looks and movements if he had never railed at her or ignored her she would have been less sensitive to the attention he gave her but as it was the prospect of seeing him seemed to light up her life and to disperse the old dullness she looked unusually charming to day from the very fact that she was not vividly conscious of anything but of having a mind near her that asked her to be something better than she actually was the consciousness of her own superiority amongst the people around her was superseded and even a few brief weeks had given a softened expression to her eyes a more feminine beseechingness and self doubt to her manners perhaps however a little new defiance was rising in place of the old contempt defiance of the trebian views about felix holt what a very nice looking young woman your minister's daughter is said mrs tiliot in an undertone to mrs muscat who as she had hoped had found a seat next her quondam friend quite the lady rather too much so considering said mrs muscat she's thought proud and that is not pretty in a girl even if there was anything to back it up but now she seems to be encouraging that young holt who scoffs at everything as you may judge by his appearance she has despised his betters before now but i leave you to judge whether a young man who has taken to low ways of getting a living can pay for fine cambric handkerchiefs and light kid gloves mrs muscat lowered her blonde eyelashes and swayed her neat head just perceptibly from side to side with a sincere desire to be moderate in her expressions notwithstanding any shock that facts might have given her dear dear said mrs tiliot what that is young holt leaning forward now without a cravat i've never seen him before to notice him but i've heard tiliot talking about him they say he's a dangerous character and goes stirring up the workingmen at sproxton and well to be sure such great eyes and such a great head of hair it is enough to frighten one what can she see in him quite below her yes and brought up a governess said mrs muscat you'd have thought she'd knowed better how to choose but the minister has let her get the upper hand sadly too much it's a pity in a man of god i don't deny he's that well i am sorry said mrs tiliot for i meant her to give my girls lessons when they came from school mr wace and mr pendrell meanwhile were standing up and looking round at the audience nodding to their fellow townspeople with the affability due from men in their position it's time he came now said mr wace looking at his watch and comparing it with the schoolroom clock this debating is a new fangled sort of thing but the rector would never have given in to it if there hadn't been good reasons nolan said he wouldn't come he says this debating is an atheistical sort of thing the atheists are very fond of it theirs is a bad book to take a leaf out of however we shall hear nothing but what's good from mr sherlock he preaches a capital sermon for such a young man well it was our duty to support him not to leave him alone among the dissenters said mr pendrell you see everybody hasn't felt that labron might have shown himself if not lukyn i could have alleged business myself if i had thought proper here he comes i think said mr wace turning round on hearing a movement near the small door on a level with the platform by george it's mr debarry come now this is handsome mr wace and mr pendrell clapped their hands and the example was followed even by most of the dissenters philip was aware that he was doing a popular thing of a kind that treby was not used to from the elder debarrys but his appearance had not been long premeditated he was driving through the town toward an engagement at some distance but on calling at labron's office he had found that the affair which demanded his presence had been deferred and so had driven round to the free school christian came in behind him mr lyon was now roused from his abstraction and stepping from his slight elevation begged mr debarry to act as moderator or president on the occasion with all my heart said philip but mr sherlock has not arrived apparently he tarries somewhat unduly said mr lyon nevertheless there may be a reason of which we know not shall i collect the thoughts of the assembly by a brief introductory address in the interval no no no said mr wace who saw a limit to his powers of endurance mr sherlock is sure to be here in a minute or two christian said philip debarry who felt a slight misgiving just be so good but stay i'll go myself excuse me gentlemen i'll drive round to mr sherlock's lodgings he may be under a little mistake as to the time studious men are sometimes rather absent minded you needn't come with me christian as mr debarry went out rufus lyon stepped on to the tribune again in rather an uneasy state of mind a few ideas had occurred to him eminently fitted to engage the audience profitably and so to wrest some edification out of an unforeseen delay but his native delicacy made him feel that in this assembly the church people might fairly decline any deliverance on his part which exceeded the programme and mr wace's negative had been energetic but the little man suffered from imprisoned ideas and was as restless as a racer held in he could not sit down again but walked backward and forward stroking his chin emitting his low guttural interjections under the pressure of clauses and sentences which he longed to utter aloud as he would have done in his own study there was a low buzz in the room which helped to deepen the minister's sense that the thoughts within him were as divine messengers unheeded or rejected by a trivial generation many of the audience were standing all except the old churchwomen on the back seats and a few devout dissenters who kept their eyes shut and gave their bodies a gentle oscillating motion were interested in chat your father is uneasy said felix to esther yes and now i think he is feeling for his spectacles i hope he has not left them at home he will not be able to see anything two yards before him without them and it makes him so unconscious of what people expect or want i'll go and ask him whether he has them said felix striding over the form in front of him and approaching mr lyon whose face showed a gleam of pleasure at this relief from his abstracted isolation miss lyon is afraid that you are at a loss for your spectacles sir said felix my dear young friend said mr lyon laying his hand on felix holt's fore arm which was about on a level with the minister's shoulder it is a very glorious truth albeit made somewhat painful to me by the circumstances of the present moment that as a counterpoise to the brevity of our mortal life wherein as i apprehend our powers are being trained not only for the transmission of an improved heritage as i have heard you insist but also for our own entrance into a higher initiation in the divine scheme it is i say a very glorious truth that even in what are called the waste minutes of our time like those of expectation the soul may soar and range as in some of our dreams which are brief as a broken rainbow in duration yet seem to comprise a long history of terror or joy and again each moment may be a beginning of a new spiritual energy and our pulse would doubtless be a coarse and clumsy notation of the passage from that which was not to that which is even in the finer processes of the material world and how much more esther was watching her father and felix and though she was not within hearing of what was being said she guessed the actual state of the case that the enquiry about the spectacles had been unheeded and that her father was losing himself and embarrassing felix in the intricacies of a dissertation there was not the stillness around her that would have made a movement on her part seem conspicuous and she was impelled by her anxiety to step on the tribune and walk up to her father who paused a little startled pray see whether you have forgotten your spectacles father if so i will go home at once and look for them mr lyon was automatically obedient to esther and he began immediately to feel in his pockets how is it that miss jermyn is so friendly with the dissenting parson said christian to quorlen the tory printer who was an intimate of his those grand jermyns are not dissenters surely what miss jermyn why don't you see that fine girl who is talking to him miss jermyn why that's the little parson's daughter his daughter christian gave a low brief whistle which seemed a natural expression of surprise that the rusty old ranter should have a daughter of such distinguished appearance meanwhile the search for the spectacles had proved vain 'tis a grievous fault in me my dear said the little man humbly i become thereby sadly burdensome to you i will go at once said esther refusing to let felix go instead of her but she had scarcely stepped off the tribune when mr debarry re entered and there was a commotion which made her wait after a low toned conversation with mr pendrell and mr wace philip debarry stepped on to the tribune with his hat in his hand and said with an air of much concern and annoyance i am sorry to have to tell you ladies and gentlemen that doubtless owing to some accidental cause which i trust will soon be explained as nothing serious mr sherlock is absent from his residence and is not to be found he went out early his landlady informs me to refresh himself by a walk on this agreeable morning as is his habit she tells me when he has been kept up late by study and he has not returned do not let us be too anxious i shall cause enquiry to be made in the direction of his walk it is easy to imagine many accidents not of a grave character by which he might nevertheless be absolutely detained against his will under these circumstances mr lyon continued philip turning to the minister i presume that the debate must be adjourned the debate doubtless began mr lyon but his farther speech was drowned by a general rising of the church people from their seats many of them feeling that even if the cause were lamentable the adjournment was not altogether disagreeable good gracious me said mrs tiliot as she took her husband's arm i hope the poor young man hasn't fallen into the river or broken his leg but some of the more acrid dissenters whose temper was not controlled by the habits of retail business had begun to hiss implying that in their interpretation the curate's absence had not depended on any injury to life or limb he's turned tail sure enough said mr muscat to the neighbor behind him lifting his eyebrows and shoulders and laughing in a way that showed that deacon as he was he looked at the affair in an entirely secular light but mrs muscat thought it would be nothing but right to have all the waters dragged agreeing in this with the majority of the church ladies i regret sincerely mr lyon said philip debarry addressing the minister with politeness that i must say good morning to you with the sense that i have not been able at present to contribute to your satisfaction as i had wished speak not of it in the way of apology sir said mr lyon in a tone of depression i doubt not that you yourself have acted in good faith nor will i open any door of egress to constructions such as anger often deems ingenious but which the disclosure of the simple truth may expose as erroneous and uncharitable fabrications i wish you good morning sir when the room was cleared of the church people mr lyon wished to soothe his own spirit and that of his flock by a few reflections introductory to a parting prayer but there was a general resistance to this effort the men mustered round the minister and declared their opinion that the whole thing was disgraceful to the church some said that the curate's absence had been contrived from the first others more than hinted that it had been a folly in mr lyon to set on foot any procedure in common with tories and clergymen who if they ever aped civility to dissenters would never do anything but laugh at them in their sleeves brother kemp urged in his heavy bass that mr lyon should lose no time in sending an account of the affair to the patriot and brother hawkins in his high tenor observed that it was an occasion on which some stinging things might be said with all the extra effect of an apropos the position of receiving a many voiced lecture from the members of his church was familiar to mr lyon but now he felt weary frustrated and doubtful of his own temper felix who stood by and saw that this man of sensitive fibre was suffering from talkers whose noisy superficiality cost them nothing got exasperated it seems to me sirs he burst in with his predominant voice that mr lyon has hitherto had the hard part of the business while you of his congregation have had the easy one punish the church clergy if you like they can take care of themselves but don't punish your own minister it's no business of mine perhaps except so far as fair play is everybody's business but it seems to me the time to ask mr lyon to take a little rest instead of setting on him like so many wasps by this speech felix raised a displeasure which fell on the minister as well as on himself but he gained his immediate end the talkers dropped off after a slight show of persistence and mr lyon quitted the field of no combat with a small group of his less imperious friends to whom he confided his intention of committing his argument fully to paper and forwarding it to a discriminating editor but regarding personalities he added i have not the same clear showing for say that this young man was pusillanimous i were but ill provided with arguments if i took my stand even for a moment on so poor an irrelevancy as that because one curate is ill furnished therefore episcopacy is false if i held up any one to just obloquy it would be the well designated incumbent of this parish who calling himself one of the church militant sends a young and weak kneed substitute to take his place in the fight mr philip debarry did not neglect to make industrious enquiry concerning the accidents which had detained the reverend theodore sherlock on his morning walk that well intentioned young divine was seen no more in treby magna but the river was not dragged for by the evening coach the rector received an explanatory letter the reverend theodore's agitation had increased so much during his walk that the passing coach had been a means of deliverance not to be resisted and literally at the eleventh hour he had hailed and mounted the cheerful tally ho and carried away his portion of the debate in his pocket but the rector had subsequently the satisfaction of receiving mr sherlock's painstaking production in print with a dedication to the reverend augustus debarry a motto from st chrysostom and other additions the fruit of ripening leisure he was sorry for poor sherlock who wanted confidence but he was convinced that for his own part he had taken the course which under the circumstances was the least compromising to the church sir maximus however observed to his son and brother that he had been right and they had been wrong as to the danger of vague enormous expressions of gratitude to a dissenting preacher and on any differences of opinion seldom failed to remind them of that precedent chapter xxv your fellow man divide the epithet say rather you're the fellow he the man when christian quitted the free school with the discovery that the young lady whose appearance had first startled him with an indefinable impression in the market place was the daughter of the old dissenting preacher who had shown so much agitated curiosity about his name he felt very much like an uninitiated chess player who sees that the pieces are in a peculiar position on the board and might open the way for him to give checkmate if he only knew how ever since his interview with jermyn his mind had been occupied with the charade it offered to his ingenuity what was the real meaning of the lawyer's interest in him and in his relations with maurice christian bycliffe here was a secret and secrets were often a source of profit of that agreeable kind which involved little labor jermyn had hinted at profit which might possibly come through him but christian said inwardly with well satisfied self esteem that he was not so pitiable a nincompoop as to trust jermyn on the contrary the only problem before him was to find out by what combination of independent knowledge he could outwit jermyn elude any purchase the attorney had on him through his past history and get a handsome bonus by which a somewhat shattered man of pleasure might live well without a master christian having early exhausted the more impulsive delights of life had become a sober calculator and he had made up his mind that for a man who had long ago run through his own money servitude in a great family was the best kind of retirement after that of a pensioner but if a better chance offered a person of talent must not let it slip through his fingers he held various ends of threads but there was danger of pulling at them too impatiently he had not forgotten the surprise which had made him drop the punch ladle when mr crowder talking in the steward's room had said that a scamp named henry scaddon had been concerned in a lawsuit about the transome estate again jermyn was the family lawyer of the transomes he knew of the exchange of names between scaddon and bycliffe he clearly wanted to know as much as he could about bycliffe's history the conclusion was not remote that bycliffe had had some claim on the transome property and that a difficulty had arisen from his being confounded with henry scaddon but hitherto the other incident which had been apparently connected with the interchange of names mr lyon's demand that he should write down the name maurice christian accompanied with the question whether that were his whole name had had no visible link with the inferences arrived at through crowder and jermyn the discovery made this morning at the free school that esther was the daughter of the dissenting preacher at last suggested a possible link until then christian had not known why esther's face had impressed him so peculiarly but the minister's chief association for him was with bycliffe and that association served as a flash to show him that esther's features and expression and still more her bearing now she stood and walked revived bycliffe's image daughter there were various ways of being a daughter suppose this were a case of adoption suppose bycliffe were known to be dead or thought to be dead begad if the old parson had fancied the original father was come to life again it was enough to frighten him a little slow and steady christian said to himself i'll get some talk with the old man again he's safe enough one can handle him without cutting one's self i'll tell him i knew bycliffe and was his fellow prisoner i'll worm out the truth about this daughter could pretty annette have married again and married this little scare crow there's no knowing what a woman will not do christian could see no distinct result for himself from his industry but if there were to be any such result it must be reached by following out every clue and to the non legal mind there are dim possibilities in law and heirship which prevent any issue from seeming too miraculous the consequence of these meditations was that christian hung about treby more than usual in his leisure time and that on the first opportunity he accosted mr lyon in the street with suitable civility stating that since the occasion which had brought them together some weeks before he had often wished to renew their conversation and with mr lyon's permission would now ask to do so after being assured as he had been by jermyn that this courier who had happened by some accident to possess the memorable locket and pocket book was certainly not annette's husband and was ignorant whether maurice christian bycliffe were living or dead the minister's mind had become easy again his habitual lack of interest in personal details rendering him gradually oblivious of jermyn's precautionary statement that he was pursuing enquiries and that if anything of interest turned up mr lyon should be made acquainted with it hence when christian addressed him the minister taken by surprise and shaken by the recollections of former anxieties said helplessly if it is business sir you would perhaps do better to address yourself to mr jermyn he could not have said anything that was a more valuable hint to christian he inferred that the minister had made a confidant of jermyn and it was needful to be wary on the contrary sir he answered it may be of the utmost importance to you that what passes between us should not be known to mr jermyn mr lyon was perplexed and felt at once that he was no more in clear daylight concerning jermyn than concerning christian he dared not neglect the possible duty of hearing what this man had to say and he invited him to proceed to malthouse yard where they could converse in private once in mr lyon's study christian opened the dialogue by saying that since he was in this room before it had occurred to him that the anxiety he had observed in mr lyon might be owing to some acquaintance with maurice christian bycliffe a fellow prisoner in france whom he christian had assisted in getting freed from his imprisonment and who in fact had been the owner of the trifles which mr lyon had recently had in his possession and had restored christian hastened to say that he knew nothing of bycliffe's history since they had parted in france but that he knew of his marriage with annette ledru and had been acquainted with annette herself he would be very glad to know what became of bycliffe if he could for he liked him uncommonly here christian paused but mr lyon only sat changing color and trembling this man's bearing and tone of mind were made repulsive to him by being brought in contact with keenly felt memories and he could not readily summon the courage to give answers or ask questions may i ask if you knew my friend bycliffe said christian trying a more direct method no sir i never saw him ah well you have seen a very striking likeness of him it's wonderful unaccountable but when i saw miss lyon at the free school the other day i could have sworn she was bycliffe's daughter sir said mr lyon in his deepest tone half rising and holding by the arms of his chair these subjects touch me with too sharp a point for you to be justified in thrusting them on me out of mere levity is there any good you seek or any injury you fear in relation to them precisely sir we shall come to an understanding suppose i believed that the young lady who goes by the name of miss lyon was the daughter of bycliffe mr lyon moved his lips silently and suppose i had reason to suspect that there would be some great advantage for her if the law knew who was her father sir said mr lyon shaken out of all reticence i would not conceal it she believes herself to be my daughter but i will bear all things rather than deprive her of a right nevertheless i appeal to the pity of any fellow man not to thrust himself between her and me but to let me disclose the truth to her myself all in good time said christian we must do nothing rash then miss lyon is annette's child the minister shivered as if the edge of a knife had been drawn across his hand but the tone of this question by the fact that it intensified his antipathy to christian enabled him to collect himself for what must be simply the endurance of a painful operation after a moment or two he said more coolly it is true sir her mother became my wife proceed with any statement which may concern my duty i have no more to say than this if there's a prize that the law might hand over to bycliffe's daughter i am much mistaken if there isn't a lawyer who'll take precious good care to keep the law hoodwinked and that lawyer is mat jermyn why my good sir if you've been taking jermyn into your confidence you've been setting the fox to keep off the weasel it strikes me that when you were made a little anxious about those articles of poor bycliffe's you put jermyn on making enquiries of me eh i think i am right i do not deny it ah it was very well you did for by that means i've found that he's got hold of some secrets about bycliffe which he means to stifle now sir if you desire any justice for your daughter step daughter i should say don't so much as wink to yourself before jermyn and if you've got any papers or things of that sort that may come in evidence as these confounded rascals the lawyers call it clutch them tight for if they get into jermyn's hands they may soon fly up the chimney have i said enough i had not purposed any further communication with mr jermyn sir indeed i have nothing further to communicate except that one fact concerning my daughter's birth which i have erred in concealing from her i neither seek disclosures nor do i tremble before them then i have your word that you will be silent about this conversation between us it is for your daughter's interest mind sir i shall be silent said mr lyon with cold gravity unless he added with an acumen as to possibilities rather disturbing to christian's confident contempt for the old man unless i were called upon by some tribunal to declare the whole truth in this relation in which case i should submit myself to that authority of investigation which is a requisite of social order christian departed feeling satisfied that he had got the utmost to be obtained at present out of the dissenting preacher whom he had not dared to question more closely he must look out for chance lights and perhaps too he might catch a stray hint by stirring the sediment of mr crowder's memory but he must not venture on enquiries that might be noticed when mr lyon was alone he paced up and down among his books and thought aloud in order to relieve himself after the constraint of this interview i will not wait for the urgency of necessity he said more than once i will tell the child without compulsion and then i shall fear nothing and an unwonted spirit of tenderness has filled her of late she will forgive me chapter xxvi consideration like an angel came and whipped the offending adam out of her leaving her body as a paradise to envelope and contain celestial spirits shakespeare henry v the next morning after much prayer for the needful strength and wisdom mr lyon came down stairs with the resolution that another day should not pass without the fulfillment of the task he had laid on himself but what hour he should choose for this solemn disclosure to esther must depend on their mutual occupations perhaps he must defer it till they sat up alone together after lyddy was gone to bed but at breakfast esther said to day is a holiday father my pupils are all going to duffield to see the wild beasts what have you got to do to day come you are eating no breakfast oh lyddy lyddy the eggs are hard again i wish you would not read alleyne's 'alarm' before breakfast it makes you cry and forget the eggs they are hard and that's the truth but there's hearts as are harder miss esther said lyddy i think not said esther this is leathery enough for the heart of the most obdurate jew pray give it little zachary for a football dear dear don't you be so light miss we may all be dead before night you speak out of season my good lyddy said mr lyon wearily depart into the kitchen what have you got to do to day father persisted esther i have a holiday mr lyon felt as if this were a fresh summons not to delay i have something of great moment to do my dear and since you are not otherwise demanded i will ask you to come and sit with me up stairs esther wondered what there could be on her father's mind more pressing than his morning studies soon she knew motionless but mentally stirred as she had never been before esther listened to her mother's story and to the outpouring of her step father's long pent up experience the rays of the morning sun which fell athwart the books the sense of the beginning day had deepened the solemnity more than night would have done all knowledge which alters our lives penetrates us more when it comes in the early morning the day that has to be travelled with something new and perhaps forever sad in its light is an image of the life that spreads beyond but at night the time of rest is near mr lyon regarded his narrative as a confession as a revelation to this beloved child of his own miserable weakness and error but to her it seemed a revelation of another sort her mind seemed suddenly enlarged by a vision of passion and struggle of delight and renunciation in the lot of beings who had hitherto been a dull enigma to her and in the act of unfolding to her that he was not her real father but had only striven to cherish her as a father had only longed to be loved as a father the odd way worn unworldly man became the object of a new sympathy in which esther exulted perhaps this knowledge would have been less powerful within her but for the mental preparation that had come during the last two months from her acquaintance with felix holt which had taught her to doubt the infallibility of her own standard and raised a presentiment of moral depths that were hidden from her esther had taken her place opposite to her father and had not moved even her clasped hands while he was speaking but after the long outpouring in which he seemed to lose the sense of everything but the memories he was giving utterance to he paused a little while and then said timidly this is a late retrieval of a long error esther i make not excuses for myself for we ought to strive that our affections be rooted in the truth nevertheless you esther had risen and had glided on to the wooden stool on a level with her father's chair where he was accustomed to lay books she wanted to speak but the flood gates could not be opened for words alone she threw her arms round the old man's neck and sobbed out with a passionate cry father father forgive me if i have not loved you enough i will i will the old man's little delicate frame was shaken by a surprise and joy that was almost painful in their intensity he had been going to ask forgiveness of her who asked it for herself in that moment of supreme complex emotion one ray of the minister's joy was the thought surely the work of grace is begun in her surely here is a heart that the lord hath touched they sat so enclasped in silence while esther relieved her full heart when she raised her head she sat quite still for a minute or two looking fixedly before her and keeping one little hand in the minister's presently she looked at him and said then you lived like a workingman father you were very very poor yet my mother had been used to luxury she was well born she was a lady it is true my dear it was a poor life that i could give her mr lyon answered in utter dimness as to the course esther's mind was taking he had anticipated before his disclosure from his long standing discernment of tendencies in her which were often the cause of silent grief to him that the discovery likely to have the keenest interest for her would be that her parents had a higher rank than that of the poor dissenting preacher but she had shown that other and better sensibilities were predominant he rebuked himself now for a hasty and shallow judgment concerning the child's inner life and waited for new clearness but that must be the best life father said esther suddenly rising with a flush across her paleness and standing with her head thrown a little backward as if some illumination had given her a new decision that must be the best life what life my dear child why that where one bears and does everything because of some great and strong feeling so that this and that in one's circumstances don't signify yea verily but the feeling that should be thus supreme is devotedness to the divine will esther did not speak her father's words did not fit on to the impressions wrought in her by what he had told her she sat down again and said more quietly mamma did not speak much of my first father not much dear she said he was beautiful to the eye and good and generous and that his family was of those who had been long privileged among their fellows but now i will deliver to you the letters which together with the ring and locket are the only visible memorials she retained of him mr lyon reached and delivered to esther the box containing the relics take them and examine them in privacy my dear and that i may no more err by concealment i will tell you some late occurrences that bear on these memorials though to my present apprehension doubtfully and confusedly he then narrated to esther all that had passed between himself and christian the possibility to which mr lyon's alarms had pointed that her real father might still be living was a new shock she could not speak about it to her present father but it was registered in silence as a painful addition to the uncertainties which she suddenly saw hanging over her life i have little confidence in this man's allegations mr lyon ended i confess his presence and speech are to me as the jarring of metal he bears the stamp of one who has never conceived aught of more sanctity than the lust of the eye and the pride of life he hints at some possible inheritance for you and denounces mysteriously the devices of mr jermyn all this may or may not have a true foundation but it is not my part to move in this matter save on a clear showing certainly not father said esther eagerly a little while ago these problematic prospects might have set her dreaming pleasantly but now for some reasons that she could not have put distinctly into words they affected her with dread chapter xxvii to hear with eyes is part of love's rare wit shakespeare sonnets custom calls me to't what custom wills in all things should we do't the dust on antique time would lie unswept and mountainous error be too highly heaped for truth to over peer coriolanus in the afternoon mr lyon went out to see the sick amongst his flock and esther who had been passing the morning in dwelling on the memories and the few remaining relics of her parents was left alone in the parlor amidst the lingering odors of the early dinner not easily got rid of in that small house rich people who know nothing of these vulgar details can hardly imagine their significance in the history of multitudes of human lives in which the sensibilities are never adjusted to the external conditions esther always felt so much discomfort from those odors that she usually seized any possibility of escaping from them and to day they oppressed her the more because she was weary with long continued agitation why did she not put on her bonnet as usual and get out into the open air it was one of those pleasant november afternoons pleasant in the wide country when the sunshine is on the clinging brown leaves of the young oaks and the last yellow leaves of the elms flutter down in the fresh but not eager breeze but esther sat still on the sofa pale and with reddened eyelids her curls all pushed back carelessly and her elbow resting on the ridgy black horsehair which usually almost set her teeth on edge if she pressed it even through her sleeve while her eyes rested blankly on the dull street lyddy had said miss you look sadly if you can't take a walk go and lie down she had never seen the curls in such disorder and she reflected that there had been a death from typhus recently but the obstinate miss only shook her head esther was waiting for the sake of not a probability but a mere possibility which made the brothy odors endurable apparently in less than half an hour the possibility came to pass for she changed her attitude almost started from her seat sat down again and listened eagerly if lyddy should send him away could she herself rush out and call him back why not such things were permissible where it was understood from the necessity of the case that there was only friendship but lyddy opened the door and said here's mr holt miss wants to know if you'll give him leave to come in i told him you was sadly oh yes lyddy beg him to come in i should not have persevered said felix as they shook hands only i know lyddy's dismal way but you do look ill he went on as he seated himself at the other end of the sofa or rather for that's a false way of putting it you look as if you had been very much distressed do you mind about my taking notice of it he spoke very kindly and looked at her more persistently than he had ever done before when her hair was perfect you are quite right i am not at all ill but i have been very much agitated this morning my father has been telling me things i never heard before about my mother and giving me things that belonged to her she died when i was a very little creature then it is no new pain or trouble for you and mr lyon i could not help being anxious to know that esther passed her hand over her brow before she answered i hardly know whether it is pain or something better than pleasure it has made me see things i was blind to before depths in my father's nature as she said this she looked at felix and their eyes met very gravely it is such a beautiful day he said it would do you good to go into the air let me take you along the river toward little treby will you i will put my bonnet on said esther unhesitatingly though they had never walked out together before it is true that to get into the fields they had to pass through the street and when esther saw some acquaintances she reflected that her walking alone with felix might be a subject of remark all the more because of his cap patched boots no cravat and thick stick esther was a little amazed herself at what she had come to so our lives glide on the river ends we don't know where and the sea begins and there is no more jumping ashore when they were in the streets esther hardly spoke felix talked with his usual readiness as easily as if he were not doing it solely to divert her thoughts first about job tudge's delicate chest and the probability that the little white faced monkey would not live long and then about a miserable beginning of a night school which was all he could get together at sproxton and the dismalness of that hamlet which was a sort of lip to the coalpit on one side and the public on the other and yet a paradise compared with the wynds of glasgow where there was little more than a chink of daylight to show the hatred in women's faces but soon they got into the fields where there was a right of way toward little treby now following the course of the river now crossing toward a lane and now turning into a cart track through a plantation here we are said felix when they had crossed the wooden bridge and were treading on the slanting shadows made by the elm trunks i think this is delicious i never feel less unhappy than in these late autumn afternoons when they are sunny less unhappy there now said esther smiling at him with some of her habitual sauciness i have caught you in self contradiction i have heard you quite furious against puling melancholy people if i had said what you have just said you would have given me a long lecture and told me to go home and interest myself in the reason of the rule of three very likely said felix beating the weeds according to the foible of our common humanity when it has a stick in its hand but i don't think myself a fine fellow because i'm melancholy i don't measure my force by the negations in me and think my soul must be a mighty one because it is more given to idle suffering than to beneficent activity that's what your favorite gentlemen do of the byronic bilious style i don't admit that those are my favorite gentlemen i've heard you defend them gentlemen like your rns who have no particular talent for the finite but a general sense that the infinite is the right thing for them they might as well boast of nausea as a proof of a strong inside stop stop you run on in that way to get out of my reach i convicted you of confessing that you are melancholy yes said felix thrusting his left hand into his pocket with a shrug as i could confess to a great many other things i'm not proud of the fact is there are not many easy lots to be drawn in the world at present and such as they are i am not envious of them i don't say life is not worth having to a man who has some sparks of sense and feeling and bravery in him and the finest fellow of all would be the one who could be glad to have lived because the world was chiefly miserable and his life had come to help some one who needed it he would be the man who had the most powers and the fewest selfish wants but i'm not up to the level of what i see to be best i'm often a hungry discontented fellow why have you made your life so hard then said esther rather frightened as she asked the question it seems to me you have tried to find just the most difficult task not at all said felix with curt decision my course was a very simple one it was pointed out to me by conditions that i saw as clearly as i see the bars of this stile it's a difficult stile too added felix striding over shall i help you or will you be left to yourself i can do without help thank you it was simple enough continued felix as they walked on if i meant to put a stop to the sale of those drugs i must keep my mother and of course at her age she would not leave the place she had been used to and i had made up my mind against what they call genteel business but suppose every one did as you do please to forgive me for saying so but i cannot see why you could not have lived as honorably with some employment that presupposes education and refinement because you can't see my history or my nature said felix bluntly i have to determine for myself and not for other men i don't blame them or think i am better than they their circumstances are different i would never choose to withdraw myself from the labor and common burden of the world but i do choose to withdraw myself from the push and the scramble for money and position any man is at liberty to call me a fool and say that mankind are benefited by the push and the scramble in the long run but i care for the people who live now and will not be living when the long run comes as it is i prefer going shares with the unlucky esther did not speak and there was silence between them for a minute or two till they passed through a gate into a plantation where there was no large timber but only thin stemmed trees and underwood so that the sunlight fell on the mossy spaces which lay open here and there see how beautiful those stooping birch stems are with the light on them said felix here is an old felled trunk they have not thought worth carrying away shall we sit down a little while yes the mossy ground with the dry leaves sprinkled over it is delightful to one's feet esther sat down and took off her bonnet that the light breeze might fall on her head felix too threw down his cap and stick lying on the ground with his back against the felled trunk i wish i felt more as you do she said looking at the point of her foot which was playing with a tuft of moss i can't help caring very much what happens to me and you seem to care so little about yourself you are thoroughly mistaken said felix it is just because i'm a very ambitious fellow with very hungry passions wanting a great deal to satisfy me that i have chosen to give up what people call worldly good at least that has been one determining reason it all depends on what a man gets into his consciousness what life thrusts into his mind so that it becomes present to him as remorse is present to the guilty or a mechanical problem to an inventive genius there are two things i've got present in that way one of them is the picture of what i should hate to be i'm determined never to go about making my face simpering or solemn and telling professional lies for profit or to get tangled in affairs where i must wink at dishonesty and pocket the proceeds and justify that knavery as part of a system that i can't alter if i once went into that sort of struggle for success i should want to win i should defend the wrong that i had once identified myself with i should become everything that i see now beforehand to be detestable and what's more i should do this as men are doing it every day for a ridiculously small prize perhaps for none at all perhaps for the sake of two parlors a rank eligible for the churchwardenship a discontented wife and several unhopeful children esther felt a terrible pressure on her heart the certainty of her remoteness from felix the sense that she was utterly trivial to him the other thing that's got into my mind like a splinter said felix after a pause is the life of the miserable the spawning life of vice and hunger i'll never be one of the sleek dogs the old catholics are right with their higher rule and their lower some are called to subject themselves to a harder discipline and renounce things voluntarily which are lawful for others it is the old word 'necessity' is laid upon me it seems to me you are stricter than my father is no i quarrel with no delight that is not base or cruel but one must sometimes accommodate one's self to a small share that is the lot of the majority i would wish the minority joy only they don't want my wishes again there was silence esther's cheeks were hot in spite of the breeze that sent her hair floating backward she felt an inward strain a demand on her to see things in a light that was not easy or soothing when felix had asked her to walk he seemed so kind so alive to what might be her feelings that she had thought herself nearer to him than she had ever been before but since they had come out he had appeared to forget all that and yet she was conscious that this impatience of hers was very petty battling in this way with her own little impulses and looking at the birch stems opposite till her gaze was too wide for her to see anything distinctly she was unaware how long they had remained without speaking she did not know that felix had changed his attitude a little and was resting his elbow on the tree trunk while he supported his head which was turned toward her suddenly he said in a lower tone than was habitual to him you are very beautiful she started and looked round at him to see whether his face would give some help to the interpretation of this novel speech he was looking up at her quite calmly very much as a reverential protestant might look at a picture of the virgin with a devoutness suggested by the type rather than by the image esther's vanity was not in the least gratified she felt that somehow or other felix was going to reproach her i wonder he went on still looking at her whether the subtle measuring of forces will ever come to measuring the force there would be in one beautiful woman whose mind was as noble as her face was beautiful who made a man's passion for her rush in one current with all the great aims of his life esther's eyes got hot and smarting it was no use trying to be dignified she had turned away her head and now said rather bitterly it is difficult for a woman ever to try to be anything good when she is not believed in when it is always supposed that she must be contemptible no dear esther it was the first time felix had been prompted to call her by her christian name and as he did so he laid his large hand on her two little hands which were clasped on her knees you don't believe that i think you contemptible when i first saw you i know i know said esther interrupting him impetuously but still looking away you mean you did think me contemptible then but it was very narrow of you to judge me in that way when my life had been so different from yours i have great faults i know i am selfish and think too much of my own small tastes and too little of what affects others but i am not stupid i am not unfeeling i can see what is better but i have not done you injustice since i knew more of you said felix gently yes you have said esther turning and smiling at him through her tears you talk to me like an angry pedagogue were you always wise remember the time when you were foolish or naughty that is not far off said felix curtly taking away his hand and clasping it with the other at the back of his head the talk which seemed to be introducing a mutual understanding such as had not existed before seemed to have undergone some check shall we get up and walk back now said esther after a few moments no said felix entreatingly don't move yet i dare say we shall never walk together or sit here again why not because i am a man who am warned by visions those old stories of visions and dreams guiding men have their truth we are saved by making the future present to ourselves i wish i could get visions then said esther smiling at him with an effort of playfulness in resistance to something vaguely mournful within her that is what i want said felix looking at her very earnestly don't turn your head do look at me and then i shall know if i may go on speaking i do believe in you but i want you to have such a vision of the future that you may never lose your best self some charm or other may be flung about you some of your attar of rose fascinations and nothing but a good strong terrible vision will save you and if it did save you you might be that woman i was thinking of a little while ago when i looked at your face the woman whose beauty makes a great task easier to men instead of turning them away from it i am not likely to see such fine issues but they may come where a woman's spirit is finely touched i should like to be sure they would come to you why are you not likely to know what becomes of me said esther turning away her eyes in spite of his command why should you not always be my father's friend and mine oh i shall go away as soon as i can to some large town said felix in his more usual tone some ugly wicked miserable place i want to be a demagogue of a new sort an honest one if possible who will tell the people they are blind and foolish and neither flatter them nor fatten on them i have my heritage an order i belong to i have the blood of a line of handicraftsmen in my veins and i want to stand up for the lot of the handicraftsman as a good lot in which a man may be better trained to all the best functions of his nature than if he belonged to the grimacing set who have visiting cards and are proud to be thought richer than their neighbors would nothing ever make it seem right to you to change your mind said esther she had rapidly woven some possibilities out of the new uncertainties in her own lot though she would not for the world have had felix know of her weaving suppose by some means or other a fortune might come to you honorably by marriage or in any other unexpected way would you see no change in your course no said felix peremptorily i will never be rich i don't count that as any peculiar virtue some men do well to accept riches but that is not my inward vocation i have no fellow feeling with the rich as a class the habits of their lives are odious to me thousands of men have wedded poverty because they expect to go to heaven for it i don't expect to go to heaven for it but i wed it because it enables me to do what i most want to do on earth whatever the hopes for the world may be whether great or small i am a man of this generation i will try to make life less bitter for a few within my reach it is held reasonable enough to toil for the fortunes of a family though it may turn to imbecility in the third generation i choose a family with more chances in it esther looked before her dreamily till she said that seems a hard lot yet it is a great one she rose to walk back then you don't think i'm a fool said felix loudly starting to his feet and then stooping to gather up his cap and stick of course you suspected me of that stupidity well women unless they are saint theresas or elizabeth frys generally think this sort of thing madness unless when they read of it in the bible a woman can hardly ever choose in that way she is dependent on what happens to her she must take meaner things because only meaner things are within her reach why can you imagine yourself choosing hardship as the better lot said felix looking at her with a sudden question in his eyes yes i can she said flushing over neck and brow their words were charged with a meaning dependent entirely on the secret consciousness of each nothing had been said which was necessarily personal they walked a few yards along the road by which they had come without further speech till felix said gently take my arm she took it and they walked home so entirely without conversation felix was struggling as a firm man struggles with a temptation seeing beyond it and disbelieving its lying promise esther was struggling as a woman struggles with the yearning for some expression of love and with vexation under that subjection to a yearning which is not likely to be satisfied each was conscious of a silence which each was unable to break till they entered malthouse lane and were within a few yards of the minister's door it is getting dusk felix then said will mr lyon be anxious about you no i think not lyddy would tell him that i went out with you and that you carried a large stick said esther with a light laugh felix went in with esther to take tea but the conversation was entirely between him and mr lyon about the tricks of canvassing the foolish personality of the placards and the probabilities of transome's return as to which felix declared himself to have become indifferent this scepticism made the minister uneasy he had great belief in the old political watchwords had preached that universal suffrage and no ballot were agreeable to the will of god and liked to believe that a visible instrument was forthcoming in the radical candidate who had pronounced emphatically against whig finality felix being in a perverse mood contended that universal suffrage would be equally agreeable to the devil that he would change his politics a little have a larger traffic and see himself more fully represented in parliament nay my friend said the minister you are again sporting with paradox for you will not deny that you glory in the name of radical or root and branch man as they said in the great times when nonconformity was in its giant youth a radical yes but i want to go to some roots a good deal lower down than the franchise truly there is a work within which cannot be dispensed with but it is our preliminary work to free men from the stifled life of political nullity and bring them into what milton calls 'the liberal air' wherein alone can be wrought the final triumphs of the spirit with all my heart but while caliban is caliban though you multiply him by a million he'll worship every trinculo that carries a bottle i forget though you don't read shakespeare mr lyon i am bound to confess that i have so far looked into a volume of esther's as to conceive your meaning but the fantasies therein were so little to be reconciled with a steady contemplation of that divine economy which is hidden from sense and revealed to faith that i forbore the reading as likely to perturb my ministrations esther sat by in unusual silence the conviction that felix willed her exclusion from his life was making it plain that something more than friendship between them was not so thoroughly out of the question as she had always inwardly asserted in her pain that his choice lay aloof from her she was compelled frankly to admit to herself the longing that it had been otherwise and that he had entreated her to share his difficult life he was like no one else to her he had seemed to bring at once a law and the love that gave strength to obey the law yet the next moment stung by his independence of her she denied that she loved him she had only longed for a moral support under the negations of her life if she were not to have that support all effort seemed useless esther had been so long used to hear the formulas of her father's belief without feeling or understanding them that they had lost all power to touch her the first religious experience of her life the first self questioning the first voluntary subjection the first longing to acquire the strength of greater motives and obey the more strenuous rule had come to her through felix holt no wonder that she felt as if the loss of him were inevitable backsliding but was it certain that she should lose him she did not believe that he was really indifferent to her chapter xxviii titus but what says jupiter i ask thee clown alas sir i know not jupiter i never drank with him in all my life titus andronicus the multiplication of uncomplimentary placards noticed by mr lyon and felix holt was one of several signs that the days of nomination and election were approaching the presence of the revising barrister in treby was not only an opportunity for all persons not otherwise busy to show their zeal for the purification of the voting lists but also to reconcile private ease and public duty by standing about the streets and lounging at doors it was no light business for trebians to form an opinion the mere fact of a public functionary with an unfamiliar title was enough to give them pause as a premise that was not to be quickly started from to mr pink the saddler for example until some distinct injury or benefit had accrued to him the existence of the revising barrister was like the existence of the young giraffe which wombwell had lately brought into those parts it was to be contemplated and not criticised mr pink professed a deep dyed toryism but he regarded all fault finding as radical and somewhat impious as disturbing to trade and likely to offend the gentry or the servants through whom their harness was ordered there was a nemesis in things which made objection unsafe and even the reform bill was a sort of electric eel which a thriving tradesman had better leave alone it was only the papists who lived far enough off to be spoken of uncivilly but mr pink was fond of news which he collected and retailed with perfect impartiality noting facts and rejecting comments hence he was well pleased to have his shop so constant a place of resort for loungers that to many trebians there was a strong association between the pleasures of gossip and the smell of leather he had the satisfaction of chalking and cutting and of keeping his journeymen close at work at the very time that he learned from his visitors who were those whose votes had been called in question before his honor how lawyer jermyn had been too much for lawyer labron about todd's cottages and how in the opinion of some townsmen this looking into the value of people's property and swearing it down below a certain sum was a nasty inquisitorial kind of thing while others observed that being nice to a few pounds was all nonsense they should put the figure high enough and then never mind if a voter's qualification was thereabouts but said mr sims the auctioneer everything was done for the sake of the lawyers mr pink suggested impartially that lawyers must live but mr sims having a ready auctioneering wit did not see that so many of them need live or that babies were born lawyers mr pink felt that this speculation was complicated by the ordering of side saddles for lawyers' daughters and returning to the firm ground of fact stated that it was getting dusk the dusk seemed deepened the next moment by a tall figure obstructing the doorway at sight of whom mr pink rubbed his hands and smiled and bowed more than once with evident solicitude to show honor where honor was due while he said mr christian sir how do you do sir christian answered with the condescending familiarity of a superior very badly i can tell you with these confounded braces that you were to make such a fine job of see old fellow they've burst out again very sorry sir can you leave them with me oh yes i'll leave them what's the news eh said christian half seating himself on a high stool and beating his boot with a hand whip well sir we look to you to tell us that said mr pink with a knowing smile you're at headquarters eh sir that was what i said to mr scales the other day he came up for some straps mr scales did and he asked that question in pretty near the same terms that you've done sir and i answered him as i may say ditto not meaning any disrespect to you sir but a way of speaking come that's gammon pink said christian you know everything you can tell me if you will who is the fellow employed to paste up transome's handbills what do you say mr sims said pink looking at the auctioneer why you know and i know well enough it's tommy trounsem an old crippling half mad fellow most people know tommy i've employed him myself for charity where shall i find him said christian at the cross keys in pollard's end most likely said mr sims i don't know where he puts himself when he isn't at the public he was a stoutish fellow fifteen year ago when he carried pots said mr pink ay and has snared many a hare in his time said mr sims but he was always a little cracked lord bless you he used to swear he had a right to the transome estate why what put that notion into his head said christian who had learned more than he expected the lawing sir nothing but the lawing about the estate there was a deal of it twenty year ago said mr pink tommy happened to turn up hereabout at that time a big lungeous fellow who would speak disrespectfully of hanybody oh he meant no harm said mr sims he was fond of a drop to drink and not quite right in the upper story and he could hear no difference between trounsem and transome it's an odd way of speaking they have in that part where he was born a little north'ard you'll hear it in his tongue now if you talk to him at the cross keys i shall find him eh said christian getting off his stool good day pink good day christian went straight from the saddler's to quorlen's the tory printer's with whom he had contrived a political spree quorlen was a new man in treby who had so reduced the trade of dow the old hereditary printer that dow had lapsed to whiggery and radicalism and opinions in general so far as they were contented to express themselves in a small stock of types quorlen had brought his duffield wit with him and insisted that religion and joking were the handmaids of politics on which principle he and christian undertook the joking and left the religion to the rector the joke at present in question was a practical one christian turning into the shop merely said i've found him out give me the placards and tucking a thickish flat bundle wrapped in a black glazed cotton bag under his arm walked out into the dusk again suppose now he said to himself as he strode along suppose there should be some secret to be got out of this old scamp or some notion that's as good as a secret to those who know how to use it that would be virtue rewarded but i'm afraid the old tosspot is not likely to be good for much there's truth in wine and there may be some in gin and muddy beer but whether it's truth worth my knowing is another question i've got plenty of truth but never any that was worth a sixpence to me the cross keys was a very old fashioned public its bar was a big rambling kitchen with an undulating brick floor the small paned windows threw an interesting obscurity over the far off dresser garnished with pewter and tin and with large dishes that seemed to speak of better times the two settles were half pushed under the wide mouthed chimney and the grate with its brick hobs massive iron crane and various pothooks suggested a generous plenty possibly existent in all moods and tenses except the indicative present one way of getting an idea of our fellow countrymen's miseries is to go and look at their pleasures the cross keys had a fungous featured landlord and a yellow sickly landlady with a large white kerchief bound round her cap as if her head had recently required surgery it had doctored ale an odor of bad tobacco and remarkably strong cheese it was not what astra when come back might be expected to approve as the scene of ecstatic enjoyment for the beings whose special prerogative it is to lift their sublime faces toward heaven still there was ample space on the hearth accommodation for narrative bagmen or boxmen room for a man to stretch his legs his brain was not pressed upon by a white wall within a yard of him and the light did not stare in mercilessly on bare ugliness turning the fire to ashes compared with some beerhouses of this more advanced period the cross keys of that day presented a high standard of pleasure but though this venerable public had not failed to share in the recent political excitement of drinking the pleasures it offered were not at this hour of the evening sought by a numerous company there were only three or four pipes being smoked by the firelight but it was enough for christian when he found that one of these was being smoked by the bill sticker whose large flat basket stuffed with placards leaned near him against the settle so splendid an apparition as christian was not a little startling at the cross keys and was gazed at in expectant silence but he was a stranger in pollard's end and was taken for the highest style of traveller when he declared that he was deucedly thirsty ordered sixpenny worth of gin and a large jug of water and putting a few drops of the spirit into his own glass invited tommy trounsem who sat next him to help himself tommy was not slower than a shaking hand obliged him to be in accepting this invitation he was a tall broad shouldered old fellow who had once been good looking but his cheeks and chest were both hollow now and his limbs were shrunken you've got some bills there master eh said christian pointing to the basket is there an auction coming on auction no said tommy with a gruff hoarseness which was the remnant of a jovial bass and with an accent which differed from the trebian fitfully as an early habit is wont to reassert itself i've nought to do wi' auctions i'm a pol'tical charicter it's me am getting trounsem into parl'ment trounsem said he the landlord observed taking out his pipe with a low laugh it's transome sir maybe you don't belong to this part it's the candidate 'ull do most for the workingmen and's proved it too in the way o' being open handed and wishing 'em to enjoy themselves if i'd twenty votes i'd give one for transome and i don't care who hears me the landlord peered out from his fungous cluster of features with a beery confidence that the high figure of twenty had somehow raised the hypothetic value of his vote spilkins now said tommy waving his hand to the landlord you let one gentelman speak to another will you this genelman wants to know about my bills does he or doesn't he what then i spoke according said the landlord mildly holding his own you're all very well spilkins returned tommy but y'aren't me i know what the bills are it's public business i'm none o' your common bill stickers master i've left off sticking up ten guineas reward for a sheep stealer or low stuff like that these are trounsem's bills and i'm the rightful family and so i give him a lift a trounsem i am and a trounsem i'll be buried and if old nick tries to lay hold on me for poaching i'll say 'you be hanged for a lawyer old nick every hare and pheasant on the trounsem's land is mine' and what rises the family rises old tommy and we're going to get into parl'ment that's the long and the short on't master and i'm the head o' the family and i stick the bills there's johnsons and thomsons and jacksons and billsons but i'm a trounsem i am what do you say to that master this appeal accompanied by a blow on the table while the landlord winked at the company was addressed to christian who answered with severe gravity i say there isn't any work more honorable than bill sticking no no said tommy wagging his head from side to side i thought you'd come in to that i thought you'd know better than say contrairy but i'll shake hands wi' you i don't want to knock any man's head off i'm a good chap a sound crock an old family kep' out o' my rights i shall go to heaven for all old nick as these celestial prospects might imply that a little extra gin was beginning to tell on the bill sticker christian wanted to lose no time in arresting his attention he laid his hand on tommy's and spoke emphatically but i'll tell you what you bill stickers are not up to you should be on the look out when debarry's side have stuck up fresh bills and go and paste yours over them i know where there's a lot of debarry's bills now come along with me and i'll show you we'll paste them over and then we'll come back and treat the company hooray said tommy let's be off then he was one of the thoroughly inured originally hale drunkards and did not easily lose his head or legs or the ordinary amount of method in his talk strangers often supposed that tommy was tipsy when he had only taken what he called one blessed pint chiefly from that glorious contentment with himself and his adverse fortunes which is not usually characteristic of the sober briton he knocked the ashes out of his pipe seized his paste vessel and his basket and prepared to start with a satisfactory promise that he could know what he was about the landlord and some others had confidently concluded that they understood all about christian now he was a transome's man come to see after the bill sticking in transome's interest the landlord telling his yellow wife snappishly to open the door for the gentleman hoped soon to see him again this is a transome's house sir he observed in respect of entertaining customers of that color i do my duty as a publican which if i know it is to turn back no genelman's money i say give every genelman a chance and the more the merrier in parl'ment and out of it and if anybody says they want but two parl'ment men i say it 'ud be better for trade if there was six of 'em and voters according ay ay said christian you're a sensible man landlord you don't mean to vote for debarry then eh not nohow said the landlord thinking that where negatives were good the more you had of them the better as soon as the door had closed behind christian and his new companion tommy said now master if you're to be my lantern don't you be a jacky lantern which i take to mean one as leads you the wrong way for i'll tell you what if you've had the luck to fall in wi' tommy trounsem don't you let him drop no no to be sure not said christian come along here we'll go to the back brewery wall first no no don't you let me drop give me a shilling any day you like and i'll tell you more nor you'll hear from spilkins in a week there isna many men like me i carried pots for fifteen year off and on what do you think o' that now for a man as might ha' lived up there at trounsem park and snared his own game which i'd ha' done said tommy wagging his head at christian in the dimness undisturbed by gas none o' your shooting for me it's two to one you'll miss snaring's more fishing like you bait your hook and if it isna the fishes' good will to come that's nothing again' the sporting genelman and that's what i say by snaring but if you'd a right to the transome estate how was it you were kept out of it old boy it was some foul shame or other eh it's the law that's what it is you're a good sort of chap i don't mind telling you there's folks born to property and there's folks catch hold on it and the law's made for them to catch hold i'm pretty deep i see a good deal further than spilkins there was ned patch the peddler used to say to me 'you canna read tommy' says he 'no thank you' says i 'i'm not going to crack my headpiece to make myself as big a fool as you' i was fond o' ned many's the pot we've had together i see well enough you're deep tommy how came you to know you were born to property it was the regester the parish regester said tommy with his knowing wag of the head that shows as you was born i allays felt it inside me as i was somebody and i could see other chaps thought it on me too and so one day at littleshaw where i kep' ferrets and a little bit of a public there come a fine man looking after me and walking me up and down wi' questions and i made out from the clerk as he'd been at the regester and i gave the clerk a pot or two and he got it off our parson as the name o' trounsem was a great name hereabout and i waits a bit for my fine man to come again thinks i if there's property wants a right owner i shall be called for for i didn't know the law then and i waited and waited till i see'd no fun i' waiting so i parted with my public and my ferrets for she was dead a' ready my wife was and i hadn't no cumbrance and off i started a pretty long walk to this country side for i could walk for a wager in them days ah well here we are at the back brewery wall put down your paste and your basket now old boy and i'll help you you paste and i'll give you the bills and then you can go on talking tommy obeyed automatically for he was now carried away by the rare opportunity of talking to a new listener and was only eager to go on with his story as soon as his back was turned and he was stooping over his paste pot christian with quick adroitness exchanged the placards in his own bag for those in tommy's basket christian's placards had not been printed at treby but were a new lot which had been sent from duffield that very day highly spiced quorlen had said coming from a pen that was up to that sort of thing christian had read the first of the sheaf and supposed they were all alike he proceeded to hand one to tommy and said here old boy paste this over the other and so when you got into this country side what did you do why i put up at a good public and ordered the best for i'd a bit o' money in my pocket and i axed about and they said to me if it's trounsem business you're after you go to lawyer jermyn and i went and says i going along he's maybe the fine man as walked me up and down but no such thing i'll tell you what lawyer jermyn was he stands you there and holds you away from him wi' a pole three yard long he stares at you and says nothing till you feel like a tomfool and then he threats you to set the justice on you and then he's sorry for you and hands you money and preaches you a sarmint and tells you you're a poor man and he'll give you a bit of advice and you'd better not be meddling wi' things belonging to the law else you be catched up in a big wheel and fly to bits and i went of a cold sweat and i wished i might never come i' sight o' lawyer jermyn again but he says if you keep i' this neighborhood behave yourself well and i'll pertect you i were deep enough but it's no use being deep 'cause you can never know the law and there's times when the deepest fellow's most frightened yes yes there now for another placard and so that was all all said tommy turning round and holding the paste brush in suspense don't you be running too quick thinks i 'i'll meddle no more i've got a bit o' money i'll buy a basket and be a pot man it's a pleasant life i shall live at publics and see the world and pick 'quaintance and get a chance penny' but when i'd turned into the red lion and got myself warm again wi' a drop o' hot something jumps into my head thinks i tommy you've done finely for yourself you're a rat as has broke up your house to take a journey and show yourself to a ferret and then it jumps into my head i'd once two ferrets as turned on one another and the little un killed the big un says i to the landlady 'missus could you tell me of a lawyer' says i 'not very big or fine but a second size a big potato like' 'that i can' says she 'there's one now in the bar parlor' 'be so kind as bring us together' says i and she cries out i think i hear her now 'mr johnson' and what do you think at this crisis in tommy's story the gray clouds which had been gradually thinning opened sufficiently to let down the sudden moonlight and show his poor battered old figure and face in the attitude and with the expression of a narrator sure of the coming effect on his auditor his body and neck stretched a little on one side and his paste brush held out with an alarming intention of tapping christian's coat sleeve at the right moment christian started to a safe distance and said it's wonderful i can't tell what to think then never do you deny old nick said tommy with solemnity i've believed in him more ever since who was johnson why johnson was the fine man as had walked me up and down with questions and i out with it to him then and there and he speaks me civil and says 'come away wi' me my good fellow' and he told me a deal o' law and he says 'whether you're a tommy trounsem or no it's no good to you but only to them as have got hold o' the property if you was a tommy trounsem twenty times over it 'ud be no good for the law's bought you out and your life's no good only to them as have catched hold o' the property the more you live the more they'll stick in not as they want you now' says he 'you're no good to anybody and you might howl like a dog foriver and the law 'ud take no notice on you' says johnson 'i'm doing a kind thing by you to tell you for that's the law' and if you want to know the law master you ask johnson i heard 'em say after as he was an understrapper at jermyn's i've never forgot it from that day to this but i saw clear enough as if the law hadn't been again' me the trounsem estate 'ud ha' been mine but folks are fools hereabouts and i've left off talking the more you tell 'em the truth the more they'll niver believe you and i went and bought my basket and the pots and come then fire away said christian here's another placard i'm getting a bit dry master well then make haste and you'll have something to drink all the sooner tommy turned to his work again and christian continuing his help said and how long has mr jermyn been employing you oh no particular time off and on but a week or two ago he sees me upo' the road and speaks to me uncommon civil and tells me to go up to his office and he'll give me employ and i was noways unwilling to stick the bills to get the family into parl'ment for there's no man can help the law and the family's the family whether you carry pots or no master i'm uncommon dry my head's a turning round it's talking so long on end the unwonted excitement of poor tommy's memory was producing a reaction well tommy said christian who had just made a discovery among the placards which altered the bent of his thoughts you may go back to the cross keys now if you like here's a half crown for you to spend handsomely i can't go back there myself just yet but you may give my respects to spilkins and mind you paste the rest of the bills early to morrow morning ay ay but don't you believe too much i' spilkins said tommy pocketing the half crown and showing his gratitude by giving this advice he's no harm much but weak he thinks he's at the bottom o' things because he scores you up but i bear him no ill will tommy trounsem's a good chap and any day you like to give me half a crown i'll tell you the same story over again not now i'm dry come help me up wi' these things you're a younger chap than me well i'll tell spilkins you'll come again another day the moonlight which had lit up poor tommy's oratorical attitude had served to light up for christian the print of the placards he had expected the copies to be various and had turned them half over at different depths of the sheaf before drawing out those he offered to the bill sticker suddenly the clearer light had shown him on one of them a name which was just then especially interesting to him and all the more when occurring in a placard intended to dissuade the electors of north loamshire from voting for the heir of the transomes he hastily turned over the bills that preceded and succeeded that he might draw out and carry away all of this pattern for it might turn out to be wiser for him not to contribute to the publicity of handbills which contained allusions to bycliffe versus transome there were about a dozen of them he pressed them together and thrust them into his pocket returning all the rest to tommy's basket to take away this dozen might not be to prevent similar bills from being posted up elsewhere but he had reason to believe that these were all of the same kind which had been sent to treby from duffield christian's interest in his practical joke had died out like a morning rushlight apart from this discovery in the placards old tommy's story had some indications in it that were worth pondering over where was that well informed johnson now was he still an understrapper of jermyn's with this matter in his thoughts christian only turned in hastily at quorlen's threw down the black bag which contained the captured radical handbills said he had done the job and hurried back to the manor that he might study his problem chapter xxix i doe believe that as the gall has severall receptacles in several creatures soe there's scarce any creature but hath that emunctorye somewhere sir thomas browne fancy what a game at chess would be if all the chessmen had passions and intellects more or less small and cunning if you were not only uncertain about your adversary's men but a little uncertain about your own if your knight could shuffle himself on to a new square by the sly if your bishop in disgust at your castling could wheedle your pawns out of their places and if your pawns hating you because they are pawns could make away from their appointed posts that you might get checkmate on a sudden you might be the longest headed of deductive reasoners and yet you might be beaten by your own pawns you would be especially likely to be beat if you depended arrogantly on your mathematical imagination and regarded your passionate pieces with contempt yet this imaginary chess is easy compared with the game a man has to play against his fellow men with other fellow men for his instruments he thinks himself sagacious perhaps because he trusts no bond except that of self interest but the only self interest he can safely rely on is what seems to be such to the mind he would use or govern can he ever be sure of knowing this matthew jermyn was under no misgivings as to the fealty of johnson he had been the making of johnson and this seems to many men as a reason for expecting devotion in spite of the fact that they themselves though very fond of their own persons and lives are not at all devoted to the maker they believe in johnson was a most serviceable subordinate being a man who aimed at respectability a family man who had a good church pew subscribed for engravings of banquet pictures where there were portraits of political celebrities and wished his children to be more unquestionably genteel than their father he presented all the more numerous handles of worldly motive by which a judicious superior might get a hold on him but this useful regard to respectability had its inconvenience in relation to such a superior it was a mark of some vanity and some pride which if they were not touched just in the right handling place were liable to become raw and sensitive jermyn was aware of johnson's weaknesses and thought he had flattered them sufficiently but on the point of knowing when we are disagreeable our human nature is fallible our lavender water our smiles our compliments and other polite falsities are constantly offensive when in the very nature of them they can only be meant to attract admiration and regard jermyn had often been unconsciously disagreeable to johnson over and above the constant offence of being an ostentatious patron he would never let johnson dine with his wife and daughters he would not himself dine at johnson's house when he was in town he often did what was equivalent to poohpoohing his conversation by not even appearing to listen and by suddenly cutting it short with a query on a new subject jermyn was able and politic enough to have commanded a great deal of success in his life but he could not help being handsome arrogant fond of being heard indisposed to any kind of comradeship amorous and bland toward women cold and self contained toward men you will hear very strong denials that an attorney's being handsome could enter into the dislike he excited but conversation consists a good deal in the denial of what is true from the british point of view masculine beauty is regarded very much as it is in the drapery business as good solely for the fancy department for young noblemen artists poets and the clergy some one who like mr lingon was disposed to revile jermyn perhaps it was sir maximus had called him a cursed sleek handsome long winded overbearing sycophant epithets which expressed rather confusedly the mingled character of the dislike he excited and serviceable john johnson himself sleek and mindful about his broadcloth and his cambric fronts had what he considered spirit enough within him to feel that dislike of jermyn gradually gathering force through years of obligation and subjection till it had become an actuating motive disposed to use an opportunity if it did not watch for one it was not this motive however but rather the ordinary course of business which accounted for johnson's playing a double part as an electioneering agent what men do in elections is not to be classed either among sins or marks of grace it would be profane to include business in religion and conscience refers to failure not to success still the sense of being galled by jermyn's harness was an additional reason for cultivating all relations that were independent of him and pique at harold transome's behavior to him in jermyn's office perhaps gave all the more zest to johnson's use of his pen and ink when he wrote a handbill in the service of garstin and garstin's incomparable agent putty full of innuendoes against harold transome as a descendant of the durfey transomes it is a natural subject of self congratulation to a man when special knowledge gained long ago without any forecast turns out to afford a special inspiration in the present and johnson felt a new pleasure in the consciousness that he of all people in the world next to jermyn had the most intimate knowledge of the transome affairs still better some of these affairs were secrets of jermyn's if in an uncomplimentary spirit he might have been called jermyn's man of straw it was a satisfaction to know that the unreality of the man john johnson was confined to his appearance in annuity deeds and that elsewhere he was solid locomotive and capable of remembering anything for his own pleasure and benefit to act with doubleness towards a man whose conduct was double was so near an approach to virtue that it deserved to be called by no meaner name than diplomacy by such causes it came to pass that christian held in his hands a bill in which jermyn was playfully alluded to as mr german cozen who won games by clever shuffling and odd tricks without any honor and backed durfey's crib against bycliffe in which it was adroitly implied that the so called head of the transomes was only the tail of the durfeys and that some said the durfeys would have died out and left their nest empty if it had not been for their german cozen johnson had not dared to use any recollections except such as might credibly exist in other minds besides his own in the truth of the case no one but himself had the prompting to recall these out worn scandals but it was likely enough that such foul winged things should be revived by election heats for johnson to escape all suspicion christian could gather only dim and uncertain inferences from this flat irony and heavy joking but one chief thing was clear to him he had been right in his conjecture that jermyn's interest about bycliffe had its source in some claim of bycliffe's on the transome property and then there was that story of the old bill sticker's which closely considered indicated that the right of the present transomes depended or at least had depended on the continuance of some other lives christian in his time had gathered enough legal notions to be aware that possession by one man sometimes depended on the life of another that a man might sell his own interest in property and the interest of his descendants while a claim on that property would still remain to some one else than the purchaser supposing the descendants became extinct and the interests they had sold were at an end but under what conditions the claim might be valid or void in any particular case was all darkness to him suppose bycliffe had any such claim on the transome estates how was christian to know whether at the present moment it was worth anything more than a bit of rotten parchment old tommy trounsem had said that johnson knew all about it but even if johnson were still above ground and all johnsons are mortal he might still be an understrapper of jermyn's in which case his knowledge would be on the wrong side of the hedge for the purposes of henry scaddon his immediate care must be to find out all he could about johnson he blamed himself for not having questioned tommy further while he had him at command but on this head the bill sticker could hardly know more than the less dilapidated denizens of treby now it had happened that during the weeks in which christian had been at work trying to solve the enigma of jermyn's interest about bycliffe johnson's mind also had been somewhat occupied with suspicion and conjecture as to new information on the subject of the old bycliffe claims which jermyn intended to conceal from him the letter which after his interview with christian jermyn had written with a sense of perfect safety to his faithful ally johnson was as we know written to a johnson who had found his self love incompatible with that faithfulness of which it was supposed to be the foundation anything that the patron felt it inconvenient for his obliged friend and servant to know became by that very fact an object of peculiar curiosity the obliged friend and servant secretly doted on his patron's inconvenience provided that he himself did not share it and conjecture naturally became active johnson's legal imagination being very differently furnished from christian's was at no loss to conceive conditions under which there might arise a new claim on the transome estates he had before him the whole history of the settlement of those estates made a hundred years ago by john justus transome entailing them whilst in his possession on his son thomas and his heirs male with remainder to the bycliffes in fee he knew that thomas son of john justus proving a prodigal had without the knowledge of his father the tenant in possession sold his own and his descendants' rights to a lawyer cousin named durfey that therefore the title of the durfey transomes in spite of that old durfey's tricks to show the contrary depended solely on the purchase of the base fee thus created by thomas transome and that the bycliffes were the remainder men who might fairly oust the durfey transomes if ever the issue of the prodigal thomas went clean out of existence and ceased to represent a right which he had bargained away from them johnson as jermyn's subordinate had been closely cognizant of the details concerning the suit instituted by successive bycliffes of whom maurice christian bycliffe was the last on the plea that the extinction of thomas transome's line had actually come to pass a weary suit which had eaten into the fortunes of two families and had only made the cankerworms fat the suit had closed with the death of maurice christian bycliffe in prison but before his death jermyn's exertions to get evidence that there was still issue of thomas transome's line surviving as a security of the durfey title had issued in the discovery of a thomas transome at littleshaw in stonyshire who was the representative of the pawned inheritance the death of maurice had made this discovery useless had made it seem the wiser part to say nothing about it and the fact had remained a secret known only to jermyn and johnson no other bycliffe was known or believed to exist and the durfey transomes might be considered safe unless yes there was an unless which johnson could conceive an heir or heiress of the bycliffes if such a personage turned out to be in existence might sometime raise a new and valid claim when once informed that wretched old tommy trounsem the bill sticker tottering drunkenly on the edge of the grave was the last issue remaining above ground from that dissolute thomas who played his esau part a century before while the poor old bill sticker breathed the durfey transomes could legally keep their possession in spite of a possible bycliffe proved real but not when the parish had buried the bill sticker still it is one thing to conceive conditions and another to see any chance of proving their existence johnson at present had no glimpse of such a chance and even if he ever gained the glimpse he was not sure that he should ever make any use of it his enquiries of medwin in obedience to jermyn's letter had extracted only a negative as to any information possessed by the lawyers of bycliffe concerning a marriage or expectation of offspring on his part but johnson felt not the less stung by curiosity to know what jermyn had found out that he had found something in relation to a possible bycliffe johnson felt pretty sure and he thought with satisfaction that jermyn could not hinder him from knowing what he already knew about thomas transome's issue many things might occur to alter his policy and give a new value to facts was it certain that jermyn would always be fortunate when greed and unscrupulousness exhibit themselves on a grand historical scale and there is a question of peace or war or amicable partition it often occurs that gentlemen of high diplomatic talents have their minds bent on the same object from different points of view each perhaps is thinking of a certain duchy or province with a view to arranging the ownership in such a way as shall best serve the purposes of the gentleman with high diplomatic talents in whom each is more especially interested but these select minds in high office can never miss their aims from ignorance of each other's existence or whereabouts their high titles may be learned even by common people from every pocket almanac but with meaner diplomats who might be mutually useful such ignorance is often obstructive mr john johnson and mr christian otherwise mr scaddon might have had a concentration of purpose and an ingenuity of device fitting them to make a figure in the parcelling of europe and yet they might never have met simply because johnson knew nothing of christian and because christian did not know where to find johnson chapter xxx his nature is too noble for the world he would not flatter neptune for his trident or jove for his power to thunder his heart's his mouth what his breast forges that his tongue must vent and being angry doth forget that ever he heard the name of death coriolanus christian and johnson did meet however by means that were quite incalculable the incident which brought them into communication was due to felix holt who of all men in the world had the least affinity either for the industrious or the idle parasite mr lyon had urged felix to go to duffield on the fifteenth of december to witness the nomination of the candidates for north loamshire the minister wished to hear what took place and the pleasure of gratifying him helped to outweigh some opposing reasons i shall get into a rage at something or other felix had said i've told you one of my weak points where i have any particular business i must incur the risks my nature brings but i've no particular business at duffield however i'll make a holiday and go by dint of seeing folly i shall get lessons in patience the weak point to which felix referred was his liability to be carried completely out of his own mastery by indignant anger his strong health his renunciation of selfish claims his habitual preoccupation with large thoughts and with purposes independent of everyday casualties secured him a fine and even temper free from moodiness or irritability he was full of long suffering toward his unwise mother who pressed him daily with her words and urged him so that his soul was vexed he had chosen to fill his days in a way that required the utmost exertion of patience that required those little rill like outflowings of goodness which in minds of great energy must be fed from deep sources of thought and passionate devotedness in this way his energies served to make him gentle and now in this twenty sixth year of his life they had ceased to make him angry except in the presence of something that roused his deep indignation when once exasperated the passionateness of his nature threw off the yoke of a long trained consciousness in which thought and emotion had been more and more completely mingled and concentrated itself in a rage as ungovernable as that of boyhood he was thoroughly aware of the liability and knew that in such circumstances he could not answer for himself sensitive people with feeble frames have often the same sort of fury within them but they are themselves shattered and shatter nothing felix had a terrible arm he knew that he was dangerous and he avoided the conditions that might cause him exasperation as he would have avoided intoxicating drinks if he had been in danger of intemperance the nomination day was a great epoch of successful trickery or to speak in a more parliamentary manner of war stratagem on the part of skilful agents and mr johnson had his share of inward chuckling and self approval as one who might justly expect increasing renown and be some day in as general request as the great putty himself to have the pleasure and the praise of electioneering ingenuity and also to get paid for it without too much anxiety whether the ingenuity will achieve its ultimate end perhaps gives to some select persons a sort of satisfaction in their superiority to their more agitated fellow men that is worthy to be classed with those generous enjoyments of having the truth chiefly to yourself and of seeing others in danger of drowning while you are high and dry which seem to have been regarded as unmixed privileges by lucretius and lord bacon one of mr johnson's great successes was this spratt the hated manager of the sproxton colliery in careless confidence that the colliers and other laborers under him would follow his orders had provided carts to carry some loads of voteless enthusiasm to duffield on behalf of garstin enthusiasm which being already paid for by the recognized benefit of garstin's existence as a capitalist with a share in the sproxton mines was not to cost much in the form of treating a capitalist was held worthy of pious honor as the cause why workingmen existed but mr spratt did not sufficiently consider that a cause which was to be proved by argument or testimony is not an object of passionate devotion to colliers a visible cause of beer acts on them much more strongly and even if there had been any love of the far off garstin hatred of the too immediate spratt would have been the stronger motive hence johnson's calculations made long ago with chubb the remarkable publican had been well founded and there had been diligent care to supply treating at duffield in the name of transome after the election was over it was not improbable that there would be much friendly joking between putty and johnson as to the success of this trick against putty's employer and johnson would be conscious of rising in the opinion of his celebrated senior for the show of hands and the cheering the hustling and the pelting the roaring and the hissing the hard hits with small missiles and the soft hits with small jokes were strong enough on the side of transome to balance the similar demonstrations for garstin even with the debarry interest in his favor and the inconvenient presence of spratt was easily got rid of by a dexterously managed accident which sent him bruised and limping from the scene of action mr chubb had never before felt so thoroughly that the occasion was up to a level with his talents while the clear daylight in which his virtue would appear when at the election he voted as his duty to himself bound him for garstin only gave him thorough repose of conscience felix holt was the only person looking on at the senseless exhibitions of this nomination day who knew from the beginning the history of the trick with the sproxton men he had been aware all along that the treating at chubb's had been continued and that so far harold transome's promise had produced no good fruits and what he was observing to day as he watched the uproarious crowd convinced him that the whole scheme would be carried out just as if he had never spoken about it he could be fair enough to transome to allow that he might have wished and yet have been unable with his notions of success to keep his promise and his bitterness toward the candidate only took the form of contemptuous pity for felix was not sparing in his contempt for men who put their inward honor in pawn by seeking the prizes of the world his scorn fell too readily on the fortunate but when he saw johnson passing to and fro and speaking to jermyn on the hustings he felt himself getting angry and jumped off the wheel of the stationary cart on which he was mounted that he might no longer be in sight of this man whose vitiating cant had made his blood hot and his fingers tingle on the first day of encountering him at sproxton it was a little too exasperating to look at this pink faced rotund specimen of prosperity to witness the power for evil that lay in his vulgar cant backed by another man's money and to know that such stupid iniquity flourished the flags of reform and liberalism and justice to the needy while the roaring and the scuffling were still going on felix with his thick stick in his hand made his way through the crowd and walked on through the duffield streets till he came out on a grassy suburb where the houses surrounded a small common here he walked about in the breezy air and ate his bread and apples telling himself that this angry haste of his about evils that could only be remedied slowly could be nothing else than obstructive and might some day he saw it so clearly that the thought seemed like a presentiment be obstructive of his own work not to waste energy to apply force where it would tell to do small work close at hand not waiting for speculative chances of heroism but preparing for them these were the rules he had been constantly urging on himself but what could be a greater waste than to beat a scoundrel who had law and opodeldoc at command after this meditation felix felt cool and wise enough to return into the town not however intending to deny himself the satisfaction of a few pungent words wherever there was place for them blows are sarcasms turned stupid wit is a form of force that leaves the limbs at rest anything that could be called a crowd was no longer to be seen the show of hands having been pronounced to be in favor of debarry and transome and a poll having been demanded for garstin the business of the day might be considered at an end but in the street where the hustings were erected and where the great hotels stood there were many groups as well as strollers and steady walkers to and fro men in superior greatcoats and well brushed hats were awaiting with more or less impatience an important dinner either at the crown which was debarry's house or at the three cranes which was garstin's or at the fox and hounds which was transome's knots of sober retailers who had already dined were to be seen at some shop doors men in very shabby coats and miscellaneous head coverings inhabitants of duffield and not county voters were lounging about in dull silence or listening some to a grimy man in a flannel shirt hatless and with turbid red hair who was insisting on political points with much more ease than had seemed to belong to the gentlemen speakers on the hustings and others to a scotch vendor of articles useful to sell whose unfamiliar accent seemed to have a guarantee of truth in it wanting as an association with everyday english some rough looking pipe smokers or distinguished cigar smokers chose to walk up and down in isolation and silence but the majority of those who had shown a burning interest in the nomination had disappeared and cockades no longer studded a close pressed crowd like and also very unlike meadow flowers among the grass the street pavement was strangely painted with fragments of perishable missiles ground flat under heavy feet but the workers were resting from their toil and the buzz and tread and the fitfully discernible voices seemed like stillness to felix after the roar with which the wide space had been filled when he left it the group round the speaker in the flannel shirt stood at the corner of a side street and the speaker himself was elevated by the head and shoulders above his hearers not because he was tall but because he stood on a projecting stone at the opposite corner of the turning was the great inn of the fox and hounds and this was the ultra liberal quarter of the high street felix was at once attracted by this group he liked the look of the speaker whose bare arms were powerfully muscular though he had the pallid complexion of a man who lives chiefly amidst the heat of furnaces he was leaning against the dark stone building behind him with folded arms the grimy paleness of his shirt and skin standing out in high relief against the dark stone building behind him he lifted up one forefinger and marked his emphasis with it as he spoke his voice was high and not strong but felix recognized the fluency and the method of an habitual preacher or lecturer it's the fallacy of all monopolists he was saying we know what monopolists are men who want to keep a trade all to themselves under the pretence that they'll furnish the public with a better article we know what that comes to in some countries a poor man can't afford to buy a spoonful of salt and yet there's salt enough in the world to pickle every living thing in it that's the sort of benefit monopolists do to mankind and these are the men who tell us we're to let politics alone they'll govern us better without our knowing anything about it we must mind our business we are ignorant we've no time to study great questions but i tell them this the greatest question in the world is how to give every man a man's share in what goes on in life hear hear said felix in his sonorous voice which seemed to give a new impressiveness to what the speaker had said every one looked at him the well washed face and its educated expression along with a dress more careless than that of most well to do workmen on a holiday made his appearance strangely arresting not a pig's share the speaker went on not a horse's not the share of a machine fed with oil only to make it work and nothing else it isn't a man's share just to mind your pin making or your glass blowing and higgle about your own wages and bring up your family to be ignorant sons of ignorant fathers and no better prospect that's a slave's share we want a freeman's share and that is to think and speak and act about what concerns us all and see whether these fine gentlemen who undertake to govern us are doing the best they can for us they've got the knowledge say they very well we've got the wants there's many a one would be idle if hunger didn't pinch him but the stomach sets us to work there's a fable told where the nobles are the belly and the people the members but i make another sort of fable i say we are the belly that feels the pinches and we'll set these aristocrats these great people who call themselves our brains to work at some way of satisfying us a bit better the aristocrats are pretty sure to try and govern for their own benefit but how are we to be sure they'll try and govern for ours they must be looked after i think like other workmen we must have what we call inspectors to see whether the work's well done for us we want to send our inspectors to parliament well they say you've got the reform bill what more can you want send your inspectors but i say the reform bill is a trick it's nothing but swearing in special constables to keep the aristocrats safe in their monopoly it's bribing some of the people with votes to make them hold their tongues about giving votes to the rest i say if a man doesn't beg or steal but works for his bread the poorer and the more miserable he is the more he'd need have a vote to send an inspector to parliament else the man who is worst off is likely to be forgotten and i say he's the man who ought to be first remembered else what does their religion mean why do they build churches and endow them that their sons may get paid well for preaching a saviour and making themselves as little like him as can be if i want to believe in jesus christ i must shut my eyes for fear i should see a parson and what's a bishop a bishop's a person dressed up who sits in the house of lords to help and throw out reform bills and because it's hard to get anything in the shape of a man to dress himself up like that and do such work they have to give him a palace for it and plenty of thousands a year and then they cry out 'the church is in danger' 'the poor man's church' and why is it the poor man's church because he can have a seat for nothing i think it is for nothing for it would be hard to tell what he gets by it if the poor man had a vote in the matter i think he'd choose a different sort of church to what that is but do you think the aristocrats will ever alter it if the belly doesn't pinch them not they it's part of their monopoly they'll supply us with our religion like everything else and get a profit on it they'll give us plenty of heaven we may have land there that's the sort of religion they like a religion that gives us workingmen heaven and nothing else but we'll offer to change with them we'll give them back some of their heaven and take it out in something for us and our children in this world they don't seem to care so much about heaven themselves till they feel the gout very bad but you won't get them to give up anything else if you don't pinch 'em for it and to pinch them enough we must get the suffrage we must get votes that we may send the men to parliament who will do our work for us and we must have parliament dissolved every year that we may change our man if he doesn't do what we want him to do and we must have the country divided so that the little kings of the counties can't do as they like but must be shaken up in one bag with us i say if we workingmen are ever to get a man's share we must have universal suffrage and annual parliaments and the vote by ballot and electoral districts no something else before all that said felix again startling the audience into looking at him but the speaker glanced coldly at him and went on that's what sir francis burdett went in for fifteen years ago and it's the right thing for us if it was tomfool who went in for it you must lay hold of such handles as you can i don't believe much in liberal aristocrats but if there's any fine carved gold headed stick of an aristocrat will make a broomstick of himself i'll lose no time but i'll sweep with him and that's what i think about transome and if any of you have acquaintance among county voters give 'em a hint that you wish 'em to vote for transome at the last word the speaker stepped down from his slight eminence and walked away rapidly like a man whose leisure was exhausted and who must go about his business but he had left an appetite in his audience for further oratory and one of them seemed to express a general sentiment as he hurried immediately to felix and said come sir what do you say felix did at once what he would very likely have done without being asked he stepped on the stone and took off his cap by an instinctive prompting that always led him to speak uncovered the effect of his figure in relief against the stone background was unlike that of the previous speaker he was considerably taller his head and neck were more massive and the expression of his mouth and eyes was something very different from the mere acuteness and rather hard lipped antagonism of the trades union man felix holt's face had the look of habitual meditative abstraction from objects of mere personal vanity or desire which is the peculiar stamp of culture and makes a very roughly cut face worthy to be called the human face divine even lions and dogs know a distinction between men's glances and doubtless those duffield men in the expectation with which they looked up at felix were unconsciously influenced by the grandeur of his full yet firm mouth and the calm clearness of his gray eyes which were somehow unlike what they were accustomed to see along with an old brown velveteen coat and an absence of chin propping when he began to speak the contrast of voice was still stronger than that of appearance the man in the flannel shirt had not been heard had probably not cared to be heard beyond the immediate group of listeners but felix at once drew the attention of persons comparatively at a distance in my opinion he said almost the moment after he was addressed that was a true word spoken by your friend when he said the great question was how to give every man a man's share in life but i think he expects voting to do more toward it than i do i want the workingmen to have power i'm a workingman myself and i don't want to be anything else but there are two sorts of power there's a power to do mischief to undo what has been done with great expense and labor to waste and destroy to be cruel to the weak to lie and quarrel and to talk poisonous nonsense that's the sort of power that ignorant numbers have it never made a joint stool or planted a potato do you think it's likely to do much toward governing a great country and making wise laws and giving shelter food and clothes to millions of men ignorant power comes in the end to the same thing as wicked power it makes misery it's another sort of power that i want us workingmen to have and i can see plainly enough that our all having votes will do little toward it at present i hope we or the children that come after us will get plenty of political power some time i tell everybody plainly i hope there will be great changes and that some time whether we live to see it or not men will have come to be ashamed of things they're proud of now but i should like to convince you that votes would never give you political power worth having while things are as they are now and that if you go the right way to work you may get power sooner without votes perhaps all you who hear me are sober men who try to learn as much of the nature of things as you can and to be as little like fools as possible a fool or idiot is one who expects things to happen that never can happen he pours milk into a can without a bottom and expects the milk to stay there the more of such vain expectations a man has the more he is a fool or idiot and if any working man expects a vote to do for him what it never can do he's foolish to that amount if no more i think that's clear enough eh hear hear said several voices but they were not those of the original group they belonged to some strollers who had been attracted by felix holt's vibrating voice and were tories from the crown among them was christian who was smoking a cigar with a pleasure he always felt in being among people who did not know him and doubtless took him to be something higher than he really was hearers from the fox and hounds also were slowly adding themselves to the nucleus felix accessible to the pleasure of being listened to went on with more and more animation the way to get rid of folly is to get rid of vain expectations and of thoughts that don't agree with the nature of things the men who have had true thoughts about water and what it will do when it is turned into steam and under all sorts of circumstances have made themselves a great power in the world they are turning the wheels of engines that will help to change most things but no engines would have done if there had been false notions about the way water would act now all the schemes about voting and districts and annual parliaments and the rest are engines and the water or steam the force that is to work them must come out of human nature out of men's passions feelings desires whether the engines will do good work or bad depends on these feelings and if we have false expectations about men's characters we are very much like the idiot who thinks he'll carry milk in a can without a bottom in my opinion the notions about what mere voting will do are very much of that sort that's very fine said a man in dirty fustian with a scornful laugh but how are we to get the power without votes i'll tell you what's the greatest power under heaven said felix and that is public opinion the ruling belief in society about what is right and what is wrong what is honorable and what is shameful that's the steam that is to work the engines how can political freedom make us better any more than a religion we don't believe in if people laugh and wink when they see men abuse and defile it and while public opinion is what it is while men have no better beliefs about public duty while corruption is not felt to be a damning disgrace while men are not ashamed in parliament and out of it to make public questions which concern the welfare of millions a mere screen for their own petty private ends i say no fresh scheme of voting will much mend our condition for take us workingmen of all sorts suppose out of every hundred who had a vote there were thirty who had some soberness some sense to choose with some good feeling to make them wish the right thing for all and suppose there were seventy out of the hundred who were half of them not sober who had no sense to choose one thing in politics more than another and who had so little good feeling in them that they wasted on their own drinking the money that should have helped to feed and clothe their wives and children and another half of them who if they didn't drink were too ignorant or stupid to see any good for themselves better than pocketing a five shilling piece when it was offered them where would be the political power of the thirty sober men the power would lie with the seventy drunken and stupid votes and i'll tell you what sort of men would get the power what sort of men would end by returning whom they pleased to parliament felix had seen every face around him and had particularly noticed a recent addition to his audience but now he looked about him without appearing to fix his glance on any one in spite of his cooling meditations an hour ago his pulse was getting quickened by indignation and the desire to crush what he hated was likely to vent itself in articulation his tone became more biting they would be men who would undertake to do the business for a candidate and return him men who have no real opinions but who pilfer the words of every opinion and turn them into a cant which will serve their purpose at the moment men who look out for dirty work to make their fortunes by because dirty work wants little talent and no conscience men who know all the ins and outs of bribery because there is not a cranny in their own souls where a bribe can't enter such men as these will be the masters wherever there's a majority of voters who care more for money for drink more for some mean little end which is their own and nobody else's than for anything that has ever been called right in the world for suppose there's a poor voter named jack who has seven children and twelve or fifteen shillings a week wages perhaps less jack can't read i don't say whose fault that is he never had the chance to learn he knows so little that he perhaps thinks god made the poor laws and if anybody said the pattern of the work house was laid down in the testament he wouldn't be able to contradict them what is poor jack likely to do when he sees a smart stranger coming to him who happens to be just one of these men that i say will be the masters till public opinion gets too hot for them he's a middle sized man we'll say stout with coat upon coat of fine broadcloth open enough to show a fine gold chain none of your dark scowling men but one with an innocent pink and white skin and very smooth light hair a most respectable man who calls himself a good sound well known english name as green or baker or wilson or let us say johnson felix was interrupted by an explosion of laughter from a majority of the bystanders some eyes had been turned on johnson who stood on the right hand of felix at the very beginning of the description and these were gradually followed by others till at last every hearer's attention was fixed on him and the first burst of laughter from the two or three who knew the attorney's name let every one sufficiently into the secret to make the amusement common johnson who had kept his ground till his name was mentioned now turned away looking unusually white after being unusually red and feeling by an attorney's instinct for his pocket book as if he felt it was a case for taking down the names of witnesses all the well dressed hearers turned away too thinking they had had the cream of the speech in the joke against johnson which as a thing worth telling helped to recall them to the scene of dinner who is this johnson said christian to a young man who had been standing near him and had been one of the first to laugh christian's curiosity had naturally been awakened by what might prove a golden opportunity oh a london attorney he acts for transome that tremendous fellow at the corner there is some red hot radical demagogue and johnson has offended him i suppose else he wouldn't have turned in that way on a man of their own party i had heard there was a johnson who was an understrapper of jermyn's said christian well so this man may have been for what i know but he's a london man now a very busy fellow on his own legs in bedford row ha ha it's capital though when these liberals get a slap in the face from the workingmen they're so very fond of another turn along the street enabled christian to come to a resolution having seen jermyn drive away an hour before he was in no fear he walked at once to the fox and hounds and asked to speak to mr johnson a brief interview in which christian ascertained that he had before him the johnson mentioned by the bill sticker issued in the appointment of a longer one at a later hour and before they left duffield they had come not exactly to a mutual understanding but to an exchange of information mutually welcome christian had been very cautious in the commencement only intimating that he knew something important which some chance hints had induced him to think might be interesting to mr johnson but that this entirely depended on how far he had a common interest with mr jermyn johnson replied that he had much business in which that gentleman was not concerned but that to a certain extent they had a common interest probably then christian observed the affairs of the transome estate were part of the business in which mr jermyn and mr johnson might be understood to represent each other in which case he need not detain mr johnson at this hint johnson could not conceal that he was becoming eager he had no idea what christian's information was but there were many grounds on which johnson desired to know as much as he could about the transome affairs independently of jermyn by little and little an understanding was arrived at christian told of his interview with tommy trounsem and stated that if johnson could show him whether the knowledge could have any legal value he could bring evidence that a legitimate child of bycliffe's existed he felt certain of his fact and of his proof johnson explained that in this case the death of the old bill sticker would give the child the first valid claim to the bycliffe heirship that for his own part he should be glad to further a true claim but that caution would have to be observed how did christian know that jermyn was informed on this subject christian more and more convinced that johnson would be glad to counteract jermyn at length became explicit about esther but still withheld his own real name and the nature of his relations with bycliffe he said he would bring the rest of his information when mr johnson took the case up seriously and place it in the hands of bycliffe's old lawyers of course he would do that johnson replied that he would certainly do that but that there were legal niceties which mr christian was probably not acquainted with that esther's claim had not yet accrued and that hurry was useless the two men parted each in distrust of the other but each well pleased to have learned something johnson was not at all sure how he should act but thought it likely that events would soon guide him christian was beginning to meditate a way of securing his own ends without depending in the least on johnson's procedure it was enough for him that he was now assured of esther's legal claim on the transome estates chapter xxxi in the copia of the factious language the word tory was entertained and being a vocal clever sounding word readily pronounced it kept its hold and took possession of the foul mouths of the faction the loyalists began to cheer up and to take heart of grace and in the working of this crisis according to the common law of scolding they considered which way to make payment for so much of tory as they had been treated with to clear scores immediately the train took and ran like wildfire and became general and so the account of tory was balanced and soon began to run up a sharp score on the other side north's examen p at last the great epoch of the election for north loamshire had arrived the roads approaching treby were early traversed by a larger number of vehicles horsemen and also foot passengers than were ever seen at the annual fair treby was the polling place for many voters whose faces were quite strange in the town and if there were some strangers who did not come to poll though they had business not unconnected with the election they were not liable to be regarded with suspicion or especial curiosity it was understood that no division of a county had ever been more thoroughly canvassed and that there would be a hard run between garstin and transome mr johnson's headquarters were at duffield but it was a maxim which he repeated after the great putty that a capable agent makes himself omnipresent and quite apart from the express between him and jermyn mr john johnson's presence in the universe had potent effects on this december day at treby magna a slight drizzling rain which was observed by some tories who looked out of their bedroom windows before six o'clock made them hope that after all the day might pass off better than alarmists had expected the rain was felt to be somehow on the side of quiet and conservatism but soon the breaking of the clouds and the mild gleams of a december sun brought back previous apprehensions as there were already precedents for riot at a reformed election and as the trebian district had had its confidence in the natural course of things somewhat shaken by a landed proprietor with an old name offering himself as a radical candidate the election had been looked forward to by many with a vague sense that it would be an occasion something like a fighting match when bad characters would probably assemble and there might be struggles and alarms for respectable men which would make it expedient for them to take a little neat brandy as a precaution beforehand and a restorative afterward the tenants on the transome estate were comparatively fearless poor mr goffe of rabbit's end considered that one thing was as mauling as the other and that an election was no worse than the sheep rot while mr dibbs taking the more cheerful view of a prosperous man reflected that if the radicals were dangerous it was safer to be on their side it was the voters for debarry and garstin who considered that they alone had the right to regard themselves as targets for evil minded men and mr crowder if he could have got his ideas countenanced would have recommended a muster of farm servants with defensive pitchforks on the side of church and king but the bolder men were rather gratified by the prospect of being groaned at so that they might face about and groan in return mr crow the high constable of treby inwardly rehearsed a brief address to a riotous crowd in case it should be wanted having been warned by the rector that it was a primary duty on these occasions to keep a watch against provocation as well as violence the rector with a brother magistrate who was on the spot had thought it desirable to swear in some special constables but the presence of loyal men not absolutely required for the polling was not looked at in the light of a provocation the benefit clubs from various quarters made a show some with the orange colored ribbons and streamers of the true tory candidate some with the mazarine of the whig the orange colored bands played auld lang syne and a louder mazarine band came across them with oh whistle and i will come to thee my lad probably as the tune the most symbolical of liberalism which their repertory would furnish there was not a single club bearing the radical blue the sproxton club members wore the mazarine and mr chubb wore so much of it that he looked at a sufficient distance like a very large gentianella it was generally understood that these brave fellows representing the fine institution of benefit clubs holding aloft the motto let brotherly love continue were a civil force calculated to encourage voters of sound opinions and keep up their spirits but a considerable number of unadorned heavy navvies colliers and stone pit men who used their freedom as british subjects to be present in treby on this great occasion looked like a possible uncivil force whose politics were dubious until it was clearly seen for whom they cheered and for whom they groaned thus the way up to the polling booths was variously lined and those who walked it to whatever side they belonged had the advantage of hearing from the opposite side what were the most marked defects or excesses in their personal appearance for the trebians of that day held without being aware that they had cicero's authority for it that the bodily blemishes of an opponent were a legitimate ground for ridicule but if the voter frustrated wit by being handsome he was groaned at and satirized according to a formula in which the adjective was tory whig or radical as the case might be and the substantive a blank to be filled up after the taste of the speaker some of the more timid had chosen to go through this ordeal as early as possible in the morning one of the earliest was mr timothy rose the gentleman farmer from leek malton he had left home with some foreboding having swathed his more vital parts in layers of flannel and put on two greatcoats as a soft kind of armor but reflecting with some trepidation that there were no resources for protecting his head he once more wavered in his intention to vote he once more observed to mrs rose that these were hard times when a man of independent property was expected to vote willy nilly but finally coerced by the sense that he should be looked ill on in these times if he did not stand by the gentlemen round about he set out in his gig taking with him a powerful wagoner whom he ordered to keep him in sight as he went to the polling booth it was hardly more than nine o'clock when mr rose having thus come up to the level of his times cheered himself with a little cherry brandy at the marquis drove away in a much more courageous spirit and got down at mr nolan's just outside the town the retired londoner he considered was a man of experience who would estimate properly the judicious course he had taken and could make it known to others mr nolan was superintending the removal of some shrubs in his garden well mr nolan said rose twinkling a self complacent look over the red prominence of his cheeks have you been to give your vote yet no all in good time i shall go presently well i wouldn't lose an hour i wouldn't i said to myself if i've got to do gentlemen a favor i'll do it at once you see i've got no landlord nolan i'm in that position o' life that i can be independent just so my dear sir said the wiry faced nolan pinching his under lip between his thumb and finger and giving one of those wonderful universal shrugs by which he seemed to be recalling all his garments from a tendency to disperse themselves come in and see mrs nolan no no thankye mrs rose expects me back but as i was saying i'm a independent man and i consider it's not my part to show favor to one more than another but to make things as even as i can if i'd been a tenant to anybody well in course i must have voted for my landlord that stands to sense but i wish everybody well and if one's returned to parliament more than another nobody can say it's my doing for when you can vote for two you can make things even so i gave one to debarry and one to transome and i wish garstin no ill but i can't help the odd number and he hangs on to debarry they say god bless me sir said mr nolan coughing down a laugh don't you perceive that you might as well have stayed at home and not voted at all unless you would rather send a radical to parliament than a sober whig well i'm sorry you should have anything to say against what i've done nolan said mr rose rather crestfallen though sustained by inward warmth i thought you'd agree with me as you're a sensible man but the most a independent man can do is to try and please all and if he hasn't the luck here's wishing i may do it another time added mr rose apparently confounding a toast with a salutation for he put out his hand for a passing shake and then stepped into his gig again at the time that mr timothy rose left the town the crowd in king street and in the market place where the polling booths stood was fluctuating voters as yet were scanty and brave fellows who had come from any distance this morning or who had sat up late drinking the night before required some reinforcement of their strength and spirits every public house in treby not excepting the venerable and sombre cross keys was lively with changing and numerous company not of course that there was any treating treating necessarily had stopped from moral scruples when once the writs were out but there was drinking which did equally well under any name poor tommy trounsem breakfasting here on falstaff's proportion of bread and something which for gentility's sake i will call sack was more than usually victorious over the ills of life and felt himself one of the heroes of the day he had an immense light blue cockade in his hat and an amount of silver in a dirty little canvas bag which astonished himself for some reason at first inscrutable to him he had been paid for his bill sticking with great liberality at mr jermyn's office in spite of his having been the victim of a trick by which he had once lost his own bills and pasted up debarry's but he soon saw that this was simply a recognition of his merit as an old family kept out of its rights and also of his peculiar share in an occasion when the family was to get into parliament under these circumstances it was due from him that he should show himself prominently where business was going forward and give additional value by his presence to every vote for transome with this view he got a half pint bottle filled with his peculiar kind of sack and hastened back to the market place feeling good natured and patronizing toward all political parties and only so far partial as his family bound him to be but a disposition to concentrate at that extremity of king street which issued in the market place was not universal among the increasing crowd some of them seemed attracted toward another nucleus at the other extremity of king street near the seven stars this was garstin's chief house where his committee sat and it was also a point which must necessarily be passed by many voters entering the town on the eastern side it seemed natural that the mazarine colors should be visible here and that pack the tall shepherd of the sproxton men should be seen moving to and fro where there would be a frequent opportunity of cheering the voters for a gentleman who had the chief share in the sproxton mines but the side lanes and entries out of king street were numerous enough to relieve any pressure if there was need to make way the lanes had a distinguished reputation two of them had odors of brewing one had a side entrance to mr tiliot's wine and spirit vaults up another mr muscat's cheeses were frequently being unloaded and even some of the entries had those cheerful suggestions of plentiful provision which were among the characteristics of treby between ten and eleven the voters came in more rapid succession and the whole scene became spirited cheers sarcasms and oaths which seemed to have a flavor of wit for many hearers were beginning to be reinforced by more practical demonstrations dubiously jocose there was a disposition in the crowd to close and hem in the way for voters either going or coming until they had paid some kind of toll it was difficult to see who set the example in the transition from words to deeds some thought it was due to jacob cuff a tory charity man who was a well known ornament of the pothouse and gave his mind much leisure for amusing devices but questions of origination in stirring periods are notoriously hard to settle it is by no means necessary in human things that there should be only one beginner this however is certain that mr chubb who wished it to be noticed that he voted for garstin solely was one of the first to get rather more notice than he wished and that he had his hat knocked off and crushed in the interest of debarry by tories opposed to coalition on the other hand some said it was at the same time that mr pink the saddler being stopped on his way and made to declare that he was going to vote for debarry got himself well chalked as to his coat and pushed up an entry where he remained the prisoner of terror combined with the want of any back outlet and never gave his vote that day the second tory joke was performed with much gusto the majority of the transome tenants came in a body from the ram inn with mr banks the bailiff leading them poor goffe was the last of them and his worn melancholy look and forward leaning gait gave the jocose cuff the notion that the farmer was not what he called compus mr goffe was cut off from his companions and hemmed in asked by voices with hot breath close to his ear how many horses he had how many cows how many fat pigs then jostled from one to another who made trumpets with their hands and deafened him by telling him to vote for debarry in this way the melancholy goffe was hustled on till he was at the polling booth filled with confused alarms the immediate alarm being that of having to go back in still worse fashion than he had come arriving in this way after the other tenants had left he astonished all hearers who knew him for a tenant of the transomes by saying debarry and was jostled back trembling amid shouts of laughter by stages of this kind the fun grew faster and was in danger of getting rather serious the tories began to feel that their jokes were returned by others of a heavier sort and that the main strength of the crowd was not on the side of sound opinion but might come to be on the side of sound cudgelling and kicking the navvies and pitmen in dishabille seemed to be multiplying and to be clearly not belonging to the party of order the shops were freely resorted to for various forms of playful missiles and weapons and news came to the magistrates watching from the large window of the marquis that a gentleman coming in on horseback at the other end of the street to vote for garstin had had his horse turned round and frightened into a headlong gallop out of it again mr crow and his subordinates and all the special constables felt that it was necessary to make some energetic effort or else every voter would be intimidated and the poll must be adjourned the rector determined to get on horseback and go amidst the crowd with the constables and he sent a message to mr lingon who was at the ram calling on him to do the same sporting jack was sure the good fellows meant no harm but he was courageous enough to face any bodily dangers and rode out in his brown leggings and colored bandana speaking persuasively it was nearly twelve o'clock when this sally was made the constables and magistrates tried the most pacific measures and they seemed to succeed there was a rapid thinning of the crowd the most boisterous disappeared or seemed to do so by becoming quiet missiles ceased to fly and a sufficient way was cleared for voters along king street the magistrates returned to their quarters and the constables took convenient posts of observation mr wace who was one of debarry's committee had suggested to the rector that it might be wise to send for the military from duffield with orders that they should station themselves at hathercote three miles off there was so much property in the town that it would be better to make it secure against risks but the rector felt that this was not the part of a moderate and wise magistrate unless the signs of riot recurred he was a brave man and fond of thinking that his own authority sufficed for the maintenance of the general good in treby chapter xxxii go from me yet i feel that i shall stand henceforward in thy shadow nevermore alone upon the threshold of my door of individual life i shall command the uses of my soul nor lift my hand serenely in the sunshine as before without the sense of that which i forbore thy touch upon the palm the widest land doom takes to part us leaves thy heart in mine with pulses that beat double what i do and what i dream include thee as the wine must taste of its own grapes and when i sue god for myself he hears that name of thine and sees within my eyes the tears of two mrs browning felix holt seated at his work without his pupils who had asked for a holiday with a notion that the wooden booths promised some sort of show noticed about eleven o'clock that the noises which reached him from the main street were getting more and more tumultuous he had long seen bad auguries for this election but like all people who dread the prophetic wisdom that ends in desiring the fulfillment of its own evil forebodings he had checked himself with remembering that though many conditions were possible which might bring on violence there were just as many which might avert it there would perhaps be no other mischief than what he was already certain of with these thoughts he sat down quietly to his work meaning not to vex his soul by going to look on at things he would fain have made different if he could but he was of a fiber that vibrated too strongly to the life around him to shut himself away in quiet even from suffering and irremediable wrong as the noises grew louder and wrought more and more strongly on his imagination he was obliged to lay down his delicate wheel work his mother came from her turnip paring in the kitchen where little job was her companion to observe that they must be killing everybody in the high street and that the election which had never been before at treby must have come for a judgment that there were mercies where you didn't look for them and that she thanked god in his wisdom for making her live up a back street felix snatched his cap and rushed out but when he got to the turning into the market place the magistrates were already on horseback there the constables were moving about and felix observed that there was no strong spirit of resistance to them he stayed long enough to see the partial dispersion of the crowd and the restoration of tolerable quiet and then went back to mrs holt to tell her that there was nothing to fear now he was going out again and she must not be in any anxiety at his absence she might set by his dinner for him felix had been thinking of esther and her probable alarm at the noises that must have reached her more distinctly than they had reached him for malthouse yard was removed but a little way from the main street mr lyon was away from home having been called to preach charity sermons and attend meetings in a distant town and esther with the plaintive lyddy for her sole companion was not cheerfully circumstanced felix had not been to see her yet since her father's departure but to day he gave way to new reasons miss esther was in the garret lyddy said trying to see what was going on but before she was fetched she came running down the stairs drawn by the knock at the door which had shaken the small dwelling i am so thankful to see you she said eagerly pray come in when she had shut the parlor door behind them felix said i suspected that you might have been made anxious by the noises i came to tell you that things are quiet now though indeed you can hear that they are i was frightened said esther the shouting and roaring of rude men is so hideous it is a relief to me that my father is not at home that he is out of the reach of any danger he might have fallen into if he had been here but i gave you credit for being in the midst of the danger she added smiling with a determination not to show much feeling sit down and tell me what has happened they sat down at the extremities of the old black sofa and felix said to tell you the truth i had shut myself up and tried to be as indifferent to the election as if i'd been one of the fishes in the lapp till the noises got too strong for me but i only saw the tail end of the disturbance the poor noisy simpletons seemed to give way before the magistrates and the constables i hope nobody has been much hurt the fear is that they may turn out again by and by their giving way so soon may not be altogether a good sign there's a great number of heavy fellows in the town if they go and drink more the last end may be worse than the first however felix broke off as if this talk was futile clasped his hands behind his head and leaning backward looked at esther who was looking at him may i stay here a little while he said after a moment which seemed long pray do said esther coloring to relieve herself she took some work and bowed her head over her stitching it was in reality a little heaven to her that felix was there but she saw beyond it saw that by and by he would be gone and that they should be farther on their way not toward meeting but parting his will was impregnable he was a rock and she was no more to him than the white clinging mist cloud i wish i could be sure that you see things just as i do he said abruptly after a minute's silence i am sure you see them much more wisely than i do said esther almost bitterly without looking up there are some people one must wish to judge truly not to wish it would be mere hardness i know you think i am a man without feeling at least without strong affections you think i love nothing but my own resolutions suppose i reply in the same sort of strain said esther with a little toss of the head how why that you think me a shallow woman incapable of believing what is best in you setting down everything that is too high for me as a deficiency don't parry what i say answer me there was an expression of painful beseeching in the tone with which felix said this esther let her work fall on her lap and looked at him but she was unable to speak i want you to tell me once that you know it would be easier to me to give myself up to loving and being loved as other men do when they can than to this breaking off in speech was something quite new in felix for the first time he had lost his self possession and turned his eyes away he was at variance with himself he had begun what he felt he ought not to finish esther like a woman as she was a woman waiting for love never able to ask for it had her joy in these signs of her power but they made her generous not chary as they might have done if she had had a pettier disposition she said with deep yet timid earnestness what you have chosen to do has only convinced me that your love would be the better worth having all the finest part of esther's nature trembled in those words to be right in great memorable moments is perhaps the thing we need most desire for ourselves felix as quick as lightning turned his look upon her again and leaning forward took her sweet hand and held it to his lips some moments before he let it fall again and raised his head we shall always be the better for thinking of each other he said leaning his elbow on the back of the sofa and supporting his head as he looked at her with calm sadness this thing can never come to me twice over it is my knighthood that was always a business of great cost he smiled at her but she sat biting her inner lip and pressing her hands together she desired to be worthy of what she reverenced in felix but the inevitable renunciation was too difficult she saw herself wandering through the future weak and forsaken the charming sauciness was all gone from her face but the memory of it made this childlike dependent sorrow all the more touching tell me what you would felix burst out leaning nearer to her but the next instant he started up went to the table took his cap in his hand and came in front of her good bye he said very gently not daring to put out his hand but esther put up hers instead of speaking he just pressed it and then went away she heard the doors close behind him and felt free to be miserable she cried bitterly if she might have married felix holt she could have been a good woman she felt no trust that she could ever be good without him felix reproached himself he would have done better not to speak in that way but the prompting to which he had chiefly listened had been the desire to prove to esther that he set a high value on her feelings he could not help seeing that he was very important to her and he was too simple and sincere a man to ape a sort of humility which would not have made him any the better if he had possessed it such pretences turn our lives into sorry dramas and felix wished esther to know that her love was dear to him as the beloved dead are dear he felt that they must not marry that they would ruin each other's lives but he had longed for her to know fully that his will to be always apart from her was renunciation not an easy preference in this he was thoroughly generous and yet now some subtle mysterious conjuncture of impressions and circumstances had made him speak he questioned the wisdom of what he had done express confessions give definiteness to memories that might more easily melt away without and felix felt for esther's pain as the strong soldier who can march on hungering without fear that he shall faint feels for the young brother the maiden cheeked conscript whose load is too heavy for him chapter xxxiii mischief thou art afoot julius csar felix could not go home again immediately after quitting esther he got out of the town skirted it a little while looking across the december stillness of the fields and then re entered it by the main road into the market place thinking that after all it would be better for him to look at the busy doings of men than to listen in solitude to the voices within him and he wished to know how things were going on it was now nearly half past one and felix perceived that the street was filling with more than the previous crowd by the time he got in front of the booths he was himself so surrounded by men who were being thrust hither and thither that retreat would have been impossible and he went where he was obliged to go although his height and strength were above the average even in a crowd where there were so many heavy armed workmen used to the pickaxe almost all shabby coated trebians must have been there but the entries and back streets of the town did not supply the mass of the crowd and besides the rural incomers both of the more decent and the rougher sort felix as he was pushed along thought he discerned here and there men of that keener aspect which is only common in manufacturing towns but at present there was no evidence of any distinctly mischievous design there was only evidence that the majority of the crowd were excited with drink and that their action could hardly be calculated on more than those of the oxen and pigs congregated amidst hootings and pushings the confused deafening shouts the incidental fighting the knocking over pulling and scuffling seemed to increase every moment such of the constables as were mixed with the crowd were quite helpless and if an official staff was seen above the heads it moved about fitfully showing as little sign of a guiding hand as the summit of a buoy on the waves doubtless many hurts and bruises had been received but no one could know the amount of injuries that were widely scattered it was clear that no more voting could be done and the poll had been adjourned the probabilities of serious mischief had grown strong enough to prevail over the rector's objection to getting military aid within reach and when felix re entered the town a galloping messenger had already been dispatched to duffield the rector wished to ride out again and read the riot act from a point where he could be better heard than from the window of the marquis but mr crow the high constable who had returned from closer observation insisted that the risk would be too great new special constables had been sworn in but mr crow said prophetically that if once mischief began the mob was past caring for constables but the rector's voice was ringing and penetrating and when he appeared on the narrow balcony and read the formula commanding all men to go to their homes or about their lawful business there was a strong transient effect every one within hearing listened and for a few moments after the final words god save the king the comparative silence continued then the people began to move the buzz rose again and grew and grew till it turned to shouts and roaring as before the movement was that of a flood hemmed in it carried nobody away whether the crowd would obey the order to disperse themselves within an hour was a doubt that approached nearer to a negative certainty presently mr crow who called himself a tactician took a well intentioned step which went far to fulfill his own prophecy he had arrived with the magistrates by a back way at the seven stars and here again the riot act was read from a window with much the same result as before the rector had returned by the same way to the marquis as the headquarters most suited for administration but mr crow remained at the other extremity of king street where some awe striking presence was certainly needed seeing that the time was passing and all effect from the voice of law had disappeared he showed himself at an upper window and addressed the crowd telling them that the soldiers had been sent for and that if they did not disperse they would have cavalry upon them instead of constables mr crow like some other high constables more celebrated in history enjoyed a bad reputation that is to say he enjoyed many things which caused his reputation to be bad and he was anything but popular in treby it is probable that a pleasant message would have lost something from his lips and what he actually said was so unpleasant that instead of persuading the crowd it appeared to enrage them some one snatching a raw potato from a sack in the green grocer's shop behind him threw it at the constable and hit him on the mouth straightway raw potatoes and turnips were flying by twenties at the windows of the seven stars and the panes were smashed felix who was half way up the street heard the voices turning to a savage roar and saw a rush toward the hardware shop which furnished more effective weapons and missiles than turnips and potatoes then a cry ran along that the tories had sent for the soldiers and if those among the mob who called themselves tories as willingly as anything else were disposed to take whatever called itself the tory side they only helped the main result of reckless disorder but there were proofs that the predominant will of the crowd was against debarry's men and in favor of transome several shops were invaded and they were all of them tory shops the tradesmen who could do so now locked their doors and barricaded their windows within there was a panic among the householders of this hitherto peaceful town and a general anxiety for the military to arrive the rector was in painful anxiety on this head he had sent out two messengers as secretly as he could toward hathercote to order the soldiers to ride straight to the town but he feared that these messengers had been somehow intercepted it was three o'clock more than an hour had elapsed since the reading of the riot act the rector of treby magna wrote an indignant message and sent it to the ram to mr lingon the rector of little treby saying that there was evidently a radical animus in the mob and that mr transome's party should hold themselves peculiarly responsible where was mr jermyn mr lingon replied that he was going himself out toward duffield to see after the soldiers as for jermyn he was not that attorney's sponsor he believed that jermyn was gone away somewhere on business to fetch voters a serious effort was now being made by all the civil force at command the december day would soon be passing into evening and all disorder would be aggravated by obscurity the horrors of fire were as likely to happen as any minor evil the constables as many of them as could do so armed themselves with carbines and sabres all the respectable inhabitants who had any courage prepared themselves to struggle for order and many felt with mr wace and mr tiliot that the nearest duty was to defend the breweries and the spirit and wine vaults where the property was of a sort at once most likely to be threatened and most dangerous in its effects the rector with fine determination got on horseback again as the best mode of leading the constables who could only act efficiently in a close body by his direction the column of armed men avoided the main street and made their way along a back road that they might occupy the two chief lanes leading into the wine vaults of the brewery and bear down on the crowd from these openings which it was especially desirable to guard meanwhile felix holt had been hotly occupied in king street after the first window smashing at the seven stars there was a sufficient reason for damaging that inn to the utmost the destructive spirit tends toward completeness and any object once maimed or otherwise injured is as readily doomed by unreasoning men as by unreasoning boys also the seven stars sheltered spratt and to some sproxton men in front of that inn it was exasperating that spratt should be safe and sound on a day when blows were going and justice might be rendered and again there was the general desirableness of being inside a public house felix had at last been willingly urged on to this spot hitherto swayed by the crowd he had been able to do nothing but defend himself and keep on his legs but he foresaw that the people would burst into the inn he heard cries of spratt fetch him out we'll pitch him out pummel him it was not unlikely that lives might be sacrificed and it was intolerable to felix to be witnessing the blind outrages of this mad crowd and yet be doing nothing to counteract them even some vain effort would satisfy him better than mere gazing within the walls of the inn he might save some one he went in with a miscellaneous set who dispersed themselves with different objects some to the tap room and to search for the cellar some up stairs to search in all the rooms for spratt or any one else perhaps as a temporary scapegoat for spratt guided by the screams of women felix at last got to a high up stairs passage where the landlady and some of her servants were running away in helpless terror from two or three half tipsy men who had been emptying a spirit decanter in the bar assuming the tone of a mob leader he cried out here boys here's better fun this way come with me and drew the men back with him along the passage they reached the lower staircase in time to see the unhappy spratt being dragged coatless and screaming down the steps no one at present was striking or kicking him it seemed as if he were being reserved for punishment on some wider area where the satisfaction might be more generally shared felix followed close determined if he could to rescue both assailers and assaulted from the worst consequences his mind was busy with possible devices down the stairs out along the stones through the gateway spratt was dragged as a mere heap of linen and cloth rags when he was got outside the gateway there was an immense hooting and roaring though many there had no grudge against him and only guessed that others had the grudge but this was the narrower part of the street it widened as it went onward and spratt was dragged on his enemies crying we'll make a ring we'll see how frightened he looks kick him and have done with him felix heard another say let's go to tiliot's vaults there's more gin there here were two hideous threats in dragging spratt onward the people were getting very near to the lane leading up to tiliot's felix kept as close as he could to the threatened victim he had thrown away his own stick and carried a bludgeon which had escaped from the hands of an invader at the seven stars his head was bare he looked to undiscerning eyes like a leading spirit of the mob in this condition he was observed by several persons looking anxiously from their upper windows and finally observed to push himself by violent efforts close behind the dragged man meanwhile the foremost among the constables who coming by the back way had now reached the opening of tiliot's lane discerned that the crowd had a victim amongst them one spirited fellow named tucker who was a regular constable feeling that no time was to be lost in meditation called on his neighbor to follow him and with a sabre that happened to be his weapon got away for himself where he was not expected by dint of quick resolution at this moment spratt had been let go had been dropped in fact almost lifeless with terror on the street stones and the men round him had retreated for a little space as if to amuse themselves with looking at him felix had taken his opportunity and seeing the first step toward a plan he was bent on he sprang forward close to the cowering spratt as he did this tucker had cut his way to the spot and imagining felix to be the destined executioner of spratt for any discrimination of tucker's lay in his muscles rather than his eyes he rushed up to felix meaning to collar him and throw him down but felix had rapid senses and quick thoughts he discerned the situation he chose between two evils quick as lightning he frustrated the constable fell upon him and tried to master his weapon in the struggle which was watched without interference the constable fell undermost and felix got his weapon he started up with the bare sabre in his hand the crowd round him cried hurray with a sense that he was on their side against the constable tucker did not rise immediately but felix did not imagine that he was much hurt don't touch him said felix let him go here bring spratt and follow me felix was perfectly conscious that he was in the midst of a tangled business but he had chiefly before his imagination the horrors that might come if the mass of wild chaotic desires and impulses around him were not diverted from any further attacks on places where they would get in the midst of intoxicating and inflammable materials it was not a moment in which a spirit like his could calculate the effect of misunderstanding as to himself nature never makes men who are at once energetically sympathetic and minutely calculating he believed he had the power and was resolved to try to carry the dangerous mass out of mischief till the military came to awe them which he supposed from mr crow's announcement a long time ago must be a near event he was followed the more willingly because tiliot's lane was seen by the hindmost to be now defended by constables some of whom had firearms and where there is no strong counter movement any proposition to do something that is unspecified stimulates stupid curiosity to many of the sproxton men who were within sight of him felix was known personally and vaguely believed to be a man who meant many queer things not at all of an everyday kind pressing along like a leader with the sabre in his hand and inviting them to bring on spratt there seemed a better reason for following him than for doing anything else a man with a definite will and an energetic personality acts as a sort of flag to draw and bind together the foolish units of a mob it was on this sort of influence over men whose mental state was a mere medley of appetites and confused impressions that felix had dared to count he hurried them along with words of invitation telling them to hold up spratt and not drag him and those behind followed him with a growing belief that he had some design worth knowing while those in front were urged along partly by the same notion partly by the sense that there was a motive in those behind them not knowing what the motive was it was that mixture of pushing forward and being pushed forward which is a brief history of most human things what felix really intended to do was to get the crowd by the nearest way out of the town and induce them to skirt it on the north side with him keeping up in them the idea that he was leading them to execute some stratagem by which they would surprise something worth attacking and circumvent the constables who were defending the lanes in the meantime he trusted that the soldiers would have arrived and with this sort of mob which was animated by no real political passion or fury against social distinctions it was in the highest degree unlikely that there would be any resistance to a military force the presence of fifty soldiers would probably be enough to scatter the rioting hundreds how numerous the mob was no one ever knew many inhabitants afterward were ready to swear that there must have been at least two thousand rioters felix knew he was incurring great risks but his blood was up we hardly allow enough in common life for the results of that enkindled passionate enthusiasm which under other conditions makes world famous deeds he was making for a point where the street branched off on one side toward a speedy opening between hedgerows on the other toward the shabby wideness of pollard's end at this forking of the street there was a large space in the centre of which there was a small stone platform mounting by three steps with an old green finger post upon it felix went straight to this platform and stepped upon it crying halt in a loud voice to the men behind and before him and calling to those who held spratt to bring him there all came to a stand with faces toward the finger post and perhaps for the first time the extremities of the crowd got a definite idea that a man with a sabre in his hand was taking the command now said felix when spratt had been brought to the stone platform faint and trembling has anybody got cord if not handkerchiefs knotted fast give them to me he drew out his own handkerchief and two or three others were mustered and handed to him he ordered them to be knotted together while curious eyes were fixed on him was he going to have spratt hanged felix kept fast hold of his weapon and ordered others to act now put it round his waist wind his arms in draw them a little backward so and tie it fast on the other side of the post when that was done felix said imperatively leave him there we shall come back to him let us make haste march along lads up park street and down hobb's lane it was the best chance he could think of for saving spratt's life and he succeeded the pleasure of seeing the helpless man tied up sufficed for the moment if there were any who had ferocity enough to count much on coming back to him nobody's imagination represented the certainty that some one out of the houses at hand would soon come and untie him when he was left alone and the rioters pushed up park street a noisy stream with felix still in the midst of them though he was laboring hard to get his way to the front he wished to determine the course of the crowd along a by road called hobb's lane which would have taken them to the other the duffield end of the town he urged several of the men round him one of whom was no less a person than the big dredge our old sproxton acquaintance to get forward and be sure that all the fellows would go down the lane else they would spoil sport hitherto felix had been successful and he had gone along with an unbroken impulse but soon something occurred which brought with a terrible shock the sense that his plan might turn out to be as mad as all bold projects are seen to be when they have failed mingled with the more headlong and half drunken crowd there were some sharp visaged men who loved the irrationality of riots for something else than its own sake and who at present were not so much the richer as they desired to be for the pains they had taken in coming to the treby election induced by certain prognostics gathered at duffield on the nomination day that there might be the conditions favorable to that confusion which was always a harvest time it was known to some of these sharp men that park street led out toward the grand house of treby manor which was as good nay better for their purpose than the bank while felix was entertaining his ardent purpose these other sons of adam were entertaining another ardent purpose of their peculiar sort and the moment had come when they were to have their triumph from the front ranks backward toward felix there ran a new summons a new invitation let us go to treby manor from that moment felix was powerless a new definite suggestion overrode his vaguer influence there was a determined rush past hobb's lane and not down it felix was carried along too he did not know whether to wish the contrary once on the road out of town with openings into fields and with the wide park at hand it would have been easy to liberate himself from the crowd at first it seemed to him the better part to do this and to get back to the town as fast as he could in the hope of finding the military and getting a detachment to come and save the manor but he reflected that the course of the mob had been sufficiently seen and that there were plenty of people in park street to carry the information faster than he could it seemed more necessary that he should secure the presence of some help for the family at the manor by going there himself the debarrys were not of the class of people he was wont to be anxious about but felix holt's conscience was alive to the accusation that any danger they might be in now was brought on by a deed of his in these moments of bitter vexation and disappointment it did occur to him that very unpleasant consequences might be hanging over him of a kind quite different from inward dissatisfaction but it was useless now to think of averting such consequences as he was pressed along with the multitude into treby park his very movement seemed to him only an image of the day's fatalities in which the multitudinous small wickednesses of small selfish ends really undirected toward any larger result had issued in widely shared mischief that might yet be hideous illustration felix wounded in the riot the light was declining already the candles shone through many windows of the manor already the foremost part of the crowd had burst into the offices and adroit men were busy in the right places to find plate after setting others to force the butler into unlocking the cellars and felix had only just been able to force his way on to the front terrace with the hope of getting to the rooms where he would find the ladies of the household and comfort them with the assurance that rescue must soon come when the sound of horses' feet convinced him that the rescue was nearer than he had expected just as he heard the horses he had approached the large window of a room where a brilliant light suspended from the ceiling showed him a group of women clinging together in terror others of the crowd were pushing their way up the terrace steps and gravel slopes at various points hearing the horses he kept his post in front of the window and motioning with his sabre cried out to the oncomers keep back i hear the soldiers coming some scrambled back some paused automatically the louder and louder sound of the hoofs changed its pace and distribution halt fire bang bang bang came deafening the ears of the men on the terrace before they had time or nerve to move there was a rushing sound closer to them again fire a bullet whizzed and passed through felix holt's shoulder the shoulder of the arm that held the naked weapon which shone in the light from the window felix fell the rioters ran confusedly like terrified sheep some of the soldiers turning drove them along with the flat of their swords the greater difficulty was to clear the invaded offices the rector who with another magistrate and several other gentlemen on horseback had accompanied the soldiers now jumped on to the terrace and hurried to the ladies of the family presently there was a group round felix who had fainted and reviving had fainted again he had had little food during the day and had been overwrought two of the group were civilians but only one of them knew felix the other being a magistrate not resident in treby the one who knew felix was mr john johnson whose zeal for the public peace had brought him from duffield when he heard that the soldiers were summoned i know this man very well said mr johnson he is a dangerous character quite revolutionary it was a weary night and the next day felix whose wound was declared trivial was lodged in loamford jail there were three charges against him that he had assaulted a constable that he had committed manslaughter tucker was dead from spinal concussion and that he had led a riotous onslaught on a dwelling house four other men were committed one of them for possessing himself of a gold cup with the debarry arms on it the three others one of whom was the collier dredge for riot and assault that morning treby town was no longer in terror but it was in much sadness other men more innocent than the hated spratt were groaning under severe bodily injuries and poor tucker's corpse was not the only one that had been lifted from the pavement it is true that none grieved much for the other dead man unless it be grief to say poor old fellow he had been trampled upon doubtless where he fell drunkenly near the entrance of the seven stars this second corpse was old tommy trounsem the bill sticker otherwise thomas transome the last of a very old family line chapter xxxiv the fields are hoary with december's frost i too am hoary with the chills of age but through the fields and through the untrodden woods is rest and stillness only in my heart the pall of winter shrouds a throbbing life a week after that treby riot harold transome was at transome court he had returned from a hasty visit to town to keep his christmas at this delightful country home not in the best christmas spirits he had lost the election but if that had been his only annoyance he had good humor and good sense enough to have borne it as well as most men and to have paid the eight or nine thousand which had been the price of ascertaining that he was not to sit in the next parliament without useless grumbling but the disappointments of life can never any more than its pleasures be estimated singly and the healthiest and most agreeable of men is exposed to that coincidence of various vexations each heightening the effect of the other which may produce in him something corresponding to the spontaneous and externally unaccountable moodiness of the morbid and disagreeable harold might not have grieved much at a small riot in treby even if it had caused some expenses to fall on the county but the turn which the riot had actually taken was a bitter morsel for rumination on more grounds than one however the disturbances had arisen and been aggravated and probably no one knew the whole truth on these points the conspicuous gravest incidents had all tended to throw the blame on the radical party that is to say on transome and on transome's agents and so far the candidateship and its results had done harold dishonor in the county precisely the opposite effect to that which was a dear object of his ambition more than this harold's conscience was active enough to be very unpleasantly affected by what had befallen felix holt his memory always good was particularly vivid in its retention of felix holt's complaint to him about the treating of the sproxton men and of the subsequent irritating scene in jermyn's office when the personage with the inauspicious name of johnson had expounded to him the impossibility of revising an electioneering scheme once begun and of turning your vehicle back when it had already begun to roll downhill remembering felix holt's words of indignant warning about hiring men with drink in them to make a noise harold could not resist the urgent impression that the offences for which felix was committed were fatalities not brought about by any willing co operation of his with the noisy rioters but arising probably from some rather ill judged efforts to counteract their violence and this urgent impression which insisted on growing into a conviction became in one of its phases an uneasy sense that he held evidence which would at once tend to exonerate felix and to place himself and his agents in anything but a desirable light it was likely that some one else could give equivalent evidence in favor of felix the little talkative dissenting preacher for example but anyhow the affair with the sproxton men would be ripped open and made the worst of by the opposite parties the man who has failed in the use of some indirectness is helped very little by the fact that his rivals are men to whom that indirectness is a something human very far from being alien there remains this grand distinction that he has failed and that the jet of light is thrown entirely on his misdoings in this matter harold felt himself a victim could he hinder the tricks of his agents in this particular case he had tried to hinder them and had tried in vain he had not loved the two agents in question to begin with and now at this later stage of events he was more innocent than ever of bearing them anything but the most sincere ill will he was more utterly exasperated with them than he would probably have been if his one great passion had been for public virtue jermyn with his john johnson had added this ugly dirty business of the treby election to all the long accumulating list of offences which harold was resolved to visit on him to the utmost he had seen some handbills carrying the insinuation that there was a discreditable indebtedness to jermyn on the part of the transomes if any such notions existed apart from electioneering slander there was all the more reason for letting the world see jermyn severely punished for abusing his power over the family affairs and tampering with the family property and the world certainly should see this with as little delay as possible the cool confident assuming fellow should be bled to the last drop in compensation and all connection with him be finally got rid of now that the election was done with harold meant to devote himself to private affairs till everything lay in complete order under his supervision this morning he was seated as usual in his private room which had now been handsomely fitted up for him it was but the third morning after the first christmas he had spent in his english home for fifteen years and the home looked like an eminently desirable one the white frost was now lying on the broad lawn on the many formed leaves of the evergreens and on the giant trees at a distance logs of dry oak blazed on the hearth the carpet was like warm moss under his feet he had breakfasted just according to his taste and he had the interesting occupations of a large proprietor to fill the morning all through the house now steps were noiseless on carpets or on fine matting there was warmth in hall and corridors there were servants enough to do everything and to do it at the right time skilful dominic was always at hand to meet his master's demands and his bland presence diffused itself like a smile over the household infecting the gloomy english mind with the belief that life was easy and making his real predominance seem as soft and light as a down quilt old mr transome had gathered new courage and strength since little harry and dominic had come and since harold had insisted on his taking drives mrs transome herself was seen on a fresh background with a gown of rich new stuff and if in spite of this she did not seem happy harold either did not observe it or kindly ignored it as the necessary frailty of elderly women whose lives have had too much of dullness and privation our minds get tricks and attitudes as our bodies do thought harold and age stiffens them into unalterableness poor mother i confess i should not like to be an elderly woman myself one requires a good deal of the purring cat for that or else of the loving grandame i wish she would take more to little harry i suppose she has her suspicions about the lad's mother and is as rigid in those matters as in her toryism however i do what i can it would be difficult to say what there is wanting to her in the way of indulgence and luxury to make up for the old niggardly life and certainly transome court was now such a home as many women would covet yet even harold's own satisfaction in the midst of its elegant comfort needed at present to be sustained by the expectation of gratified resentment he was obviously less bright and enjoying than usual and his mother who watched him closely without daring to ask questions had gathered hints and drawn inferences enough to make her feel sure that there was some storm gathering between him and jermyn she did not dare to ask questions and yet she had not resisted the temptation to say something bitter about harold's failure to get returned as a radical helping with feminine self defeat to exclude herself more completely from any consultation by him in this way poor women whose power lies solely in their influence make themselves like music out of tune and only move men to run away this morning harold had ordered his letters to be brought to him at the breakfast table which was not his usual practice his mother could see that there were london business letters about which he was eager and she had found out that the letter brought by a clerk the day before was to make an appointment with harold for jermyn to come to transome court at eleven this morning she observed harold swallow his coffee and push away his plate with an early abstraction from the business of breakfast which was not at all after his usual manner she herself ate nothing her sips of tea seemed to excite her her cheeks flushed and her hands were cold she was still young and ardent in her terrors the passions of the past were living in her dread when harold left the table she went into the long drawing room where she might relieve her restlessness by walking up and down and catch the sound of jermyn's entrance into harold's room which was close by here she moved to and fro amongst the rose colored satin of chairs and curtains the great story of this world reduced for her to the little tale of her own existence dull obscurity everywhere except where the keen light fell on the narrow track of her own lot wide only for a woman's anguish at last she heard the expected ring and footstep and the opening and closing door unable to walk about any longer she sank into a large cushioned chair helpless and prayerless she was not thinking of god's anger or mercy but of her son's she was thinking of what might be brought not by death but by life chapter xxxv m check to your queen n nay your own king is bare and moving so you give yourself checkmate when jermyn entered the room harold who was seated at his library table examining papers with his back toward the light and his face toward the door moved his head coldly jermyn said an ungracious good morning as little as possible like a salutation to one who might regard himself as a patron on the attorney's handsome face there was a black cloud of defiant determination slightly startling to harold who had expected to feel that the overpowering weight of temper in the interview was on his own side nobody was ever prepared beforehand for this expression of jermyn's face which seemed as strongly contrasted with the cold impenetrableness which he preserved under the ordinary annoyance of business as with the bland radiance of his lighter moments harold himself did not look amiable just then but his anger was of the sort that seeks a vent without waiting to give a fatal blow it was that of a nature more subtly mixed than jermyn's less animally forcible less unwavering in selfishness and with more of high bred pride he looked at jermyn with increased disgust and secret wonder sit down he said curtly jermyn seated himself in silence opened his greatcoat and took some papers from a side pocket i have written to makepeace said harold to tell him to take the entire management of the election expenses so you will transmit your accounts to him very well i am come this morning on other business if it's about the riot and the prisoners i have only to say that i shall enter into no plans if i am called on i shall say what i know about that young fellow felix holt people may prove what they can about johnson's damnable tricks or yours either i am not come to speak about the riot i agree with you in thinking that quite a subordinate subject when jermyn had the black cloud over his face he never hesitated or drawled and made no latin quotations be so good then as to open your business at once said harold in a tone of imperious indifference that is precisely what i wish to do i have here information from a london correspondent that you are about to file a bill against me in chancery jermyn as he spoke laid his hand on the papers before him and looked straight at harold in that case the question for you is how far your conduct as the family solicitor will bear investigation but it is a question which you will consider quite apart from me doubtless but prior to that there is a question which we must consider together the tone in which jermyn said this gave an unpleasant shock to harold's sense of mastery was it possible that he should have the weapon wrenched out of his hand i shall know what to think of that he replied as haughtily as ever when you have stated what the question is simply whether you will choose to retain the family estates or lay yourself open to be forthwith legally deprived of them i presume you refer to some underhand scheme of your own on a par with the annuities you have drained us by in the name of johnson said harold feeling a new movement of anger if so you had better state your scheme to my lawyers dymock and halliwell no i think you will approve of my stating in your own ear first of all that it depends on my will whether you remain an important landed proprietor in north loamshire or whether you retire from the country with the remainder of the fortune you have acquired in trade jermyn paused as if to leave time for this morsel to be tasted what do you mean said harold sharply not any scheme of mine but a state of the facts resulting from the settlement of the estate made in state of the facts which renders your father's title and your own title to the family estates utterly worthless as soon as the claimant is made aware of his right and you intend to inform him that depends i am the only person who has the requisite knowledge it rests with you to decide whether i shall use that knowledge against you or whether i shall use it in your favor by putting an end to the evidence that would serve to oust you in spite of your 'robust title of occupancy' jermyn paused again he had been speaking slowly but without the least hesitation and with a bitter definiteness of enunciation there was a moment or two before harold answered and then he said abruptly i don't believe you i thought you were more shrewd said jermyn with a touch of scorn i thought you understood that i had had too much experience to waste my time in telling fables to persuade a man who has put himself into the attitude of my deadly enemy well then say at once what your proofs are said harold shaking in spite of himself and getting nervous i have no inclination to be lengthy it is not more than a few weeks since i ascertained that there is in existence an heir of the bycliffes the old adversaries of your family more curiously it is only a few days ago in fact only since the day of the riot that the bycliffe claim has become valid and that the right of remainder accrues to the heir in question and how pray said harold rising from his chair and making a turn in the room with his hands thrust in his pockets jermyn rose too and stood near the hearth facing harold as he moved to and fro by the death of an old fellow who got drunk and was trampled to death in the riot he was the last of that thomas transome's line by the purchase of whose interest your family got its title to the estate your title died with him it was supposed that the line had become extinct before and on that supposition the old bycliffes founded their claim but i hunted up this man just about the time the last suit was closed his death would have been of no consequence to you if there had not been a bycliffe in existence but i happen to know that there is and that the fact can be legally proved for a minute or two harold did not speak but continued to pace the room while jermyn kept his position holding his hands behind him at last harold said from the other end of the room speaking in a scornful tone that sounds alarming but it is not to be proved simply by your statement clearly i have here a document with a copy which will back my statement it is the opinion given on the case more than twenty years ago and it bears the signature of the attorney general and the first conveyancer of the day jermyn took up the papers he had laid on the table opening them slowly and coolly as he went on speaking and as harold advanced toward him you may suppose that we spared no pains to ascertain the state of the title in the last suit against maurice christian bycliffe which threatened to be a hard run this document is the result of a consultation it gives an opinion which must be taken as a final authority you may cast your eyes over that if you please i will wait your time or you may read the summing up here jermyn ended holding out one of the papers to harold and pointing to a final passage harold took the paper with a slight gesture of impatience he did not choose to obey jermyn's indication and confine himself to the summing up he ran through the document but in truth he was too much excited really to follow the details and was rather acting than reading till at once he threw himself into his chair and consented to bend his attention on the passage to which jermyn had pointed the attorney watched him as he read and twice re read to sum up we are of opinion that the title of the present possessors of the transome estate can be strictly proved to rest solely upon a base fee created under the original settlement of and to be good so long only as issue exists of the tenant in tail by whom that base fee was created we feel satisfied by the evidence that such issue exists in the person of thomas transome otherwise trounsem of littleshaw but upon his decease without issue we are of opinion that the right in remainder of the bycliffe family will arise which right would not be barred by any statute of limitation when harold's eyes were on the signatures to this document for the third time jermyn said as it turned out the case being closed by the death of the claimant we had no occasion for producing thomas transome who was the old fellow i told you of the enquiries about him set him agog and after they were dropped he came into this neighborhood thinking there was something fine in store for him here if you like to take it is a memorandum about him i repeat that he died in the riot the proof is ready and i repeat that to my knowledge and mine only there is a bycliffe in existence and that i know how the proof can be made out harold rose from his chair again and again paced the room he was not prepared with any defiance and where is he this bycliffe he said at last stopping in his walk and facing round toward jermyn i decline to say more till you promise to suspend proceedings against me harold turned again and looked out of the window without speaking for a moment or two it was impossible that there should not be a conflict within him and at present it was a very confused one at last he said this person is in ignorance of his claim yes has been brought up in an inferior station yes said jermyn keen enough to guess part of what was going on in harold's mind there is no harm in leaving him in ignorance the question is a purely legal one and as i said before the complete knowledge of the case as one of evidence lies exclusively with me i can nullify the evidence or i can make it tell with certainty against you the choice lies with you i must have time to think of this said harold conscious of a terrible pressure i can give you no time unless you promise me to suspend proceedings and then when i ask you you will lay the details before me not without a thorough understanding beforehand if i engage not to use my knowledge against you you must engage in writing that on being satisfied by the details you will cancel all hostile proceedings against me and will not institute fresh ones on the strength of any occurrences now past well i must have time said harold more than ever inclined to thrash the attorney but feeling bound hand and foot with knots that he was not sure he could ever unfasten that is to say said jermyn with his black browed persistence you will write to suspend proceedings again harold paused he was more than ever exasperated but he was threatened mortified and confounded by the necessity for an immediate decision between alternatives almost equally hateful to him it was with difficulty that he could prevail on himself to speak any conclusive words he walked as far as he could from jermyn to the other end of the room then walked back to his chair and threw himself into it at last he said without looking at jermyn i agree i must have time very well it is a bargain no further than this said harold hastily flashing a look at jermyn no further than this that i require time and therefore i give it to you of course you require time to consider whether the pleasure of trying to ruin me me to whom you are really indebted is worth the loss of the transome estates i shall wish you good morning harold did not speak to him or look at him again and jermyn walked out of the room as he appeared outside the door and closed it behind him mrs transome showed her white face at another door which opened on a level with harold's in such a way that it was just possible for jermyn not to see her he availed himself of that possibility and walked straight across the hall where there was no servant in attendance to let him out as if he believed that no one was looking at him who could expect recognition he did not want to speak to mrs transome at present he had nothing to ask from her and one disagreeable interview had been enough for him this morning she was convinced that he had avoided her and she was too proud to arrest him she was as insignificant now in his eyes as in her son's men have no memories in their hearts she said to herself bitterly and then turning into her sitting room she heard the voices of mr transome and little harry at play together she would have given a great deal at this moment if her feeble husband had not always lived in dread of her temper and her tyranny so that he might have been fond of her now she felt herself loveless if she was important to any one it was only to her old waiting woman denner chapter xxxvi are these things then necessities then let us meet them like necessities

conscience to poor hobson's aid few men would have felt otherwise than harold transome felt if having a reversion tantamount to possession of a fine estate carrying an association with an old name and considerable social importance they were suddenly informed that there was a person who had a legal right to deprive them of these advantages that person's right having never been contemplated by any one as more than a chance and being quite unknown to himself in ordinary cases a shorter possession than harold's family had enjoyed was allowed by the law to constitute an indefeasible right and if in rare and peculiar instances the law left the possessor of a long inheritance exposed to deprivation as the consequence of old obscure transactions the moral reasons for giving legal validity to the title of long occupancy were not the less strong nobody would have said that harold was bound to hunt out this alleged remainder man and urge his rights upon him on the contrary all the world would have laughed at such conduct and he would have been thought an interesting patient for a mad doctor the unconscious remainder man was probably much better off left in his original station harold would not have been called upon to consider his existence if it had not been presented to him in the shape of a threat from one who had power to execute the threat in fact what he would have done had the circumstances been different was much clearer than what he should choose to do or feel himself compelled to do in the actual crisis he would not have been disgraced if on a valid claim being urged he had got his lawyers to fight it out for him on the chance of eluding the claim by some adroit technical management nobody off the stage could be sentimental about these things or pretend to shed tears of joy because an estate was handed over from a gentleman to a mendicant sailor with a wooden leg and this chance remainder man was perhaps some such specimen of inheritance as the drunken fellow killed in the riot all the world would think the actual transomes in the right to contest any adverse claim to the utmost but then it was not certain that they would win in the contest and not winning they would incur other losses besides that of the estate there had been a little too much of such loss already but why if it were not wrong to contest the claim should he feel the most uncomfortable scruples about robbing the claim of its sting by getting rid of its evidence it was a mortal disappointment it was a sacrifice of indemnification to abstain from punishing jermyn but even if he brought his mind to contemplate that as the wiser course he still shrank from what looked like complicity with jermyn he still shrank from the secret nullification of a just legal claim if he had only known the details if he had known who this alleged heir was he might have seen his way to some course that would not have grated on his sense of honor and dignity but jermyn had been too acute to let harold know this he had even carefully kept to the masculine pronoun and he believed that there was no one besides himself who would or could make harold any wiser he went home persuaded that between this interview and the next which they would have together harold would be left to an inward debate founded entirely on the information he himself had given and he had not much doubt that the result would be what he desired harold was no fool there were many good things he liked better in life than an irrational vindictiveness and it did happen that after writing to london in fulfillment of his pledge harold spent many hours over that inward debate which was not very different from what jermyn imagined he took it everywhere with him on foot and on horseback and it was his companion through a great deal of the night his nature was not of a kind given to internal conflict and he had never before been long undecided and puzzled this unaccustomed state of mind was so painfully irksome to him he rebelled so impatiently against the oppression of circumstances in which his quick temperament and habitual decision could not help him that it added tenfold to his hatred of jermyn who was the cause of it and thus as the temptation to avoid all risk of losing the estate grew and grew till scruples looked minute by the side of it the difficulty of bringing himself to make a compact with jermyn seemed more and more insurmountable but we have seen that the attorney was much too confident in his calculations and while harold was being gulled by his subjection to jermyn's knowledge independent information was on its way to him the messenger was christian who after as complete a survey of probabilities as he was capable of had come to the conclusion that the most profitable investment he could make of his peculiar experience and testimony in relation to bycliffe and bycliffe's daughter was to place them at the disposal of harold transome he was afraid of jermyn he utterly distrusted johnson but he thought he was secure in relying on harold transome's care for his own interest and he preferred above all issues the prospect of forthwith leaving the country with a sum that at least for a good while would put him at his ease when only three mornings after the interview with jermyn dominic opened the door of harold's sitting room and said that meester chreestian mr philip debarry's courier and an acquaintance of his own at naples requested to be admitted on business of importance harold's immediate thought was that the business referred to the so called political affairs which were just now his chief association with the name of debarry though it seemed an oddness requiring explanation that a servant should be personally an intermediary he assented expecting something rather disagreeable than otherwise christian wore this morning those perfect manners of a subordinate who is not servile which he always adopted toward his unquestionable superiors mr debarry who preferred having some one about him with as little resemblance as possible to a regular servant had a singular liking for the adroit quiet mannered christian and would have been amazed to see the insolent assumption he was capable of in the presence of people like mr lyon who were of no account in society christian had that sort of cleverness which is said to know the world that is to say he knew the price current of most things aware that he was looked at as a messenger while he remained standing near the door with his hat in his hand he said with respectful ease you will probably be surprised sir at my coming to speak to you on my own account and in fact i could not have thought of doing so if my business did not happen to be something of more importance to you than to any one else you don't come from mr debarry then said harold with some surprise no sir my business is a secret and if you please must remain so is it a pledge you are demanding from me said harold rather suspiciously having no ground for confidence in a man of christian's position yes sir i am obliged to ask no less than that you will pledge yourself not to take mr jermyn into confidence concerning what passes between us with all my heart said harold something like a gleam passing over his face his circulation had become more rapid but what have you had to do with jermyn he has not mentioned me to you then has he sir no certainly not never christian thought aha mr jermyn you are keeping the secret well are you he said aloud then mr jermyn has never mentioned to you sir what i believe he is aware of that there is danger of a new suit being raised against you on the part of a bycliffe to get the estate ah said harold starting up and placing himself with his back against the mantelpiece he was electrified by surprise at the quarter from which this information was coming any fresh alarm was counteracted by the flashing thought that he might be enabled to act independently of jermyn and in the rush of feelings he could utter no more than an interjection christian concluded that harold had no previous hint it is this fact that i came to tell you of from some other motive than kindness to me i presume said harold with a slight approach to a smile certainly said christian as quietly as if he had been stating yesterday's weather i should not have the folly to use any affectation with you mr transome i lost considerable property early in life and am now in the receipt of a salary simply in the affair i have just mentioned to you i can give evidence which will turn the scale against you i have no wish to do so if you will make it worth my while to leave the country harold listened as if he had been a legendary hero selected for peculiar solicitation by the evil one here was temptation in a more alluring form than before because it was sweetened by the prospect of eluding jermyn but the desire to gain time served all the purposes of caution and resistance and his indifference to the speaker in this case helped him to preserve perfect self command you are aware he said coolly that silence is not a commodity worth purchasing unless it is loaded there are many persons i dare say who would like me to pay their travelling expenses for them but they might hardly be able to show me that it was worth my while you wish me to state what i know well that is a necessary preliminary to any further conversation i think you will see mr transome that as a matter of justice the knowledge i can give is worth something quite apart from my future appearance or non appearance as a witness i must take care of my own interest and if anything should hinder you from choosing to satisfy me for taking an essential witness out of the way i must at least be paid for bringing you the information can you tell me who and where this bycliffe is i can and give me a notion of the whole affair yes i have talked to a lawyer not jermyn who is at the bottom of the law in the affair you must not count on any wish of mine to suppress evidence or remove a witness but name your price for the information in that case i must be paid the higher for my information say two thousand pounds two thousand devils burst out harold throwing himself into his chair again and turning his shoulder toward christian new thoughts crowded upon him this fellow may want to decamp for some reason or other he said to himself more people besides jermyn know about his evidence it seems the whole thing may look black for me if it comes out i shall be believed to have bribed him to run away whether or not thus the outside conscience came in aid of the inner i will not give you one sixpence for your information he said resolutely until time has made it clear that you do not intend to decamp but will be forthcoming when you are called for on those terms i have no objection to give you a note specifying that after the fulfilment of that condition that is after the occurrence of a suit or the understanding that no suit is to occur i will pay you a certain sum in consideration of the information you now give me christian felt himself caught in a vise in the first instance he had counted confidently on harold's ready seizure of his offer to disappear and after some words had seemed to cast a doubt on this presupposition he had inwardly determined to go away whether harold wished it or not if he could get a sufficient sum he did not reply immediately and harold waited in silence inwardly anxious to know what christian could tell but with a vision at present so far cleared that he was determined not to risk incurring the imputation of having anything to do with scoundrelism we are very much indebted to such a linking of events as makes a doubtful action look wrong christian was reflecting that if he stayed and faced some possible inconveniences of being known publicly as henry scaddon for the sake of what he might get from esther it would at least be wise to be certain of some money from harold transome since he turned out to be of so peculiar a disposition as to insist on a punctilious honesty to his own disadvantage did he think of making a bargain with the other side if so he might be content to wait for the knowledge till it came in some other way christian was beginning to be afraid lest he should get nothing by this clever move of coming to transome court at last he said i think sir two thousand would not be an unreasonable sum on those conditions i will not give two thousand allow me to say sir you must consider that there is no one whose interest it is to tell you as much as i shall even if they could since mr jermyn who knows it has not thought fit to tell you there may be use you don't think of in getting the information at once well i think a gentleman should act liberally under such circumstances so i will i could not take less than a thousand pounds it really would not be worth my while if mr jermyn knew i gave you the information he would endeavor to injure me i will give you a thousand said harold immediately for christian had unconsciously touched a sure spring at least i'll give you a note to the effect i spoke of he wrote as he had promised and gave the paper to christian now don't be circuitous said harold you seem to have a business like gift of speech who and where is this bycliffe you will be surprised to hear sir that she is supposed to be the daughter of the old preacher lyon in malthouse yard good god how can that be said harold at once the first occasion on which he had seen esther rose in his memory the little dark parlor the graceful girl in blue with the surprisingly distinguished manners and appearance in this way old lyon by some strange means or other married bycliffe's widow when this girl was a baby and the preacher didn't want the girl to know that he was not her real father he told me that himself but she is the image of bycliffe whom i knew well an uncommonly fine woman steps like a queen i have seen her said harold more than ever glad to have purchased this knowledge but now go on christian proceeded to tell all he knew including his conversation with jermyn except so far as it had an unpleasant relation to himself then said harold as the details seemed to have come to a close you believe that miss lyon and her supposed father are at present unaware of the claims that might be urged for her on the strength of her birth i believe so but i need not tell you that where the lawyers are on the scent you can never be sure of anything long together i must remind you sir that you have promised to protect me from mr jermyn by keeping my confidence never fear depend upon it i shall betray nothing to mr jermyn christian was dismissed with a good morning and while he cultivated some friendly reminiscences with dominic harold sat chewing the cud of his new knowledge and finding it not altogether so bitter as he had expected from the first after his interview with jermyn the recoil of harold's mind from the idea of strangling a legal right threw him on the alternative of attempting a compromise some middle course might be possible which would be a less evil than a costly lawsuit or than the total renunciation of the estates and now he had learned that the new claimant was a woman a young woman brought up under circumstances that would make the fourth of the transome property seem to her an immense fortune both the sex and the social condition were of the sort that lies open to many softening influences and having seen esther it was inevitable that amongst the various issues agreeable and disagreeable depicted by harold's imagination there should present itself a possibility that would unite the two claims his own which he felt to be the rational and esther's which apparently was the legal claim harold as he had constantly said to his mother was not a marrying man he did not contemplate bringing a wife to transome court for many years to come if at all having little harry as an heir he preferred freedom western women were not to his taste they showed a transition from the feebly animal to the thinking being which was simply troublesome harold preferred a slow witted large eyed woman silent and affectionate with a load of black hair weighing much more heavily than her brains he had seen no such woman in england except one which he had brought with him from the east therefore harold did not care to be married until or unless some surprising chance presented itself and now that such a chance had occurred to suggest marriage to him he would not admit to himself that he contemplated marrying esther as a plan he was only obliged to see that such an issue was not inconceivable he was not going to take any step expressly directed toward that end what he had made up his mind to as the course most satisfactory to his nature under present urgencies was to behave to esther with a frank gentle manliness which must win her good will and incline her to save his family interest as much as possible he was helped to this determination by the pleasure of frustrating jermyn's contrivance to shield himself from punishment and his most distinct and cheering prospect was that within a very short space of time he should not only have effected a satisfactory compromise with esther but should have made jermyn aware by a very disagreeable form of announcement that harold transome was no longer afraid of him jermyn should bite the dust at the end of these meditations he felt satisfied with himself and light hearted he had rejected two dishonest propositions and he was going to do something that seemed eminently graceful but he needed his mother's assistance and it was necessary that he should both confide in her and persuade her within two hours after christian left him harold begged his mother to come into his private room and there he told her the strange and startling story omitting however any particulars which would involve the identification of christian as his informant harold felt that his engagement demanded his reticence and he told his mother that he was bound to conceal the source of that knowledge which he had got independently of jermyn mrs transome said little in the course of the story she made no exclamations but she listened with close attention and asked a few questions so much to the point as to surprise harold when he showed her the copy of the legal opinion which jermyn had left with him she said she knew it very well she had a copy herself the particulars of that last lawsuit were too well engraven on her mind it happened at a time when there was no one to supersede her and she was the virtual head of the family affairs she was prepared to understand how the estate might be in danger but nothing had prepared her for the strange details for the way in which the new claimant had been reared and brought within the range of converging motives that had led to this revelation least of all for the part jermyn had come to play in the revelation mrs transome saw these things through the medium of certain dominant emotions that made them seem like a long ripening retribution harold perceived that she was painfully agitated that she trembled and that her white lips would not readily lend themselves to speech and this was hardly more than he expected he had not liked the revelation himself when it had first come to him but he did not guess what it was in his narrative which had most pierced his mother it was something that made the threat about the estate only a secondary alarm now for the first time she heard of the intended proceedings against jermyn harold had not chosen to speak of them before but having at last called his mother into consultation there was nothing in his mind to hinder him from speaking without reserve of his determination to visit on the attorney his shameful maladministration of the family affairs harold went through the whole narrative of what he called jermyn's scheme to catch him in a vise and his power of triumphantly frustrating that scheme in his usual rapid way speaking with a final decisiveness of tone and his mother felt that if she urged any counter consideration at all she could only do so when he had no more to say now what i want you to do mother if you can see this matter as i see it harold said in conclusion is to go with me to call on this girl in malthouse yard i will open the affair to her it appears she is not likely to have been informed yet and you will invite her to visit you here at once that all scandal all hatching of law mischief may be avoided and the thing may be brought to an amicable conclusion it seems almost incredible extraordinary a girl in her position said mrs transome with difficulty it would have seemed the bitterest humiliating penance if another sort of suffering had left any room in her heart i assure you she is a lady i saw her when i was canvassing and was amazed at the time you will be quite struck with her it is no indignity for you to invite her oh said mrs transome with low toned bitterness i must put up with all things as they are determined for me when shall we go well said harold looking at his watch it is hardly two yet we could really go to day when you have lunched it is better to lose no time i'll order the carriage stay said mrs transome with a desperate effort there is plenty of time i shall not lunch i have a word to say harold withdrew his hand from the bell and leaned against the mantelpiece to listen you see i comply with your wish at once harold yes mother i'm much obliged to you for making no difficulties you ought to listen to me in return pray go on said harold expecting to be annoyed what is the good of having these chancery proceedings against jermyn good this good that fellow has burdened the estate with annuities and mortgages to the extent of three thousand a year and the bulk of them i am certain he holds himself under the name of another man and the advances this yearly interest represents have not been much more than twenty thousand of course he has hoodwinked you and my father never gave attention to these things he has been up to all sorts of devil's work with the deeds he didn't count on my coming back from smyrna to fill poor durfey's place he shall feel the difference and the good will be that i shall save almost all the annuities for the rest of my father's life which may be ten years or more and i shall get back some of the money and i shall punish a scoundrel that is the good he will be ruined that's what i intend said harold sharply he exerted himself a great deal for us in the old suits everyone said he had wonderful zeal and ability said mrs transome getting courage and warmth as she went on her temper was rising what he did he did for his own sake you may depend on that said harold with a scornful laugh there were very painful things in that last suit you seem anxious about this young woman to avoid all further scandal and contests in the family why don't you wish to do it in this case jermyn might be willing to arrange things amicably to make restitution as far as he can if he has done anything wrong i will arrange nothing amicably with him said harold decisively if he has ever done anything scandalous as our agent let him bear the infamy and the right way to throw the infamy on him is to show the world that he has robbed us and that i mean to punish him why do you wish to shield such a fellow mother it has been chiefly through him that you have had to lead such a thrifty miserable life you who used to make as brilliant a figure as a woman need wish mrs transome's rising temper was turned into a horrible sensation as painful as a sudden concussion from something hard and immovable when we have struck out with our fist intending to hit something warm soft and breathing like ourselves poor mrs transome's strokes were sent jarring back on her by a hard unalterable past she did not speak in answer to harold but rose from the chair as if she gave up the debate women are frightened at everything i know said harold kindly feeling that he had been a little harsh after his mother's compliance and you have been used for so many years to think jermyn a law of nature come mother he went on looking at her gently and resting his hands on her shoulders look cheerful we shall get through all these difficulties and this girl i dare say she will be quite an interesting visitor for you you have not had any young girl about you for a long while who knows she may fall deeply in love with me and i may be obliged to marry her he spoke laughingly only thinking how he could make his mother smile but she looked at him seriously and said do you mean that harold am i not capable of making a conquest not too fat yet a handsome well rounded youth of thirty four she was forced to look straight at the beaming face with its rich dark color just bent a little over her why could she not be happy in this son whose future she had once dreamed of and who had been as fortunate as she had ever hoped the tears came not plenteously but making her dark eyes as large and bright as youth had once made them without tears there there said harold coaxingly don't be afraid you shall not have a daughter in law unless she is a pearl now we will get ready to go in half an hour from that time mrs transome came down looking majestic in sables and velvet ready to call on the girl in malthouse yard she had composed herself to go through this task she saw there was nothing better to be done after the resolutions harold had taken some sort of compromise with this oddly placed heiress was the result most to be hoped for if the compromise turned out to be a marriage well she had no reason to care much she was already powerless it remained to be seen what this girl was the carriage was to be driven round the back way to avoid too much observation but the late election affairs might account for mr lyon's receiving a visit from the unsuccessful radical candidate chapter xxxvii i also could speak as ye do if your soul were in my soul's stead i could heap up words against you and shake mine head at you book of job in the interval since esther parted with felix holt on the day of the riot she had gone through so much emotion and had already had so strong a shock of surprise that she was prepared to receive any new incident of an unwonted kind with comparative equanimity when mr lyon had got home again from his preaching excursion felix was already on his way to loamford jail the little minister was terribly shaken by the news he saw no clear explanation of felix holt's conduct for the statements esther had heard were so conflicting that she had not been able to gather distinctly what had come out in the examination by the magistrates but mr lyon felt confident that felix was innocent of any wish to abet a riot or the infliction of injuries what he chiefly feared was that in the fatal encounter with tucker he had been moved by a rash temper not sufficiently guarded against by a prayerful and humble spirit my poor young friend is being taught with mysterious severity the evil of a too confident self reliance he said to esther as they sat opposite to each other listening and speaking sadly you will go and see him father verily will i but i must straightway go and see that poor afflicted woman whose soul is doubtless whirled about in this trouble like a shapeless and unstable thing driven by divided winds mr lyon rose and took his hat hastily ready to walk out with his greatcoat flying open and exposing his small person to the keen air stay father pray till you have had some food said esther putting her hand on his arm you look quite weary and shattered child i cannot stay i can neither eat bread nor drink water till i have learned more about this young man's deeds what can be proved and what cannot be proved against him i fear he has none to stand by him in this town for even by the friends of our church i have been ofttimes rebuked because he seemed dear to me but esther my beloved child here mr lyon grasped her arm and seemed in the need of speech to forget his previous haste i bear in mind this the lord knoweth them that are his but we we are left to judge by uncertain signs that so we may learn to exercise hope and faith toward one another and in this uncertainty i cling with awful hope to those whom the world loves not because their conscience albeit mistakenly is at war with the habits of the world our great faith my esther is the faith of martyrs i will not lightly turn away from any man who endures harshness because he will not lie nay though i would not wantonly grasp at ease of mind through an arbitrary choice of doctrine i cannot but believe that the merits of the divine sacrifice are wider than our utmost charity i once believed otherwise but not now not now the minister paused and seemed to be abstractedly gazing at some memory he was always liable to be snatched away by thoughts from the pursuit of a purpose which had seemed pressing esther seized the opportunity and prevailed on him to fortify himself with some of lyddy's porridge before he went out on his tiring task of seeking definite trustworthy knowledge from the lips of various witnesses beginning with that feminine darkener of counsel poor mrs holt she regarding all her trouble about felix in the light of a fulfilment of her own prophecies treated the sad history with a preference for edification above accuracy and for mystery above relevance worthy of a commentator on the apocalypse she insisted chiefly not on the important facts that felix had sat at his work till after eleven like a deaf man had rushed out in surprise and alarm had come back to report with satisfaction that things were quiet and had asked her to set by his dinner for him facts which would tell as evidence that felix was disconnected with any project of disturbances and was averse to them these things came out incidentally in her long plaint to the minister but what mrs holt felt it essential to state was that long before michaelmas was turned sitting in her chair she had said to felix that there would be a judgment on him for being so certain sure about the pills and the elixir and now mr lyon said the poor woman who had dressed herself in a gown previously cast off a front all out of curl and a cap with no starch in it while she held little coughing job on her knee and now you see my words have come true sooner than i thought they would felix may contradict me if he will but there he is in prison and here am i with nothing in the world to bless myself with but half a crown a week as i've saved by my own scraping and this house i've got to pay rent for it's not me has done wrong mr lyon there's nobody can say it of me not the orphan child on my knee is more innicent o' riot and murder and anything else as is bad but when you've got a son so masterful and stopping medicines as providence has sent and his betters have been taking up and down the country since before he was a baby it's o' no use being good here below but he was a baby mr lyon and i gave him the breast here poor mrs holt's motherly love over came her expository eagerness and she fell more and more to crying as she spoke and to think there's folks saying now as he'll be transported and his hair shaved off and the treadmill and everything oh dear as mrs holt broke off into sobbing little job also who had got a confused yet profound sense of sorrow and of felix being hurt and gone away set up a little wail of wondering misery nay mistress holt said the minister soothingly enlarge not your grief by more than warrantable grounds i have good hope that my young friend your son will be delivered from any severe consequences beyond the death of the man tucker which i fear will ever be a sore burden on his memory i feel confident that a jury of his country men will discern between misfortune or it may be misjudgment and an evil will and that he will be acquitted of any grave offence he never stole anything in his life mr lyon said mrs holt reviving nobody can throw it in my face as my son ran away with money like the young man at the bank though he looked most respectable and far different on a sunday to what felix ever did and i know it's very hard fighting with constables but they say tucker's wife'll be a deal better off than she was before for the great folks'll pension her and she'll be put on all the charities and her children at the free school and everything your trouble's easy borne when everybody gives it a lift for you and if judge and jury wants to do right by felix they'll think of his poor mother with the bread took out of her mouth all but half a crown a week and furniture which to be sure is most excellent and of my own buying and got to keep this orphin child as felix himself brought on me and i might send him back to his old grandfather on parish pay but i'm not that woman mr lyon i've a tender heart and here's his little feet and toes like marbil do but look here mrs holt drew off job's sock and shoe and showed a well washed little foot and you'll perhaps say i might take a lodger but it's easy talking it isn't everybody at a loose end wants a parlor and a bedroom and if anything bad happens to felix i may as well go and sit in the parish pound and nobody to buy me out for it's beyond everything how the church members find fault with my son but i think they might leave his mother to find fault for queer and masterful he might be and flying in the face of the very scripture about the physic but he was most clever beyond anything that i will say and was his own father's lawful child and me his mother that was mary wall thirty years before ever i married his father here mrs holt's feelings again became too much for her but she struggled on to say sobbingly and if they're to transport him i should like to go to the prison and take the orphin child for he was most fond of having him on his lap and said he'd never marry and there was one above overheard him for he's been took at his word mr lyon listened with low groans and then tried to comfort her by saying that he would himself go to loamford as soon as possible and would give his soul no rest till he had done all he could do for felix on one point mrs holt's plaint tallied with his own forebodings and he found them verified the state of feeling in treby among the liberal dissenting flock was unfavorable to felix none who had observed his conduct from the windows saw anything tending to excuse him and his own account of his motives given on his examination was spoken of with head shaking if it had not been for his habit of always thinking himself wiser than other people he would never have entertained such a wild scheme he had set himself up for something extraordinary and had spoken ill of respectable trades people he had put a stop to the making of saleable drugs contrary to the nature of buying and selling and to a due reliance on what providence might effect in the human inside through the instrumentality of remedies unsuitable to the stomach looked at in a merely secular light and the result was what might have been expected he had brought his mother to poverty and himself into trouble and what for he had done no good to the cause if he had fought about church rates or had been worsted in some struggle in which he was distinctly the champion of dissent and liberalism his case would have been one for gold silver and copper subscriptions in order to procure the best defence sermons might have been preached on him and his name might have floated on flags from newcastle to dorchester but there seemed to be no edification in what had befallen felix the riot at treby turn it which way you would as mr muscat observed was no great credit to liberalism and what mr lyon had to testify as to felix holt's conduct in the matter of the sproxton men only made it clear that the defence of felix was the accusation of his party the whole affair mr nuttwood said was dark and inscrutable and seemed not to be one in which the interference of god's servants would tend to give the glory where the glory was due that a candidate for whom the richer church members had all voted should have his name associated with the encouragement of drunkenness riot and plunder was an occasion for the enemy to blaspheme and it was not clear how the enemy's mouth would be stopped by exertions in favor of a rash young man whose interference had made things worse instead of better mr lyon was warned lest his human partialities should blind him to the interests of truth it was god's cause that was endangered in this matter the little minister's soul was bruised he himself was keenly alive to the complication of public and private regards in this affair and suffered a good deal at the thought of tory triumph in the demonstration that excepting the attack on the seven stars which called itself a whig house all damage to property had been borne by tories he cared intensely for his opinions and would have liked events to speak for them in a sort of picture writing that everybody could understand the enthusiasms of the world are not to be stimulated by a commentary in small and subtle characters which alone can tell the whole truth and the picture writing in felix holt's troubles was of an entirely puzzling kind if he were a martyr neither side wanted to claim him yet the minister as we have seen found in his christian faith a reason for clinging the more to one who had not a large party to back him that little man's heart was heroic he was not one of those liberals who make their anxiety for the cause of liberalism a plea for cowardly desertion besides himself he believed there was no one who could bear testimony to the remonstrances of felix concerning the treating of the sproxton men except jermyn johnson and harold transome though he had the vaguest idea of what could be done in the case he fixed his mind on the probability that mr transome would be moved to the utmost exertion if only as an atonement but he dared not take any step until he had consulted felix who he foresaw was likely to have a very strong determination as to the help he would accept or not accept this last expectation was fulfilled mr lyon returned to esther after his day's journey to loamford and back with less of trouble and perplexity in his mind he had at least got a definite course marked out to which he must resign himself felix had declared that he would receive no aid from harold transome except the aid he might give as an honest witness there was nothing to be done for him but what was perfectly simple and direct even if the pleading of counsel had been permitted and at that time it was not on behalf of a prisoner on trial for felony felix would have declined it he would in any case have spoken in his own defence he had a perfectly simple account to give and needed not to avail himself of any legal adroitness he consented to accept the services of a respectable solicitor in loamford who offered to conduct his case without any fees the work was plain and easy felix said the only witnesses who had to be hunted up at all were some who could testify that he had tried to take the crowd down hobb's lane and that they had gone to the manor in spite of him then he is not so much cast down as you feared father said esther no child albeit he is pale and much shaken for one so stalwart he hath no grief he says save for the poor man tucker and for his mother otherwise his heart is without a burden we discoursed greatly on the sad effect of all this for his mother and on the perplexed condition of human things whereby even right action seems to bring evil consequences if we have respect only to our own brief lives and not to that larger rule whereby we are stewards of the eternal dealings and not contrivers of our own success did he say nothing about me father said esther trembling a little but unable to repress her egoism yes he asked if you were well and sent his affectionate regards nay he bade me say something which appears to refer to your discourse together when i was not present 'tell her' he said 'whatever they sentence me to she knows they can't rob me of my vocation with poverty for my bride and preaching and pedagoguy for my business i am sure of a handsome establishment' he laughed doubtless bearing in mind some playfulness of thine mr lyon seemed to be looking at esther as he smiled but she was not near enough for him to discern the expression of her face just then it seemed made for melancholy rather than for playfulness hers was not a childish beauty and when the sparkle of mischief wit and vanity was out of her eyes and the large look of abstracted sorrow was there you would have been surprised by a certain grandeur which the smiles had hidden that changing face was the perfect symbol of her mixed susceptible nature in which battle was inevitable and the side of victory uncertain she began to look on all that had passed between herself and felix as something not buried but embalmed and kept as a relic in a private sanctuary the very entireness of her preoccupation about him the perpetual repetition in her memory of all that had passed between them tended to produce this effect she lived with him in the past in the future she seemed shut out from him he was an influence above her life rather than a part of it some time or other perhaps he would be to her as if he belonged to the solemn admonishing skies checking her self satisfied pettiness with the suggestion of a wider life but not yet not while her trouble was so fresh for it was still her trouble and not felix holt's perhaps it was a subtraction from his power over her that she could never think of him with pity because he always seemed to her too great and strong to be pitied he wanted nothing he evaded calamity by choosing privation the best part of a woman's love is worship but it is hard to her to be sent away with her precious spikenard rejected and her long tresses too that were let fall ready to soothe the wearied feet while esther was carrying these things in her heart the january days were beginning to pass by with their wonted wintry monotony except that there was rather more of good cheer than usual remaining from the feast of twelfth night among the triumphant tories and rather more scandal than usual excited among the mortified dissenters by the wilfulness of their minister he had actually mentioned felix holt by name in his evening sermon and offered up a petition for him in the evening prayer also by name not as a young ishmaelite whom he would fain see brought back from the lawless life of the desert and seated in the same fold even with the sons of judah and of benjamin a suitable periphrasis which brother kemp threw off without any effort and with all the felicity of a suggestive critic poor mrs holt indeed even in the midst of her grief experienced a proud satisfaction that though she was not a church member she was now an object of congregational remark and ministerial allusion feeling herself a spotless character standing out in relief on a dark background of affliction and a practical contradiction to that extreme doctrine of human depravity which she had never given in to she was naturally gratified and soothed by a notice which must be a recognition but more influential hearers were of opinion that in a man who had so many long sentences at command as mr lyon so many parentheses and modifying clauses this naked use of a non scriptural treby name in an address to the almighty was all the more offensive in a low unlettered local preacher of the wesleyan persuasion such things might pass but a certain style in prayer was demanded from independents the most educated body in the ranks of orthodox dissent to mr lyon such notions seemed painfully perverse and the next morning he was declaring to esther his resolution stoutly to withstand them and to count nothing common or unclean on which a blessing could be asked when the tenor of his thoughts was completely changed by a great shock of surprise which made both himself and esther sit looking at each other in speechless amazement the cause was a letter brought by a special messenger from duffield a heavy letter addressed to esther in a business like manner quite unexampled in her correspondence and the contents of the letter were more startling than its exterior it began madam herewith we send you a brief abstract of evidence which has come within our knowledge that the right of remainder whereby the lineal issue of edward bycliffe can claim possession of the estates of which the entail was settled by john justus transome in now first accrues to you as the sole and lawful issue of maurice christian bycliffe we are confident of success in the prosecution of this claim which will result to you in the possession of estates to the value at the lowest of from five to six thousand per annum it was at this point that esther who was reading aloud let her hand fall with the letter on her lap and with a palpitating heart looked at her father who looked again in silence that lasted for two or three minutes a certain terror was upon them both though the thoughts that laid that weight on the tongue of each were different it was mr lyon who spoke first this then is what the man named christian referred to i distrusted him yet it seems he spoke truly but said esther whose imagination ran necessarily to those conditions of wealth which she could best appreciate do they mean that the transomes would be turned out of transome court and that i should go and live there it seems quite an impossible thing nay child i know not i am ignorant in these things and the thought of worldly grandeur for you hath more of terror than of gladness for me nevertheless we must duly weigh all things not considering aught that befalls us as a bare event but rather as an occasion for faithful stewardship let us go to my study and consider this writing further how this announcement which to esther seemed as unprepared as if it had fallen from the skies came to be made to her by solicitors other than batt cowley the old lawyers of the bycliffes was by a sequence as natural that is to say as legally natural as any in the world the secret worker of the apparent wonder was mr johnson who on the very day when he wrote to give his patron mr jermyn the serious warning that a bill was likely to be filed in chancery against him had carried forward with added zeal the business already commenced of arranging with another firm his share in the profits likely to result from the prosecution of esther bycliffe's claim jermyn's star was certainly going down and johnson did not feel an unmitigated grief beyond some troublesome declarations as to his actual share in transactions in which his name had been used johnson saw nothing formidable in prospect for himself he was not going to be ruined though jermyn probably was he was not a high flyer but a mere climbing bird who could hold on and get his livelihood just as well if his wings were clipped a little and in the meantime here was something to be gained in this bycliffe business which it was not unpleasant to think was a nut that jermyn had intended to keep for his own particular cracking and which would be rather a severe astonishment to mr harold transome whose manners towards respectable agents were such as leave a smart in a man of spirit under the stimulus of small many mixed motives like these a great deal of business has been done in the world by well clad and in clean shaven men whose names are on charity lists and who do not know that they are base mr johnson's character was not much more exceptional than his double chin no system religious or political i believe has laid it down as a principle that all men are alike virtuous or even that all the people rated for houses are an honor to their species chapter xxxviii the down we rest on in our ary dreams has not been plucked from birds that live and smart 'tis but warm snow that melts not the story and the prospect revealed to esther by the lawyer's letter which she and her father studied together had made an impression on her very different from what she had been used to figure to herself in her many day dreams as to the effect of a sudden elevation in rank and fortune in her day dreams she had not traced out the means by which such a change could be brought about in fact the change had seemed impossible to her except in her little private utopia which like other utopias was filled with delightful results independent of processes but her mind had fixed itself habitually on the signs and luxuries of ladyhood for which she had the keenest perception she had seen the very mat in her carriage had scented the dried rose leaves in her corridors had felt the soft carpet under her pretty feet and seen herself as she rose from her sofa cushions in the crystal panel that reflected a long drawing room where the conservatory flowers and the pictures of fair women left her still with the supremacy of charm she had trodden the marble firm gravel of her garden walks and the soft deep turf of her lawn she had had her servants about her filled with adoring respect because of her kindness as well as her grace and beauty but she had had several accomplished cavaliers all at once sueing for her hand one of whom uniting very high birth with long dark eyelashes and the most distinguished talents she secretly preferred though his pride and hers hindered an avowal and supplied the inestimable interest of retardation the glimpses she had had in her brief life as a family governess supplied her ready faculty with details enough of delightful still life to furnish her day dreams and no one who has not like esther a strong natural prompting and susceptibility toward such things and has at the same time suffered from the presence of opposite conditions can understand how powerfully those minor accidents of rank which please the fastidious sense can preoccupy the imagination it seemed that almost everything in her day dreams cavaliers apart must be found at transome court but now that fancy was becoming real and the impossible appeared possible esther found the balance of her attention reversed now that her ladyhood was not simply in utopia she found herself arrested and painfully grasped by the means through which the ladyhood was to be obtained to her inexperience this strange story of an alienated inheritance of such a last representative of pure blooded lineage as old thomas transome the bill sticker above all of the dispossession hanging over those who actually held and had expected always to hold the wealth and position which were suddenly announced to be rightly hers all these things made a picture not for her own tastes and fancies to float in with elysian indulgence but in which she was compelled to gaze on the degrading hard experience of other human beings and on a humiliating loss which was the obverse of her own proud gain even in her times of most untroubled egoism esther shrank from anything ungenerous and the fact that she had a very lively image of harold transome and his gypsy eyed boy in her mind gave additional distinctness to the thought that if she entered they must depart of the elder transomes she had a dimmer vision and they were necessarily in the background to her sympathy she and her father sat with their hands locked as they might have done if they had been listening to a solemn oracle in the days of old revealing unknown kinship and rightful heirdom it was not that esther had any thought of renouncing her fortune she was incapable in these moments of condensing her vague ideas and feelings into any distinct plan of action nor indeed did it seem that she was called upon to act with any promptitude it was only that she was conscious of being strangely awed by something that was called good fortune and the awe shut out any scheme of rejection as much as any triumphant joy in acceptance her father she learned had died disappointed and in wrongful imprisonment and an undefined sense of nemesis seemed half to sanctify her inheritance and counteract its apparent arbitrariness felix holt was present in her mind throughout what he would say was an imaginary commentary that she was constantly framing and the words that she most frequently gave him for she dramatized under the inspiration of a sadness slightly bitter were of this kind that is clearly your destiny to be aristocratic to be rich i always saw that our lots lay widely apart you are not fit for poverty or any work of difficulty but remember what i once said to you about a vision of consequences take care where your fortune leads you her father had not spoken since they had ended their study and discussion of the story and the evidence as it was presented to them into this he had entered with his usual penetrating activity but he was so accustomed to the impersonal study of narrative that even in these exceptional moments the habit of half a century asserted itself and he seemed sometimes not to distinguish the case of esther's inheritance from a story in ancient history until some detail recalled him to the profound feeling that a great great change might be coming over the life of this child who was so close to him at last he relapsed into total silence and for some time esther was not moved to interrupt it he had sunk back in his chair with his hand locked in hers and was pursuing a sort of prayerful meditation he lifted up no formal petition but it was as if his soul travelled again over the facts he had been considering in the company of a guide ready to inspire and correct him he was striving to purify his feeling in this matter from selfish or worldly dross a striving which is that prayer without ceasing sure to wrest an answer by its sublime importunity there is no knowing how long they might have sat in this way if it had not been for the inevitable lyddy reminding them dismally of dinner yes lyddy we come said esther and then before moving is there any advice you have in your mind for me father the sense of awe was growing in esther her intensest life was no longer in her dreams where she made things to her own mind she was moving in a world charged with forces not yet my dear save this that you will seek special illumination in this juncture and above all be watchful that your soul be not lifted up within you by what rightly considered is rather an increase of charge and a call upon you to walk along a path which is indeed easy to the flesh but dangerous to the spirit you would always live with me father esther said under a strong impulse partly affection partly the need to grasp at some moral help but she had no sooner uttered the words than they raised a vision showing as by a flash of lightning the incongruity of that past which had created the sanctities and affections of her life with that future which was coming to her the little rusty old minister with the one luxury of his sunday evening pipe smoked up the kitchen chimney coming to live in the midst of grandeur but no her father with the grandeur of his past sorrow and his long struggling labors forsaking his vocation and vulgarly accepting an existence unsuited to him esther's face flushed with the excitement of this vision and its reversed interpretation which five months ago she would have been incapable of seeing her question to her father seemed like a mockery she was ashamed he answered slowly touch not that chord yet my child i must learn to think of thy lot according to the demands of providence we will rest a while from the subject and i will seek calmness in my ordinary duties the next morning nothing more was said mr lyon was absorbed in his sermon making for it was near the end of the week and esther was obliged to attend to her pupils mrs holt came by invitation with little job to share their dinner of roast meat and after much of what the minister called unprofitable discourse she was quitting the house when she hastened back with an astonished face to tell mr lyon and esther who were already in wonder at crashing thundering sounds on the pavement that there was a carriage stopping and stamping at the entry into malthouse yard with all sorts of fine liveries and a lady and gentleman inside mr lyon and esther looked at each other both having the same name in their minds if it's mr transome or somebody else as is great mr lyon urged mrs holt you'll remember my son and say he's got a mother with a character they may enquire into as much as they like and never mind what felix says for he's so masterful he'd stay in prison and be transported whether or no only to have his own way for it's not to be thought but what the great people could get him off if they would and it's very hard with a king in the country and all the texts in proverbs about the king's countenance and solomon and the live baby mr lyon lifted up his hand deprecatingly and mrs holt retreated from the parlor door to a corner of the kitchen the outer doorway being occupied by dominic who was enquiring if mr and miss lyon were at home and could receive mrs transome and mr harold transome while dominic went back to the carriage mrs holt escaped with her tiny companion to zachary's the new pew opener observing to lyddy that she knew herself and was not that woman to stay where she might not be wanted whereupon lyddy differing fundamentally admonished her parting ear that it was well if she knew herself to be dust and ashes silently extending the application of this remark to mrs transome as she saw the tall lady sweep in arrayed in her rich black and fur with that fine gentleman behind her whose thick top knot of wavy hair sparkling ring dark complexion and general air of worldly exaltation unconnected with chapel were painfully suggestive to lyddy of herod pontius pilate or the much quoted gallio harold transome greeting esther gracefully presented his mother whose eagle like glance fixed on her from the first moment of entering seemed to esther to pierce her through mrs transome hardly noticed mr lyon not from studied haughtiness but from sheer mental inability to consider him as a person ignorant of natural history is unable to consider a fresh water polyp otherwise than as a sort of animated weed certainly not fit for table but harold saw that his mother was agreeably struck by esther who indeed showed to much advantage she was not at all taken by surprise and maintained a dignified quietude but her previous knowledge and reflection about the possible dispossession of these transomes gave her a softened feeling toward them which tinged her manners very agreeably harold was carefully polite to the minister throwing out a word to make him understand that he had an important part in the important business which had brought this unannounced visit and the four made a group seated not far off each other near the window mrs transome and esther being on the sofa you must be astonished at a visit from me miss lyon mrs transome began i seldom come to treby magna now i see you the visit is an unexpected pleasure but the cause of my coming is business of a serious nature which my son will communicate to you i ought to begin by saying that what i have to announce to you is the reverse of disagreeable miss lyon said harold with lively ease i don't suppose the world would consider it very good news for me but a rejected candidate mr lyon harold went on turning graciously to the minister begins to be inured to loss and misfortune truly sir said mr lyon with a rather sad solemnity your allusion hath a grievous bearing for me but i will not retard your present purpose by further remark you will never guess what i have to disclose said harold again looking at esther unless indeed you have already had some previous intimation of it does it refer to law and inheritance said esther with a smile she was already brightened by harold's manner the news seemed to be losing its chillness and to be something really belonging to warm comfortable interesting life then you have already heard of it said harold inwardly vexed but sufficiently prepared not to seem so only yesterday said esther quite simply i received a letter from some lawyers with a statement of many surprising things showing that i was an heiress here she turned very prettily to address mrs transome which as you may imagine is one of the last things i could have supposed myself to be my dear said mrs transome with elderly grace just laying her hand for an instant on esther's it is a lot that would become you admirably esther blushed and said playfully oh i know what to buy with fifty pounds a year but i know the price of nothing beyond that her father sat looking at her through his spectacles stroking his chin it was amazing to herself that she was taking so lightly now what had caused her such deep emotion yesterday i daresay then said harold you are more fully possessed of particulars than i am so that my mother and i need only tell you what no one else can tell you that is what are her and my feelings and wishes under these new and unexpected circumstances i am most anxious said esther with a grave beautiful look of respect to mrs transome most anxious on that point indeed being of course in uncertainty about it i have not yet known whether i could rejoice mrs transome's glance had softened she liked esther to look at her our chief anxiety she said knowing what harold wished her to say is that there may be no contest no useless expenditure of money of course we will surrender what can be rightfully claimed my mother expresses our feeling precisely miss lyon said harold and i'm sure mr lyon you will understand our desire assuredly sir my daughter would in any case have had my advice to seek a conclusion which would involve no strife we endeavor sir in our body to hold to the apostolic rule that one christian brother should not go to law with another and i for my part would extend this rule to all my fellow men apprehending that the practice of our courts is little consistent with the simplicity that is in christ if it is to depend on my will said esther there is nothing that would be more repugnant to me than any struggle on such a subject but can't the lawyers go on doing what they will in spite of me it seems that this is what they mean not exactly said harold smiling of course they live by such struggles as you dislike but we can thwart them by determining not to quarrel it is desirable that we should consider the affair together and put it into the hands of honorable solicitors i assure you we transomes will not contend for what is not our own and this is what i have come to beg of you said mrs transome it is that you will come to transome court and let us take full time to arrange matters do oblige me you shall not be teased more than you like by an old woman you shall do just as you please and become acquainted with your future home since it is to be yours i can tell you a world of things that you will want to know and the business can proceed properly do consent said harold with winning brevity esther was flushed and her eyes were bright it was impossible for her not to feel that the proposal was a more tempting step toward her change of condition than she could have thought of beforehand she had forgotten that she was in any trouble but she looked toward her father who was again stroking his chin as was his habit when he was doubting or deliberating i hope you do not disapprove of miss lyon's granting us this favor said harold to the minister i have nothing to oppose to it sir if my daughter's own mind is clear as to her course you will come now with us said mrs transome persuasively you will go back with us now in the carriage harold was highly gratified with the perfection of his mother's manner on this occasion which he had looked forward to as difficult since he had come home again he had never seen her so much at her ease or with so much benignancy in her face the secret lay in the charm of esther's sweet young deference a sort of charm that had not before entered into mrs transome's elderly life esther's pretty behavior it must be confessed was not fed entirely from lofty moral sources over and above her really generous feeling she enjoyed mrs transome's accent the high bred quietness of her speech the delicate odor of her drapery she had always thought that life must be particularly easy if one could pass it among refined people and so it seemed at this moment she wished unmixedly to go to transome court since my father has no objection she said and you urge me so kindly but i must beg for time to pack up a few clothes by all means said mrs transome we are not at all pressed when esther had left the room harold said apart from our immediate reason for coming mr lyon i could have wished to see you about these unhappy consequences of the election contest but you will understand that i have been much preoccupied with private affairs you have well said that the consequences are unhappy sir and but for a reliance on something more than human calculation i know not which i should most bewail the scandal which wrong dealing has brought on right principles or the snares which it laid for the feet of a young man who is dear to me 'one soweth and another reapeth' is a verity that applies to evil as well as good you are referring to felix holt i have not neglected steps to secure the best legal help for the prisoners but i am given to understand that holt refuses any aid from me i hope he will not go rashly to work in speaking in his own defence without any legal instruction it is an opprobrium of our law that no counsel is allowed to plead for the prisoner in cases of felony a ready tongue may do a man as much harm as good in a court of justice he piques himself on making a display and displays a little too much sir you know him not said the little minister in his deeper tone he would not accept even if it were accorded a defense wherein the truth was screened or avoided not from a vainglorious spirit of self exhibition for he hath a singular directness and simplicity of speech but from an averseness to a profession wherein a man may without shame seek to justify the wicked for reward and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him it's a pity a fine young fellow should do himself harm by fanatical notions of that sort i could at least have procured the advantage of first rate consultation he didn't look to me like a dreamy personage nor is he dreamy rather his excess lies in being too practical well i hope you will not encourage him in such irrationality the question is not one of misrepresentation but of adjusting fact so as to raise it to the power of evidence don't you see that i do i do but i distrust not felix holt's discernment in regard to his own case he builds not on doubtful things and hath no illusory hopes on the contrary he is of a too scornful incredulity where i would fain see a more childlike faith but he will hold no belief without action corresponding thereto and the occasion of his return to this his native place at a time which has proved fatal was no other than his resolve to hinder the sale of some drugs which had chiefly supported his mother but which his better knowledge showed him to be pernicious to the human frame he undertook to support her by his own labor but sir i pray you to mark and old as i am i will not deny that this young man instructs me herein i pray you to mark the poisonous confusion of good and evil which is the wide spreading effect of vicious practices through the use of undue electioneering means concerning which however i do not accuse you farther than of having acted the part of him who washes his hands when he delivers up to others the exercise of an iniquitous power felix holt is i will not scruple to say the innocent victim of a riot and that deed of strict honesty whereby he took on himself the charge of his aged mother seems now to have deprived her of sufficient bread and is even an occasion of reproach to him from the weaker brethren i shall be proud to supply her as amply as you think desirable said harold not enjoying this lecture i will pray you to speak of this question with my daughter who it appears may herself have large means at command and would desire to minister to mrs holt's needs with all friendship and delicacy for the present i can take care that she lacks nothing essential as mr lyon was speaking esther re entered equipped for her drive she laid her hand on her father's arm and said you will let my pupils know at once will you father doubtless my dear said the old man trembling a little under the feeling that this departure of esther's was a crisis nothing again would be as it had been in their mutual life but he feared that he was being mastered by a too tender self regard and struggled to keep himself calm mrs transome and harold had both risen if you are quite ready miss lyon said harold divining that the father and daughter would like to have an unobserved moment i will take my mother to the carriage and come back for you when they were alone esther put her hands on her father's shoulders and kissed him this will not be a grief to you i hope father you think it is better that i should go nay child i am weak but i would fain be capable of a joy quite apart from the accidents of my aged earthly existence which indeed is a petty and almost dried up fountain whereas to the receptive soul the river of life pauses not nor is diminished perhaps you will see felix holt again and tell him all shall i say aught to him for you oh no only that job tudge has a little flannel shirt and a box of lozenges said esther smiling ah i hear mr transome coming back i must say good bye to lyddy else she will cry over my hard heart in spite of all the grave thoughts that had been esther felt it a very pleasant as well as new experience to be led to the carriage by harold transome to be seated on soft cushions and bowled along looked at admiringly and deferentially by a person opposite whom it was agreeable to look at in return and talked to with suavity and liveliness toward what prospect was that easy carriage really leading her she could not be always asking herself mentor like questions her young bright nature was rather weary of the sadness that had grown heavier in these last weeks like a chill white mist hopelessly veiling the day her fortune was beginning to appear worthy of being called good fortune she had come to a new stage in her journey a new day had arisen on new scenes and her young untired spirit was full of curiosity chapter xxxix no man believes that many textured knowledge and skill as a just idea of the solar system or the power of painting flesh or of reading written harmonies can come late and of a sudden yet many will not stick at believing that happiness can come at any day and hour solely by a new disposition of events though there is naught less capable of a magical production than a mortal's happiness which is mainly a complex of habitual relations and dispositions not to be wrought by news from foreign parts or any whirling of fortune's wheel for one on whose brow time has written legibly some days after esther's arrival at transome court denner coming to dress mrs transome before dinner a labor of love for which she had ample leisure now found her mistress seated with more than ever of a marble aspect of self absorbed suffering which to the waiting woman's keen observation had been gradually intensifying itself during the past week she had tapped at the door without having been summoned and she had ventured to enter though she had heard no voice saying come in mrs transome had on a dark warm dressing gown hanging in thick folds about her and she was seated before a mirror which filled a panel from the floor to the ceiling the room was bright with the light of the fire and of wax candles for some reason contrary to her usual practice mrs transome had herself unfastened her abundant gray hair which rolled backward in a pale sunless stream over her dark dress she was seated before the mirror apparently looking at herself her brow knit in one deep furrow and her jewelled hands laid one above the other on her knee probably she had ceased to see the reflection in the mirror for her eyes had the fixed wide open look that belongs not to examination but to reverie motionless in that way her clear cut features keeping distinct record of past beauty she looked like an image faded dried and bleached by uncounted suns rather than a breathing woman who had numbered the years as they passed and had a consciousness within her which was the slow deposit of those ceaseless rolling years denner with all her ingrained and systematic reserve could not help showing signs that she was startled when peering from between her half closed eyelids she saw the motionless image in the mirror opposite to her as she entered her gentle opening of the door had not roused her mistress to whom the sensations produced by denner's presence were as little disturbing as those of a favorite cat but the slight cry and the start reflected in the glass were unusual enough to break the reverie mrs transome moved leaned back in her chair and said so you're come at last denner yes madam it is not late i'm sorry you should have undone your hair yourself i undid it to see what an old hag i am these fine clothes you put on me denner are only a smart shroud pray don't talk so madam if there's anybody doesn't think it pleasant to look at you so much the worse for them for my part i've seen no young ones fit to hold up your train look at your likeness down below and though you're older now what signifies i wouldn't be letty in the scullery because she's got red cheeks she mayn't know she's a poor creature but i know it and that's enough for me i know what sort of a dowdy draggletail she'll be in ten years' time i would change with nobody madam and if troubles were put up to market i'd sooner buy old than new it's something to have seen the worst a woman never has seen the worst till she is old denner said mrs transome bitterly the keen little waiting woman was not clear as to the cause of her mistress's added bitterness but she rarely brought herself to ask questions when mrs transome did not authorize them by beginning to give her information banks the bailiff and the head servant had nodded and winked a good deal over the certainty that mr harold was none so fond of jermyn but this was a subject on which mrs transome had never made up her mind to speak and denner knew nothing definite again she felt quite sure that there was some important secret connected with esther's presence in the house she suspected that the close dominic knew the secret and was more trusted than she was in spite of her forty years' service but any resentment on this ground would have been an entertained reproach against her mistress inconsistent with denner's creed and character she inclined to the belief that esther was the immediate cause of the new discontent if there's anything worse coming to you i should like to know what it is madam she said after a moment's silence speaking always in the same low quick way and keeping up her quiet labors when i awake at cock crow i'd sooner have one real grief on my mind than twenty false it's better to know one's robbed than to think one's going to be murdered i believe you are the creature in the world that loves me best denner yet you will never understand what i suffer it's of no use telling you there's no folly in you and no heartache you are made of iron you have never had any trouble i've had some of your trouble madam yes you good thing but as a sick nurse that never caught the fever you never even had a child i can feel for things i never went through i used to be sorry for the poor french queen when i was young i'd have lain cold for her to lie warm i know people have feelings according to their birth and station and you always took things to heart madam beyond anybody else but i hope there's nothing new to make you talk of the worst yes denner there is there is said mrs transome speaking in a low tone of misery while she bent for her head dress to be pinned on is it this young lady why what do you think about her denner said mrs transome in a tone of more spirit rather curious to hear what the old woman would say i don't deny she's graceful and she has a pretty smile and very good manners it's quite unaccountable by what banks says about her father i know nothing of those treby townsfolk myself but for my part i'm puzzled i'm fond of mr harold i always shall be madam i was at his bringing into the world and nothing but his doing wrong by you would turn me against him but the servants all say he's in love with miss lyon i wish it were true denner said mrs transome energetically i wish he were in love with her so that she could master him and make him do what she pleased then it is not true what they say not true that she will ever master him no woman ever will he will make her fond of him and afraid of him that's one of the things you have never gone through denner a woman's love is always freezing into fear she wants everything she is secure of nothing this girl has a fine spirit plenty of fire and pride and wit men like such captives as they like horses that champ the bit and paw the ground they feel more triumph in their mastery what is the use of a woman's will if she tries she doesn't get it and she ceases to be loved god was cruel when he made women denner was used to such outbursts as this her mistress's rhetoric and temper belonged to her superior rank her grand person and her piercing black eyes mrs transome had a sense of impiety in her words which made them all the more tempting to her impotent anger the waiting woman had none of that awe which could be turned into defiance the sacred grove was a common thicket to her it mayn't be good luck to be a woman she said but one begins with it from a baby one gets used to it and i shouldn't like to be a man to cough so loud and stand straddling about on a wet day and be so wasteful with meat and drink they're a coarse lot i think then i needn't make a trouble of this young lady madam she added after a moment's pause no denner i like her if that were all i should like harold to marry her it would be the best thing if the truth were known and it will be known soon the estate is hers by law such law as it is it's a strange story she's a bycliffe really denner did not look amazed but went on fastening her mistress's dress as she said well madam i was sure there was something wonderful at the bottom of it and turning the old lawsuits and everything else over in my mind i thought the law might have something to do with it then she is a born lady yes she has good blood in her veins we talked that over in the housekeeper's room what a hand and an instep she has and how her head is set on her shoulders almost like your own madam but her lightish complexion spoils her to my thinking and dominic said mr harold never admired that sort of woman before there's nothing that smooth fellow couldn't tell you if he would he knows the answer to riddles before they're made however he knows how to hold his tongue i'll say that for him and so do i madam yes yes you will not talk of it till other people are talking of it and so if mr harold married her it would save all fuss and mischief yes about the estate and he seems inclined and she'll not refuse him i'll answer for it and you like her madam there's everything to set your mind at rest denner was putting the finishing touch to mrs transome's dress by throwing an indian scarf over her shoulders and so completing the contrast between the majestic lady in costume and the dishevelled hecuba like woman whom she had found half an hour before i am not at rest mrs transome said with slow distinctness moving from the mirror to the window where the blind was not drawn down and she could see the chill white landscape and the far off unheeding stars denner more distressed by her mistress's suffering than she could have been by anything else took up with the instinct of affection a gold vinaigrette which mrs transome often liked to carry with her and going up to her put it into her hand gently mrs transome grasped the little woman's hand hard and held it so denner she said in a low tone if i could choose at this moment i would choose that harold should never have been born nay my dear denner had only once before in her life said my dear to her mistress it was a happiness to you then i don't believe i felt the happiness then as i feel the misery now it is foolish to say people can't feel much when they are getting old not pleasure perhaps little comes but they can feel they are forsaken why every fibre in me seems to be a memory that makes a pang they can feel that all the love in their lives is turned to hatred or contempt not mine madam not mine let what would be i should want to live for your sake for fear you should have nobody to do for you as i would ah then you are a happy woman denner you have loved somebody for forty years who is old and weak now and can't do without you the sound of the dinner gong resounded below and mrs transome let the faithful hand fall again chapter xl she's beautiful and therefore to be wooed she is a woman therefore to be won henry vi if denner had had a suspicion that esther's presence at transome court was not agreeable to her mistress it was impossible to entertain such a suspicion with regard to the other members of the family between her and little harry there was an extraordinary fascination this creature with the soft broad brown cheeks low forehead great black eyes tiny well defined nose fierce biting tricks toward every person and thing he disliked and insistence on entirely occupying those he liked was a human specimen such as esther had never seen before and she seemed to be equally original in harry's experience at first sight her light complexion and her blue gown probably also her sunny smile and her hands stretched out toward him seemed to make a show for him as of a new sort of bird he threw himself backward against his gappa as he called old mr transome and stared at this new comer with the gravity of a wild animal but she had no sooner sat down on the sofa in the library than he climbed up to her and began to treat her as an attractive object in natural history snatched up her curls with his brown fist and discovering that there was a little ear under them pinched it and blew into it pulled at her coronet of plaits and seemed to discover with satisfaction that it did not grow at the summit of her head but could be dragged down and altogether undone then finding that she laughed tossed him back kissed and pretended to bite him in fact was an animal that understood fun he rushed off and made dominic bring a small menagerie of white mice squirrels and birds with moro the black spaniel to make her acquaintance whomsoever harry liked it followed that mr transome must like gappa along with nimrod the retriever was part of the menagerie and perhaps endured more than all the other live creatures in the way of being tumbled about seeing that esther bore having her hair pulled down quite merrily and that she was willing to be harnessed and beaten the old man began to confide to her in his feeble smiling and rather jerking fashion harry's remarkable feats how he had one day when gappy was asleep unpinned a whole drawerful of beetles to see if they would fly away then disgusted with their stupidity was about to throw them all on the ground and stamp on them when dominic came in and rescued these valuable specimens also how he had subtly watched mrs transome at the cabinet where she kept her medicines and when she had left it for a little while without locking it had gone to the drawers and scattered half the contents on the floor but what old mr transome thought the most wonderful proof of an almost preternatural cleverness was that harry would hardly ever talk but preferred making inarticulate noises or combining syllables after a method of his own he can talk well enough if he likes said gappa evidently thinking that harry like the monkeys had deep reasons for his reticence you mind him he added nodding at esther and shaking with low toned laughter you'll hear he knows the right names of things well enough but he likes to make his own he'll give you one all to yourself before long and when harry seemed to have made up his mind distinctly that esther's name was boo mr transome nodded at her with triumphant satisfaction and then told her in a low whisper looking round cautiously beforehand that harry would never call mrs transome gamma but always bite it's wonderful said he laughing slyly the old man seemed so happy now in the new world created for him by dominic and harry that he would perhaps have made a holocaust of his flies and beetles if it had been necessary in order to keep this living lively kindness about him he no longer confined himself to the library but shuffled along from room to room staying and looking on at what was going forward whenever he did not find mrs transome alone to esther the sight of this feeble minded timid paralytic man who had long abdicated all mastery over the things that were his was something piteous certainly this had never been part of the furniture she had imagined for the delightful aristocratic dwelling in her utopia and the sad irony of such a lot impressed her the more because in her father she was accustomed to age accompanied with mental acumen and activity her thoughts went back in conjecture over the past life of mr and mrs transome a couple so strangely different from each other she found it impossible to arrange their existence in the seclusion of this fine park and in this lofty large roomed house where it seemed quite ridiculous to be anything so small as a human being without finding it rather dull mr transome had always had his beetles but mrs transome it was not easy to conceive that the husband and wife had ever been very fond of each other esther felt at her ease with mrs transome she was gratified by the consciousness for on this point esther was very quick that mrs transome admired her and looked at her with satisfied eyes but when they were together in the early days of her stay the conversation turned chiefly on what happened in mrs transome's youth what she wore when she was presented at court who were the most distinguished and beautiful women at that time the terrible excitement of the french revolution the emigrants she had known and the history of various titled members of the lingon family and esther from native delicacy did not lead to more recent topics of a personal kind she was copiously instructed that the lingon family was better than that even of the elder transomes and was privileged with an explanation of the various quarterings which proved that the lingon blood had been continually enriched poor mrs transome with her secret bitterness and dread still found a flavor in this sort of pride none the less because certain deeds of her own life had been in fatal inconsistency with it besides genealogies entered into her stock of ideas and her talk on such subjects was as necessary as the notes of the linnet or the blackbird she had no ultimate analysis of things that went beyond blood and family the herons of fenshore or the badgers of hillbury she had never seen behind the canvas with which her life was hung in the dim background there was the burning mount and the tables of the law in the foreground there was lady debarry privately gossipping about her and lady wyvern finally deciding not to send her invitations to dinner unlike that semiramis who made laws to suit her practical license she lived poor soul in the midst of desecrated sanctities and of honors that looked tarnished in the light of monotonous and weary suns glimpses of the lingon heraldry in their freshness were interesting to esther but it occurred to her that when she had known about them a good while they would cease to be succulent themes of converse or meditation and mrs transome having known them all along might have felt a vacuum in spite of them nevertheless it was entertaining at present to be seated on soft cushions with her netting before her while mrs transome went on with her embroidery and told in that easy phrase and with that refined high bred tone and accent which she possessed in perfection family stories that to esther were like so many novelettes what diamonds were in the earl's family own cousins to mrs transome how poor lady sara's husband went off into jealous madness only a month after their marriage and dragged that sweet blue eyed thing by the hair and how the brilliant fanny having married a country parson became so niggardly that she had gone about almost begging for fresh eggs from the farmers' wives though she had done very well with her six sons as there was a bishop and no end of interest in the family and two of them got appointments in india at present mrs transome did not touch at all on her own time of privation or her troubles with her eldest son or on anything that lay very close to her heart she conversed with esther and acted the part of hostess as she performed her toilet and went on with her embroidery these things were to be done whether one were happy or miserable even the patriarch job if he had been a gentleman of the modern west would have avoided picturesque disorder and poetical laments and the friends who called on him though not less disposed than bildad the shuhite to hint that their unfortunate friend was in the wrong would have sat on chairs and held their hats in their hands the harder problems of our life have changed less than our manners we wrestle with the old sorrows but more decorously esther's inexperience prevented her from divining much about this fine gray haired woman whom she could not help perceiving to stand apart from the family group as if there were some cause of isolation for her both within and without to her young heart there was a peculiar interest in mrs transome an elderly woman whose beauty position and graceful kindness toward herself made deference to her spontaneous was a new figure in esther's experience her quick light movement was always ready to anticipate what mrs transome wanted her bright apprehension and silvery speech were always ready to cap mrs transome's narratives or instructions even about doses and liniments with some lively commentary she must have behaved charmingly for one day when she had tripped across the room to put the screen just in the right place mrs transome said taking her hand my dear you make me wish i had a daughter that was pleasant and so it was to be decked by mrs transome's own hands in a set of turquoise ornaments which became her wonderfully worn with a white cashmere dress which was also insisted on esther never reflected that there was a double intention in these pretty ways toward her with young generosity she was rather preoccupied by the desire to prove that she herself entertained no low triumph in the fact that she had rights prejudicial to this family whose life she was learning and besides through all mrs transome's perfect manners there pierced some undefinable indications of a hidden anxiety much deeper than anything she could feel about this affair of the estate to which she often alluded slightly as a reason for informing esther of something it was impossible to mistake her for a happy woman and young speculation is always stirred by discontent for which there is no obvious cause when we are older we take the uneasy eyes and the bitter lips more as a matter of course but harold transome was more communicative about recent years than his mother was he thought it well that esther should know how the fortune of his family had been drained by law expenses owing to suits mistakenly urged by her family he spoke of his mother's lonely life and pinched circumstances of her lack of comfort in her elder son and of the habit she had consequently acquired of looking at the gloomy side of things he hinted that she had been accustomed to dictate and that as he had left her when he was a boy she had perhaps indulged the dream that he would come back a boy she was still sore on the point of his politics these things could not be helped but so far as he could he wished to make the rest of her life as cheerful as possible esther listened eagerly and took these things to heart the claim to an inheritance the sudden discovery of a right to a fortune held by others was acquiring a very distinct and unexpected meaning for her every day she was getting more clearly into her imagination what it would be to abandon her own past and what she would enter into in exchange for it what it would be to disturb a long possession and how difficult it was to fix a point at which the disturbance might begin so as to be contemplated without pain harold transome's thoughts turned on the same subject but accompanied by a different state of feeling and with more definite resolutions he saw a mode of reconciling all difficulties which looked pleasanter to him the longer he looked at esther when she had been hardly a week in the house he had made up his mind to marry her and it had never entered into that mind that the decision did not rest entirely with his inclination it was not that he thought slightly of esther's demands he saw that she would require considerable attractions to please her and that there were difficulties to be overcome she was clearly a girl who must be wooed but harold did not despair of presenting the requisite attractions and the difficulties gave more interest to the wooing than he could have believed when he had said that he would not marry an englishwoman he had always made a mental reservation in favor of peculiar circumstances and now the peculiar circumstances were come to be deeply in love was a catastrophe not likely to happen to him but he was readily amorous no woman could make him miserable but he was sensitive to the presence of women and was kind to them not with grimaces like a man of mere gallantry but beamingly easily like a man of genuine good nature and each day he was near esther the solution of all difficulties by marriage became a more pleasing prospect though he had to confess to himself that the difficulties did not diminish on a nearer view in spite of the flattering sense that she brightened at his approach harold was not one to fail in a purpose for want of assiduity after an hour or two devoted to business in the morning he went to look for esther and if he did not find her at play with harry and old mr transome or chatting with his mother he went into the drawing room where she was usually either seated with a book on her knee and making a bed for her cheek with one little hand while she looked out of the window or else standing in front of one of the full length family portraits with an air of rumination esther found it impossible to read in these days her life was a book which she seemed herself to be constructing trying to make character clear before her and looking into the ways of destiny the active harold had almost always something definite to propose by way of filling the time if it were fine she must walk out with him and see the grounds and when the snow melted and it was no longer slippery she must get on horseback and learn to ride if they staid indoors she must learn to play at billiards or she must go over the house and see the pictures he had had hung anew or the costumes he had brought from the east or come into his study and look at the map of the estate and hear what if it had remained in his family he had intended to do in every corner of it in order to make the most of its capabilities about a certain time in the morning esther had learned to expect him let every wooer make himself strongly expected he may succeed by dint of being absent but hardly in the first instance one morning harold found her in the drawing room leaning against a console table and looking at the full length portrait of a certain lady betty transome who had lived a century and a half before and had the usual charm of ladies in sir peter lely's style don't move pray he said on entering you look as if you were standing for your own portrait i take that as an insinuation said esther laughing and moving toward her seat on an ottoman near the fire for i notice almost all the portraits are in a conscious affected attitude that fair lady betty looks as if she had been drilled into that posture and had not will enough of her own ever to move again unless she had a little push given to her she brightens up that panel well with her long satin skirt said harold as he followed esther but alive i dare say she would have been less cheerful company one would certainly think that she had just been unpacked from silver paper ah how chivalrous you are said esther as harold kneeling on one knee held her silken netting stirrup for her to put her foot through she had often fancied pleasant scenes in which such homage was rendered to her and the homage was not disagreeable now it was really come but strangely enough a little darting sensation at that moment was accompanied by the vivid remembrance of some one who had never paid the least attention to her foot there had been a slight blush such as often came and went rapidly and she was silent a moment harold naturally believed that it was he himself who was filling the field of vision he would have liked to place himself on the ottoman near esther and behave very much more like a lover but he took a chair opposite to her at a circumspect distance he dared not do otherwise along with esther's playful charm she conveyed an impression of personal pride and high spirit which warned harold's acuteness that in the delicacy of their present position he might easily make a false move and offend her a woman was likely to be credulous about adoration and to find no difficulty in referring it to her intrinsic attractions but esther was too dangerously quick and critical not to discern the least awkwardness that looked like offering her marriage as a convenient compromise for himself beforehand he might have said that such characteristics as hers were not loveable in a woman but as it was he found that the hope of pleasing her had a piquancy quite new to him i wonder said esther breaking the silence in her usual light silvery tones i wonder whether the women who looked in that way ever felt any troubles i see there are two old ones up stairs in the billiard room who have only got fat the expression of their faces is just of the same sort a woman ought never to have any trouble there should always be a man to guard her from it harold transome was masculine and fallible he had incautiously sat down this morning to pay his addresses by talk about nothing in particular and clever experienced man as he was he fell into nonsense but suppose the man himself got into trouble you would wish her to mind about that or suppose added esther suddenly looking up merrily at harold the man himself was troublesome oh you must not strain probabilities in that way the generality of men are perfect take me for example you are a perfect judge of sauces said esther who had her triumphs in letting harold know that she was capable of taking notes that is perfection number one pray go on oh the catalogue is too long i should be tired before i got to your magnificent ruby ring and your gloves always of the right color if you would let me tell you your perfections i should not be tired that is not complimentary it means that the list is short no it means that the list is pleasant to dwell upon pray don't begin said esther with her pretty toss of the head it would be dangerous to our good understanding the person i liked best in the world was one who did nothing but scold me and tell me of my faults when esther began to speak she meant to do no more than make a remote unintelligible allusion feeling it must be owned a naughty will to flirt and be saucy and thwart harold's attempts to be felicitous in compliment but she had no sooner uttered the words than they seemed to her like a confession a deep flush spread itself over her face and neck and the sense that she was blushing went on deepening her color harold felt himself unpleasantly illuminated as to a possibility that had never yet occurred to him his surprise made an uncomfortable pause in which esther had time to feel much vexation you speak in the past tense said harold at last yet i am rather envious of that person i shall never be able to win your regard in the same way is it anyone at treby because in that case i can enquire about your faults oh you know i have always lived among grave people said esther more able to recover herself now she was spoken to before i came home to be with my father i was nothing but a school girl first and then a teacher in different stages of growth people in those circumstances are not usually flattered but there are varieties in fault finding at our paris school the master i liked best was an old man who stormed at me terribly when i read racine but yet showed that he was proud of me esther was getting quite cool again but harold was not entirely satisfied if there was any obstacle in his way he wished to know exactly what it was that must have been a wretched life for you at treby he said a person of your accomplishments i used to be dreadfully discontented said esther much occupied with mistakes she had made in her netting but i was becoming less so i have had time to get rather wise you know i am two and twenty yes said harold rising and walking a few paces backward and forward you are past your majority you are empress of your own fortunes and more besides dear me said esther letting her work fall and leaning back against the cushions i don't think i know very well what to do with my empire well said harold pausing in front of her leaning one arm on the mantelpiece and speaking very gravely i hope that in any case since you appear to have no near relative who understands affairs you will confide in me and trust me with all your intentions as if i had no other personal concern in the matter than a regard for you i hope you believe me capable of acting as the guardian of your interest even where it turns out to be inevitably opposed to my own i am sure you have given me reason to believe it said esther with seriousness putting out her hand to harold she had not been left in ignorance that he had had opportunities twice offered of stifling her claims harold raised the hand to his lips but dared not retain it more than an instant still the sweet reliance in esther's manner made an irresistible temptation to him after standing still a moment or two while she bent over her work he glided to the ottoman and seated himself close by her looking at her busy hands i see you have made mistakes in your work he said bending still nearer for he saw that she was conscious yet not angry nonsense you know nothing about it said esther laughing and crushing up the soft silk under her palms those blunders have a design in them she looked round and saw a handsome face very near her harold was looking as he felt thoroughly enamored of this bright woman who was not at all to his preconceived taste perhaps a touch of hypothetic jealousy now helped to heighten the effect but he mastered all indiscretion and only looked at her as he said i am wondering whether you have any deep wishes and secrets that i can't guess pray don't speak of my wishes said esther quite overmastered by this new and apparently involuntary manifestation in harold i could not possibly tell you one at this moment i think i shall never find them out again oh yes she said abruptly struggling to relieve herself from the oppression of unintelligible feelings i do know one wish distinctly i want to go and see my father he writes me word that all is well with him but still i want to see him you shall be driven there when you like may i go now i mean as soon as it is convenient said esther rising i will give the order immediately if you wish it said harold understanding that the audience was broken up chapter xli he rates me as the merchant does the wares he will not purchase quality not high 'twill lose its color opened to the sun has no aroma and in fine is naught i barter not for such commodities there is no ratio betwixt sands and gems 'tis wicked judgment for the soul can grow as embryos that live and move but blindly burst from the dark emerge regenerate and lead a life of vision and of choice esther did not take the carriage into malthouse lane but left it to wait for her outside the town and when she entered the house she put her finger on her lip to lyddy and ran lightly up stairs she wished to surprise her father by this visit and she succeeded the little minister was just then almost surrounded by a wall of books with merely his head peeping above them being much embarrassed to find a substitute for tables and desks on which to arrange the volumes he kept open for reference he was absorbed in mastering all those painstaking interpretations of the book of daniel which are by this time well gone to the limbo of mistaken criticism and esther as she opened the door softly heard him rehearsing aloud a passage in which he declared with some parenthetic provisoes that he conceived not how a perverse ingenuity could blunt the edge of prophetic explicitness or how an open mind could fail to see in the chronology of the little horn the resplendent lamp of an inspired symbol searching out the germinal growth of an anti christian power you will not like me to interrupt you father said esther slyly ah my beloved child he exclaimed upsetting a pile of books and thus unintentionally making a convenient breach in his wall through which esther could get up to him and kiss him thy appearing is as a joy despaired of i had thought of thee as the blinded think of the daylight which indeed is a thing to rejoice in like all other good though we see it not nigh are you sure you have been as well and comfortable as you said you were in your letters said esther seating herself close in front of her father and laying her hand on his shoulder i wrote truly my dear according to my knowledge at the time but to an old memory like mine the present days are but as a little water poured on the deep it seems now that all has been as usual except my studies which have gone somewhat curiously into prophetic history but i fear you will rebuke me for my negligent apparel said the little man feeling in front of esther's brightness like a bat overtaken by the morning that is lyddy's fault who sits crying over her want of christian assurance instead of brushing your clothes and putting out your clean cravat she is always saying her righteousness is filthy rags and really i don't think that is a very strong expression for it i'm sure it is dusty clothes and furniture nay my dear your playfulness glances too severely on our faithful lyddy doubtless i am myself deficient in that i do not aid her infirm memory by admonition but now tell me aught that you have left untold about yourself your heart has gone out somewhat toward this family the old man and the child whom i had not reckoned of yes father it is more and more difficult to me to see how i can make up my mind to disturb these people at all something should doubtless be devised to lighten the loss and the change to the aged father and mother i would have you in any case seek to temper a vicissitude which is nevertheless a providential arrangement not to be wholly set aside do you think father do you feel assured that a case of inheritance like this of mine is a sort of providential arrangement that makes a command i have so held it said mr lyon solemnly in all my meditations i have so held it for you have to consider my dear that you have been led by a peculiar path and into experience which is not ordinarily the lot of those who are seated in high places and what i have hinted to you already in my letters on this head i shall wish on a future opportunity to enter into more at large esther was uneasily silent on this great question of her lot she saw doubts and difficulties in which it seemed as if her father could not help her there was no illumination for her in this theory of providential arrangement she said suddenly what she had not thought of at all suddenly have you been again to see felix holt father you have not mentioned him in your letters i have been since i last wrote my dear and i took his mother with me who i fear made the time heavy to him with her plaints but afterward i carried her away to the house of a brother minister at loamford and returned to felix and then we had much discourse did you tell him of everything that has happened i mean about me about the transomes assuredly i told him and he listened as one astonished for he had much to hear knowing naught of your birth and that you had any other father than rufus lyon 'tis a narrative i trust i shall not be called on to give to others but i was not without satisfaction in unfolding the truth to this young man who hath wrought himself into my affection strangely i would fain hope for ends that will be a visible good in his less way worn life when mine shall be no longer and you told him how the transomes had come and that i was staying at transome court yes i told these things with some particularity as is my wont concerning what hath imprinted itself on my mind what did felix say truly my dear nothing desirable to recite said mr lyon rubbing his hand over his brow dear father he did say something and you always remember what people say pray tell me i want to know it was a hasty remark and rather escaped him than was consciously framed he said 'then she will marry transome that is what transome means' that was all said esther turning rather pale and biting her lip with the determination that the tears should not start yes we did not go further into that branch of the subject i apprehend there is no warrant for his seeming prognostic and i should not be without disquiet if i thought otherwise for i confess that in your accession to this great position and property i contemplate with hopeful satisfaction your remaining attached to that body of congregational dissent which as i hold hath retained most of pure and primitive discipline your education and peculiar history would thus be seen to have coincided with a long train of events in making this family property a means of honoring and illustrating a purer form of christianity than that which hath unhappily obtained the pre eminence in this land i speak my child as you know always in the hope that you will fully join our communion and this dear wish of my heart nay this urgent prayer would seem to be frustrated by your marriage with a man of whom there is at least no visible indication that he would unite himself to our body if esther had been less agitated she would hardly have helped smiling at the picture her father's words suggested of harold transome joining the church in malthouse yard but she was too seriously preoccupied with what felix had said which hurt her in a two edged fashion that was highly significant first she was very angry with him for daring to say positively whom she would marry and secondly she was angry at the implication that there was from the first a cool deliberate design in harold transome to marry her esther said to herself that she was quite capable of discerning harold transome's disposition and judging of his conduct she felt sure he was generous and open it did not lower him in her opinion that since circumstances had brought them together he evidently admired her was in love with her in short desired to marry her and she thought that she discerned the delicacy which hindered him from being more explicit there is no point on which young women are more easily piqued than this of their sufficiency to judge the men who make love to them and esther's generous nature delighted to believe in generosity all these thoughts were making a tumult in her mind while her father was suggesting the radiance her lot might cast on the cause of congregational dissent she heard what he said and remembered it afterward but she made no reply at present and chose rather to start up in search of a brush an action which would seem to her father quite a usual sequence with her it served the purpose of diverting him from a lengthy subject have you yet spoken with mr transome concerning mrs holt my dear he said as esther was moving about the room i hinted to him that you would best decide how assistance should be tendered to her no father we have not approached the subject mr transome may have forgotten it and for several reasons i would rather not talk of this of money matters to him at present there is money due to me from the lukyns and the pendrells they have paid it said mr lyon opening his desk i have it here ready to deliver to you keep it father and pay mrs holt's rent with it and do anything else that is wanted for her we must consider everything temporary now said esther enveloping her father in a towel and beginning to brush his auburn fringe of hair while he shut his eyes in preparation for this pleasant passivity everything is uncertain what may become of felix what may become of us all oh dear she went on changing suddenly to laughing merriment i am beginning to talk like lyddy i think truly said mr lyon smiling the uncertainty of things is a text rather too wide and obvious for fruitful application and to discourse of it is as one may say to bottle up the air and make a present of it to those who are already standing out of doors do you think said esther in the course of their chat that the treby people know at all about the reasons of my being at transome court i have had no sign thereof and indeed there is no one as it appears who could make the story public the man christian is away in london with mr debarry parliament now beginning and mr jermyn would doubtless respect the confidence of the transomes i have not seen him lately i know nothing of his movements and so far as my own speech is concerned and my strict command to lyddy i have withheld the means of information even as to your having returned to transome court in the carriage not wishing to give any occasion to solicitous questioning till time hath somewhat inured me but it hath got abroad that you are there and is the subject of conjectures whereof i imagine the chief is that you are gone as companion to mistress transome for some of our friends have already hinted a rebuke to me that i should permit your taking a position so little likely to further your spiritual welfare now father i think i shall be obliged to run away from you not to keep the carriage too long said esther as she finished her reforms on the minister's toilet you look beautiful now and i must give lyddy a little lecture before i go yes my dear i would not detain you seeing that my duties demand me but take with you this treatise which i have purposely selected it concerns all the main questions between ourselves and the establishment government discipline state support it is seasonable that you should give a nearer attention to these polemics lest you be drawn aside by the fallacious association of a state church with elevated rank esther chose to take the volume submissively rather than to adopt the ungraceful sincerity of saying that she was unable at present to give her mind to the original functions of a bishop or the comparative merit of endowments and voluntaryism but she did not run her eyes over the pages during her solitary drive to get a foretaste of the argument for she was entirely occupied with felix holt's prophecy that she would marry harold transome chapter xlii thou sayst it and not i for thou hast done the ugly deed that made these ugly words sophocles electra yea it becomes a man to cherish memory where he had delight for kindness is the natural birth of kindness whose soul records not the great debt of joy is stamped for ever an ignoble man sophocles ajax it so happened that on the morning of the day when esther went to see her father jermyn had not yet heard of her presence at transome court one fact conducing to keep him in this ignorance was that some days after his critical interview with harold days during which he had been wondering how long it would be before harold made up his mind to sacrifice the luxury of satisfied anger for the solid advantage of securing fortune and position he was peremptorily called away by business to the south of england and was obliged to inform harold by letter of his absence he took care also to notify his return but harold made no sign in reply the days passed without bringing him any gossip concerning esther's visit for such gossip was almost confined to mr lyon's congregation her church pupils miss louisa jermyn among them having been satisfied by her father's written statement that she was gone on a visit of uncertain duration but on this day of esther's call in malthouse yard the miss jermyns in their walk saw her getting into the transomes' carriage which they had previously observed to be waiting and which they now saw bowled along on the road toward little treby it followed that only a few hours later the news reached the astonished ears of matthew jermyn entirely ignorant of those converging indications and small links of incident which had raised christian's conjectures and had gradually contributed to put him in possession of the facts ignorant too of some busy motives in the mind of his obliged servant johnson jermyn was not likely to see at once how the momentous information that esther was the surviving bycliffe could possibly have reached harold his daughters naturally leaped as others had done to the conclusion that the transomes seeking a governess for little harry had had their choice directed to esther and observed that they must have attracted her by a high salary to induce her to take charge of such a small pupil though of course it was important that his english and french should be carefully attended to from the first jermyn hearing this suggestion was not without a momentary hope that it might be true and that harold was still safely unconscious of having under the same roof with him the legal claimant of the family estate but a mind in the grasp of a terrible anxiety is not credulous of easy solutions the one stay that bears up our hopes is sure to appear frail and if looked at long will seem to totter too much depended on that unconsciousness of harold's and although jermyn did not see the course of things that could have disclosed and combined the various items of knowledge which he had imagined to be his own secret and therefore his safeguard he saw quite clearly what was likely to be the result of the disclosure not only would harold transome be no longer afraid of him but also by marrying esther and jermyn at once felt sure of this issue would be triumphantly freed from any unpleasant consequences and could pursue much at his ease the gratification of ruining matthew jermyn the prevision of an enemy's triumphant ease is in any case sufficiently irritating to hatred and there were reasons why it was peculiarly exasperating here but jermyn had not the leisure now for mere fruitless emotion he had to think of a possible device which might save him from imminent ruin not an indefinite adversity but a ruin in detail which his thoughts painted out with the sharpest ugliest intensity a man of sixty with an unsuspicious wife and daughters capable of shrieking and fainting at a sudden revelation and of looking at him reproachfully in their daily misery under a shabby lot to which he had reduced them with a mind and with habits dried hard by the years with no glimpse of an endurable standing ground except where he could domineer and be prosperous according to the ambitions of pushing middle class gentility such a man is likely to find the prospect of worldly ruin ghastly enough to drive him to the most uninviting means of escape he will probably prefer any private scorn that will save him from public infamy or that will leave him with money in his pocket to the humiliation and hardship of new servitude in old age a shabby hat and a melancholy hearth where the firing must be used charily and the women look sad but though a man may be willing to escape through a sewer a sewer with an outlet into the dry air is not always at hand running away especially when spoken of as absconding seems at a distance to offer a good modern substitute for the right of sanctuary but seen closely it is often found inconvenient and scarcely possible jermyn on thoroughly considering his position saw that he had no very agreeable resources at command but he soon made up his mind what he would do next he wrote to mrs transome requesting her to appoint an hour in which he could see her privately he knew she would understand that it was to be an hour when harold was not at home as he sealed the letter he indulged a faint hope that in this interview he might be assured of esther's birth being unknown at transome court but in the worst case perhaps some help might be found in mrs transome to such uses may tender relations come when they have ceased to be tender the hazaels of our world who are pushed on quickly against their preconceived confidence in themselves to do doglike actions by the sudden suggestion of a wicked ambition are much fewer than those who are led on through the years by the gradual demands of a selfishness which has spread its fibres far and wide through the intricate vanities and sordid cares of an everyday existence in consequence of that letter to mrs transome jermyn was two days afterward ushered into the smaller drawing room at transome court it was a charming little room in its refurbished condition it had two pretty inlaid cabinets great china vases with contents that sent forth odors of paradise groups of flowers in oval frames on the walls and mrs transome's own portrait in the evening costume of with a garden in the background that brilliant young woman looked smilingly down on mr jermyn as he passed in front of the fire and at present hers was the only gaze in the room he could not help meeting the gaze as he waited holding his hat behind him could not help seeing many memories lit up by it but the strong bent of his mind was to go on arguing each memory into a claim and to see in the regard others had for him a merit of his own there had been plenty of roads open to him when he was a young man perhaps if he had not allowed himself to be determined chiefly of course by the feelings of others for of what effect would his own feelings have been without them into the road he actually took he might have done better for himself at any rate he was likely at last to get the worst of it and it was he who had most reason to complain the fortunate jason as we know from euripides piously thanked the goddess and saw clearly that he was not at all obliged to medea jermyn was perhaps not aware of the precedent but thought out his own freedom from obligation and the indebtedness of others toward him with a native faculty not inferior to jason's before three minutes had passed however as if by some sorcery the brilliant smiling young woman above the mantelpiece seemed to be appearing at the doorway withered and frosted by many winters and with lips and eyes from which the smile had departed jermyn advanced and they shook hands but neither of them said anything by way of greeting mrs transome seated herself and pointed to a chair opposite and near her harold has gone to loamford she said in a subdued tone you had something particular to say to me yes said jermyn with his soft and deferential air the last time i was here i could not take the opportunity of speaking to you but i am anxious to know whether you are aware of what has passed between me and harold yes he has told me everything about his proceedings against me and the reason he stopped them yes have you had notice that he has begun them again no said jermyn with a very unpleasant sensation of course he will now said mrs transome there is no reason in his mind why he should not has he resolved to risk the estate then he feels in no danger on that score and if there were the danger doesn't depend on you the most likely thing is that he will marry this girl he knows everything then said jermyn the expression of his face getting clouded everything it's of no use for you to think of mastering him you can't do it i used to wish harold to be fortunate and he is fortunate said mrs transome with intense bitterness it's not my star that he inherits do you know how he came by the information about this girl no but she knew it all before we spoke to her it's no secret jermyn was confounded by this hopeless frustration to which he had no key though he thought of christian the thought shed no light but the more fatal point was clear he held no secret that could help him you are aware that these chancery proceedings may ruin me he told me they would but if you are imagining i can do anything pray dismiss the notion i have told him as plainly as i dare that i wish him to drop all public quarrel with you and that you could make an arrangement without scandal i can do no more he will not listen to me he doesn't mind about my feelings he cares more for mr transome than he does for me he will not listen to me any more than if i were an old ballad singer it's very hard on me i know said jermyn in the tone with which a man flings out a reproach i besought you three months ago to bear anything rather than quarrel with him i have not quarrelled with him it is he who has been always seeking a quarrel with me i have borne a great deal more than any one else would he set his teeth against me from the first he saw things that annoyed him and men are not like women said mrs transome there was bitter innuendo in that truism it's very hard on me i know that said jermyn with an intensification of his previous tone rising and walking a step or two then turning and laying his hand on the back of the chair of course the law in this case can't in the least represent the justice of the matter i made a good many sacrifices in times past i gave up a great deal of fine business for the sake of attending to the family affairs and in that lawsuit they would have gone to rack and ruin if it hadn't been for me he moved away again laid down his hat which he had been previously holding and thrust his hands into his pockets as he returned mrs transome sat motionless as marble and almost as pale her hands lay crossed on her knees this man young slim and graceful with a selfishness which then took the form of homage to her had at one time kneeled to her and kissed those hands fervently and she had thought there was a poetry in such passion beyond any to be found in everyday domesticity i stretched my conscience a good deal in that affair of bycliffe as you know perfectly well i told you everything at the time i told you i was very uneasy about those witnesses and about getting him thrown into prison i know it's the blackest thing anybody could charge me with if they knew my life from beginning to end and i should never have done it if i had not been under an infatuation such as makes a man do anything what did it signify to me about the loss of the lawsuit i was a young bachelor i had the world before me yes said mrs transome in a low tone it was a pity you didn't make another choice what would have become of you said jermyn carried along a climax like other self justifiers i had to think of you you would not have liked me to make another choice then clearly said mrs transome with concentrated bitterness but still quietly the greater mistake was mine egoism is usually stupid in a dialogue but jermyn's did not make him so stupid that he did not feel the edge of mrs transome's words they increased his irritation i hardly see that he replied with a slight laugh of scorn you had an estate and a position to save to go no farther i remember very well what you said to me 'a clever lawyer can do anything if he has the will if it's impossible he will make it possible and the property is sure to be harold's some day' he was a baby then i remember most things a little too well you had better say at once what is your object in recalling them an object that is nothing more than justice with the relation i stood in it was not likely i should think myself bound by all the forms that are made to bind strangers i had often immense trouble to raise the money necessary to pay off debts and carry on the affairs and as i said before i had given up other lines of advancement which would have been open to me if i had not stayed in this neighborhood at a critical time when i was fresh to the world anybody who knew the whole circumstances would say that my being hunted and run down on the score of my past transactions with regard to the family affairs is an abominably unjust and unnatural thing jermyn paused a moment and then added at my time of life and with a family about me and after what has passed i should have thought there was nothing you would care more to prevent i do care it makes me miserable that is the extent of my power to feel miserable no it is not the extent of your power you could save me if you would it is not to be supposed that harold would go on against me if he knew the whole truth jermyn had sat down before he uttered the last words he had lowered his voice slightly he had the air of one who thought that he had prepared the way for an understanding that a man with so much sharpness with so much suavity at command a man who piqued himself on his persuasiveness toward women should behave just as jermyn did on this occasion would be surprising but for the constant experience that temper and selfish insensibility will defeat excellent gifts will make a sensible person shout when shouting is out of place and will make a polished man rude when his polish might be of eminent use to him as jermyn sitting down and leaning forward with an elbow on his knee uttered his last words if he knew the whole truth a slight shock seemed to pass through mrs transome's hitherto motionless body followed by a sudden light in her eyes as in an animal's about to spring and you expect me to tell him she said not loudly but yet with a clear metallic ring in her voice would it not be right for him to know said jermyn in a more bland and persuasive tone than he had yet used perhaps some of the most terrible irony of the human lot is this of a deep truth coming to be uttered by lips that have no right to it i will never tell him said mrs transome starting up her whole frame thrilled with a passion that seemed almost to make her young again her hands hung beside her clenched tightly her eyes and lips lost the helpless repressed bitterness of discontent and seemed suddenly fed with energy you reckon up your sacrifices for me you have kept a good account of them and it is needful they are some of them what no one else could guess or find out but you made your sacrifices when they seemed pleasant to you when you told me they were your happiness when you told me that it was i who stooped and i who bestowed favors jermyn rose too and laid his hand on the back of the chair he had grown visibly paler but seemed about to speak don't speak mrs transome said peremptorily don't open your lips again you have said enough i will speak now i have made sacrifices too but it was when i knew that they were not my happiness it was after i saw that i had stooped after i saw that your tenderness had turned into calculation after i saw that you cared for yourself only and not for me i heard your explanations of your duty in life of our mutual reputation of a virtuous young lady attached to you i bore it i let everything go i shut my eyes i might almost have let myself starve rather than have scenes of quarrel with the man i had loved in which i must accuse him of turning my love into a good bargain there was a slight tremor in mrs transome's voice in the last words and for a moment she paused but when she spoke again it seemed as if the tremor had frozen into a cutting icicle i suppose if a lover picked one's pocket there's no woman would like to own it i don't say i was not afraid of you i was afraid of you and i know now i was right mrs transome said jermyn white to the lips it is needless to say more i withdraw any words that have offended you you can't withdraw them can a man apologize for being a dastard and i have caused you to strain your conscience have i it is i who have sullied your purity i should think the demons have more honor they are not so impudent to one another i would not lose the misery of being a woman now i see what can be the baseness of a man one must be a man first to tell a woman that her love has made her your debtor and then ask her to pay you by breaking the last poor threads between her and her son i do not ask it said jermyn with a certain asperity he was beginning to find this intolerable the mere brute strength of a masculine creature rebelled he felt almost inclined to throttle the voice out of this woman you do ask it it is what you would like i have had a terror on me lest evil should happen to you from the first after harold came home i had a terrible dread it seemed as if murder might come between you i didn't know what i felt the horror of his not knowing the truth i might have been dragged at last by my own feeling by my own memory to tell him all and make him as well as myself miserable to save you again there was a slight tremor as if at the remembrance of womanly tenderness and pity but immediately she launched forth again but now you have asked me i will never tell him be ruined no do something more dastardly to save yourself if i sinned my judgment went beforehand that i should sin for a man like you swiftly upon those last words mrs transome passed out of the room the softly padded door closed behind her making no noise and jermyn found himself alone for a brief space he stood still human beings in moments of passionate reproach and denunciation especially when their anger is on their own account are never so wholly in the right that the person who has to wince cannot possibly protest against some unreasonableness or unfairness in their outburst and if jermyn had been capable of feeling that he had thoroughly merited this infliction he would not have uttered the words that drew it down on him men do not become penitent and learn to abhor themselves by having their backs cut open with the lash rather they learn to abhor the lash what jermyn felt about mrs transome when she disappeared was that she was a furious woman who would not do what he wanted her to do and he was supported as to his justifiableness by the inward repetition of what he had already said to her it was right that harold should know the truth he did not take into account how should he the exasperation and loathing excited by his daring to urge the plea of right a man who had stolen the pyx and got frightened when justice was at his heels might feel the sort of penitence which would induce him to run back in the dark and lay the pyx where the sexton might find it but if in doing so he whispered to the blessed virgin that he was moved by considering the sacredness of all property and the peculiar sacredness of the pyx it is not to be believed that she would like him the better for it indeed one often seems to see why the saints should prefer candles to words especially from penitents whose skin is in danger some salt of generosity would have made jermyn conscious that he had lost the citizenship which authorized him to plead the right still more that his self vindication to mrs transome would be like the exhibition of a brand mark and only show that he was shame proof there is heroism even in the circles of hell for fellow sinners who cling to each other in the fiery whirlwind and never recriminate but these things which are easy to discern when they are painted for us on the large canvas of poetic story become confused and obscure even for well read gentlemen when their affection for themselves is alarmed by pressing details of actual experience if their comparison of instances is active at such times it is chiefly in showing them that their own case has subtle distinctions from all other cases which should free them from unmitigated condemnation and it was in this way with matthew jermyn so many things were more distinctly visible to him and touched him more acutely than the effect of his acts or words on mrs transome's feelings in fact he asked with a touch of something that makes us all akin was it not preposterous this excess of feeling on points which he himself did not find powerfully moving she had treated him most unreasonably it would have been right for her to do what he had not asked but only hinted at in a mild and interrogatory manner but the clearest and most unpleasant result of the interview was that this right thing which he desired so much would certainly not be done for him by mrs transome as he was moving his arm from the chair back and turning to take his hat there was a boisterous noise in the entrance hall the door of the drawing room which had closed without latching was pushed open and old mr transome appeared with a face of feeble delight playing horse to little harry who roared and flogged behind him while moro yapped in a puppy voice at their heels but when mr transome saw jermyn in the room he stood still in the doorway as if he did not know whether entrance was permissible the majority of his thoughts were but ravelled threads of the past the attorney came forward to shake hands with due politeness but the old man said with a bewildered look and in a hesitating way mr jermyn why why where is mrs transome jermyn smiled his way out past the unexpected group and little harry thinking he had an eligible opportunity turned round to give a parting stroke on the stranger's coat tails chapter xliii whichever way my days decline i felt and feel though left alone his being working in mine own the footsteps of his life in mine dear friend far off my lost desire so far so near in woe and weal oh loved the most when most i feel there is a lower and a higher tennyson in memoriam after that morning on which esther found herself reddened and confused by the sense of having made a distant allusion to felix holt she felt it impossible that she should even as she had sometimes intended speak of him explicitly to harold in order to discuss probabilities as to the issue of his trial she was certain she could not do it without betraying emotion and there were very complex reasons in esther's mind why she could not bear that harold should detect her sensibility on this subject it was not only all the fibres of maidenly pride and reserve of a bashfulness undefinably peculiar toward this man who while much older than herself and bearing the stamp of an experience quite hidden from her imagination was taking strongly the aspect of a lover it was not only this exquisite kind of shame which was at work within her there was another sort of susceptibility in esther which her present circumstances tended to encourage though she had come to regard it as not at all lofty but rather as something which condemned her to littleness in comparison with a mind she had learned to venerate she knew quite well that to harold transome felix holt was one of the common people who could come into question in no other than a public light she had a native capability for discerning that the sense of ranks and degrees has its repulsions corresponding to the repulsions dependent on difference of race and color and she remembered her own impressions too well not to foresee that it would come on harold transome as a shock if he suspected there had been any love passages between her and this young man who to him was of course no more than any other intelligent member of the working class to him said esther to herself with a reaction of her newer better pride who has not had the sort of intercourse in which felix holt's cultured nature would have asserted its superiority and in her fluctuations on this matter she found herself mentally protesting that whatever harold might think there was a light in which he was vulgar compared with felix felix had ideas and motives which she did not believe harold could understand more than all there was this test she herself had no sense of inferiority and just subjection when she was with harold transome there were even points in him for which she felt a touch not of anger but of playful scorn whereas with felix she had always a sense of dependence and possible illumination in those large grave candid gray eyes of his love seemed something that belonged to the high enthusiasm of life such as now might be forever shut out from her all the same her vanity winced at the idea that harold should discern what from his point of view would seem like a degradation of her taste and refinement she could not help being gratified by all the manifestations from those around her that she was thought thoroughly fitted for a high position could not help enjoying with more or less keenness a rehearsal of that demeanor amongst luxuries and dignities which had often been a part of her day dreams and the rehearsal included the reception of more and more emphatic attentions from harold and of an effusiveness in his manners which in proportion as it would have been offensive if it had appeared earlier became flattering as the effect of a growing acquaintance and daily contact it comes in so many forms in this life of ours the knowledge that there is something sweetest and noblest of which we despair and the sense of something present that solicits us with an immediate and easy indulgence and there is a pernicious falsity in the pretence that a woman's love lies above the range of such temptations day after day esther had an arm offered her had very beaming looks upon her had opportunities for a great deal of light airy talk in which she knew herself to be charming and had the attractive interest of noticing harold's practical cleverness the masculine ease with which he governed everybody and administered everything about him without the least harshness and with a facile good nature which yet was not weak in the background too there was the ever present consideration that if harold transome wished to marry her and she accepted him the problem of her lot would be more easily solved than in any other way it was difficult by any theory of providence or consideration of results to see a course which she could call duty if something would come and urge itself strongly as pleasure and save her from the effort to find a clue of principle amid the labyrinthine confusions of right and possession the promise could not but seem alluring and yet this life at transome court was not the life of her day dreams there was dullness already in its ease and in the absence of high demand and there was a vague consciousness that the love of this not unfascinating man who hovered about her gave an air of moral mediocrity to all her prospects she would not have been able perhaps to define this impression but somehow or other by this elevation of fortune it seemed that the higher ambition which had begun to spring in her was forever nullified all life seemed cheapened as it might seem to a young student who having believed that to gain a certain degree he must write a thesis in which he would bring his powers to bear with memorable effect suddenly ascertained that no thesis was expected but the sum in english money of twenty seven pounds ten shillings and sixpence after all she was a woman and could not make her own lot as she had once said to felix a woman must choose meaner things because only meaner things are offered to her her lot is made for her by the love she accepts and esther began to think that her lot was being made for her by the love that was surrounding her with the influence of a garden on a summer morning harold on his side was conscious that the interest of his wooing was not standing still he was beginning to think it a conquest in which it would be disappointing to fail even if this fair nymph had no claim to the estate he would have liked and yet he would not have liked that just a slight shadow of doubt as to his success should be removed there was something about esther that he did not altogether understand she was clearly a woman that could be governed she was too charming for him to fear that she would ever be obstinate or interfering yet there was a lightning that shot out of her now and then which seemed the sign of a dangerous judgment as if she inwardly saw something more admirable than harold transome now to be perfectly charming a woman should not see this one fine february day when already the golden and purple crocuses were out on the terrace one of those flattering days which sometimes precede the north east winds of march and make believe that the coming spring will be enjoyable a very striking group of whom esther and harold made a part came out at midday to walk upon the gravel at transome court they did not as usual go toward the pleasure grounds on the eastern side because mr lingon who was one of them was going home and his road lay through the stone gateway into the park uncle lingon who disliked painful confidences and preferred knowing no mischief of anybody had not objected to be let into the important secret about esther and was sure at once that the whole affair instead of being a misfortune was a piece of excellent luck for himself he did not profess to be a judge of women but she seemed to have all the points and to carry herself as well as arabella did which was saying a good deal honest jack lingon's first impressions quickly became traditions which no subsequent evidence could disturb he was fond of his sister and seemed never to be conscious of any change for the worse in her since their early time he considered that man a beast who said anything unpleasant about the persons to whom he was attached it was not that he winked his wide open eyes saw nothing but what his easy disposition inclined him to see harold was a good fellow a clever chap and esther's peculiar fitness for him under all the circumstances was extraordinary it reminded him of something in the classics though he couldn't think exactly what in fact a memory was a nasty uneasy thing esther was always glad when the old rector came with an odd contrariety to her former niceties she liked his rough attire and careless frank speech they were something not point device that seemed to connect the life of transome court with that rougher commoner world where her home had been she and harold were walking a little in advance of the rest of the party who were retarded by various causes old mr transome wrapped in a cloth cloak trimmed with sable and with a soft warm cap also trimmed with fur on his head had a shuffling uncertain walk little harry was dragging a toy vehicle on the seat of which he had insisted on tying moro with a piece of scarlet drapery round him making him look like a barbaric prince in a chariot moro having little imagination objected to this and barked with feeble snappishness as the tyrannous lad ran forward then whirled the chariot round and ran back to gappa then came to a dead stop which overset the chariot that he might watch uncle lingon's water spaniel run for the hurled stick and bring it in his mouth nimrod kept close to his old master's legs glancing with much indifference at this youthful ardor about sticks he had gone through all that and dominic walked by looking on blandly and taking care both of young and old mrs transome was not there illustration esther lyon and harold transome looking back and seeing that they were a good deal in advance of the rest esther and harold paused what do you think about thinning the trees over there said harold pointing with his stick i have a bit of a notion that if they were divided into clumps so as to show the oaks beyond it would be a great improvement it would give an idea of extent that is lost now and there might be some very pretty clumps got out of those mixed trees what do you think i should think it would be an improvement one likes a 'beyond' everywhere but i never heard you express yourself so dubiously said esther looking at him rather archly you generally see things so clearly and are so convinced that i shall begin to feel quite tottering if i find you in uncertainty pray don't begin to be doubtful it is infectious you think me a great deal too sure too confident said harold not at all it is an immense advantage to know your own will when you always mean to have it but suppose i couldn't get it in spite of meaning said harold with a beaming inquiry in his eyes oh then said esther turning her head aside carelessly as if she were considering the distant birch stems you would bear it quite easily as you did your not getting into parliament you would know you could get it another time or get something else as good the fact is said harold moving on a little as if he did not want to be quite overtaken by the others you consider me a fat fatuous self satisfied fellow oh there are degrees said esther with a silvery laugh you have just as much of those qualities as is becoming there are different styles you are perfect in your own but you prefer another style i suspect a more submissive tearful devout worshipper who would offer his incense with more trembling you are quite mistaken said esther still lightly i find i am very wayward when anything is offered to me it seems that i prize it less and don't want to have it here was a very baulking answer but in spite of it harold could not help believing that esther was very far from objecting to the sort of incense he had been offering just then i have often read that that is in human nature she went on yet it takes me by surprise in myself i suppose she added smiling i didn't think of myself as human nature i don't confess to the same waywardness said harold i am very fond of things that i can get and i never longed much for anything out of my reach whatever i feel sure of getting i like all the better i think half those priggish maxims about human nature in the lump are no more to be relied on than universal remedies there are different sorts of human nature some are given to discontent and longing others to securing and enjoying and let me tell you the discontented longing style is unpleasant to live with harold nodded with a meaning smile at esther oh i assure you i have abjured all admiration for it she said smiling up at him in return she was remembering the schooling felix had given her about her byronic heroes and was inwardly adding a third sort of human nature to those varieties which harold had mentioned he naturally supposed that he might take the abjuration to be entirely in his own favor and his face did look very pleasant she could not help liking him although he was certainly too particular about sauces gravies and wines and had a way of virtually measuring the value of everything by the contribution it made to his own pleasure his very good nature was unsympathetic it never came from any thorough understanding or deep respect for what was in the mind of the person he obliged or indulged it was like his kindness to his mother an arrangement of his for the happiness of others which if they were sensible ought to succeed and an inevitable comparison which haunted her showed her the same quality in his political views the utmost enjoyment of his own advantages was the solvent that blended pride in his family and position with the adhesion to changes that were to obliterate tradition and melt down enchased gold heirlooms into plating for the egg spoons of the people it is terrible the keen bright eye of a woman when it has once been turned with admiration on what is severely true but then the severely true rarely comes within its range of vision esther had had an unusual illumination harold did not know how but he discerned enough of the effect to make him more cautious than he had ever been in his life before that caution would have prevented him just then from following up the question as to the style of person esther would think pleasant to live with even if uncle lingon had not joined them as he did to talk about soughing tiles saying presently that he should turn across the grass and get on to the home farm to have a look at the improvements that harold was making with such racing speed but you know lad said the rector as they paused at the expected parting you can't do everything in a hurry the wheat must have time to grow even when you've reformed all us old tories off the face of the ground dash it now the election's over i'm an old tory again you see harold a radical won't do for the county at another election you must be on the look out for a borough where they want a bit of blood i should have liked you uncommonly to stand for the county and a radical of good family squares well enough with a new fashioned tory like young debarry but you see these riots it's been a nasty business i shall have my hair combed at the sessions for a year to come but heyday what dame is this with a small boy not one of my parishioners harold and esther turned and saw an elderly woman advancing with a tiny red haired boy scantily attired as to his jacket which merged into a small sparrow tail a little higher than his waist but muffled as to his throat with a blue woollen comforter esther recognized the pair too well and felt very uncomfortable we are so pitiably in subjection to all sorts of vanity even the very vanities we are practically renouncing and in spite of the almost solemn memories connected with mrs holt esther's first shudder was raised by the idea of what things this woman would say and by the mortification of having felix in any way represented by his mother as mrs holt advanced into closer observation it became more evident that she was attired with a view not to charm the eye but rather to afflict it with all that expression of woe which belongs to very rusty bombazine and the limpest state of false hair still she was not a woman to lose the sense of her own value or become abject in her manners under any circumstances of depression and she had a peculiar sense on the present occasion that she was justly relying on the force of her own character and judgment in independence of anything that mr lyon or the masterful felix would have said if she had thought them worthy to know of her undertaking she courtesied once as if to the entire group now including even the dogs who showed various degrees of curiosity especially as to what kind of game the smaller animal job might prove to be after due investigation and then she proceeded at once toward esther who in spite of her annoyance took her arm from harold's said how do you do mrs holt very kindly and stooped to pat little job yes you know him miss lyon said mrs holt in that tone which implies that the conversation is intended for the edification of the company generally you know the orphin child as felix brought home for me that am his mother to take care of and it's what i've done nobody more so though it's trouble is my reward esther had raised herself again to stand in helpless endurance of whatever might be coming but by this time young harry struck even more than the dogs by the appearance of job tudge had come round dragging his chariot and placed himself close to the pale child whom he exceeded in height and breadth as well as in depth of coloring he looked into job's eyes peeped round at the tail of his jacket and pulled it a little and then taking off the tiny cloth cap observed with much interest the tight red curls which had been hidden underneath it job looked at his inspector with the round blue eyes of astonishment until harry purely by way of experiment took a bon bon from a fantastic wallet which hung over his shoulder and applied the test to job's lips the result was satisfactory to both every one had been watching this small comedy and when job crunched the bon bon while harry looked down at him inquiringly and patted his back there was general laughter except on the part of mrs holt who was shaking her head slowly and slapping the back of her left hand with the painful patience of a tragedian whose part is in abeyance to an ill timed introduction of the humorous i hope job's cough has been better lately said esther in mere uncertainty as to what it would be desirable to say or do i dare say you hope so miss lyon said mrs holt looking at the distant landscape i've no reason to disbelieve but what you wish well to the child and to felix and to me i'm sure nobody has any occasion to wish me otherways my character will bear enquiry and what you as are young don't know others can tell you that was what i said to myself when i made up my mind to come here and see you and ask you to get me the freedom to speak to mr transome i said whatever miss lyon may be now in the way of being lifted up among great people she's our minister's daughter and was not above coming to my house and walking with my son felix though i'll not deny he made that figure on the lord's day that'll perhaps go against him with the judge if anybody thinks well to tell him here mrs holt paused a moment as with a mind arrested by the painful image it had called up esther's face was glowing when harold glanced at her and seeing this he was considerate enough to address mrs holt instead of her you are then the mother of the unfortunate young man who is in prison indeed i am sir said mrs holt feeling that she was now in deep water it's not likely i should claim him if he wasn't my own though it's not by my will nor my advice sir that he ever walked for i gave him none but good but if everybody's son was guided by their mothers the world 'ud be different my son is not worse than many another woman's son and that in treby whatever they may say as haven't got their sons in prison and as to his giving up the doctoring and then stopping his father's medicines i know it's bad that i know but it's me has had to suffer and it's me a king and parliament 'ud consider if they meant to do the right thing and had anybody to make it known to 'em and as for the rioting and killing the constable my son said most plain to me he never meant it and there was his bit of potato pie for dinner getting dry by the fire the whole blessed time as i sat and never knew what was coming on me and it's my opinion as if great people make elections to get themselves into parliament and there's riot and murder to do it they ought to see as the widow and the widow's son doesn't suffer for it i well know my duty and i read my bible and i know in jude where it's been stained with the dried tulip leaves this many a year as you're told not to rail at your betters if they was the devil himself nor will i but this i do say if it's three mr transomes instead of one as is listening to me as there's them ought to go to the king and get him to let off my son felix this speech in its chief points had been deliberately prepared mrs holt had set her face like a flint to make the gentry know their duty as she knew hers her defiant defensive tone was due to the consciousness not only that she was braving a powerful audience but that she was daring to stand on the strong basis of her own judgment in opposition to her son's her proposals had been waived off by mr lyon and felix but she had long had the feminine conviction that if she could get to speak in the right quarter things might be different the daring bit of impromptu about the three mr transomes was immediately suggested by a movement of old mr transome to the foreground in a line with mr lingon and harold his furred and unusual costume appearing to indicate a mysterious dignity which she must hasten to include in her appeal and there were reasons that none could have foreseen which made mrs holt's remonstrance immediately effective while old mr transome stared very much like a waxen image in which the expression is a failure and the rector accustomed to female parishioners and complainants looked on with a smile in his eyes harold said at once with cordial kindness i think you are quite right mrs holt and for my part i am determined to do my best for your son both in the witness box and elsewhere take comfort if it is necessary the king shall be appealed to and rely upon it i shall bear you in mind as felix holt's mother rapid thoughts had convinced harold that in this way he was best commending himself to esther well sir said mrs holt who was not going to pour forth disproportionate thanks i am glad to hear you speak so becoming and if you had been the king himself i should have made free to tell you my opinion for the bible says the king's favor is toward a wise servant and it's reasonable to think he'd make all the more account of them as have never been in service or took wage which i never did and never thought of my son doing and his father left money meaning otherways so as he might have been a doctor on horseback at this very minute instead of being in prison what was he regularly apprenticed to a doctor said mr lingon who had not understood this before sir he was and most clever like his father before him only he turned contrary but as for harming anybody felix never meant to harm anybody but himself and his mother which he certainly did in respect of his clothes and taking to be a low workingman and stopping my living respectable more particular by the pills which had a sale as you may be sure they suited people's insides and what folks can never have boxes enough of to swallow i should think you have a right to sell and there's many and many a text for it as i've opened on without ever thinking for if it's true 'ask and you shall have' i should think it's truer when you're willing to pay for what you have this was a little too much for mr lingon's gravity he exploded and harold could not help following him mrs holt fixed her eyes on the distance and slapped the back of her left hand again it might be that this kind of mirth was the peculiar effect produced by forcible truth on high and worldly people who were neither in the independent nor the general baptist connection i'm sure you must be tired with your long walk and little job too said esther by way of breaking this awkward scene aren't you job she added stooping to caress the child who was timidly shrinking from harry's invitation to him to pull the little chariot harry's view being that job would make a good horse for him to beat and would run faster than gappa it's well you can feel for the orphin child miss lyon said mrs holt choosing an indirect answer rather than to humble herself by confessing fatigue before gentlemen who seemed to be taking her too lightly i didn't believe but what you'd behave pretty as you always did to me though everybody said you held yourself high but i'm sure you never did to felix for you let him sit by you at the free school before all the town and him with never a bit of stock round his neck and it shows you saw that in him worth taking notice of and it is but right if you know my words are true as you should speak for him to the gentlemen i assure you mrs holt said harold coming to the rescue i assure you that enough has been said to make me use my best efforts for your son and now pray go on to the house with the little boy and take some rest dominic show mrs holt the way and ask mrs hickes to make her comfortable and see that somebody takes her back to treby in the buggy i will go back with mrs holt said esther making an effort against herself no pray said harold with that kind of entreaty which is really a decision let mrs holt have time to rest we shall have returned and you can see her before she goes we will say good by for the present mrs holt the poor woman was not sorry to have the prospect of rest and food especially for the orphin child of whom she was tenderly careful like many women who appear to others to have a masculine decisiveness of tone and to themselves to have a masculine force of mind and who come into severe collision with sons arrived at the masterful stage she had the maternal cord vibrating strongly within her toward all tiny children and when she saw dominic pick up job and hoist him on his arm for a little while by way of making acquaintance she regarded him with an approval which she had not thought it possible to extend to a foreigner since dominic was going harry and old mr transome chose to follow uncle lingon shook hands and turned off across the grass and thus esther was left alone with harold but there was a new consciousness between them harold's quick perception was least likely to be slow in seizing indications of anything that might affect his position with regard to esther some time before his jealousy had been awakened to the possibility that before she had known him she had been deeply interested in some one else jealousy of all sorts whether for our fortune or our love is ready at combinations and likely even to outstrip the fact and esther's renewed confusion united with her silence about felix which now first seemed noteworthy and with mrs holt's graphic details as to her walking with him and letting him sit by her before all the town were grounds not merely for a suspicion but for a conclusion in harold's mind the effect of this which he at once regarded as a discovery was rather different from what esther had anticipated it seemed to him that felix was the least formidable person that he could have found as an object of interest antecedent to himself a young workman who had got himself thrown into prison whatever recommendations he might have had for a girl at a romantic age in the dreariness of dissenting society at treby could hardly be considered by harold in the light of a rival esther was too clever and tasteful a woman to make a ballad heroine of herself by bestowing her beauty and her lands on this lowly lover besides harold cherished the belief that at the present time esther was more wisely disposed to bestow these things on another lover in every way eligible but in two directions this discovery had a determining effect on him his curiosity was stirred to know exactly what the relation with felix had been and he was solicitous that his behavior with regard to this young man should be such as to enhance his own merit in esther's eyes at the same time he was not inclined to any euphemisms that would seem to bring felix into the lists with himself naturally when they were left alone it was harold who spoke first i should think there's a good deal of worth in this young fellow this holt notwithstanding the mistakes he has made a little queer and conceited perhaps but that is usually the case with men of his class when they are at all superior to their fellows felix holt is a highly cultivated man he is not at all conceited said esther the different kinds of pride within her were coalescing now she was aware that there had been a betrayal ah said harold not quite liking the tone of this answer this eccentricity is a sort of fanaticism then this giving up being a doctor on horseback as the old woman calls it and taking to let me see watchmaking isn't it if it is eccentricity to be very much better than other men he is certainly eccentric and fanatical too if it is fanatical to renounce all small selfish motives for the sake of a great and unselfish one i never knew what nobleness of character really was before i knew felix holt it seemed to esther as if in the excitement of this moment her own words were bringing her a clearer revelation god bless me said harold in a tone of surprised yet thorough belief and looking in esther's face i wish you had talked to me about this before esther at that moment looked perfectly beautiful with an expression which harold had never hitherto seen all the confusion which had depended on personal feeling had given way before the sense that she had to speak the truth about the man whom she felt to be admirable i think i didn't see the meaning of anything fine i didn't even see the value of my father's character until i had been taught a little by hearing what felix holt said and seeing that his life was like his words harold looked and listened and felt his slight jealousy allayed rather than heightened this is not like love he said to himself with some satisfaction with all due regard to harold transome he was one of those men who are liable to make the greater mistakes about a particular woman's feelings because they pique themselves on a power of interpretation derived from much experience experience is enlightening but with a difference experiments on live animals may go on for a long period and yet the fauna on which they are made may be limited there may be a passion in the mind of a woman which precipitates her not along the path of easy beguilement but into a great leap away from it harold's experience had not taught him this and esther's enthusiasm about felix holt did not seem to him to be dangerous he's quite an apostolic sort of fellow then was the self quieting answer he gave to her last words he didn't look like that but i had only a short interview with him and i was given to understand that he refused to see me in prison i believe he's not very well inclined toward me but you saw a great deal of him i suppose and your testimony to any one is enough for me said harold lowering his voice rather tenderly now i know what your opinion is i shall spare no effort on behalf of such a young man in fact i had come to the same resolution before but your wish would make difficult things easy after that energetic speech of esther's as often happens the tears had just suffused her eyes it was nothing more than might have been expected in a tender hearted woman considering felix holt's circumstances and the tears only made more lovely the look with which she met harold's when he spoke so kindly she felt pleased with him she was open to the fallacious delight of being assured that she had power over him to make him do what she liked and quite forgot the many impressions which had convinced her that harold had a padded yoke ready for the neck of every man woman and child that depended on him after a short silence they were getting near the stone gateway and harold said with an air of intimate consultation what could we do for this young man supposing he were let off i shall send a letter with fifty pounds to the old woman to morrow i ought to have done it before but it really slipped my memory amongst the many things that have occupied me lately but this young man what do you think would be the best thing we could do for him if he gets at large again he should be put in a position where his qualities could be more telling esther was recovering her liveliness a little and was disposed to encourage it for the sake of veiling other feelings about which she felt renewed reticence now that the overpowering influence of her enthusiasm was past she was rather wickedly amused and scornful at harold's misconceptions and ill placed intentions of patronage you are hopelessly in the dark she said with a light laugh and toss of her head what would you offer felix holt a place in the excise you might as well think of offering it to john the baptist felix has chosen his lot he means always to be a poor man means yes said harold slightly piqued but what a man means usually depends on what happens i mean to be a commoner but a peerage might present itself under acceptable circumstances oh there is no sum in proportion to be done there said esther again gaily as you are to a peerage so is not felix holt to any offer of advantage that you could imagine for him you must think him fit for any position the first in the county no i don't said esther shaking her head mischievously i think him too high for it i see you can be ardent in your admiration yes it is my champagne you know i don't like the other kind that would be satisfactory if one were sure of getting your admiration said harold leading her up to the terrace and amongst the crocuses from whence they had a fine view of the park and river they stood still near the east parapet and saw the dash of light on the water and the pencilled shadows of the trees on the grassy lawn would it do as well to admire you instead of being worthy to be admired said harold turning his eyes from that landscape to esther's face it would be a thing to be put up with said esther smiling at him rather roguishly but you are not in that state of self despair well i am conscious of not having those severe virtues that you have been praising that is true you are quite in another genre a woman would not find me a tragic hero oh no she must dress for general comedy such as your mother once described to me where the most thrilling event is the drawing of a handsome check you are a naughty fairy said harold daring to press esther's hand a little more closely to him and drawing her down the eastern steps into the pleasure ground as if he were unwilling to give up the conversation confess that you are disgusted with my want of romance i shall not confess to being disgusted i shall ask you to confess that you are not a romantic figure i am a little too stout for romance yes at least you must find security for not getting stouter and i don't look languishing enough oh yes rather too much so at a fine cigar and i am not in danger of committing suicide no you are a widower harold did not reply immediately to this last thrust of esther's she had uttered it with innocent thoughtlessness from the playful suggestions of the moment but it was a fact that harold's previous married life had entered strongly in her impressions about him the presence of harry made it inevitable harold took this allusion of esther's as an indication that his quality of widower was a point that made against him and after a brief silence he said in an altered more serious tone you don't suppose i hope that any other woman has ever held the place that you could hold in my life esther began to tremble a little as she always did when the love talk between them seemed getting serious she only gave the rather stumbling answer how so harry's mother had been a slave was bought in fact it was impossible for harold to preconceive the effect this had on esther his natural disqualification for judging of a girl's feelings was heightened by the blinding effect of an exclusive object which was to assure her that her own place was peculiar and supreme hitherto esther's acquaintance with oriental love was derived chiefly from byronic poems and this had not sufficed to adjust her mind to a new story where the giaour concerned was giving her his arm she was unable to speak and harold went on though i am close on thirty five i never met with a woman at all like you before there are new eras in one's life that are equivalent to youth are something better than youth i was never an aspirant till i knew you esther was still silent not that i dare to call myself that i am not so confident a personage as you imagine i am necessarily in a painful position for a man who has any feeling here at last harold had stirred the right fibre esther's generosity seized at once the whole meaning implied in that last sentence she had a fine sensibility to the line at which flirtation must cease and she was now pale and shaken with feelings she had not yet defined for herself do not let us speak of difficult things any more now she said with gentle seriousness i am come into a new world of late and have to learn life all over again let us go in i must see poor mrs holt again and my little friend job she paused at the glass door that opened on the terrace and entered there while harold went round to the stables when esther had been up stairs and descended again into the large entrance hall she found its stony capaciousness made lively by human figures extremely unlike the statues since harry insisted on playing with job again mrs holt and her orphan after dining had just been brought to this delightful scene for a game at hide and seek and for exhibiting the climbing powers of the two pet squirrels mrs holt sat on a stool in singular relief against the pedestal of the apollo while dominic and denner otherwise mrs hickes bore her company harry in his bright red and purple flitted about like a great tropic bird after the sparrow tailed job who hid himself with much intelligence behind the scagliola pillars and the pedestals while one of the squirrels perched itself on the head of the tallest statue and the other was already peeping down from among the heavy stuccoed angels on the ceiling near the summit of a pillar mrs holt held on her lap a basket filled with good things for job and seemed much soothed by pleasant company and excellent treatment as esther descending softly and unobserved leaned over the stone banisters and looked at the scene for a minute or two she saw that mrs holt's attention having been directed to the squirrel which had scampered on to the head of the silenus carrying the infant bacchus had been drawn downward to the tiny babe looked at with so much affection by the rather ugly and hairy gentleman of whom she nevertheless spoke with reserve as of one who possibly belonged to the transome family it's most pretty to see its little limbs and the gentleman holding it i should think he was amiable by his look but it was odd he should have his likeness took without any clothes was he transome by name mrs holt suspected that there might be a mild madness in the family denner peering and smiling quietly was about to reply when she was prevented by the appearance of old mr transome who since his walk had been having forty winks on the sofa in the library and now came out to look for harry he had doffed his fur cap and cloak but in lying down to sleep he had thrown over his shoulders a soft oriental scarf which harold had given him and this still hung over his scanty white hair and down to his knees held fast by his wooden looking arms and laxly clasped hands which fell in front of him this singular appearance of an undoubted transome fitted exactly into mrs holt's thought at the moment it lay in the probabilities of things that gentry's intellects should be peculiar since they had not to get their own living the good lord might have economized in their case that common sense which others were so much more in need of and in the shuffling figure before her she saw a descendant of the gentleman who had chosen to be represented without his clothes all the more eccentric where there were the means of buying the best but these oddities said nothing in great folks who were powerful in high quarters all the same and mrs holt rose and courtesied with a proud respect precisely as she would have done if mr transome had looked as wise as lord burleigh i hope i'm in no way taking a liberty sir she began while the old gentleman looked at her with bland feebleness i'm not that woman to sit anywhere out of my own home without inviting and pressing to but i was brought here to wait because the little gentleman wanted to play with the orphin child very glad my good woman sit down sit down said mr transome nodding and smiling between his clauses nice little boy your grandchild indeed sir no said mrs holt continuing to stand quite apart from any awe of mr transome sitting down she felt would be a too great familiarity with her own pathetic importance on this extra and unlooked for occasion it's not me has any grandchild nor ever shall have though most fit but with my only son saying he'll never be married and in prison besides and some saying he'll be transported you may see yourself though a gentleman as there isn't much chance of my having grandchildren of my own and this is old master tudge's grandchild as my own felix took to for pity because he was sickly and clemm'd and i was noways against it being of a tender heart for i'm a widow myself and my son felix though big is fatherless and i know my duty in consequence and it's to be wished sir as others should know it as are more in power and live in great houses and can ride in a carriage where they will and if you're the gentleman as is the head of everything and it's not to be thought you'd give up to your son as a poor widow's been forced to do it behooves you to take the part of them as are deserving for the bible says gray hairs should speak yes yes poor woman what shall i say said old mr transome feeling himself scolded and as usual desirous of mollifying displeasure sir i can tell you what to say fast enough for it's what i should say myself if i could get to speak to the king for i've asked them that know and they say it's the truth both out of the bible and in as the king can pardon anything and anybody and judging by his countenance on the new signs and the talk there was a while ago about his being the people's friend as the minister once said it from the very pulpit if there's any meaning in words he'll do the right thing by me and my son if he's asked proper yes a very good man he'll do anything right said mr transome whose own ideas about the king just then were somewhat misty consisting chiefly in broken reminiscences of george iii i'll ask him anything you like he added with a pressing desire to satisfy mrs holt who alarmed him slightly then sir if you'll go in your carriage and say this young man felix holt by name as his father was known the country round and his mother most respectable he never meant harm to anybody and so far from bloody murder and fighting would part with his victual to them that needed it more and if you'd get other gentlemen to say the same and if they're not satisfied to enquire i'll not believe but what the king 'ud let my son out of prison or if it's true he must stand his trial the king 'ud take care no mischief happened to him i've got my senses and i'll never believe as in a country where there's a god above and a king below the right thing can't be done if great people was willing to do it mrs holt like all orators had waxed louder and more energetic ceasing to propel her arguments and being propelled by them poor old mr transome getting more and more frightened at this severe spoken woman who had the horrible possibility to his mind of being a novelty that was to become permanent seemed to be fascinated by fear and stood helplessly forgetful that if he liked he might turn round and walk away little harry alive to anything that had relation to gappa had paused in his game and discerning what he thought a hostile aspect in this naughty black old woman rushed toward her and proceeded first to beat her with his mimic jockey's whip and then suspecting that her bombazine was not sensitive to set his teeth in her arm while dominic rebuked him and pulled him off nimrod began to bark anxiously and the scene was become alarming even to the squirrels which scrambled as far off as possible esther who had been waiting for an opportunity of intervention now came up to mrs holt to speak some soothing words and old mr transome seeing a sufficient screen between himself and his formidable suppliant at last gathered courage to turn round and shuffle away with unusual swiftness into the library dear mrs holt said esther do rest comforted i assure you you have done the utmost that can be done by your words your visit has not been thrown away see how the children have enjoyed it i saw little job actually laughing i think i never saw him do more than smile before then turning round to dominic she said will the buggy come round to this door this hint was sufficient dominic went to see if the vehicle was ready and denner remarking that mrs holt would like to mount it in the inner court invited her to go back into the housekeeper's room but there was a fresh resistance raised in harry by the threatened departure of job who had seemed an invaluable addition to the menagerie of tamed creatures and it was barely in time that esther had the relief of seeing the entrance hall cleared so as to prevent any further encounter of mrs holt with harold who was now coming up the flight of steps at the entrance chapter xliv i'm sick at heart the eye of day the insistent summer noon seems pitiless shining in all the barren crevices of weary life leaving no shade no dark where i may dream that hidden waters lie shortly after mrs holt's striking presentation of herself at transome court esther went on a second visit to her father the loamford assizes were approaching it was expected that in about ten days felix holt's trial would come on and some hints in her father's letters had given esther the impression that he was taking a melancholy view of the result harold transome had once or twice mentioned the subject with a facile hopefulness as to the young fellow's coming off easily which in her anxious mind was not a counterpoise to disquieting suggestions and she had not chosen to introduce another conversation about felix holt by questioning harold concerning the probabilities he relied on since those moments on the terrace harold had daily become more of the solicitous and indirectly beseeching lover and esther from the very fact that she was weighed on by thoughts that were painfully bewildering to her by thoughts which in their newness to her young mind seemed to shake her belief that life could be anything else than a compromise with things repugnant to the moral taste had become more passive to his attentions at the very time that she had begun to feel more profoundly that in accepting harold transome she left the high mountain air the passionate serenity of perfect love forever behind her and must adjust her wishes to a life of middling delights overhung with the languorous haziness of motiveless ease where poetry was only literature and the fine ideas had to be taken down from the shelves of the library when her husband's back was turned but it seemed as if all outward conditions concurred along with her generous sympathy for the transomes and with those native tendencies against which she had once begun to struggle to make this middling lot the best she could attain to she was in this half sad half satisfied resignation to something like what is called worldly wisdom when she went to see her father and learn what she could from him about felix the little minister was much depressed unable to resign himself to the dread which had begun to haunt him that felix might have to endure the odious penalty of transportation for the manslaughter which was the offence that no evidence in his favor could disprove i had been encouraged by the assurances of men instructed in this regard said mr lyon while esther sat on the stool near him and listened anxiously that though he were pronounced guilty in regard to this deed whereunto he hath calamitously fallen yet that a judge mildly disposed and with a due sense of that invisible activity of the soul whereby the deeds which are the same in outward appearance and effect yet differ as the knife stroke of the surgeon even though it kill differs from the knife stroke of a wanton mutilater might use his discretion in tempering the punishment so that it would not be very evil to bear but now it is said that the judge who cometh is a severe man and one nourishing a prejudice against the bolder spirits who stand not in the old paths i am going to be present at the trial father said esther who was preparing the way to express a wish which she was timid about even with her father i mentioned to mrs transome that i should like to do so and she said that she used in old days always to attend the assizes and that she would take me you will be there father assuredly i shall be there having been summoned to bear witness to felix's character and to his having uttered remonstrances and warnings long beforehand whereby he proved himself an enemy to riot in our ears who know him it sounds strangely that aught else should be credible but he hath few to speak for him though i trust that mr harold transome's testimony will go far if as you say he is disposed to set aside minor regards and not to speak the truth grudgingly and reluctantly for the very truth hath a color from the disposition of the utterer he is kind he is capable of being generous said esther it is well for i verily believe that evil minded men have been at work against felix the duffield watchman hath written continually in allusion to him as one of those mischievous men who seek to elevate themselves through the dishonor of their party and as one of those who go not heart and soul with the needs of the people but seek only to get a hearing for themselves by raising their voices in crotchety discord it is these things that cause me heaviness of spirit the dark secret of this young man's lot is a cross i carry daily father said esther timidly while the eyes of both were filling with tears i should like to see him again before his trial might i will you ask him will you take me the minister raised his suffused eyes to hers and did not speak for a moment or two a new thought had visited him but his delicate tenderness shrank even from an inward enquiry that was too curious that seemed like an effort to peep at sacred secrets i see naught against it my dear child if you arrived early enough and would take the elderly lady into your confidence so that you might descend from the carriage at some suitable place the house of the independent minister for example where i could meet and accompany you i would forewarn felix who would doubtless delight to see your face again seeing that he may go away and be as it were buried from you even though it may be only in prison and not this was too much for esther she threw her arms round her father's neck and sobbed like a child it was an unspeakable relief to her after all the pent up stifling experience all the inward incommunicable debate of the last few weeks the old man was deeply moved too and held his arm close round the dear child praying silently no word was spoken for some minutes till esther raised herself dried her eyes and with an action that seemed playful though there was no smile on her face pressed her handkerchief against her father's cheeks then when she had put her hand in his he said solemnly 'tis a great and mysterious gift this clinging of the heart my esther whereby it hath often seemed to me that even in the very moment of suffering our souls have the keenest foretaste of heaven i speak not lightly but as one who hath endured and 'tis a strange truth that only in the agony of parting we look into the depths of love so the interview ended without any question from mr lyon concerning what esther contemplated as the ultimate arrangement between herself and the transomes after this conversation which showed him that what happened to felix touched esther more closely than he had supposed the minister felt no impulse to raise the images of a future so unlike anything that felix would share and esther would have been unable to answer any such questions the successive weeks instead of bringing her nearer to clearness and decision had only brought that state of disenchantment belonging to the actual presence of things which have long dwelt in the imagination with all the factitious charms of arbitrary arrangement her imaginary mansion had not been inhabited just as transome court was her imaginary fortune had not been attended with circumstances which she was unable to sweep away she herself in her utopia had never been what she was now a woman whose heart was divided and oppressed the first spontaneous offering of her woman's devotion the first great inspiration of her life was a sort of vanished ecstasy which had left its wounds it seemed to her a cruel misfortune of her young life that her best feeling her most precious dependence had been called forth just where the conditions were hardest and that all the easy invitations of circumstance were toward something which that previous consecration of her longing had made a moral descent for her it was characteristic of her that she scarcely at all entertained the alternative of such a compromise as would have given her the larger portion of the fortune to which she had a legal claim and yet have satisfied her sympathy by leaving the transomes in possession of their old home her domestication with this family had brought them into the foreground of her imagination the gradual wooing of harold had acted on her with a constant immediate influence that predominated over all indefinite prospects and a solitary elevation to wealth which out of utopia she had no notion how she should manage looked as chill and dreary as the offer of dignities in an unknown country in the ages since adam's marriage it has been good for some men to be alone and for some women also but esther was not one of these women she was intensely of the feminine type verging neither toward the saint nor the angel she was a fair divided excellence whose fullness of perfection must be in marriage and like all youthful creatures she felt as if the present conditions of choice were final it belonged to the freshness of her heart that having had her emotions strongly stirred by real objects she never speculated on possible relations yet to come it seemed to her that she stood at the first and last parting of the ways and in one sense she was under no illusion it is only in that freshness of our time that the choice is possible which gives unity to life and makes the memory a temple where all relics and all votive offerings all worship and all grateful joy are an unbroken history sanctified by one religion chapter xlv we may not make this world a paradise by walking it together with clasped hands and eyes that meeting feed a double strength we must be only joined by pains divine of spirits blent in mutual memories it was a consequence of that interview with her father that when esther stepped early on a gray march morning into the carriage with mrs transome to go to the loamford assizes she was full of an expectation that held her lips in trembling silence and gave her eyes that sightless beauty which tells that the vision is all within mrs transome did not disturb her with unnecessary speech of late esther's anxious observation had been drawn to a change in mrs transome shown in many small ways which only women notice it was not only that when they sat together the talk seemed more of an effort to her that might have come from the gradual draining away of matter for discourse pertaining to most sorts of companionship in which repetition is not felt to be as desirable as novelty but while mrs transome was dressed just as usual took her seat as usual trifled with her drugs and had her embroidery before her as usual and still made her morning greetings with that finished easy politeness and consideration of tone which to rougher people seems like affectation esther noticed a strange fitfulness in her movements sometimes the stitches of her embroidery went on with silent unbroken swiftness for a quarter of an hour as if she had to work out her deliverance from bondage by finishing a scroll patterned border then her hands dropped suddenly and her gaze fell blankly on the table before her and she would sit in that way motionless as a seated statue apparently unconscious of esther's presence till some thought darting within her seemed to have the effect of an external shock and rouse her with a start when she looked around hastily like a person ashamed of having slept esther touched with wondering pity at signs of unhappiness that were new in her experience took the most delicate care to appear inobservant and only tried to increase the gentle attention that might help to soothe or gratify this uneasy woman but one morning mrs transome had said breaking a rather long silence my dear i shall make this house dull for you you sit with me like an embodied patience i am unendurable i am getting into a melancholy dotage a fidgety old woman like me is as unpleasant to see as a rook with its wing broken don't mind me my dear run away from me without ceremony every one else does you see i am part of the old furniture with new drapery dear mrs transome said esther gliding to the low ottoman close by the basket of embroidery do you dislike my sitting with you only for your own sake my fairy said mrs transome smiling faintly and putting her hand under esther's chin doesn't it make you shudder to look at me why will you say such naughty things said esther affectionately if you had had a daughter she would have desired to be with you most when you most wanted cheering and surely every young woman has something of a daughter's feeling toward an older one who has been kind to her i should like you to be really my daughter said mrs transome rousing herself to look a little brighter that is something still for an old woman to hope for esther blushed she had not foreseen this application of words that came from pitying tenderness to divert the train of thought as quickly as possible she at once asked what she had previously had in her mind to ask before her blush had disappeared she said oh you are so good i shall ask you to indulge me very much it is to let us set out very early to loamford on wednesday and put me down at a particular house that i may keep an appointment with my father it is a private matter that i wish no one to know about if possible and he will bring me back to you wherever you appoint in that way esther won her end without needing to betray it and as harold was already away at loamford she was the more secure the independent minister's house at which she was set down and where she was received by her father was in a quiet street not far from the jail esther had thrown a dark cloak over the handsomer coverings which denner had assured her were absolutely required of ladies who sat anywhere near the judge at a great trial and as the bonnet of that day did not throw the face into high relief but rather into perspective a veil drawn down gave her a sufficiently inconspicuous appearance i have arranged all things my dear said mr lyon and felix expects us we will lose no time they walked away at once esther not asking a question she had no consciousness of the road along which they passed she could never remember anything but a dim sense of entering within high walls and going along passages till they were ushered into a larger space than she had expected and her father said it is here that we are permitted to see felix my esther he will presently appear esther automatically took off her gloves and bonnet as if she had entered the house after a walk she had lost the complete consciousness of everything except that she was going to see felix she trembled it seemed to her as if he too would look altered after her new life as if even the past would change for her and be no longer a steadfast remembrance but something she had been mistaken about as she had been about the new life perhaps she was growing out of that childhood to which common things have rareness and all objects look larger perhaps from henceforth the whole world was to be meaner for her the dread concentrated in those few moments seemed worse than anything she had known before it was what the dread of the pilgrim might be who has it whispered to him that the holy places are a delusion or that he will see them with a soul unstirred and unbelieving every minute that passes may be charged with some such crisis in the little inner world of man or woman but soon the door opened slightly someone looked in then it opened wide and felix holt entered miss lyon esther and her hand was in his grasp he was just the same no something inexpressibly better because of the distance and separation and the half weary novelties which made him like the return of the morning take no heed of me children said mr lyon i have some notes to make and my time is precious we may remain here only a quarter of an hour and the old man sat down at a window with his back to them writing with his head bent close to the paper you are very pale you look ill compared with your old self said esther she had taken her hand away but they stood still near each other she looking up at him the fact is i'm not fond of prison said felix smiling but i suppose the best i can hope for is to have a good deal more of it it is thought that in the worst case a pardon may be obtained said esther avoiding harold transome's name i don't rely on that said felix shaking his head my wisest course is to make up my mind to the very ugliest penalty they can condemn me to if i can face that anything less will seem easy but you know he went on smiling at her brightly i never went in for fine company and cushions i can't be very heavily disappointed in that way do you see things just as you used to do said esther turning pale as she said it i mean about poverty and the people you will live among has all the misunderstanding and sadness left you just as obstinate she tried to smile but could not succeed what about the sort of life i should lead if i were free again said felix yes i can't help being discouraged for you by all these things that have happened see how you may fail esther spoke timidly she saw a peculiar smile which she knew well gathering in his eyes ah i dare say i am silly she said deprecatingly no you are dreadfully inspired said felix when the wicked tempter is tired of snarling that word failure in a man's cell he sends a voice like a thrush to say it for him see now what a messenger of darkness you are he smiled and took her two hands between his pressed together as children hold them up in prayer both of them felt too solemnly to be bashful they looked straight into each other's eyes as angels do when they tell some truth and they stood in that way while he went on speaking but i'm proof against that word failure i've seen behind it the only failure a man ought to fear is failure in cleaving to the purpose he sees to be best as to just the amount of result he may see from his particular work that's a tremendous uncertainty the universe has not been arranged for the gratification of his feelings as long as a man sees and believes in some great good he'll prefer working toward that in the way he's best fit for come what may i put effects at their minimum but i'd rather have the maximum of effect if it's of the sort i care for than the maximum of effect i don't care for a lot of fine things that are not to my taste and if they were the conditions of holding them while the world is what it is are such as would jar on me like grating metal yes said esther in a low tone i think i understand that now better than i used to do the words of felix at last seemed strangely to fit her own experience but she said no more though he seemed to wait for it a moment or two looking at her but then he went on i don't mean to be illustrious you know and make a new era else it would be kind of you to get a raven and teach it to croak 'failure' in my ears where great things can't happen i care for very small things such as will never be known beyond a few garrets and workshops and then as to one thing i believe in i don't think i can altogether fail if there's anything our people want convincing of it is that there's some dignity and happiness for a man other than changing his station that's one of the beliefs i choose to consecrate my life to if anybody could demonstrate to me that i was a flat for it i shouldn't think it would follow that i must borrow money to set up genteelly and order new clothes that's not a rigorous consequence to my understanding they smiled at each other with the old sense of amusement they had so often had together you are just the same said esther and you said felix my affairs have been settled long ago but yours a great change has come in them magic at work yes said esther rather falteringly well said felix looking at her gravely again it's a case of fitness that seems to give a chance sanction to that musty law the first time i saw you your birth was an immense puzzle to me however the appropriate conditions are come at last these words seemed cruel to esther but felix could not know all the reasons for their seeming so she could not speak she was turning cold and feeling her heart beat painfully all your tastes are gratified now he went on innocently but you'll remember the old pedagogue and his lectures one thought in the mind of felix was that esther was sure to marry harold transome men readily believe these things of the women who love them but he could not allude to the marriage more directly he was afraid of this destiny for her without having any very distinct knowledge by which to justify his fear to the mind of another it did not satisfy him that esther should marry harold transome my children said mr lyon at this moment not looking round but only looking close at his watch we have just two minutes more then he went on writing esther did not speak but felix could not help observing now that her hands had turned to a deathly coldness and that she was trembling he believed he knew that whatever prospects she had this feeling was for his sake an overpowering impulse from mingled love gratitude and anxiety urged him to say i had a horrible struggle esther but you see i was right there was a fitting lot in reserve for you but remember you have cost a great price don't throw what is precious away i shall want the news that you have a happiness worthy of you esther felt too miserable for tears to come she looked helplessly at felix for a moment then took her hands from his and turning away mutely walked dreamily toward her father and said father i am ready there is no more to say she turned back again toward the chair where her bonnet lay with a face quite corpse like above her dark garments esther she heard felix say the word with an entreating cry and went toward him with the swift movement of a frightened child toward its protector he clasped her and they kissed each other she never could recall anything else that happened till she was in the carriage again with mrs transome chapter xlvi why there are maidens of heroic touch and yet they seem like things of gossamer you'd pinch the life out of as out of moths oh it is not loud tones and mouthingness 'tis not the arms akimbo and large strides that make a woman's force the tiniest birds with softest downy breasts have passions in them and are brave with love esther was so placed in the court under mrs transome's wing as to see and hear everything without effort harold had received them at the hotel and had observed that esther looked ill and was unusually abstracted in her manner but this seemed to be sufficiently accounted for by her sympathetic anxiety about the result of a trial in which the prisoner at the bar was a friend and in which both her father and himself were important witnesses mrs transome had no reluctance to keep a small secret from her son and no betrayal was made of that previous engagement of esther's with her father harold was particularly delicate and unobtrusive in his attentions to day he had the consciousness that he was going to behave in a way that would gratify esther and win her admiration and we are all of us made more graceful by the inward presence of what we believe to be a generous purpose our actions move to a hidden music a melody that's sweetly played in tune if esther had been less absorbed by supreme feelings she would have been aware that she was an object of special notice in the bare squareness of a public hall where there was not one jutting angle to hang a guess or a thought upon not an image or a bit of color to stir the fancy and where the only objects of speculation of admiration or of any interest whatever were human beings that occupied positions indicating some importance the notice bestowed on esther would not have been surprising even if it had been merely a tribute to her youthful charm which was well championed by mrs transome's elderly majesty but it was due also to whisperings that she was an hereditary claimant of the transome estates whom harold transome was about to marry harold himself had of late not cared to conceal either the fact or the probability they both tended rather to his honor than his dishonor and to day when there was a good proportion of trebians present the whisperings spread rapidly the court was still more crowded than on the previous day when our poor acquaintance dredge and his two collier companions were sentenced to a year's imprisonment with hard labor and the more enlightened prisoner who stole the debarry's plate to transportation for life poor dredge had cried had wished he'd never heared of 'lection and in spite of sermons from the jail chaplain fell back on the explanation that this was a world in which spratt and old nick were sure to get the best of it so that in dredge's case at least most observers must have had the melancholy conviction that there had been no enhancement of public spirit and faith in progress from that wave of political agitation which had reached the sproxton pits but curiosity was necessarily at a higher pitch to day when the character of the prisoner and the circumstances of his offence were of a highly unusual kind soon as felix appeared at the bar a murmur rose and spread into a loud buzz which continued until there had been repeated authoritative calls for silence in the court rather singularly it was now for the first time that esther had a feeling of pride in him on the ground simply of his appearance at this moment when he was the centre of a multitudinous gaze which seemed to act on her own vision like a broad unmitigated daylight she felt that there was something pre eminent in him notwithstanding the vicinity of numerous gentlemen no apple woman would have admired him not only to feminine minds like mrs tiliot's but to many minds in coat and waistcoat there was something dangerous and perhaps unprincipled in his bare throat and great gothic head and his somewhat massive person would doubtless have come out very oddly from the hands of a fashionable tailor of that time but as esther saw his large gray eyes looking round calmly and undefiantly first at the audience generally and then with a more observant expression at the lawyers and other persons immediately around him she felt that he bore the outward stamp of a distinguished nature forgive her if she needed this satisfaction all of us whether men or women are liable to this weakness of liking to have our preference justified before others as well as ourselves esther said inwardly with a certain triumph that felix holt looked as worthy to be chosen in the midst of this large assembly as he had ever looked in their tte tte under the sombre light of the little parlor in malthouse yard esther had felt some relief in hearing from her father that felix had insisted on doing without his mother's presence and since to mrs holt's imagination notwithstanding her general desire to have her character enquired into there was no greatly consolatory difference between being a witness and a criminal and an appearance of any kind before the judge could hardly be made to suggest anything definite that would overcome the dim sense of unalleviated disgrace she had been less inclined than usual to complain of her son's decision esther had shuddered beforehand at the inevitable farce there would be in mrs holt's testimony but surely felix would lose something for want of a witness who could testify to his behavior in the morning before he became involved in the tumult he is really a fine young fellow said harold coming to speak to esther after a colloquy with the prisoner's solicitor i hope he will not make a blunder in defending himself he is not likely to make a blunder said esther she had recovered her color a little and was brighter than she had been all the morning before felix had seemed to include her in his general glance but had avoided looking at her particularly she understood how delicate feeling for her would prevent this and that she might safely look at him and toward her father whom she could see in the same direction turning to harold to make an observation she saw that he was looking toward the same point but with an expression on his face that surprised her dear me she said prompted to speak without any reflection how angry you look i never saw you look so angry before it is not my father you are looking at oh no i am angry at something i'm looking away from said harold making an effort to drive back the troublesome demon who would stare out at window it's that jermyn he added glancing at his mother as well as esther he will thrust himself under my eyes everywhere since i refused him an interview and returned his letter i'm determined never to speak to him directly again if i can help it mrs transome heard with a changeless face she had for some time been watching and had taken on her marble look of immobility she said an inward bitter of course to everything that was unpleasant after this esther soon became impatient of all speech her attention was rivetted on the proceedings of the court and on the mode in which felix bore himself in the case for the prosecution there was nothing more than a reproduction with irrelevancies added by witnesses of the facts already known to us spratt had retained consciousness enough in the midst of his terror to swear that when he was tied to the finger post felix was presiding over the actions of the mob the landlady of the seven stars who was indebted to felix for rescue from pursuit by some drunken rioters gave evidence that went to prove his assumption of leadership prior to the assault on spratt remembering only that he had called away her pursuers to better sport various respectable witnesses swore to felix's encouragement of the rioters who were dragging spratt in king street to his fatal assault on tucker and to his attitude in front of the drawing room window at the manor three other witnesses gave evidence of expressions used by the prisoner tending to show the character of the acts with which he was charged two were treby tradesmen the third was a clerk from duffield the clerk had heard felix speak at duffield the treby men had frequently heard him declare himself on public matters and they all quoted expressions which tended to show that he had a virulent feeling against the respectable shopkeeping class and that nothing was likely to be more congenial to him than the gutting of retailer's shops no one else knew the witnesses themselves did not know fully how far their strong perception and memory on these points was due to a fourth mind namely that of mr john johnson the attorney who was nearly related to one of the treby witnesses and a familiar acquaintance of the duffield clerk man cannot be defined as an evidence giving animal and in the difficulty of getting up evidence on any subject there is room for much unrecognized action of diligent persons who have the extra stimulus of some private motive mr johnson was present in court to day but in a modest retired situation he had come down to give information to mr jermyn and to gather information in other quarters which was well illuminated by the appearance of esther in company with the transomes when the case for the prosecution closed all strangers thought that it looked very black for the prisoner in two instances only felix had chosen to put a cross examining question the first was to ask spratt if he did not believe that his having been tied to the post had saved him from a probably mortal injury the second was to ask the tradesman who swore to his having heard felix tell the rioters to leave tucker alone and come along with him whether he had not shortly before heard cries among the mob summoning to an attack on the wine vaults and brewery esther had hitherto listened closely but calmly she knew that there would be this strong adverse testimony and all her hopes and fears were bent on what was to come beyond it it was when the prisoner was asked what he had to adduce in reply that she felt herself in the grasp of that tremor which does not disable the mind but rather gives keener consciousness of a mind having a penalty of body attached to it there was a silence as of night when felix holt began to speak his voice was firm and clear he spoke with simple gravity and evidently without any enjoyment of the occasion esther had never seen his face look so weary my lord i am not going to occupy the time of the court with unnecessary words i believe the witnesses for the prosecution have spoken the truth as far as a superficial observation would enable them to do it and i see nothing that can weigh with the jury in my favor unless they believe my statement of my own motives and the testimony that certain witnesses will give to my character and purposes as being inconsistent with my willingly abetting disorder i will tell the court in as few words as i can how i got entangled in the mob how i came to attack the constable and how i was led to take a course which seems rather mad to myself now i look back upon it felix then gave a concise narrative of his motives and conduct on the day of the riot from the moment when he was startled into quitting his work by the earlier uproar of the morning he omitted of course his visit to malthouse yard and merely said that he went out to walk again after returning to quiet his mother's mind he got warmed by the story of his experience which moved him more strongly than ever now he recalled it in vibrating words before a large audience of his fellow men the sublime delight of truthful speech to one who has the great gift of uttering it will make itself felt even through the pangs of sorrow that is all i have to say for myself my lord i pleaded 'not guilty' to the charge of manslaughter because i know that word may carry a meaning which would not fairly apply to my act when i threw tucker down i did not see the possibility that he would die from a sort of attack which ordinarily occurs in fighting without any fatal effect as to my assaulting a constable it was a quick choice between two evils i should else have been disabled and he attacked me under a mistake about my intentions i'm not prepared to say i never would assault a constable where i had more chance of deliberation i certainly should assault him if i saw him doing anything that made my blood boil i reverence the law but not where it is a pretext for wrong which it should be the very object of law to hinder i consider that i should be making an unworthy defence if i let the court infer from what i say myself or from what is said by my witnesses that because i am a man who hates drunken motiveless disorder or any wanton harm therefore i am a man who would never fight against authority i hold it blasphemy to say that a man ought not to fight against authority there is no great religion and no great freedom that has not done it in the beginning it would be impertinent for me to speak of this now if i did not need to say in my own defence that i should hold myself the worst sort of traitor if i put my hand to either fighting or disorder which must mean to injure somebody if i were not urged to it by what i hold to be sacred feelings making a sacred duty either to my own manhood or to my fellow man and certainly felix ended with a strong ring of scorn in his voice i never held it a sacred duty to try and get a radical candidate returned for north loamshire by willingly heading a drunken howling mob whose public action must consist in breaking windows destroying hard got produce and endangering the lives of men and women i have no more to say my lord i foresaw he would make a blunder said harold in a low voice to esther then seeing her shrink a little he feared she might suspect him of being merely stung by the allusion to himself i don't mean what he said about the radical candidate he added hastily in correction i don't mean the last sentence i mean that whole peroration of his which he ought to have left unsaid it has done him harm with the jury they won't understand it or rather will misunderstand it and i'll answer for it it has soured the judge it remains to be seen what we witnesses can say for him to nullify the effect of what he has said for himself i hope the attorney has done his best in collecting the evidence i understand the expense of the witnesses is undertaken by some liberals at glasgow and in lancashire friends of holt's but i suppose your father has told you the first witness called to the defence was mr lyon the gist of his statements was that from the beginning of september last till the day of the election he was in very frequent intercourse with the prisoner that he had become intimately acquainted with his character and views of life and his conduct with respect to the election and that these were totally inconsistent with any other supposition than his being involved in the riot and his fatal encounter with the constable were due to the calamitous failure of a bold but good purpose he stated further that he had been present when an interview had occurred in his own house between the prisoner and mr harold transome who was then canvassing for the representation of north loamshire that the object of the prisoner in seeking this interview had been to inform mr transome of treating given in his name to the workmen in the pits and on the canal at sproxton and to remonstrate against its continuance the prisoner fearing that disturbance and mischief might result from what he believed to be the end toward which this treating was directed namely the presence of these men on the occasions of the nomination and polling several times after this interview mr lyon said he had heard felix holt recur to the subject therein discussed with expressions of grief and anxiety he himself was in the habit of visiting sproxton in his ministerial capacity he knew fully what the prisoner had done there in order to found a night school and was certain that the prisoner's interest in the workingmen of that district turned entirely on the possibility of converting them somewhat to habits of soberness and to a due care for the instruction of their children finally he stated that the prisoner in compliance with his request had been present at duffield on the day of the nomination and had on his return expressed himself with strong indignation concerning the employment of the sproxton men on that occasion and what he called the wickedness of hiring blind violence the quaint appearance and manner of the little dissenting minister could not fail to stimulate the peculiar wit of the bar he was subjected to a troublesome cross examination which he bore with wide eyed short sighted quietude and absorption in the duty of truthful response on being asked rather sneeringly if the prisoner was not one of his flock he answered in that deeper tone which made one of the most effective transitions of his varying voice nay would to god he were i should then feel that the great virtues and the pure life i have beheld in him were a witness to the efficacy of the faith i believe in and the discipline of the church whereunto i belong perhaps it required a larger power of comparison than was possessed by any of that audience to appreciate the moral elevation of an independent minister who could utter those words nevertheless there was a murmur which was clearly one of sympathy the next witness and the one on whom the interest of the spectators was chiefly concentrated was harold transome there was a decided predominance of tory feeling in the court and the human disposition to enjoy the infliction of a little punishment on an opposite party was in this instance of a tory complexion harold was keenly alive to this and to everything else that might prove disagreeable to him in his having to appear in the witness box but he was not likely to lose his self possession or to fail in adjusting himself gracefully under conditions which most men would find it difficult to carry without awkwardness he had generosity and candor enough to bear felix holt's proud rejection of his advances without any petty resentment he had all the susceptibilities of a gentleman and these moral qualities gave the right direction to his acumen in judging of the behavior that would best secure his dignity everything requiring self command was easier to him because of esther's presence for her admiration was just then the object which this well tanned man of the world had it most at heart to secure when he entered the witness box he was much admired by the ladies amongst the audience many of whom sighed a little at the thought of his wrong course in politics he certainly looked like a handsome portrait by sir thomas lawrence in which that remarkable artist had happily omitted the usual excess of honeyed blandness mixed with alert intelligence which is hardly compatible with the state of man out of paradise he stood not far off felix and the two radicals certainly made a striking contrast felix might have come from the hands of a sculptor in the later roman period when the plastic impulse was stirred by the grandeur of barbaric forms when rolled collars were not yet conceived and satin stocks were not harold transome declared he had had only one interview with the prisoner it was the interview referred to by the previous witness in whose presence and in whose house it was begun the interview however was continued beyond the observation of mr lyon the prisoner and himself quitted the dissenting minister's house in malthouse yard together and proceeded to the office of mr jermyn who was then conducting electioneering business on his behalf his object was to comply with holt's remonstrance by enquiring into the alleged proceedings at sproxton and if possible to put a stop to them holt's language both in the malthouse yard and in the attorney's office was strong he was evidently indignant and his indignation turned on the danger of employing ignorant men excited by drink on an occasion of popular concourse he believed that holt's sole motive was the prevention of disorder and what he considered the demoralization of the workmen by treating the event had certainly justified his remonstrances he had not had any subsequent opportunities of observing the prisoner but if any reliance was to be placed on a rational conclusion it must he thought be plain that the anxiety thus manifested by holt was a guarantee of the statement he had made as to his motives on the day of the riot his entire impression from holt's manner in that single interview was that he was a moral and political enthusiast who if he sought to coerce others would seek to coerce them into a difficult and perhaps impracticable scrupulosity harold spoke with as noticeable directness and emphasis as if what he said could have no reaction on himself he had of course not entered unnecessarily into what occurred in jermyn's office but now he was subjected to a cross examination on this subject which gave rise to some subdued shrugs smiles and winks among county gentlemen the questions were directed so as to bring out if possible some indication that felix holt was moved to his remonstrance by personal resentment against the political agents concerned in setting on foot the treating at sproxton but such questioning is a sort of target shooting that sometimes hits about widely the cross examining counsel had close connections among the tories of loamshire and enjoyed his business to day under the fire of various questions about jermyn and the agent employed by him at sproxton harold got warm and in one of his replies said with rapid sharpness mr jermyn was my agent then not now i have no longer any but hostile relations with him the sense that he had shown a slight heat would have vexed harold more if he had not got some satisfaction out of the thought that jermyn heard those words he recovered his good temper quickly and when subsequently the question came you acquiesced in the treating of the sproxton men as necessary to the efficient working of the reformed constituency harold replied with quiet fluency yes on my return to england before i put up for north loamshire i got the best advice from practised agents both whig and tory they all agreed as to electioneering measures the next witness was michael brincey otherwise mike brindle who gave evidence of the sayings and doings of the prisoner among the sproxton men mike declared that felix went uncommon again' drink and pitch and toss and quarrelling and sich and was all for schooling and bringing up the little chaps but on being cross examined he admitted that he couldn't give much account that felix did talk again' idle folks whether poor or rich and that most like he meant the rich who had a rights to be idle which was what he mike liked himself sometimes though for the most part he was a hard working butty on being checked for this superfluous allegation of his own theory and practice mike became timidly conscious that answering was a great mystery beyond the reach of a butty's soul and began to err from defect instead of excess however he reasserted that what felix most wanted was to get 'em to set up a school for the little chaps with the two succeeding witnesses who swore to the fact that felix had tried to lead the mob along hobb's lane instead of toward the manor and to the violently threatening character of tucker's attack on him the case for the defence was understood to close meanwhile esther had been looking on and listening with growing misery in the sense that all had not been said which might have been said on behalf of felix if it was the jury who were to be acted on she argued to herself there might have been an impression made on their feelings which would determine their verdict was it not constantly said and seen that juries pronounced guilty or not guilty from sympathy for or against the accused she was too inexperienced to check her own argument by thoroughly representing to herself the course of things how the counsel for the prosecution would reply and how the judge would sum up with the object of cooling down sympathy into deliberation what she had painfully pressing on her inward vision was that the trial was coming to an end and that the voice of right and truth had not been strong enough when a woman feels purely and nobly that ardor of hers which breaks through formulas too rigorously urged on men by daily practical needs makes one of her most precious influences she is the added impulse that shatters the stiffening crust of cautious experience her inspired ignorance gives a sublimity to actions so incongruously simple that otherwise they would make men smile some of that ardor which has flashed out and illuminated all poetry and history was burning to day in the bosom of sweet esther lyon in this at least her woman's lot was perfect that the man she loved was her hero that her woman's passion and her reverence for rarest goodness rushed together in an undivided current and to day they were making one danger one terror one irresistible impulse for her heart her feelings were growing into a necessity for action rather than a resolve to act she could not support the thought that the trial would come to an end that sentence would be passed on felix and that all the while something had been omitted which might have been said for him there had been no witness to tell what had been his behavior and state of mind just before the riot she must do it it was possible there was time but not too much time all other agitation became merged in eagerness not to let the moment escape the last witness was being called harold transome had not been able to get back to her on leaving the witness box but mr lingon was close by her with firm quickness she said to him pray tell the attorney that i have evidence to give for the prisoner lose no time do you know what you are going to say my dear said mr lingon looking at her in astonishment yes i entreat you for god's sake said esther in that low tone of urgent beseeching which is equivalent to a cry and with a look of appeal more penetrating still i would rather die than not do it the old rector always leaning to the good natured view of things felt chiefly that there seemed to be an additional chance for the poor fellow who had got himself into trouble he disputed no farther but went to the attorney before harold was aware of esther's intention she was on her way to the witness box when she appeared there it was as if a vibration quick as light had gone through the court and had shaken felix himself who had hitherto seemed impassive a sort of a gleam seemed to shoot across his face and any one close to him would have seen that his hand which lay on the edge of the dock trembled at the first moment harold was startled and alarmed the next he felt delight in esther's beautiful aspect and in the admiration of the court there was no blush on her face she stood divested of all personal considerations whether of vanity or shyness her clear voice sounded as it might have done if she had been making a confession of faith she began and went on without query or interruption every face looked grave and respectful i am esther lyon the daughter of mr lyon the independent minister at treby who has been one of the witnesses for the prisoner i know felix holt well on the day of the election at treby when i had been much alarmed by the noises that reached me from the main street felix holt came to call upon me he knew that my father was away and he thought that i should be alarmed by the sounds of disturbance it was about the middle of the day and he came to tell me that the disturbance was quieted and that the streets were nearly emptied but he said he feared that the men would collect again after drinking and that something worse might happen later in the day and he was in much sadness at this thought he stayed a little while and then he left me he was very melancholy his mind was full of great resolutions that came from his kind feeling toward others it was the last thing he would have done to join in riot or to hurt any man if he could have helped it his nature is very noble he is tender hearted he could never have had any intention that was not brave and good there was something so naive and beautiful in this action of esther's that it conquered every low or petty suggestion even in the commonest minds the three men in that assembly who knew her best even her father and felix holt felt a thrill of surprise mingling with their admiration this bright delicate beautiful shaped thing that seemed most like a toy or ornament some hand had touched the chords and there came forth music that brought tears half a year before esther's dread of being ridiculous spread over the surface of her life but the depth below was sleeping harold transome was ready to give her his hand and lead her back to her place when she was there felix for the first time could not help looking toward her and their eyes met in one solemn glance afterward esther found herself unable to listen so as to form any judgment on what she heard the acting out of that strong impulse had exhausted every energy there was a brief pause filled with a murmur a buzz and much coughing the audience generally felt as if dull weather was setting in again and under those auspices the counsel for the prosecution got up to make his reply esther's deed had its effect beyond the momentary one but the effect was not visible in the rigid necessities of legal procedure the counsel's duty of restoring all unfavorable facts to due prominence in the minds of the jurors had its effect altogether reinforced by the summing up of the judge even the bare discernment of facts much more their arrangement with a view to inferences must carry a bias human impartiality whether judicial or not can hardly escape being more or less loaded it was not that the judge had severe intentions it was only that he saw with severity the conduct of felix was not such as inclined him to indulgent consideration and in his directions to the jury that mental attitude necessarily told on the light in which he placed the homicide even to many in the court who were not constrained by judicial duty it seemed that though this high regard felt for the prisoner by his friends and especially by a generous hearted woman was very pretty such conduct as his was not the less dangerous and foolish and assaulting and killing a constable was not the less an offence to be regarded without leniency esther seemed now so tremulous and looked so ill that harold begged her to leave the court with his mother and mr lingon he would come and tell her the issue but she said quietly that she would rather stay she was only a little overcome by the exertion of speaking she was inwardly resolved to see felix to the last moment before he left the court though she could not follow the address of the counsel or the judge she had a keen ear for what was brief and decisive she heard the verdict guilty of manslaughter and every word uttered by the judge in pronouncing sentence fell upon her like an unforgetable sound that would come back in dreaming and in waking she had her eyes on felix and at the words imprisonment for four years she saw his lip tremble but otherwise he stood firm and calm esther gave a start from her seat her heart swelled with a horrible sensation of pain but alarmed lest she should lose her self command she grasped mrs transome's hand getting some strength from that human contact esther saw that felix had turned she could no longer see his face yes she said drawing down her veil let us go chapter xlvii the devil tempts us not 'tis we tempt him beckoning his skill with opportunity the more permanent effect of esther's action in the trial was visible in a meeting which took place the next day in the principal room of the white hart of loamford to the magistrates and other county gentlemen who were drawn together about noon some of the necessary impulse might have been lacking but for that stirring of heart in certain just spirited men and good fathers among them which had been raised to a high pitch of emotion by esther's maidenly fervor among these one of the foremost was sir maximus debarry who had come to the assizes with a mind as usual slightly rebellious under an influence which he never ultimately resisted the influence of his son philip debarry himself was detained in london but in his correspondence with his father he had urged him as well as his uncle augustus to keep eyes and interest awake on the subject of felix holt whom from all the knowledge of the case he had been able to obtain he was inclined to believe peculiarly unfortunate rather than guilty philip had said he was the more anxious that his family should intervene benevolently in this affair if it were possible because he understood that mr lyon took the young man's case particularly to heart and he should always regard himself as obliged to the old preacher at this superfineness of consideration sir maximus had vented a few pshaws and in relation to the whole affair had grumbled that phil was always setting him to do he didn't know what always seeming to turn nothing into something by dint of words which hadn't so much substance as a mote behind them nevertheless he was coerced and in reality he was willing to do anything fair or good natured which had a handle that his understanding could lay hold of his brother the rector desired to be rigorously just but he had come to loamford with a severe opinion concerning felix thinking that some sharp punishment might be a wholesome check on the career of a young man disposed to rely too much on his own crude devices before the trial commenced sir maximus had naturally been one of those who had observed esther with curiosity owing to the report of her inheritance and her probable marriage to his once welcome but now exasperating neighbor harold transome and he had made the emphatic comment a fine girl something thoroughbred in the look of her too good for a radical that's all i have to say but during the trial sir maximus was wrought into a state of sympathetic ardor that needed no fanning as soon as he could take his brother by the buttonhole he said i tell you what gus we must exert ourselves to get a pardon for this young fellow confound it what's the use of mewing him up for four years example nonsense will there be a man knocked down the less for it that girl made me cry depend upon it whether she's going to marry transome or not she's been fond of holt in her poverty you know she's a modest brave beautiful woman i'd ride a steeple chase old as i am to gratify her feelings hang it the fellow's a good fellow if she thinks so and he threw out a fine sneer i thought at the radical candidate depend upon it he's a good fellow at bottom the rector had not exactly the same kind of ardor nor was he open too precisely that process of proof which appeared to have convinced sir maximus but he had been so far influenced as to be inclined to unite in an effort on the side of mercy observing also that he knew phil would be on that side and by the co operation of similar movements in the minds of other men whose names were of weight a meeting had been determined on to consult about getting up a memorial to the home secretary on behalf of felix holt his case had never had the sort of significance that could rouse political partisanship and such interest as was now felt in him was still more unmixed with that inducement the gentlemen who gathered in the room at the white hart were not as the large imagination of the north loamshire herald suggested of all shades of political opinion but of as many shades as were to be found among the gentlemen of that county harold transome had been energetically active in bringing about this meeting over and above the stings of conscience and a determination to act up to the level of all recognized honorableness he had the powerful motive of desiring to do what would satisfy esther his gradually heightened perception that she had a strong feeling toward felix holt had not made him uneasy harold had a conviction that might have seemed like fatuity if it had not been that he saw the effect he produced on esther by the light of his opinions about women in general the conviction was that felix holt could not be his rival in any formidable sense esther's admiration for this eccentric young man was he thought a moral enthusiasm a romantic fervor which was one among those many attractions quite novel in his own experience her distress about the trouble of one who had been a familiar object in her former home was no more than naturally followed from a tender woman's compassion the place young holt had held in her regard had necessarily changed its relations now that her lot was so widely changed it is undeniable that what most conduced to the quieting nature of harold's conclusions was the influence on his imagination of the more or less detailed reasons that felix holt was a watchmaker that his home and dress were of a certain quality that his person and manners that in short for harold like the rest of us had many impressions which saved him the trouble of distinct ideas felix holt was not the sort of a man a woman would be in love with when she was wooed by harold transome thus he was sufficiently at rest on this point not to be exercising any painful self conquest in acting as the zealous advocate of felix holt's cause with all persons worth influencing but it was by no direct intercourse between him and sir maximus that they found themselves in co operation for the old baronet would not recognize harold by more than the faintest bow and harold was not a man to expose himself to a rebuff whatever he in his inmost soul regarded as nothing more than a narrow prejudice he could defy not with airs of importance but with easy indifference he could bear most things good humoredly where he felt that he had the superiority the object of the meeting was discussed and the memorial agreed upon without any clashing mr lingon was gone home but it was expected that his concurrence and signature would be given as well as those of other gentlemen who were absent the business gradually reached that stage at which the concentration of interest ceases when the attention of all but a few who are more practically concerned drops off and disperses itself in private chat and there is no longer any particular reason why everybody stays except that everybody is there the room was rather a long one and invited to a little movement one gentleman drew another aside to speak in an undertone about scotch bullocks another had something to say about the north loamshire hunt to a friend who was the reverse of good looking but who nevertheless while listening showed his strength of mind by giving a severe attention also to his full length reflection in the handsome tall mirror that filled the space between two windows and in this way the groups were continually shifting but in the meantime there were moving toward this room at the white hart the footsteps of a person whose presence had not been invited and who very far from being drawn thither by the belief that he would be welcome knew well that his entrance would to one person at least be bitterly disagreeable they were the footsteps of mr jermyn whose appearance that morning was not less comely and less carefully tended than usual but who was suffering the torment of a compressed rage which if not impotent to inflict pain on another was impotent to avert evil from himself after his interview with mrs transome there had been for some reasons a delay of positive procedures against him by harold of which delay jermyn had twice availed himself first to seek an interview with harold and then to send him a letter the interview had been refused and the letter had been returned with the statement that no communication could take place except through harold's lawyers and yesterday johnson had brought jermyn the information that he would quickly hear of the proceedings in chancery being resumed the watch johnson kept in town had given him secure knowledge on this head a doomed animal with every issue earthed up except that where its enemy stands must if it has teeth and fierceness try its one chance without delay and a man may reach a point in his life in which his impulses are not distinguished from those of a hunted brute by any capability of scruples our selfishness is so robust and many clutching that well encouraged it easily devours all sustenance away from our poor little scruples since harold would not give jermyn access to him that vigorous attorney was resolved to take it he knew all about the meeting at the white hart and he was going thither with the determination of accosting harold he thought he knew what he should say and the tone in which he should say it it would be a vague intimation carrying the effect of a threat which should compel harold to give him a private interview to any counter consideration that presented itself in his mind to anything that an imagined voice might say the imagined answer arose that's all very fine but i'm not going to be ruined if i can help it least of all ruined in that way shall we call it degeneration or gradual development this effect of thirty additional winters on the soft glancing versifying young jermyn when jermyn entered the room at the white hart he did not immediately see harold the door was at the extremity of the room and the view was obstructed by groups of gentlemen with figures broadened by overcoats his entrance excited no particular observation several persons had come in late only one or two who knew jermyn well were not too much preoccupied to have a glancing remembrance of what had been chatted about freely the day before harold's irritated reply about his agent from the witness box receiving and giving a slight nod here and there jermyn pushed his way looking round keenly until he saw harold standing near the other end of the room the solicitor who had acted for felix was just then speaking to him but having put a paper into his hand turned away and harold standing isolated though at no great distance from others bent his eyes on the paper he looked brilliant that morning his blood was flowing prosperously he had come in after a ride and was additionally brightened by rapid talk and the excitement of seeking to impress himself favorably or at least powerfully on the minds of neighbors nearer or more remote he had just that amount of flush which indicates that life is more enjoyable than usual and as he stood with his left hand caressing his whisker and his right holding the paper and his riding whip his dark eyes running rapidly along the written lines and his lips reposing in a curve of good humor which had more happiness in it than a smile all beholders might have seen that his mind was at ease jermyn walked quickly and quietly close up to him the two men were of the same height and before harold looked round jermyn's voice was saying close to his ear not in a whisper but in a hard incisive disrespectful and yet not loud tone mr transome i must speak to you in private the sound jarred through harold with a sensation all the more insufferable because of the revulsion from the satisfied almost elated state in which it had seized him he started and looked round into jermyn's eyes for an instant which seemed long there was no sound between them but only angry hatred gathering in the two faces harold felt himself going to crush this insolence jermyn felt that he had words within him that were fangs to clutch this obstinate strength and wring forth the blood and compel submission and jermyn's impulse was the more urgent he said in a tone that was rather lower but yet harder and more biting you will repent else for your mother's sake at that sound quick as a leaping flame harold had struck jermyn across the face with his whip the brim of the hat had been a defense jermyn a powerful man had instantly thrust out his hand and clutched harold hard by the clothes just below the throat pushing him slightly so as to make him stagger by this time everybody's attention had been called to this end of the room but both jermyn and harold were beyond being arrested by any consciousness of spectators let me go you scoundrel said harold fiercely or i'll be the death of you do said jermyn in a grating voice i am your father in the thrust by which harold had been made to stagger backward a little the two men had got very near the long mirror they were both white both had anger and hatred in their faces the hands of both were upraised as harold heard the last terrible words he started at a leaping throb that went through him and in the start turned his eyes away from jermyn's face he turned them on the same face in the glass with his own beside it and saw the hated fatherhood reasserted the strong man reeled with a sick faintness but in the same moment jermyn released his hold and harold felt himself supported by the arm it was sir maximus debarry who had taken hold of him leave the room sir the baronet said to jermyn in a voice of imperious scorn this is a meeting of gentlemen come harold he said in the old friendly voice come away with me chapter xlviii 'tis law as steadfast as the throne of zeus our days are heritors of days gone by schylus agamemnon a little after five o'clock that day harold arrived at transome court as he was winding along the broad road of the park some parting gleams of the march sun pierced the trees here and there and threw on the grass a long shadow of himself and the groom riding and illuminated a window or two of the home he was approaching but the bitterness in his mind made these sunny gleams almost as odious as an artificial smile he wished he had never come back to this pale english sunshine in the course of his eighteen miles' drive he had made up his mind what he would do he understood now as he had never understood before the neglected solitariness of his mother's life the allusions and innuendoes which had come out during the election but with a proud insurrection against the hardship of an ignominy which was not of his own making he inwardly said that if the circumstances of his birth were such as to warrant any man in regarding his character of gentleman with ready suspicion that character should be the more strongly asserted in his conduct no one should be able to allege with any show of proof that he had inherited meanness as he stepped from the carriage and entered the hall there were the voice and the trotting feet of little harry as usual and the rush to clasp his father's leg and make his joyful puppy like noises harold just touched the boy's head and then said to dominic in a weary voice take the child away ask where my mother is mrs transome dominic said was up stairs he had seen her go up after coming in from her walk with miss lyon and she had not come down again harold throwing off his hat and greatcoat went straight to his mother's dressing room there was still a hope in his mind he might be suffering simply from a lie there is much misery created in the world by mere mistake or slander and he might have been stunned by a lie suggested by such slander he rapped at his mother's door her voice said immediately come in mrs transome was resting in her easy chair as she often did between an afternoon walk and dinner she had taken off her walking dress and wrapped herself in a soft dressing gown she was neither more nor less empty of joy than usual but when she saw harold a dreadful certainty took possession of her it was as if a long expected letter with a black seal had come at last harold's face told her what to fear the more decisively because she had never before seen it express a man's deep agitation since the time of its pouting childhood and careless youth she had seen only the confident strength and good humored imperiousness of maturity the last five hours had made a change as great as illness makes harold looked as if he had been wrestling and had had some terrible blow his eyes had that sunken look which because it is unusual seems to intensify expression he looked at his mother as he entered and her eyes followed him as he moved till he came and stood in front of her she looking up at him with white lips mother he said speaking with a distinct slowness in strange contrast with his habitual manner tell me the truth that i may know how to act he paused a moment and then said who is my father she was mute her lips only trembled harold stood silent for a few moments as if waiting then he spoke again he has said said it before others that he is my father he looked still at his mother she seemed as if age were striking her with a sudden wand as if her trembling face were getting haggard before him she was mute but her eyes had not fallen they looked up in helpless misery at her son her son turned away his eyes from her and left her in that moment harold felt hard he could show no pity all the pride of his nature rebelled against his sonship chapter xlix nay falter not 'tis an assured good to seek the noblest 'tis your only good now you have seen it for that higher vision poisons all meaner choice forevermore that day esther dined with old mr transome only harold sent word that he was engaged and had already dined and mrs transome that she was feeling ill esther was much disappointed that any tidings harold might have brought relating to felix were deferred in this way and her anxiety making her fearful she was haunted by the thought that if there had been anything cheering to tell he would have found time to tell it without delay old mr transome went as usual to his sofa in the library to sleep after dinner and esther had to seat herself in the small drawing room in a well lit solitude that was unusually dispiriting to her pretty as this room was she did not like it mrs transome's full length portrait being the only picture there urged itself too strongly on her attention the youthful brilliancy it represented saddened esther by its inevitable association with what she daily saw had come instead of it a joyless embittered age the sense that mrs transome was unhappy affected esther more and more deeply as the growing familiarity which relaxed the efforts of the hostess revealed more and more the threadbare tissue of this majestic lady's life even the flowers and the pure sunshine and the sweet waters of paradise would have been spoiled for a young heart if the bowered walks had been haunted by an eve gone gray with bitter memories of an adam who had complained the woman she gave me of the tree and i did eat and many of us know how even in our childhood some blank discontented face on the background of our home has marred our summer mornings why was it when the birds were singing when the fields were a garden and when we were clasping another little hand just larger than our own there was somebody who found it hard to smile esther had got far beyond that childhood to a time and circumstances when this daily presence of elderly dissatisfaction amidst such outward things as she had always thought must greatly help to satisfy awaked not merely vague questioning emotion but strong determining thought and now in these hours since her return from loamford her mind was in that state of highly wrought activity that large discourse in which we seem to stand aloof from our own life weighing impartially our own temptations and the weak desires that most habitually solicit us i think i am getting that power felix wished me to have i shall soon see strong visions she said to herself with a melancholy smile flitting across her face as she put out her wax lights that she might get rid of the oppressive urgency of walls and upholstery and that portrait smiling with deluded brightness unwitting of the future just then dominic came to say that mr harold sent his compliments and begged that she would grant him an interview in his study he disliked the small drawing room if she would oblige him by going to the study at once he would join her very soon esther went in some wonder and anxiety what she most feared or hoped in these moments related to felix holt and it did not occur to her that harold could have anything special to say to her that evening on other subjects certainly the study was pleasanter than the small drawing room a quiet light shone on nothing but greenness and dark wood and dominic had placed a delightful chair for her opposite to his master's which was still empty all the little objects of luxury around indicated harold's habitual occupancy and as esther sat opposite all these things along with the empty chair which suggested the coming presence the expectation of his beseeching homage brought with it an impatience and repugnance which she had never felt before while these feelings were strongly upon her the door opened and harold appeared he had recovered his self possession since his interview with his mother he had dressed and was perfectly calm he had been occupied with resolute thoughts determining to do what he knew that perfect honor demanded let it cost him what it would it is true he had a tacit hope behind that it might not cost him what he prized most highly it is true he had a glimpse even of reward but it was not less true that he would have acted as he did without that hope or glimpse it was the most serious moment in harold transome's life for the first time the iron had entered into his soul and he felt the hard pressure of our common lot the yoke of that mighty resistless destiny laid upon us by the acts of other men as well as our own when esther looked at him she relented and felt ashamed of her gratuitous impatience she saw that his mind was in some way burdened but then immediately sprang the dread that he had to say something hopeless about felix they shook hands in silence esther looking at him with anxious surprise he released her hand but it did not occur to her to sit down and they both continued standing on the hearth don't let me alarm you said harold seeing that her face gathered solemnity from his i suppose i carry the marks of a past agitation it relates entirely to troubles of my own of my own family no one beyond is involved in them esther wondered still more and felt still more relenting but said harold after a slight pause and in a voice that was weighted with new feeling it involves a difference in my position with regard to you and it is on this point that i wished to speak to you at once when a man sees what ought to be done he had better do it forthwith he can't answer for himself to morrow while esther continued to look at him with eyes widened by anxious expectation harold turned a little leaned on the mantelpiece and ceased to look at her as he spoke my feelings drag me another way i need not tell you that your regard has become very important to me that if our mutual position had been different that in short you must have seen if it had not seemed to be a matter of worldly interest i should have told you plainly already that i loved you and that my happiness could be complete only if you would consent to marry me esther felt her heart beginning to beat painfully harold's voice and words moved her so much that her own task seemed more difficult than she had before imagined it seemed as if the silence unbroken by anything but the clicking of the fire had been long before harold turned round toward her again and said but to day i have heard something that affects my own position i cannot tell you what it is there is no need it is not any culpability of my own but i have not just the same unsullied name and fame in the eyes of the world around us as i believed that i had when i allowed myself to entertain that wish about you you are very young entering on a fresh life with bright prospects you are worthy of everything that is best i may be too vain in thinking it was at all necessary but i take this precaution against myself i shut myself out from the chance of trying after to day to induce you to accept anything which others may regard as specked and stained by any obloquy however slight esther was keenly touched with a paradoxical longing such as often happens to us she wished at that moment that she could have loved this man with her whole heart the tears came into her eyes she did not speak but with an angel's tenderness in her face she laid her hand on his sleeve harold commanded himself strongly and said what is to be done now is that we should proceed at once to the necessary legal measures for putting you in possession of your own and arranging mutual claims after that i shall probably leave england esther was oppressed by an overpowering difficulty her sympathy with harold at this moment was so strong that it spread itself like a mist over all previous thought and resolve it was impossible now to wound him afresh with her hand still resting on his arm she said timidly should you be urged obliged to go in any case not in every case perhaps harold said with an evident movement of the blood toward his face at least not for long not for always esther was conscious of the gleam in his eyes with terror at herself she said in difficult haste i can't speak i can't say anything to night a great decision has to be made i must wait till to morrow she was moving her hand from his arm when harold took it reverentially and raised it to his lips she turned toward her chair and as he released her hand she sank down on the seat with a sense that she needed that support she did not want to go away from harold yet all the while there was something she needed to know and yet she could not bring herself to ask it she must resign herself to depend entirely on his recollection of anything beyond his own immediate trial she sat helpless under contending sympathies while harold stood at some distance from her feeling more harassed by weariness and uncertainty now that he had fulfilled his resolve and was no longer under the excitement of actually fulfilling it esther's last words had forbidden his revival of the subject that was necessarily supreme with him but still she sat there and his mind busy as to the probabilities of her feeling glanced over all she had done and said in the later days of their intercourse it was this retrospect that led him to say at last you will be glad to hear that we shall get a very powerfully signed memorial to the home secretary about young holt i think your speaking for him helped a great deal you made all the men wish what you wished this was what esther had been yearning to hear and dared not ask as well from respect for harold's absorption in his own sorrow as from the shrinking that belongs to our dearest need the intense relief of hearing what she longed to hear affected her whole frame her color her expression changed as if she had been suddenly freed from some torturing constraint but we interpret signs of emotion as we interpret other signs often quite erroneously unless we have the right key to what they signify harold did not gather that this was what esther had waited for or that the change in her indicated more than he had expected her to feel at this allusion to an unusual act which she had done under a strong impulse besides the introduction of a new subject after very momentous words have passed and are still dwelling on the mind is necessarily a sort of concussion shaking us into a new adjustment of ourselves it seemed natural that soon afterward esther put out her hand and said good night harold went to his bedroom on the same level with his study thinking of the morning with an uncertainty that dipped on the side of hope this sweet woman for whom he felt a passion newer than any he had expected to feel might possibly make some hard things more bearable if she loved him if not well he had acted so that he could defy anyone to say he was not a gentleman esther went up stairs to her bedroom thinking that she should not sleep that night she set her light on a high stand and did not touch her dress what she desired to see with undisturbed clearness were things not present the rest she needed was the rest of a final choice it was difficult on each side there was renunciation she drew up her blinds liking to see the gray sky where there were some veiled glimmerings of moonlight and the lines of the forever running river and the bending movement of the black trees she wanted the largeness of the world to help her thought this young creature who trod lightly backward and forward and leaned against the window frame and shook back her brown curls as she looked at something not visible had lived hardly more than six months since she saw felix holt for the first time but life is measured by the rapidity of change the succession of influences that modify the being and esther had undergone something little short of an inward revolution the revolutionary struggle however was not quite at an end there was something which she now felt profoundly to be the best thing that life could give her but if it was to be had at all it was not to be had without paying a heavy price for it such as we must pay for all that is greatly good a supreme love a motive that gives a sublime rhythm to a woman's life and exalts habit into partnership with the soul's highest needs is not to be had where and how she wills to know that high initiation she must often tread where it is hard to tread and feel the chill air and watch through darkness it is not true that love makes all things easy it makes us choose what is difficult esther's previous life had brought her into close acquaintance with many negations and with many positive ills too not of the acutely painful but of the distasteful sort what if she chose the hardship and had to bear it alone with no strength to lean upon no other better self to make a place for trust and joy her past experience saved her from illusions she knew the dim life of the back street the contact with sordid vulgarity the lack of refinement for the senses the summons to a daily task and the gain that was to make that life of privation something on which she dreaded to turn her back as if it were heaven the presence and the love of felix holt was only a quivering hope not a certainty it was not in her woman's nature that the hope should not spring within her and make a strong impulse she knew that he loved her had he not said how a woman might help a man if she were worthy and if she proved herself worthy but still there was the dread that after all she might find herself on the stony road alone and faint and be weary even with the fulfillment of her hope she knew that she pledged herself to meet high demands and on the other side there was a lot where everything seemed easy but for the fatal absence of those feelings which now she had once known them it seemed nothing less than a fall and degradation to do without with a terrible prescience which a multitude of impressions during her stay at transome court had contributed to form she saw herself in a silken bondage that arrested all motive and was nothing better than a well cushioned despair to be restless amidst ease to be languid among all appliances for pleasure was a possibility that seemed to haunt the rooms of this house and wander with her under the oaks and elms of the park and harold transome's love no longer a hovering fancy with which she played but become a serious fact seemed to threaten her with a stifling oppression the homage of a man may be delightful until he asks straight for love by which a woman renders homage since she and felix had kissed each other in the prison she felt as if she had vowed herself away as if memory lay on her lips like a seal of possession yet what had happened that very evening had strengthened her liking for harold and her care for all that regarded him it had increased her repugnance to turning him out of anything he had expected to be his or to snatching anything from him on the ground of an arbitrary claim it had even made her dread as a coming pain the task of saying anything to him that was not a promise of the utmost comfort under this newly disclosed trouble of his it was already near midnight but with these thoughts succeeding and returning in her mind like scenes through which she was living esther had a more intense wakefulness than any she had known by day all had been stillness hitherto except the fitful wind outside but her ears now caught a sound within slight but sudden she moved near her door and heard the sweep of something on the matting outside it came closer and paused then it began again and seemed to sweep away from her then it approached and paused as it had done before esther listened wondering the same thing happened again and again till she could bear it no longer she opened the door and in the dim light of the corridor where the glass above seemed to make a glimmering sky she saw mrs transome's tall figure pacing slowly with her cheek upon her hand chapter l the great question in life is the suffering we cause and the utmost ingenuity of metaphysics cannot justify the man who has pierced the heart that loved him benjamin constant when denner had gone up to her mistress's room to dress her for dinner she had found her seated just as harold had found her only with eyelids drooping and trembling over slowly rolling tears nay with a face in which every sensitive feature every muscle seemed to be quivering with a silent endurance of some agony denner went and stood by the chair a minute without speaking only laying her hand gently on mrs transome's at last she said beseechingly pray speak madam what has happened the worst denner the worst you are ill let me undress you and put you to bed no i am not ill i am not going to die i shall live i shall live what may i do go and say i shall not dine then you may come back if you will the patient waiting woman came back and sat by her mistress in motionless silence mrs transome would not let her dress be touched and waved away all proffers with a slight movement of her hand denner dared not even light a candle without being told at last when the evening was far gone mrs transome said go down denner and find out where harold is and come back and tell me shall i ask him to come to you madam no don't dare to do it if you love me come back denner brought word that mr harold was in his study and that miss lyon was with him he had not dined but had sent later to ask miss lyon to go into his study light the candles and leave me mayn't i come again no it may be that my son will come to me mayn't i sleep on the little bed in your bedroom no good denner i am not ill you can't help me that's the hardest word of all madam the time will come but not now kiss me now go the small quiet old woman obeyed as she had always done she shrank from seeming to claim an equal's share in her mistress's sorrow for two hours mrs transome's mind hung on what was hardly a hope hardly more than the listening for a bare possibility she began to create the sounds that her anguish craved to hear began to imagine a footfall and a hand upon the door then checked by continual disappointment she tried to rouse a truer consciousness by rising from her seat and walking to her window where she saw streaks of light moving and disappearing on the grass and heard the sound of bolts and closing doors she hurried away and threw herself into her seat again and buried her head in the deafening down of the cushions there was no sound of comfort to her then her heart cried out within her against the cruelty of this son when he turned from her in the first moment he had not had time to feel anything but the blow that had fallen on himself but afterward was it possible that he should not be touched with a son's pity was it possible that he should not have been visited by some thought of the long years through which she had suffered the memory of those years came back to her now with a protest against the cruelty that had all fallen on her she started up with a new restlessness from this spirit of resistance she was not penitent she had borne too hard a punishment always the edge of calamity had fallen on her who had felt for her she was desolate god had no pity else her son would not have been so hard what dreary future was there after this dreary past she too looked out into the dim night but the black boundary of trees and the long line of the river seemed only part of the loneliness and monotony of her life suddenly she saw a light on the stone balustrades of the balcony that projected in front of esther's window and the flash of a moving candle falling on a shrub below esther was still awake and up what had harold told her what had passed between them harold was fond of this young creature who had been always sweet and reverential to her there was mercy in her young heart she might be a daughter who had no impulse to punish and to strike her whom fate had stricken on the dim loneliness before her she seemed to see esther's gentle look it was possible still that the misery of this night might be broken by some comfort the proud woman yearned for the caressing pity that must dwell in that young bosom she opened her door gently but when she had reached esther's she hesitated she had never yet in her life asked for compassion had never thrown herself in faith on an unproffered love and she might have gone on pacing the corridor like an uneasy spirit without a goal if esther's thought leaping toward her had not saved her from the need to ask admission mrs transome was walking toward the door when it opened as esther saw that image of restless misery it blent itself by a rapid flash with all that harold had said in the evening she divined that the son's new trouble must be one with the mother's long sadness but there was no waiting in an instant mrs transome felt esther's arm round her neck and a voice saying softly oh why didn't you call me before they turned hand and hand into the room and sat down on a sofa at the foot of the bed the disordered gray hair the haggard face the reddened eyelids under which the tears seemed to be coming again with pain pierced esther to the heart a passionate desire to soothe this suffering woman came over her she clung round her again and kissed her poor quivering lips and eyelids and laid her young cheek against the pale and haggard one words could not be quick or strong enough to utter her yearning as mrs transome felt that soft clinging she said god has some pity on me rest on my bed said esther you are so tired i will cover you up warmly and then you will sleep no tell me dear tell me what harold said that he has had some new trouble he said nothing hard about me no nothing he did not mention you i have been an unhappy woman dear i feared it said esther pressing her gently men are selfish they are selfish and cruel what they care for is their own pleasure and their own pride not all said esther on whom these words fell with a painful jar all i have ever loved said mrs transome she paused a moment or two and then said for more than twenty years i have not had an hour's happiness harold knows it and yet he is hard to me he will not be to morrow he will not be i am sure he will be good said esther pleadingly remember he said to me his trouble was new he has not had time it is too hard to bear dear mrs transome said a new sob rising as she clung fast to esther in return i am old and expect so little now a very little thing would seem great why should i be punished any more esther found it difficult to speak the dimly suggested tragedy of this woman's life the dreary waste of years empty of sweet trust and affection afflicted her even to horror it seemed to have come as a last vision to urge her toward the life where the draughts of joy sprang from the unchanging fountains of reverence and devout love but all the more she longed to still the pain of this heart that beat against hers do let me go to your own room with you and let me undress you and let me tend upon you she said with a woman's gentle instinct it will be a very great thing to me i shall seem to have a mother again do let me mrs transome yielded at last and let esther soothe her with a daughter's tendance she was undressed and went to bed and at last dozed fitfully with frequent starts but esther watched by her till the chills of morning came and then she only wrapped more warmth around her and slept fast in the chair till denner's movement in the room roused her she started out of a dream in which she was telling felix what had happened to her that night mrs transome was now in the sounder morning sleep which sometimes comes after a long night of misery esther beckoned denner into the dressing room and said it is late mrs hickes do you think mr harold is out of his room yes a long while he was out earlier than usual will you ask him to come up here say i begged you when harold entered esther was leaning against the back of the empty chair where yesterday he had seen his mother sitting he was in a state of wonder and suspense and when esther approached him and gave him her hand he said in a startled way good god how ill you look have you been sitting up with my mother yes she is asleep now said esther they had merely pressed hands by way of greeting and now stood apart looking at each other solemnly has she told you anything said harold no only that she is wretched oh i think i would bear a great deal of unhappiness to save her from having any more a painful thrill passed through harold and showed itself in his face with that pale rapid flash which can never be painted esther pressed her hands together and said timidly though it was from an urgent prompting there is nothing in all this place nothing since ever i came here i could care for so much as that you should sit down by her now and that she should see you when she wakes then with delicate instinct she added just laying her hand on his sleeve i know you would have come i know you meant it but she is asleep now go gently before she wakes harold just laid his right hand for an instant on the back of esther's as it rested on his sleeve and then stepped softly to his mother's bedside an hour afterward when harold had laid his mother's pillow afresh and sat down again by her she said if that dear thing will marry you harold it will make up to you for a great deal but before the day closed harold knew that this was not to be that young presence which had flitted like a white new winged dove over all the saddening relics and new finery of transome court could not find its home there harold heard from esther's lips that she loved some one else and that she resigned all claim to the transome estates she wished to go back to her father chapter li the maiden said i wis the londe is very fair to see but my true love that is in bonde is fairer still to me one april day when the sun shone on the lingering raindrops lyddy was gone out and esther chose to sit in the kitchen in the wicker chair against the white table between the fire and the window the kettle was singing and the clock was ticking steadily toward four o'clock she was not reading but stitching and as her fingers moved nimbly something played about her parted lips like a ray suddenly she laid down her work pressed her hands together on her knees and bent forward a little the next moment there came a loud rap at the door she started up and opened it but kept herself hidden behind it mr lyon at home said felix in his firm tones no sir said esther from behind her screen but miss lyon is if you'll please to walk in esther exclaimed felix amazed they held each other by both hands and looked into each other's faces with delight you are out of prison yes till i do something bad again but you how is it all oh it is said esther smiling brightly as she moved toward the wicker chair and seated herself again that everything is as usual my father is gone to see the sick lyddy is gone in deep despondency to buy the grocery and i am sitting here with some vanity in me needing to be scolded felix had seated himself on a chair that happened to be near her at the corner of the table he looked at her still with questioning eyes he grave she mischievously smiling are you come back to live here then yes you are not going to be married to harold transome or to be rich no something made esther take up her work again and begin to stitch the smiles were dying into a tremor why said felix in rather a low tone leaning his elbow on the table and resting his head on his hand while he looked at her i did not wish to marry him or to be rich you have given it all up said felix leaning forward a little and speaking in a still lower tone esther did not speak they heard the kettle singing and the clock loudly ticking there was no knowing how it was esther's work fell their eyes met and the next instant their arms were round each other's necks and once more they kissed each other when their hands fell again their eyes were bright with tears felix laid his hand on her shoulder could you share the life of a poor man then esther if i thought well enough of him she said the smile coming again with the pretty saucy movement of her head have you considered well what it would be that it would be a very bare and simple life yes without atta of rose felix suddenly removed his hand from her shoulder rose from his chair and walked a step or two then he turned round and said with deep gravity and the people i shall live among esther they have not just the same follies and vices as the rich but they have their own forms of folly and vice and they have not what are called the refinements of the rich to make their faults more bearable i don't say more bearable to me i'm not fond of those refinements but you are felix paused an instant and then added it is very serious esther i know it is serious said esther looking up at him since i have been at transome court i have seen many things very seriously if i had not i should not have left what i did leave i made a deliberate choice felix stood a moment or two dwelling on her with a face where the gravity gathered tenderness and these curls he said with a sort of relenting seating himself again and putting his hand on them they cost nothing they are natural you are such a delicate creature i am very healthy poor women i think are healthier than the rich besides esther went on with a mischievous meaning i think of having some wealth how said felix with an anxious start what do you mean i think even of two pounds a week one needn't live up to the splendor of all that you know we might live as simply as you liked there would be money to spare and you could do wonders and be obliged to work too only not if sickness came and then i think of a little income for your mother enough for her to live as she has been used to live and a little income for my father to save him from being dependent when he is no longer able to preach esther said all this in a playful tone but she ended with a grave look of appealing submission i mean if you approve i wish to do what you think it will be right to do felix put his hand on her shoulder again and reflected a little while looking on the hearth then he said lifting up his eyes with a smile at her why i shall be able to set up a great library and lend the books to be dog's eared and marked with bread crumbs esther said laughing you think you are to be everything you don't know how clever i am i mean to go on teaching a great many things teaching me oh yes she said with a little toss i shall improve your french accent you won't want me to wear a stock said felix with a defiant shake of the head no and you will not attribute stupid thoughts to me before i've uttered them they laughed merrily each holding the other's arms like girl and boy there was the ineffable sense of youth in common then felix leaned forward that their lips might meet again and after that his eyes roved tenderly over her face and curls i'm a rough severe fellow esther shall you never repent never be inwardly reproaching me that i was not a man who could have shared your wealth are you quite sure quite sure said esther shaking her head for then i should have honored you less i am weak my husband must be greater and nobler than i am oh i tell you what though said felix starting up thrusting his hands into his pockets and creasing his brow playfully if you take me in that way i shall be forced to be a much better fellow than i ever thought of being i call that retribution said esther with a laugh as sweet as the morning thrush epilogue our finest hope is finest memory and those who love in age think youth is happy because it has a life to fill with love the very next may felix and esther were married every one in those days was married at the parish church but mr lyon was not satisfied without an additional private solemnity wherein there was no bondage to questionable forms so that he might have a more enlarged utterance of joy and supplication it was a very simple wedding but no wedding even the gayest ever raised so much interest and debate in treby magna even very great people like sir maximus and his family went to the church to look at this bride who had renounced wealth and chosen to be the wife of a man who said he would always be poor some few shook their heads could not quite believe it and thought there was more behind but the majority of honest trebians were affected somewhat in the same way as happy looking mr wace was who observed to his wife as they walked from under the churchyard chestnuts it's wonderful how things go through you you don't know how i feel somehow as if i believed more in everything that's good mrs holt that day said she felt herself to be receiving some reward implying that justice certainly had much more in reserve little job tudge had an entirely new suit of which he fingered every separate brass button in a way that threatened an arithmetical mania and mrs holt had out her best tea trays and put down her carpet again with the satisfaction of thinking that there would no more be boys coming in all weathers with dirty shoes for felix and esther did not take up their abode in treby magna and after a while mr lyon left the town too and joined them where they dwelt on his resignation the church in malthouse yard chose a successor to him whose doctrine was rather higher there were other departures from treby mr jermyn's establishment was broken up and he was understood to have gone to reside at a great distance some said abroad that large home of ruined reputations mr johnson continued blond and sufficiently prosperous till he got gray and rather more prosperous some persons who did not think highly of him held that his prosperity was a fact to be kept in the background as being dangerous to the morals of the young judging that it was not altogether creditable to the divine providence that anything but virtue should be rewarded by a front and back drawing room in bedford row as for mr christian he had no more profitable secrets at his disposal but he got his thousand pounds from harold transome the transome family were absent some time from transome court the place was kept up and shown to visitors but not by denner who was away with her mistress after a while the family came back and mrs transome died there sir maximus was at her funeral and throughout that neighborhood there was silence about the past uncle lingon continued to watch over the shooting on the manor and the covers until that event occurred which he had predicted as a part of church reform sure to come little treby had a new rector but others were sorry besides the old pointers as to all that wide parish of treby magna it has since prospered as the rest of england has prospered doubtless there is more enlightenment now whether the farmers are all public spirited the shopkeepers nobly independent the sproxton men entirely sober and judicious the dissenters quite without narrowness or asperity in religion and politics and the publicans all fit like gaius to be the friends of an apostle these things i have not heard not having correspondence in those parts whether any presumption may be drawn from the fact that north loamshire does not yet return a radical candidate i leave to the all wise i mean the newspapers as to the town in which felix holt now resides i will keep that a secret lest he should be troubled by any visitor having the insufferable motive of curiosity i will only say that esther has never repented felix however grumbles a little that she has made his life too easy and that if it were not for much walking he should be a sleek dog there is a young
