girton girl chapter i triangular friendship the foundations of newnham and of girton may be deep observed gaston arbuthnot in his pleasant level semi american voice the foundations of the gogmagog hills are deeper girl wranglers may come girl optimists may go the heart of woman remains unchanged and the heart of woman but a plate piled with luscious guernsey strawberries happening to be placed by a jaunty norman waitress under gastons nose the generalisation for the moment ended abruptly guernsey imagine that dot of granite washed round by such blue as our western channel shows in june imagine carnation smelling sunshine a friendly trio of young persons breakfasting with appetite on the lime shaded lawn of millers sarnian hotel imagine the flutter of a muslin dress the presence of a beautiful girl of two and twenty and the opening scene of this little drama lies before you i may add that the friendship of the three persons was a paradox as the reader of the succeeding pages shall be brought to see the heart of woman tends towards marriage well a picturesque revival of lady jane greyism went on gaston arbuthnot as his plate of strawberries subsided may be safe enough to the lady jane greys especially in an age when women young or old are by no means given to losing their heads but let the roger aschams who bear them company look to it this young person whom you geoffrey propose to coach is probably neither worse nor better than her sisters the man hating story i flatly disbelieve marjorie bartrand may or may not go to girton she is sure to prove herself a very woman in the end unfortunately you flatly disbelieve so many things as she spoke gastons wife transferred a monster strawberry from her own plate to her husbands you told me only yesterday dinah my love interrupted gaston with good humour never remind a man who has well dined or well breakfasted of what he said yesterday in what state were ones nerves twenty four hours ago was the wind in the east had our perennial duns arrived from england had our cousin geoffrey been reading pauper statistics at us each or all of these accidents may have engendered scepticism which at this moment is replaced by the childlike faith born of idleness and a fine digestion and dinahs strawberry encrusted by sugar delicately dipped in guernsey cream was placed between gastons white teeth savoured and swallowed it was not part of mr arbuthnots philosophy to refuse any little choice morsel that the world artistic intellectual or physical thought fit to offer him he was a handsome man verging on his thirtieth year tawny bearded fair with hands that titian or velasquez might have loved to paint and a profile of the type commonly known as bourbon although he may not play the first part in this or any other drama one has a feeling that gaston should advance to the footlights make his bow a good minute before his fellow actors leave the slips his eyes were shrewd and near together their colour and their expression alike prone to shift if a stranger sought too persistently to investigate them with a first look you felt sure that mr gaston arbuthnot bore a brain you felt equally sure with a second that the opinion was shared even to exaggeration by mr gaston arbuthnot himself in dress it was his pleasure to affect bohemianism on this particular june morning gaston wore a brown velveteen coat a spun silk shirt a white sombrero hat the well tailored man becoming only more conspicuous under the disguise what smaller things shall be said of him that he had been brought up as a child in paris the only son of a valetudinarian american widow and spoke french to this hour with a better accent than english rolling his rs and clipping his vowels like a born denizen of the boulevards item that he had a fair english girl for his wife item a loyal rough hewn scottish cousin for his friend the dinah and geoffrey who breakfasting with appetite although their discourse was of sentiment made up the paradoxical little group under the lime trees at which we have glanced let us turn to geoffrey next leaving dinah as i see they leave the first actress in the theatrical advertisements for the bottom of the list the cousinship of the arbuthnots might be divined at a glance although reviewed feature by feature the two men were notably unlike in their likeness both were tall both were wiry of build both held their heads high going along lifes road as though the world taken from whichever point of view you liked were decidedly a place worth living in here the likeness ended gaston indeed would declare that by virtue of his mothers yankee blood and his own parisian instincts they were less related physically than any ordinary cousin germans one overwhelming difference between them was patent geoffrey was no beauty man when he was the freshest of freshmen five or six years before the morning of this guernsey breakfast geff went in one november night for a little bit of guerilla fighting in the cambridge streets which without quenching the guerilla spirit effectually left a beauty spoiling brand upon himself for the remainder of his life it happened thus geoffrey raw from school had newly carried off one of the scholarships best worth winning in the university although brave manly impetuous the lads hours were early his habits sober he belonged indeed to a class which young gentlemen fond of their pleasure and of modest mental gifts are apt to label during their first two terms of residence under the generic name of smug well with an old schoolmate less versed in greek than himself geff had been drinking coffee and conning over such portions of plato as would be wanted by his friend for the coming little go he was midway on his way back to his scholars attic in johns when turning sharply round a corner of petty cury he found himself in the thick of a small but classic town and gown a brace of undergraduates raw as himself held a mob of roughs at bay stones oaths and brickbats flew about with homeric profusion a fine cambridge drizzle gave atmosphere to the scene police bull dogs proctors were beneath the horizon with no other weapons than his fists and his plato geff rushed to the fore in those early days he had neither the weight nor the staying power which on many a well contested football field have since made his name a terror to the foe and a tower of strength to all england he had however the force born of will of brain of generous impulse ere twenty seconds had sped plato with all the platonic philosophy went to the winds and the biggest brawniest of the roughs stoutly gripped about the neck cloth region gave tokens of surrender unfortunately for geffs beauty his antagonists left hand held a broken stone bottle as the ruffian felt himself reel to earth he swung the missile with dastard might into the scotch lads face cutting his nose and forehead very literally to the bone there came a cry of proctor there was the shuffle of departing feet then geoffrey blinded stunned fell into a bull dogs arms and heard the usual proctorial question as to name and college addressed with the usual calm proctorial courtesy to himself it was a week before the little go exams and geoffrey arbuthnot as soon as the surgeons could strap his face into a grim resemblance of humanity went down the incident in nowise lessened his cambridge reputation although he eventually came out eighth in the classical tripos it is not known that the most foolish tongue called arbuthnot of johns a smug again tacitly he was recognised even by pleasure loving young gentlemen as one of that queer good all round sort in whom the defects of bookishness and staid living are condoned by certain sterling natural virtues glorious muscle unconquerable pluck virtues that a man cant help dont you know if they are born in him and which confusing to the pleasure loving intelligence though such facts may be do certainly in the long run bring public credit to the alma mater but the blow from his street antagonist had marred geoffrey arbuthnots looks for life strength loyalty gentleness were written large upon his face his dark somewhat sunken eyes had in them the glow of an intellect high above the level of his handsome cousin his smile though geff did not resemble the family of bourbon was finer because sweeter more wholly human than gastons but his looks were marred that rugged cicatrice across nose and forehead could never wear out and geoffrey possessed not the thousand little drawing room graces that in some womens sight might go far towards rendering such a blemish interesting his hands however firm lithe adequate for a surgeons work did neither suggest titian nor velasquez to your mental eye his dress bespoke the student his french was grotesque although a second bayard in his reverence for abstract woman he had no small attentions for concrete idle ladies garden parties geoffrey arbuthnot evaded dancing parties he abhorred in regard to matrimony he would shake his head not holding it a state meet for all men concerning this latest clause however the reader shall learn more when we come to ask why the triangular friendship of the persons breakfasting together under the shadow of mr millers limes was paradoxical yes resumed gaston arbuthnot tilting himself to the outside limit of equilibrium on his garden chair and clasping his arms with a gesture admirably suggestive of habitual laziness above his head look the position in the face for one moment and you reduce it to an absurdity no girl of seventeen has ever yet been a man hater has she dinah i was not admitted mrs arbuthnot frankly although she blushed but miss bartrand of tintajeux young though she is has gone through disappointment mrs miller told me so when i showed her the paper with the advertisement miss bartrand more than a year ago was engaged to the major of some english regiment stationed in guernsey is that a disappointment my love the major of the regiment proved a sorry character said dinah gravely miss bartrand found out that he had broken the heart of some poor girl at a former garrison town and from that hour forth swore to look on all men as in the conspiracy interrupted gaston what breadth of discrimination what knowledge of the world these simple seeming schoolgirls occasionally show when i was eighteen that spring i went to stay with aunt susan at lesser cheriton i knew no more of the worlds ways than a baby did i geff the philosophers are divided as to how much a baby does know answered geoffrey fixing his dark eyes with discrimination upon mrs gaston arbuthnots face there is an unexpected parry for you my dear girl shifting his chair away from the table dinahs lord began to fold himself a loose or spanish modelled cigarette pipes and cigars of ordinary goodness gaston would no more smoke than he would swallow any of the popular fluids known among britons as wine he had the virtue of facile temperance wore the blue ribbon of a fastidious taste unless his small luxuries were of the choicest he could at any time fill the anchorites rle without effort you had better apply to your own lawful husband dinah than to geff when you want a compliment i apply to geoffrey when i want truth dinah made this answer unconscious of the slight irony her speech conveyed the truth when a pretty woman talks of truth cried gaston she means give me the biggest most sugared lump of praise that my moral gullet will enable me to swallow mrs arbuthnot had been married close upon four years yet was she so much in love with gaston still as to colour rosy red at the doubtful flattery of this remark she was a blonde amply framed devonshire girl in the fresh summer of her youth not a lady according to the traditions of small social courts the judgments of smaller feminine tribunals dinahs lips could scarcely unclose before ineradicable accents of the west country working folk informed you that gaston arbuthnot like so many artists poor dear impressionable fellows had married beneath him not a lady as far as the enunciation of certain vowels the absence of certain petty artificialities of female manner were concerned but with the purity of april dawn on her cheeks the wholesome work a day qualities of a long line of yeoman progenitors in her heart about most womens charms men are prone to hold contradictory opinions what world renowned beauty but has at times felt the cold breath of adverse criticism a smile from dinahs pensive mouth a gleam from dinahs serious eyes appealed to all beholders tottering old gentlemen would turn with spectacles hastily adjusted to wonder fine ladies cast looks of despair after her from their carriages young men of every sort and condition would lose their peace if dinah did but demurely walk along london pavement or provincial street she was an altogether unique specimen of our mixed and over featured race white and rose of complexion chiselled of profile with english coloured hair and this hair is neither gold nor flaxen nor chestnut but a subdued blending of the three eyebrows and eyelashes that matched a nobly cut throat and the slow calm movements that belong in all countries to the fair large madonna like women of her type madonna the word in connection with poor dinah must awaken instant visions of sock knitting and of pinafore mending gastons wife was in truth a very ideal of sweet and gracious motherhood gladly you would have imagined her girt round by a swarm of toddlers with eyes and cheeks like her own to be bequeathed a priceless heirloom to future generations but dinah had no living child and round dinahs mouth might be discerned lines that should certainly not have found their way thither at two and twenty and in dinahs low country voice there was a lilt at times of unexpected sadness round some corner of her path dull care you felt must lurk stealthily watchful at some point in the outward and visible sunshine of her married life there must be a blot of shadow a woman like dinah could be hit through her affections only her affections were centred painfully i had almost written morbidly on one subject and that subject was mr gaston arbuthnot her husband if miss bartrand be a hater of men a scorner of marriage so much the easier prospect for me said geoffrey at the present time i look upon myself as an educational machine to be hired out at so much an hour i have no more mind to put on company manners for miss marjorie bartrand than for any thick headed fresher i was vainly endeavouring to get through little go you it depends rather on what miss marjorie bartrand has a mind for observed gaston arbuthnot with the certainty born of larger experience happily the wording of the advertisement shows that miss bartrand means work we have it here geoffrey looked down the columns of a small blue badly printed local newspaper half french half english that lay open on the breakfast table tutor wanted i marjorie bartrand of tintajeux need a coach to prepare me for girton classics and mathematics six hours a week apply personally at tintajeux manoir after six pm an oxford or cambridge man preferred does any one know if marjorie bartrand is handsome exclaimed gaston with sudden animation dinah i adjure you to find out the truth in this matter the women of the hotel would at least repeat the popular island beliefs an oxford or cambridge man preferred the crystalline artfulness of the clause touches one from a girl who makes pretence at misanthropy but surely gaston you would not i would do most things my classics were unfairly judged of by my college tutor my mathematics gaston confessed with his air of unreliable fatuity never existed still i kept all my terms except of course the hunting terms and i succeeded as far as i went if i passed no exams i was at least never spun i am as much a cambridge man as geoffrey is i feel more than disposed to apply to miss marjorie bartrand myself the muscles about dinah arbuthnots delicately carved mouth trembled you would tire before the first lesson was over said geff watching dinah while he addressed dinahs husband you want my incentive gaston filthy lucre my terms as a coach in guernsey are five shillings an hour five sixes are thirty yes reading classics and mathematics with miss bartrand will just pay half my weekly hotel bill supposing i am not lucky enough to get other work and you dont care a straw whether marjorie bartrand is pretty or plain my dear geff if ever fortune brings you to the stage take the part of joseph surface for my sake it would suit you to admiration chapter ii poker talk ere geoffrey had had time to retaliate a factor of no common importance was destined to enter the difficult problem of dinah arbuthnots happiness holding the corner of her apron before her lips the jaunty french waitress tripped up a pathway leading from the hotel to the lime shaded lawn and placed a ladys card between gastons hands une dame mais une petite dame qui demande monsieur and the serving womans eyes took in the whole space of blue mid heaven at a glance obviously this norman waitress with acumen derived from an older civilisation than ours was mistress of the situation in a second of time dinah had glanced over her husbands shoulder mrs thorne who is mrs thorne what is that written in pencil ne linda constantia smythe gaston what is the meaning of ne i am bound to add that dinah pronounced the monosyllable as knee and a red spot showed on gaston arbuthnots cheek from his precocious boyhood up it had been a belief of gastons that lady killing was an open accomplishment the established means of defence as much an art to be learnt as the means of attack and still at the sight of those poor pencil marks at the thought of the youthful evenings when linda constantia used to hand him cups of weak tea flavoured atrociously with cinnamon in the salon of a remembered paris entresol the conscience of the man was touched as dinahs voice asked the meaning of the word knee he changed colour linda constantia smythe what an absurdly small world we inhabit you and i my love and geoffrey coming across poor linda constantia faites entrer cette dame he added turning to the waitress an absolutely forgotten acquaintance of a hundred years ago dinah an acquaintance of times before i had heard your name linda married no did not marry went out to india a spinster and returned poor soul the wife of a doctor thorne they say in these channel islands a man will run across every mortal he has known or is fated to know from his cradle to his grave you never told me of your acquaintance with any linda constantia smythe i wonder you recollected her name so instantly gaston easier perhaps to recollect the name than the lady can it be possible that this is she a cream coloured parasol a great many yards of cream coloured cambric were advancing with agitated flutter across the lawn by jupiter how these meagre women age when they once cross the line can this be the walk one has admired i know not how oft are those the shoulders my dear mrs thorne gaston arbuthnot rose to meet his visitor thoroughly warm thoroughly natural of manner and dinah with a sensation of insignificance only too familiar to her sank into the background this is too kind doctor thorne well i hope and your little daughter you see i have watched the first column of the times about your own health i need not ask and so you have really given up india have made a settlement in guernsey dinah my love let me introduce you to one of my very early parisian friends my wife mrs thorne dinah bowed with the staid gravity that in her case as in that of some other lowly born people one has known came so near to the self possession of breeding mrs thorne was effusive gaston felt an honest artistic satisfaction in watching the contrast the two young women presented to each other linda thornes figure was lithe straight thin the sort of figure that ever lends itself kindly to the setting forth of such anatomical deformities as shall have received the last approving seal of parisian fashion her eight buttoned long hands were pleasingly posed she wore a great deal of frizzled darkish hair on a forehead that but for this cupids ambuscade might have been overhigh traces of rice powder at noon of a june day were not absent from mrs thornes india bleached cheeks her eyes were big black lashed green her nose was flat giving somewhat the egyptian sphinx type to a personality which with all its demerits was by no means void either of allurement or distinction if linda had spoken perfect grammar in a london tone and with a taught manner you would have set her down perhaps as an actress from one of our good theatres speaking as she did at utter grammatical random with the slightest little bit of irish accent and no manner at all imagination might suggest to you that dr thornes wife belonged to some lost tribe of nomad lords or honourables and the suggestion would be correct lindas grandfather was an irish earl a hare brained gentleman not unknown to the newspaper editors of his day but with whose deeds good or evil with whose forfeited acres domestic relations or political principles our story has no concern linda grasped mrs arbuthnots hands drawing her towards herself with such warmth that dinahs unsmiling face rose higher in the air she had an instinctive a horrible dread that this old parisian friend of gastons this lady of the green eyes rice powdered cheeks and effusive manner might be going to embrace her a pleasure and an immense surprise to meet like this mrs thorne took in with one long look the blooming fairness of the girl gaston arbuthnot had married then dropping dinahs hands she turned coolly away i heard of your arrival here mr arbuthnot from colonel de gourmet colonel de gourmet is our island authority in all matters of taste from the dressing of a salad to the delivery of a sermon he said you looked like a man who would understand the meaning of the word dinner that is the highest praise colonel de gourmet can give i appreciate the compliment immensely you must appreciate the colonel by meeting him at our house somehow i fancied you were alone i thought stupidly you had come to guernsey for art reasons and as a bachelor so her visit was deliberately not intended for the wife after such a declaration could not involve the necessity of the wifes future acquaintance the keen blood quickened on dinahs cheek dinahs husband was unmoved should it be counted as strength or as weakness as fault or as virtue that no small feminine by thrust at his lowly born wife ever shook the outward composure of gaston arbuthnot no dinah is with me we are just starting on somewhat lengthy travels we mean to spend the early summer here mrs thorne in autumn we shall ramble leisurely on towards the south of france and in winter make a settlement of some kind in florence in florence greatly to my wifes satisfaction i am pledged to do serious work yes and is it true then that you are a sculptor by profession that you have become an artist to the exclusion of other aims of course there is a way of looking at things which makes such a life seem the most charming possible mrs thorne clasped her thin clever hands as though entering some mysterious general protest against art and its followers and still one has regrets i was foolishly ambitious about you if you remember mr arbuthnot in our romantic boy and girl paris days i quite thought you were to get into parliament to be the peoples friend a kind of second mirabeau to make a tremendous name gaston arbuthnots face for a second betrayed sincere perplexity when was linda constantia ambitious in her hopes about his intellectual future at what period of that shallow flirtation a decade of years ago could dreams of a seat in the house of commons and of parliamentary victories have been possible to her i am open to flattery mrs thorne when does a mediocre man not glory in the fine things which according to his friends he might have done yet it seems to me i never held a political opinion in my life you once held very strong ones why in a letter you wrote me after after we had said good bye in paris you were so nobly warm i remember about the english lower classes our sisters and brothers in the alleys whose claims that dear immortal mrs browning so beautifully reveals to us gaston arbuthnot at this mention of a letter felt the ground grow solid beneath his feet i must have written to you from cambridge for the moment perhaps had taken up some of geffs fads let me introduce my cousin by the bye geoffrey arbuthnot mrs thorne mrs thorne who knew that in geoffrey arbuthnot she would never have a friend smiled ambrosially geff rose he gave the lady the lowest at the same time the coldest bow in the world it was a true case of elective dislike at first sight yes went on gaston i remember he drew forward a garden chair into which mrs thorne no unpleasing picture in her broad leghorn hat her cambric morning gown her eight buttoned gloves her cream coloured sunshade sank gracefully i had taken up one of geffs fads the british workman was an epidemic among all classes of cambridge undergraduates that term get hold of your poorer brother in his hour of sobriety that is to say on a friday afternoon present him with a bookshelf of your own carving explain to him the newest thing out in draining pipes show him how to make a window box of rough cork and present him with half a dozen slips of scarlet geranium humanise him always of course with the capital h humanise him you call work so utterly noble as this a fad i assure you mr geoffrey arbuthnot i am wild myself about the working classes at this very moment i ought to be visiting among my district people mrs thornes eyes offered geoffrey a glance of tentative sympathy different men come to the same end by different roads said gaston your greatest english authority on culture declares that any man with a dash of genius is the born elevator of others i believe myself to have a dash a thin streak rather of genius i believe myself to be a born elevator but it must be in my own way and that is asked geoffrey well remembering the atmosphere of barnwell and chesterton the scene of our early labours one feels sure that the geraniums must have choked for want of air remembering the clay soil the neighbourhood of that oozy river the thick air the black ugliness gaston shivered unaffectedly one is sceptical even as to draining pipes my opinion is that the english must be regenerated by art by sculpture notably owing to the low price of plaster casts sculpture can be best studied in italy and i am on my road thither but geff and i may still be fellow labourers in the same cause gaston rattled forth this specimen of poker talk lightly his sombrero pulled low on his forehead his shrewd thought reading eyes making observation the while of linda linda whom in long dead paris days he just liked too well to be ever for one moment in love with and the result of his study was that in her leghorn hat and cambric gown and slim eight buttoned gloves linda constantia thorne looked undeniably picturesque each attitude that she took had he saw been diligently learnt by heart it was mrs thornes habit when in town to spend her nights at the lyceum studying gracefulness from the stalls at so much an hour her expression savoured rather of earth than heaven her figure spoke of the parisian deformity artist not of nature but these faults were just les dfauts de ses qualits gaston could never think idiomatically save in french a well paying section of the art of required models of linda thornes type and what artist with pockets poorly lined can resist the prospect of a good unpaid model if pure faced madonnas commanded the worship yielded to them of old no need to go farther than the exquisite brow and throat of his own dinah but pure faced madonnas in the nineteenth century are for the first class sculptor gaston belonged to the dilettante third rate men who execute pretty conventionalities with readiness get money for them from the dealers and are stirred neither by great expectation of success nor by great disappointment in failure in any case so decided the quick brain under the sombrero linda thorne during half a summer here in guernsey must be a resource personally against stagnation she had ripened into a kind of sub acid cleverness that pleased mr gaston arbuthnots taste her acquaintance opened out a not unprofitable means of spending ones hours between work and dinner on principle he was in favour always of the brain woman as opposed to the sentiment woman he chose the white rose rather than the red his only condition being that the white rose must wear jouvins gloves get her dresses from paris abjure patchouli and be peremptorily certain that every inch of his gastons heart belonged to the somewhat neglected girl with juno face and devonshire accent who waited for him at home before sixty seconds were over he had resolved upon soliciting linda thorne to be his model and while mr gaston arbuthnot chisels marble for the english pauper in some delicious florentine palace you are thinking of guernsey as an abiding place mrs thorne asked the question softly of geoffrey i certainly not madam after a few weeks holiday i am going back to my medical work in cambridge geoffrey won his academic honours long ago said gaston in my cousin geff you behold that melancholy specimen mrs thorne a man of genius resolutely bent on not getting on in the world after passing eighth in the classical tripos of his year and finding that a classical tripos does not mean bread and cheese put in geff with sturdy independence my cousin went back to school set up a skeleton and began smelling evil smells out of bottles like a good little boy of sixteen in another year and a half he hopes to get some unpaid work in the east end of london the worse added gaston with the hearty appreciation of geoffrey which was the finest thing in his own character the worse for all the wretched men and women in cambridge whose lives are bettered by my cousin geffs labours among them re ally dear dear it is all too noble a veritable life poem in prose my husband is a man of science too only in his days you know doctors believed in their own horrible medicines doctor thorne will be charmed to make mr geoffrey arbuthnots acquaintance you are not working quite too dreadfully hard here in guernsey i hope geoffrey detested italics even though he might tolerate a woman who habitually employed them judge how he was affected by the italicised enthusiasm applied to himself of linda thorne my work in guernsey will take the shape of pupils if i am lucky enough to get any my terms are five shillings an hour madam my tuition comprises greek latin arithmetic a moderate quantity of algebra and if required said geff without the ghost of a smile the use of the globes perhaps you could recommend me oh to be sure i quite understand lindas highly wrought tones went through a diminuendo of interest well bred but rapid at this announcement of poverty classics the use of the globes algebra pupils of whom we hope we have caught one cried gaston watching her face gauging the extent of her sympathy for life poems in prose you think do you not geff that you have secured miss marjorie bartrand of tintajeux i have already offered myself in writing and shall walk out to tintajeux on approval this evening if miss bartrand thinks me capable of teaching her arithmetic also the rudiments of greek and latin at five shillings an hour the bargain will be struck capable the exclamation came from dinah who until now had maintained a staid but not ungracious silence while the others talked a certain light in dinahs eyes betrayed the profound conviction of geoffreys intellect which was felt by her mrs thorne looked without showing she looked at the three arbuthnots in turn you think mr geoffrey arbuthnot more than capable of guiding the whole combined feminine intellect of our poor little guernsey do you not mrs arbuthnot linda asked this with the north pole voice that puts the social position of a feminine questioner at so vast a distance from the social position of her questioned i know nothing about intellect except what i hear from geoffrey and my husband i am quite uneducated myself dinahs reply was accompanied by a large level glance from those fearless truthful devonshire eyes of hers and mrs thornes eyes fell gaston arbuthnot felt the heart within him rejoice he would honestly have liked to accord a brava to his wife a good many interpretations may be put upon the word uneducated observed geoffrey mrs thorne had long known herself to be a clever woman she felt that she was a cleverer woman than usual at this moment yet not a suspicion had she of the situations actual point not an inkling of the delicate friendship which bound geoffrey to dinah and at a somewhat lengthened distance to gaston ah when you have stayed longer in our robinson crusoe little island and it is charming is it not quite too deliciously charming answered gaston paraphrasing lindas own style of speech and cheaper than any decently liveable place this side italy for the daily consideration of two five franc pieces one gets such sunshine as cannot be bought in great britain three excellently cooked meals and the advantage of living under the same roof with members of the english aristocracy you hear the domestic gossip dinah does not a dowager countess with a german ladys maid a second husband two pug dogs and a wig reside in some upper apartment of millers hotel but you will find that we are a little behindhand doctor thorne and myself are sensible that there is always the insular note our friends are most kind most hospitable and of course there are the military people to fall back upon still remembering other days the intimacies of the soul the freedom the expansion of indian society robbie and i feel we are in exile there is a constant danger of fatty degeneration i see mr geoffrey arbuthnot laughing at me fatty degeneration of the mind want of appreciation is the saddest thing in human life murmured gaston with a serious face i am taking my wife to florence on the outside chance that we may be recognised by the florentines as persons of distinction in london we are nowhere yes there is the insular note now these bartrands of tintajeux delightful people noble french family who emigrated a hundred years ago to guernsey such of them i mean as were not guillotined dropped the de from before their name and settled here well it is very wicked to awaken prejudice but put aside all moral obligations exclaimed gaston arbuthnot at a pass like this dear mrs thorne it is a matter of life or death to some of us to have facts is marjorie bartrand pretty with her long gloved fingers linda thorne stroked down imaginary creases in her dress marjorie ought to be pretty i am a frank adorer of beauty you must know i hate to see a girl with possibilities make the least of herself so i always contrive to give marjorie a friendly lecture if she would only arrange her hair differently as i tell her and dress like other people and take a little reasonable care of her complexion she might be distinctly nice looking all to no purpose marjorie is marjorie still some people call her an original i said linda playfully go farther i call her an aboriginal i see her with my minds eye geoffrey accept my condolences all these classico mathematical girls observed gaston are the same much nose little hair freckles ankles let the conversation be changed marjorie has too little rather than too much nose and is certainly too dark for freckles it seems mr gaston arbuthnot that you have grown cynical in these latter days if i were a girl again i should be wild to become a pupil of mr geoffreys if he would have me i should adore classics and mathematics a touch of science even positively i think one ought to have a smattering of biology just as one ought to attend the ambulance classes but we may cultivate the graces also now marjorie carries everything to extremes perhaps that is only another way of saying marjorie is a bartrand and the bartrands you hinted are as a race handsome never was man surer of carrying his point by oblique if not by direct means than gaston arbuthnot handsome stiff necked unrelenting i am not talking scandal against queen elizabeth mind if i said this in their presence both marjorie and her terrible grandfather would feel flattered something softer the child may perhaps have inherited from her spanish mother a spanish mother interpolated gaston in speculative parenthesis southern eyes flashing at you from the handsome bartrand face but marjorie has the true family temper she knows too much she ascribes the worst motives to every one she cannot forgive about a twelvemonth ago when the girl really ought to have been in the schoolroom there was an unhappy little love story afloat in guernsey a lover who was unworthy of her of course that sort of thing happens to many of us said linda examining the stitching of her kerchief and yet we women manage to forget our own wrongs and to tolerate humanity for the remainder of our lives marjorie reckoning pounds shillings and pence by our modest insular standard is an heiress well she despises the very name of man now because a certain rather mercenary major tredennis sought to marry her for her money and intends to be revenged upon us from the awful heights of plato and conic sections geff my boy i dont envy you as much as i did a quarter of an hour ago oh mr geoffrey will be frightfully snubbed it is only right to prepare him beforehand mrs thorne raised her eyes very fine and sparkling eyes they looked just then to geoffrey arbuthnots face i shall like the sensation remarked geff to the usual forms of feminine caprice one should be indifferent snubbing means sincerity if you tell her she has worked out a proposition in euclid right she will resent it think you are offering her an affront under the veil of compliment then i will speak of the propositions only in which she fails if you admire the flower she holds in her hand she will throw it away if you say the sky is fair she will remark that for her part she thinks it looks like rain once or twice said linda i have met marjorie bartrand at some village treat or flower show the girl is not out or likely to come out she possesses one dress i believe the orthodox length of other peoples and each time i have pitied the unfortunate young men who tried to make themselves agreeable to her i am not an agreeable young man mrs thorne either in fact or intention your warnings are kind but i think even a bartrand and an heiress will find it waste of time to snub me long as geoffrey spoke a side gate of the hotel garden opened the figure of a spare wooden structured old gentleman dressed in white nankeen and with a white umbrella outspread walked in why there is robbie my dear good husband exclaimed mrs thorne impulsively what in the world allait il faire dans cette galre the quotation was put in by gaston in an innocent voice now dinahs french studies had in her youth been conducted for five terms in a small and remote devonshire boarding school consequently she did not understand one word of the language as pronounced by gaston her heart sank as she watched an amused smile play round lindas mouth already ideas were exchanged between these two people dear friends once from which she must perforce remain shut out doctor tho orne doctor tho orne and with playful undulatory movements of her parasol mrs linda strove to arrest her husbands attention linda bless my heart my love i thought you were district visiting hours ago quite an unexpected pleasure and hat in hand doctor thorne advanced up the path dutifully obedient to his lindas call to be introduced to lindas friends he was an ultra indian looking ultra curry coloured old companys servant considerably more than thirty years his wifes senior with a snow white military moustache projecting white eyebrows mild tired eyes a very thick gold chain a puggaree and buff shoes you could never look at doctor thorne without a certain surprise that he did not live in cheltenham so well was his appearance in tune with your recollections of the cheltenham promenade winter garden montpellier lawn tennis courts and club windows blossoming over with generals admirals and old indians but in cheltenham linda might have hunted quite early after their return to europe doctor thorne made the discovery that he and his wife had two passions lindas for horses his own for living within his pension this decided him on choosing an island for his residence bless my heart linda a positively unexpected pleasure repeated the doctor with urbane little bows discreetly given to no person in particular you dear delicious robbie to turn up just when you are so wanted cried linda mrs arbuthnot let me introduce my husband with a careless wave of the hand that said plainly enough this part of the ceremony might be cut as short as possible mr gaston arbuthnot have i not often told you robbie of my old friendship for gast i mean for mr arbuthnot in paris mr geoffrey arbuthnot a medical student from cambridge doctor thorne was one of the most thorough believers extant in this questioning sceptical nineteenth century world he believed in his own drugs practising on a small but murderous scale here in guernsey and holding the same pharmacopial opinions that obtained half a century earlier in calcutta he believed in the great political names he had admired when he was a schoolboy in the balance of power in the infallibility of church state and the british empire generally he believed in the extraordinary convenience of his house in the fitness of his furniture in the talents of his linda doctor thorne i should add had a mind curiously small thoroughly limited but still a mind not badly stored with facts of a dry and statistical order which he loved to impart to others fastening at once on dinah for linda moving a few paces distant began to lionise the adjacent islands for gastons benefit and geff contrived to vanish from the scene fastening on poor dinah for his victim doctor thorne at once opened a conversation with the airy didactic grace in which old gentlemen would seem to have shone when the story books of our infancy were written your first visit to the island mrs arbuthnot i then i trust you and your worthy husband will accept my services as your cicerone there is much here i can assure you to stimulate the interest and foster habits of observation in the first place you see we have the people themselves whose habits of frugality contrast in a marked and favourable manner with those of larger countries you are not perhaps acquainted with the statistics of savings banks generally i have never had anything to save in my life sir well then i can give you a few important facts sit down pray let us protect our heads under the shadow of this delightful ash or lime which is it i can give you a few details with the amount actually saved by each person in this island over the age of fifteen studies of this kind captivate the softer faculty of benevolence while they strengthen and enlarge the understanding dinah was well dowered by nature with means of self defence she could put down an impertinence i am afraid could resent an injury as well as any fine london lady of them all but in dinahs moral arsenal was no weapon for demolishing a mild little prosy gentleman of sixty seven with snow white moustache yellow shoes and a tired smile some intuition she could not have analysed made her almost feel a species of pity for lindas husband we do not easily experience two distinct kinds of pain at one moment it may be that dinahs heart was too sorely troubled for her to be sensible of boredom even at the hands of such a master in the art of boring as the doctor that morsel of table land in the south is sark observed linda pointing to an outline of haze faintly towering above the dense blue of the channel and the streak nearer at hand please dont look at me but at the islands the streak nearer at hand with the sun shining on its yellow patches is jetho and nearer still where the pale green spaces mark the shallows is herm i hope you are following my stage directions mr arbuthnot mr arbuthnot was scrutinising her face curiously as one scrutinises any waif or stray from the past suddenly brought back to one but tenderly too when does a man of gastons character feel aught but kindness towards the woman whose life has been a little embittered by his own fascination the kindness made itself felt in his voice and look when he answered her almost the last time you and i saw each other we followed stage directions side by side have you forgotten those new year charades of madame benjamins i have forgotten nothing exclaimed mrs thorne with a sharpish accent i have remembered you mr arbuthnot i have thought of you hoped for your happiness all these years now at length i am called upon to witness it she gave a glance at dinah patiently enduring the doctors statistics then went on with a sort of effort you must let me congratulate you i am blunt matter of fact just as i used to be certainly linda thorne was at no pains to modulate her voice mrs arbuthnot is simply beautiful those matchless lines of profile those soft waves of gold above her brow you like that way she has with her curls i am answerable for it it took exactly fifteen months to convince dinah that a woman may wear short hair upon her forehead yet save her soul alive and the lips the chin i believe mrs arbuthnots face is the first i have ever seen without a flaw linda spoke as one might speak of a shell cameo of a china vase of a lily modelled in wax gaston arbuthnot mentally translated the chill distinct tone with edification to himself dinahs is a nature laid on large lines she is the best possible wife for such a light ballasted man as i he made this confession of faith with genuine earnestness feeling rather than acknowledging he felt that the speech set his conscience satisfactorily at rest goodness matters a great deal more does it not mrs thorne than a beautiful face possibly i am ready to accept what you say tell me only you are not offended by my outspoken admiration she went on surely i may presume sufficiently on old old acquaintance to congratulate you on your marriage on the domestic sunshine of your life it is delightful to feel that your heart is warm as ever as a matter of priority congratulations mrs thorne were due to you first dinah and i have been married three years and three quarters while you oh it makes me too old a woman to be precise about dates said linda looking away from him my daughter although she retains her ayah and her spoilt indian ways is a big girl almost four years old i hope you will visit the bungalow soon for rahnees sake the bungalow being the straggling white one storied place which you see low down under the hill to the right that is my home built entirely from doctor thornes own plans the ugliest house every honest person who sees it admits in guernsey not in its interior i am certain a house inhabited by you could not be ugly prettily said why pray in the present sthetic age cut off as we are from the poetic upholstery of london should a house inhabited by me not be a great deal uglier than other peoples i decline at this hour of the morning to be logical one has an instinct in such things rahnee at least is not ugly i am not afraid of your judgment on our little rahnee now what is to day gaston arbuthnot believed it to be the fourteenth day of june in the year of grace well then mrs thornes voice sank so as to be only half a tone higher than a whisper will you dine with us this evening at half past seven i believe added linda vaguely that one or two of the artillery officers may be coming to us we do not entertain i make a point of telling everybody that doctor thorne and i do not entertain but if our friends care to drop in unexpectedly to eat our roast mutton with us and smoke a cigarette with robbie afterwards there we are it was to be a bachelor party then dinah might possibly have been invited to eat roast mutton at mrs thornes table she could under no circumstances be asked to smoke a cigarette with robbie afterwards but gaston accepted with frank cordiality during the years of his married life it had so grown to be a matter of course that dinah dear good girl should never go into the world that even the form of hesitation at leaving her had been dropped on the part of dinahs husband no dress coat no white tie please in these long june evenings one likes to stroll away as far from bricks and mortar as possible there will not be a moon to night still even in the darkness it will be enjoyable to breathe pure air and watch the light upon the caskets from the jetty yonder and what do you think of my old friend gaston arbuthnot asked his wife when the thornes had departed on their different roads the doctor to visit a patient in millers hotel linda her dress a caviller might say scarce fitted to the work to her poor dear brothers and sisters in the alleys i have listened to linda thornes verdict on you now for the reverse of the medal what do you think of linda thorne i think her vulgar it was the first time gaston had heard judgment so harsh from dinahs lips hers was the least condemnatory of human souls she shrank with a rare modesty from giving opinions on the people with whom gaston associated was openly unashamed always of her own lowly origin and of her inability to discern the finer shades of a society to which she was not born a slight tinge of red kindled on arbuthnots cheek vulgar is a strong word women are not always generous in their strictures upon each other yet it happened that mrs thorne was singularly generous in her criticism of you linda thinks you beautiful my dear she said yours was the first face she has ever seen without a flaw standing close beside me as you did mrs thorne would have shown delicacy by not talking of me at all although i tried not to listen i heard too well what she said it was those flatteries of mrs thornes for of course i am no judge of manner which made me think her vulgar a lady at heart would have known how you must wince on hearing me so coarsely praised for one moment gaston arbuthnots looks were threatening then the cloud passed i believe you are half right my dear girl he observed in his sunniest voice and picking up his wifes hat from the spot where it had fallen at her feet but people of the world are not as transparently truthful as you my dinah you shoot at the bulls eye when you do discharge an arrow and seldom miss the mark now let me tie your hat strings lift your chin so let us wander off to the sea and forget all the insincerities all the linda thornes in existence the speech must have been uttered with some of the airy mental reservation that gaston arbuthnots habit of poker talk made easy to him he did not for one instant forget that he was engaged to dine that evening at the bungalow engaged although there was no moon to enjoy pure air and watch the light upon the caskets from the jetty yonder chapter iii has he a wife the battle is to the strong marjorie bartrand the race to the swift women have been fatally handicapped since the world began and nature understands her own intentions depend upon it better than we do does nature intend one half of the human race to be ciphers nature intends men to have wives there is no escaping that fact when i was a girl we got quite as much education as society required of us society we learned modern languages french and italian for of course german was not in vogue and i must say i think italian much the more feminine accomplishment that is paying an exceedingly high compliment to german maam and we studied english literature solidly not out of little green backed handbooks never a day passed that i did not read addison or some other fine queen anne writer aloud to my father and we knew how to write a letter and we coloured from nature for the love of the thing exceedingly well some of us though there was no south kensington and we never called ourselves art students and and marjorie bartrand how did this conversation begin apropos of spain did it not to be sure apropos of your girton scheme your wish to see classics and mathematics pushed into a country where women are still content to be women and very womanly ones university teaching for girls is a freak that will die out of itself like coal scuttle bonnets bishops sleeves crinoline or any other mode that is at once cumbersome and unbeautiful afternoon sunshine was flooding the weather beaten lichened walls of tintajeux manoir the atlantic glittered one vast field of diamonds until it melted into pallid sky along the southern horizon line the keen cool ocean saltness mingled with and almost overbalanced the fragrance of the pinks heliotropes and roses in the reverend andros bartrands old fashioned borders on a garden bench at some short distance from the house were seated two ladies fresh of face both countrified of dress fast friends although more than forty years stood between their ages a cedar of lebanon spread wide its layers of odorous darkness above their heads a grass plot emerald green close shorn was their carpet if your wits were your fortune child such ambitions might be pardonable so after a space the enemy of progress resumed her parable in families where the olive branches are in excess of the exchequer the governess heaven help her is expected to ground the boys as they call it in latin grammar and euclid but with your grandfathers position your own inheritance putting the idea of your marriage aside as you know i have put it for ever and ever cried marjorie bartrand her whole face seeming abruptly transformed into a pair of passionate eyes did we not decide long ago miss tighe that the word mar the word i detest so heartily should never be spoken between us allow that i may not be forced for money to ground small boys in latin grammar allow that my visions of raising spanish girls above the level of dolls are as laughable as you all seem to find them may i not want to bring myself marjorie bartrand up to the highest improvable point as a human being great in mathematics i shall never be i am thankful indeed to hear you say so remarked miss tighe with an air of relief but even the seigneur is forced to confess i might become a fourth rate classic i know french and spanish dogberry wise by nature that must help me a long way on the road to latin and i have learnt seventeen irregular greek verbs im not sure about the aorists and mademoiselle le patourel and i went straight through the apology of plato with bohns crib poor sophie le patourel you have outgrown her at last as you outgrew all your previous dozen or more governesses i dont know about outgrown grandpapa ridiculed our attempting greek from the first you know the cruel way we bartrands have of ridiculing under cover of a compliment well one day last week mademoiselle le patourel was reading the text of plato aloud not very flowingly poor good soul sophie le patourel had better have kept to the millinery her mother made up a cap like no woman in this island and looking round she saw the seigneur outside the window with a wicked smile about that handsome old mouth of his as he listened grandpapa made her the prettiest speech in the world about her quantities her fine classic tastes and her pupil and mademoiselle le patourel never gave me another lesson so now your scheme is to prepare for girton by yourself ambitious on my word my scheme said marjorie lowering her voice and glancing over her shoulder to make sure her terrible grandfather andros bartrand was not within earshot my scheme is to have a real university coach of my own a cambridge ba at the present time residing in guernsey cassandra tighe started up from her seat she was a spare tall conspicuous spinster with a face all features a figure all angles a manner all energy her hair was bleached as much by exposure to weather as by actual age her complexion was that of a frosted apple her dress cost her fifteen pounds a year living alone with one woman servant in a small guernsey cottage it may be affirmed that miss tighe made as much of her life as any gentlewoman of modest income and more than sixty summers in the british dominions her intellectual resources were many she was a thorough an inborn naturalist she played the harp and with no dilettante touch but as ladies early in the victorian reign were wont to play that instrument she drew on stormy evenings when she knew her voice could not penetrate the cottage window shutters cassandra confessed that she sang such songs as i see them on their winding way the captive knight or zuleika her popularity and her influence were widespread the figure of miss tighe in her red fishing cloak with nets hooks jars boxes bottles overflowing from her village cart was familiar throughout every nook and corner of the island if she had not had the sunniest of human hearts you might have been tempted to dub her a gossip that good old english word however is associated in these days with a more than doubtful spice of malice and men and women who had known cassandra tighe for thirty years averred that they had never heard an unkindly judgment from her lips she was simply a raconteuse we lack the english equivalent a sympathiser in all the vivid varying doings that constitute the lives of young and wholesomely happy people a chronicler of news a delighter in love affairs simply this and yet not unfrequently cassandra tighe made mischief truthful as far as conscious veracity went to a fault this excellent ladys memory was in a chronic state of jumble so stored it may be with polysyllabic names of plants grubs and fishes that subsidiary human details had to be packed in pell mell and take their chance of coming out again untwisted and depend upon it these tangled well meaners not your deliberate villains are the cause of half the loves marred the heartburnings the jealousies that make up the actual dramas the unwritten three volume novels of this work a day world you are going to study with a tutor marjorie bartrand with a cambridge ba with a man what does your grandfather say i have not told him the news miss tighe i grudge giving the seigneur such intense pleasure if you insist on learning latin and greek grandpapa has always said learn them decently send these trashy governesses to the winds be taught by a competent master yes cried marjorie bringing down a very small hand with very great energy on her knee i grudge grandpapa his triumph but the truth must be told now that i have caught him i shall begin coaching with my ba my cantab forthwith cassandra shook her head mournfully incredulous she was of an age and of a disposition to which revolutionary ideas do not come with ease there was really no place in her mental fabric for the picture of marjorie bartrand here inside the sacred walls of tintajeux reading classics and mathematics with a university coach i think it more than likely the plan will fall through we have no cambridge tutors in the island unless indeed you mean good old mr winkworth from the high street academy i mean no one belonging to guernsey i mean a person who ah miss tighe the girl broke off i see that i must make full confession no knowing as grandpapa says when you once begin to speak the truth where the truth may land you my ba is coming to arrange about terms and hours this evening and how did he how did any stranger man hear of you i put an advertisement in the chronique guernsiaise three days ago without consulting the seigneur child you did this thing you gave your name unknown to your grandfather in the public newspaper i gave my name in the public newspaper maam and this afternoon i got an answer to my advertisement wait one second and you shall hear it marjorie drew a note from the breast of her frock and with an air half of mystery half of triumph began to read aloud millers hotel tuesday june th geoffrey arbuthnot ba cantab is willing to read classics and mathematics with miss bartrand terms five shillings an hour geoffrey arbuthnot will call at tintajeux manoir on approval between the hours of seven and eight this evening arbuthnot why this is fatality cassandra discerned a special providence an inchoate stroke of destiny in most things i was looking in at millers hotel last night that reasonless creature mrs miller has one of her throats again and i did so want her to take some of my globules but in vain the ignorance of uneducated people and you saw my coach of the future interrupted marjorie knowing that when miss tighe got into such engrossing interests as throats and globules she must be brought back to her subject with a run yes i saw mr arbuthnot a rough diamond my dear to speak truth that is so much in his favour said marjorie peeling shred from shred the petals of a carnation that she held between her fingers i want to do my work for girton steadily unvexed by the sight or thought of that most irritating of gods creatures a beauty man cassandra looked hard at the girl remembering days perhaps when a beauty man in the fullest sense of the contemptuous epithet had scathed rather than softened marjorie bartrands heart mr geoffrey arbuthnot on the score of ugliness will meet your wishes my dear a rough hewn scotchman of the carlyle stamp a man who looks as though he ought to do big things in the world a man with a scar got i am told in a quixotic pavement fight traversing his forehead i like the sketch proceed as regards geoffrey arbuthnot himself i have done walking at his side the evening light falling on her uncovered head and fair face was the loveliest sight these old eyes have beheld for many a year geoffrey arbuthnots wife geoffrey arbuthnot has he a wife cried marjorie in an altered voice my cambridge ba married i hope you are sure of your facts miss tighe you know that sometimes rarely of course mistakes occur in our little bits of sarnian intelligence you are perfectly certain that mr geoffrey arbuthnot is a married man i have seen his wife how can you ask me if i am certain a daughter of the gods cassandra quoted divinely tall fair skinned large eyed with a look of repressed sadness about her mouth that makes her bloom and youth the more noticeable i was sitting in poor mrs millers parlour endeavouring to argue the woman out of taking doctor thornes drugs as a human creature a father a husband i have not one word to say against doctor thorne i have exclaimed marjorie bartrand imperatively as a human creature a father a husband most especially as a husband i have everything imaginable to say against doctor thorne as a physician i consider him a man slaughterer yes repeated cassandra with pious warmth a man slaughterer indeed if i had sat at the inquest on more than one of doctor thornes departed patients heaven knows what verdict i should not have returned against him but your story miss tighe the man like carlyle the beautiful wife return please to the arbuthnots well just as i was trying to put reason into mrs millers weak mind i was startled by the sight i told you of this lovely young woman went past the window not two yards from where i sat with her husband was she leaning on mr arbuthnots arm asked marjorie did they look as if they had ever had a quarrel was she in white bridal looking did you hear them murmur to each other miss tighe be dramatic at tintajeux we have not the joy remember of eventful living mrs arbuthnot was dressed in black her hair lay in short blonde waves on her forehead she wore not a flower not an ornament about her person as they passed the window her husband remarked that he considered the roast duck and peas of which they had partaken for dinner were excellent so much said marjorie affecting cynicism for a chapter of married romance ah that has been the key of our common life is c major roast duck and green peas whatever accidental sharps and flats we may deviate into occasionally the romance has been i was overcome by the young womans singular beauty went on cassandra i asked her name and was rewarded by hearing such an account of them as warmed my heart the girl belonged to the humblest class of life a gardeners daughter or something of the kind and arbuthnot while he was still an undergraduate at cambridge married her geoffrey arbuthnot marjorie repeated the name softly a question in her tone rather than in her words geoffrey i presume that is to say most decidedly and beyond question geoffrey answered cassandra with the fatal certitude of inaccuracy i am the more positive because i felt a kind of love at first sight for the two young people and made mrs miller give me details a party of cambridge men were staying in the hotel when first the arbuthnots arrived and some of these men knew the husband by sight he is looked upon as rather eccentric among his fellows i am afraid marjorie whenever a man leads a nobler life than other people the tendency of the day is to call him eccentric and geoffrey arbuthnots life must be very noble because he had the courage of his opinions in choosing a wife not that only arbuthnot is a student still at the cambridge medical school and gives such time as he has over from study to the most miserable people in the cambridge streets not proselytising not preaching for my part i dont believe much in a preaching young man said old cassandra whose opinions tended towards the broad simply binding up their wounds as men and women doing the masters work not talking about it and his beautiful wife helps him exclaimed marjorie her sensitive southern face aglow ah miss tighe thank you again and again for your visit and for telling me this news in my foolish trivial wasted existence what a splendid bit of good fortune that i should have the chance of knowing two such people cassandra tighe looked a little uncomfortable she prided herself on her freedom from the prejudices of her sex within limits really did startle her friends sometimes by the free exercise of private judgment but the liberality of a white haired lady whose sixty years of life have run in the safest narrowest conventional trammels may differ widely from the liberality of a hot head an eager self forgetting young heart like marjorie bartrands it will be a fine thing for your girton prospects capital for your greek and latin to read with mr arbuthnot but i gathered you must take this as i mean it marjorie bartrand you have no mother to tell you things i gathered from different small hints that mrs arbuthnot is not exactly in society that she is good and sweet and honest said cassandra you have only to look in her face to know still if i were in marjorie bartrands place i should wait to see what the island ladies did in the matter of calling marjorie paled round the lips sign infallible throughout the bartrand race of rising tempest cassandra knowing the family storm signals prepared to take a hasty departure i forget time always under the tintajeux cedars and there is plenty for me to do at home to morrow annette and i are off to sark for five days shore work our talk about your new tutor has been an interesting one especially the clause that prohibits my calling on the new tutors wife there is no prohibition at all the seigneur might safely leave his card on mr arbuthnot it would be a very pretty piece of condescension and of course a gentleman calling upon a gentleman can lead to nothing added cassandra rather ignobly temporising exactly thank you very much miss tighe for your advice as you say i have no mother to enlighten me as to the dark mysteries of calling or not calling and as i consider the island ladies too frisky for pioneers marjorie our archdeaconess our irreproachable guernsey matrons frisky i shall just have to act for myself as mrs arbuthnot you tell me has all good qualities written on her face and knowing the fine things we do know of her husbands life it must be a credit to any woman above all to an archdeaconess to make their acquaintance still if she is unused oh i shall not put myself forward if their merit is unrecognised if narrow minded irreproachable people hold back from calling on them i can understand that there may be shyness on my tutors part in mentioning his wife i shall simply bide his time i shall be silent until he chooses himself to speak to me of mrs arbuthnot that will be wise treat him honest gentleman as though one had not heard of his marriage meantime we can find out if our leading ladies madame corbie especially intend to notice her but in my own self i honour mr geoffrey arbuthnot interrupted marjorie her face colouring like a rose at sunset i admire honour love him i wish the world were full of such men i hold out both hands in fellowship to him at this moment cassandra for once showed prescience worthy of her name cassandra argued no more chapter iv a trinity ball geoffrey arbuthnot was a man of whom none could say that fortune had been to him a too fond mistress as a four foot high boy with shrewd observant scottish eyes with a scottish mind already beginning to hold its own ideas as to the universe he was sent through the reluctant generosity of an uncle to a london public school in those days sanitary and social reforms for overtaxed city schoolboys were still inchoate each boy must look after himself make personal acquaintance with facts with the cut and thrust of human circumstance take his recreation on the london pavements sink or swim as he listed geoffrey arbuthnot before he was ten had made acquaintance with a great many facts all hard ones he had no pocket money no tips his holidays had to be paid for out of the same reluctant uncles purse father and mother sleeping in a perthshire kirkyard ere geff could well remember aught and were enjoyed under the roof of such persons as endure homeless schoolboys on systems of rigid economy as a business hard working to excess perhaps because in work he found a friend pushed into dead language grooves because the masters sought to keep up the dead language reputation of the school geoffrey arbuthnot awoke one morning at the age of eighteen a fine classic he was sent up to compete for a cambridge scholarship won it and true to tradition began reading his heart warmed by the unwonted feeling of success for his classical tripos considering that every aptitude he possessed lay in an opposite direction to classical study one can scarcely look on the nine cambridge terms that followed as fortunate the square man did his best to fill the round hole faithfully his own squareness decreased not and then in the midst of this greek and latin epoch came his love affairs i retract the plural his one overwhelming passion ardent pure as was ever love felt by man for woman a passion which paled ere he could well grasp it into shadow and which still yes in the guernsey sunshine of this june day rendered his happiness paradoxical just at the age when happiness should be fullest most complete geoffrey arbuthnot had not been smiled on by fortune nevertheless he possessed gifts which for the simple hourly manufacture of human contentment are better worth than the bigger favours of the gods life interested him if he had had few artificial pleasures he had exhausted no pleasures at all in regard of nature his sensations were vivid as a childs walking forth to tintajeux manoir at an hour when the crisp blue and gold of afternoon had reached declension geoffrey felt youth run in his veins like wine the hay and clover smells from the newly cut fields the kiss sweet kiss sweet of the thrushes the verdured hedges touched still by springs immaturity though the flower of the may was past the peeps at every turn of purple salt water the road side ferns through which knee deep he waded the yellowing honeysuckle sprays which brushed his face the streamlets slipping seaward away through channels thick with cresses and forget me nots ay even the whiffs of wood smoke from the farmhouse chimneys the incomprehensible froissart french in which he heard the haymakers chattering to each other over their bread and cider all the low melodious notes of this homely landscape affected him with a physical and keen delight his life since remotest baby days when he walked holding his mothers hand in blithe fair scotland had been passed among streets and among the human creatures who inhabit them the pleasure of the bethnal green arab who at six years old first handles a living daisy differs in degree only from geoffreys as he trudged along through the guernsey lanes his mind vaguely fixed on tintajeux manoir and on the chill reception from his future pupil which there awaited him would miss bartrands thunder glances be discharged from black eyes or blue ones geoffrey had reached a stretch of undulating rushy common at the extreme western point of the island when this question presented itself ahead was a vista of mouldering banks gay in their shroud of blue flowered ivy leaved campanula and with here and there a jutting tip of granite crimson by reason of its glittering mica in the sunset above hovered a falcon almost lost to view against the largely vaulted bountifully coloured evening sky interpreting froissart french by such lights as he possessed geoffrey learned from an ancient goat tending peasant dame that a neighbouring block of stone building partially visible on the left through oak and larch plantations was tintajeux manoir would the girl who awaited his visit there be blonde or dark something mrs thorne had hinted about a spanish mother according to all mournful human probabilities the heiress would be swarthy a black eyed atrociously clever looking young person he thought with shining hair drawn tightly from her forehead with stiff linen collar and wristbands with a dignified manner and inkstained fingers also despite her seventeen summers with a leaning towards stoutness geoffrey disrelished the picture projected before his mental sight about as much as in his present buoyant physical state he could disrelish anything consulting his watch he found with relief that he had reached the outskirts of tintajeux five and twenty minutes too early there would be time amidst this delicious wealth of atmosphere and hue that flooded him around for a quiet smoke before encountering the terrible presence of miss marjorie bartrand a suspicion that the heiresss peppery temper might be roused if ones jacket smelt of tobacco rather heightened the alacrity with which geff arbuthnot threw himself down on the fragrant sward and produced his pipe and pouch the pipe was a black ferociously bohemian looking bulldog the pouch a delicate mass of silk embroidery and velvet as he drew forth alas that i should have to say it his strong flavoured cavendish geoffrey thought as it was his custom to think four or five times each day of the tender friendly womans hand that worked this pouch for him dinahs poor dinah when he saw her last an hour before her hands were clasped together with the half apathetic gesture of a person to whom moral suffering has become a habit a basket of coloured wools stood before her on the table ready for her evenings cross stitching round the corners of her lips was the look of silent endurance which had become so painfully familiar to geoffreys sight and all this for what there was no great sin surely in gastons putting himself at once under mrs thornes easy guidance the happiest households one hears of thought geoffrey striking a vesuvian are those in which the broadest law of liberty obtains does not an artist more than other men want change professionally dinah should know that a creator of the cheap popularity order as gaston with his pleasant self depreciation would say must have a constant supply of straw for his brickmaking must have material stuff must see brisk lights sharp shadows that the calm twilight of domestic happiness does not yield and yet it was that constant unspoken and yet in geoffreys mind which up to the present point had rendered the close friendship of the three arbuthnots a paradox leaning back against a little thyme grown knoll his hands clasped behind his head geff looked with eyes that had learned the secret of most common things in nature at the moorland weeds around him here were graceful quake grasses in plenty and waving sedges and the poets wood spurge three cups in one close at his right hand grew a stalk of rush crowned by four or five brownish insignificant flowers the least lovely outwardly of all the brilliant guernsey flora well and it came to pass that the neighbourhood of these degenerate colourless petals altered geffs mood he thought of the inherited mysteries and dooms of human life he called to mind the sordid prose of the cambridge outskirts and the wretched men and women forced deserters from the army of progress who lived in them he called to mind his own often despairing work the struggles hard and single handed of his manhood his youth his youth ah and with that the moorland scene faded the years since he first saw dinah spread themselves out scrollwise suddenly illuminated before geff arbuthnots mind how well he remembered himself a lad of twenty how well he remembered the hawthorn scented evening of their first meeting he was walking alone through the one street of lesser cheriton had passed its rectory its seven public houses was honestly thinking of his approaching mays and of nothing in the world beyond when a cottage casement window opened just above his head and looking up he saw her unornamented in russet gown and apron blue a jug of water in her white hand ready for the thirsty row of mignonette and geranium slips in the window box he loved her there and then it was an old a sacred story now and geoffrey questioned no syllable of the text as he scanned it quickly through he took her picture back with him to his dark book strewn scholars attic in johns and that night he dreamed of her next morning he walked forth to lesser cheriton at the same hour passed the rectory the seven public houses and again caught glimpses of dinahs head as she sat with a very fat old lady alas of a very humble class in a close little parlour sewing the lamp lighted the windows fast shut all the glories of the outside june night ignored the same kind of mute worship went on the next evening and the next towards the end of the week the old lady of a very humble class accosted him geff could remember the thrill of that moment yet away through the garden gloom did he not descry the flutter of a russet dress the outline of a girlish head downbent over a bush of opening roses the young gentleman would pardon her for taking such a liberty but as he seemed fond of the country he might care sometimes for a bunch of cut flowers she was a lone widow and lived too far off to send in her garden stuff to the cambridge market except in wall fruit time if she could dispose friendly like of a few cut flowers it would be a little profit to her some of the university gentlemen she had heard dressed up their rooms like a show with flowers and the roses and carnations this term were coming on wonderful if the young gentleman would please to walk round the garden and see the young gentleman walked round the garden he bought as many flowers as his arms could carry away he learned that the girls name was dinah thurston that she was apprenticed to the dressmaking and had come up all the way out of devonshire to spend a months holiday with the old lady her fathers sister the devonshire burr in dinahs speech disenchanted him no more than did an occasional lapse or two in dinahs grammar when is a stripling of his age disenchanted by anything save frowns or rivals geoffrey held original ideas on more than one burning social subject had made up his mind on the first evening he saw dinah thurston that it was a duty for him and for every man to marry young and he cared not one straw either for want of money or for plebeian birth good because healthy blood flowed in this girls veins thought geff the incipient physiologist sweet temper was on her lips a stainless womans soul looked forth from those fair eyes she was above only too much above him in every excellence inward or external what chance had he with his plain face his shy students manner of winning such a jewel as dinah thurstons love what hope was there that she would wait until the day necessarily distant when he would be able to work for a wifes support he became a daily caller at the cottage and it is hard to suppose that both dinah and dinahs protector were quite blind to the truth garden stuff was ever geffs ostensible object he wanted cut flowers for himself for an acquaintance who could not walk as far as lesser cheriton he wanted radishes cresses so different he declared to the stringy salad of college butteries he wanted to know when the strawberries were likely to ripen he wanted some daily excuse for gazing on dinah thurstons face hard i repeat to think that the feminine instinct however unsophisticated would make no guess as time went on at the state of the poor young undergraduates heart but this is just the kind of point at which good women in every class are prone to innocent casuistry at all events dinah thurston and her aunt gave no outward sign of intelligence the old lady took her daily shillings and sixpences with commercial gravity dinah cut the flowers or tied up little hunches of cress and radishes in a convenient form for geff to carry so as in a new garden of eden without a threat of the serpents coming matters progressed for yet another fortnight lesser cheriton lies at a junction of rough cambridgeshire lanes a village girt round by blossoming orchards in may by sheets of black water or blacker ice in december in addition to its rectory and seven public houses it contains a score or two of the thatched high shouldered cottages common to this part of england being untraversed by any of the maids causeways lesser cheriton lies somewhat out of the ordinary undergraduate track geoffrey had no intimate friend in the university save gaston arbuthnot whose time was quite otherwise occupied than in watching the comings and goings of his simple scholar cousin he was known to be a hard working man who took his daily walk from duty and without companionship but for an after dinner stupidity a turning missed the little love drama would probably have unfolded itself with commonplace speed and geoffrey have gained a wife for i cannot think dinahs unoccupied fancy would at the age of eighteen have been hard to win the turning however was missed thus just as geff his hands filled with flowers was parting from the girl one hushed and radiant evening there came a rush of wheels he could hear it now dreaming over the past on this guernsey moorland and the blood rose to geffs face at the remembrance a rush of wheels down the slumbering street of lesser cheriton for a few seconds the sound was muffled by the ivied churchyard wall where the road wound abruptly then at a slapping pace trotted past a high stepping bay of which gaston arbuthnot was for the moment the possessor also gaston arbuthnot in his well appointed cart returning to alma mater with a brace of rich jesus friends after spending the afternoon at ely lesser cheriton does not lie on the road between ely and cambridge lesser cheriton we may boldly say lies on the road nowhere but these young gentlemen were in the adventure seeking after dinner mood when a devious turning of any kind is taken with pleasant ease and here on their wrong road and in lesser cheritons one street they found themselves there was daylight lingering still in the low fields of cambridgeshire sky there was a young may moon too whose yellowish silver caused the outlines of dinah thurstons head and throat to stand out in waxen relief against the dusky arbutus hedge that divided the cottage garden and the road gaston arbuthnot turned sharply round for an instant and saw her shouting a cheery hullo to his cousin he drove on giving a little valedictory wave of his whip ere he disappeared and geff the glory shorn suddenly unaccountably from his eden bade dinah good night and started on his four mile trudge back to cambridge it was ten days before he again smelt the mignonette and roses of the cottage or slaked his souls thirst by gazing on dinahs face by early post next morning came a letter saying that the uncle to whose reluctantly generous hand he owed the hard all of his life lay at the point of death the old man was sound of mind still and desired his nephews presence a lawyer wrote the letter and it was added that mr geoffrey arbuthnot would well consult his worldly interests by obeying the wishes of the dying man without delay it was one of those crises when all our present and future good seems to resolve itself into a desolate perhaps geoffreys debts were few still he had debts the possibility of remaining up his nine terms at cambridge might depend upon the will of this stern hearted uncle who dying craved his presence and yet in obeying the summons might he not be risking dearer things than worldly success jeopardising hopes which already threw a trembling light over his loveless life he had spoken no syllable of his passion to dinah was too self distrustful to tell his secret by means so matter of fact as a sheet of paper and the post and so like many another timid suitor geoffrey arbuthnot elected to play a losing game with immense fidelity in his breast but without a word of explanation he set off by noon of that day to london not ignorant that gastons eyes and those of dinah thurston had already met a girls vanity if not her heart might well have been wounded by such conduct in after times geoffrey arbuthnot musing over his lost happiness would apply such medicine to his sore spirit as the limited pharmacopia of disappointment can offer if he had had a mans metal if instead of flying like a schoolboy he had said to her on that evening when gaston drove past them at the gate take me or reject me but choose had he thus spoken geoffrey used to think he might have won her to night on the guernsey waste land with heaven so broad above with earth so friendly the past seemed to return to him without effort of his own and without sting the fortnight he passed in london the unknown relatives who beset the sick mans bed the scene amidst a london churchyards gloom wherein he geff in hired crape was chief mourner the reading of the will the return to cambridge all this at first floated before his vision in grey monotone as scenes will do in which one has played a spectators rather than an actors part then in a moment geoffreys half closed eyes scanning the moors horizon the soft airs blowing on his face there came upon him a flash of light it was so intolerably clear that every leaf and flower and pebble of a cottage garden in far off cambridgeshire stood out before him with a vividness that was poignant a vividness that had in it the stab of sudden bodily pain springing to his feet geoffrey resolved to brood over the irrevocable no longer he emptied the ashes from his pipe then replaced it with dinahs delicate morsel of handiwork in his pocket he took out his watch it was more than time for him to be off and after a farewell glance at the campanula shrouded knolls geff started briskly in the direction of tintajeux manoir but the ghosts would not be laid there were yet two pictures a garden scene an interior upon which whether he walked or remained still geoffrey arbuthnot felt himself forced in the spirit to look the garden scene first time seven of a june evening sky and atmosphere rosy as these that surrounded him now thirsting to see dinahs face geoffrey walked straight away from cambridge station he remembered on his arrival from london he was dusty and wearied when he drew near the village the rectory the seven public houses of lesser cheriton looked more blankly uninhabited than usual some barn door fowls a few shining necked pigeons strutted up and down the high street its only occupants when he reached the cottage no one answered his ring the aunt was evidently absent dinah thought geoffrey would be busy among her flowers or might have taken her sewing to the orchard that lay at the bottom of the garden he had been told on some former visit to go round if the bell was unanswered to a side entrance lift the kitchen latch and if the door was unbolted enter he did so now passed through the kitchen burnished and neat as though it came out of a dutch picture through the tiny cool smelling dairy and out into the large shadows of the garden beyond silence met him everywhere the roses only budding a fortnight ago had now yearned into junes deep crimson the fruit tree leaves had grown long and grayish forming an impenetrable screen which shut out familiar perspectives and gave geoffrey a sense of strangeness that he liked not under the south wall where the apricots already looked like yellowing was a turf path leading you fieldward through the entire length of the garden along this path with unintentionally muffled footsteps geoffrey arbuthnot trod when he reached the hedge that formed the final boundary between garden and orchard a mans voice fell on his ear he stopped transfixed as one might do to whom the surgeons verdict of no hope has been delivered with cruel unexpectedness the voice was his cousin gastons geoffrey had no need to advance farther in his black clothes among the trees thick leafage he was himself invisible could see by the slightest bending of his neck as much as the world in the way of personal misery had on that summer evening to display to him for there at the entrance to the orchard stood dinah thurston the glow that lingers after sunset throwing up the fresh beauty of her head and figure and there stood gaston they were face to face hands holding hands eyes looking into eyes and even as geoffrey watched them his cousin bent forward and kissed dinah thurstons unresisting lips youth the possibility of every youthful joy died out in that moments anguish from geff arbuthnots heart but the stuff the man was made of showed itself more potent than all juice of grape is pain for evoking the best and the worst from human souls desolate bemocked of fate he turned away the door of his earthly paradise shutting on him walked back to the scholars attic in johns whose full loneliness he had never realised till now and during two hours space gave way to such abandonment as even the bravest men know under the wrench of sudden and total loss during two hours space then the lad gathered up his strength and faced the position as regarded himself the path lay plain he must work up to the collar hot and hard leaving himself no time to feel the parts that were galled and wrung but the others at the point which all had reached what was his geoffrey arbuthnots duty in respect of them it was his duty he thought after a somewhat blind and confused fashion doubtless to stand like a brother by this woman who did not love him stifling every baser feeling towards gaston it was his duty to further if he could the happiness of them both the sun should not go down on his despair he would see his rival would visit dinah thurstons lover to night gaston arbuthnot a man of means which he considerably lived beyond occupied charmingly furnished rooms in the first court of jesus peacocks feathers and sunflowers had not happily for saner england been then invented a human creature could profess artistic leanings yet run no risk of being expected by his fellows to live up to a dado gastons surroundings seemed rather the haphazard outcome of personal taste than the orthodox result of a full purse and adherence to the upholstery prophets they had the negative merit of sincerity walking with quick steps towards tintajeux how distinctly those rose lit jesus rooms the last in the series of pictures came back upon geoffreys sense he remembered an unfinished sketch in clay upon the mantelpiece a lilith with languid eyes and limbs with faultless passionless mouth with coils of loosened hair charms how unlike those of the demure madonna in the cottage at lesser cheriton he remembered the smell of hothouse flowers the like of which at all seasons of the year was wont to hang about gaston arbuthnots rooms remembered a pile of yellow backed french books on a writing table also a framed photograph of the prettiest actress of the day exactly fronting the easy chair in which his cousin gaston was pleased to affirm that he read geoffrey arbuthnot had to wait some minutes alone his cousins level self contained voice informing him from an inner room that he gaston was dressing for the last ball of the term given by trinity would geff not have come to that trinity ball by the bye ah no mourning weepers decent respect cette chre madame grundy and so the uncle had cut up decently nothing for him of course kind of wretch whom uncles always would regard as belonging to the criminal classes had a mind to dispute the will ruin geoffrey as well as himself by throwing the whole thing into chancery then gastons airy step crossed the room to a waltz tune that he whistled a curtain was drawn back the two men whose future relations were to be one long paradox stood opposite each other gaston arbuthnot was in evening dress his white cravat tied to perfection a tiny moss rose in his button hole a pair of unfolded lavender gloves were in his hand his handsome bourbon face looked its handsomest no traces of perturbed conscience marred his gracious and dbonnaire mien a man may surely find himself deep in a flirtation with some soft eyed village phillis and at the same time like to dance with as many pretty girls in his own class of life as choose to smile on him he advanced with outstretched hand i congratulate you geff the uncle had left geoffrey a sum that for the forwarding of the frugal students worldly ambition was more than adequate one thousand pounds and i said geff his ice cold fingers returning his cousins grasp firmly congratulate you there must have been some modulation in his voice some look on his haggard face that supplemented these four words strongly gaston arbuthnot changed colour what on lilith he asked shifting away and bending over his unfinished sketch it is to be good like all my things some day a new block in the pavement of the road to hades at present this left arm above the elbow is as you see a libel on anatomy geff followed him he rested his hand on his cousins shoulder with such emphasis that gaston arbuthnot had no choice but to look up i congratulate you he repeated very low but with a concentrated energy that infused meaning into each syllable i congratulate you upon your engagement to dinah thurston so these visions of the past stood out not merely with rigid correctness of form but with colour with fragrance with the stir of human passion the ring of human voices to give them vitality by the time the last one had vanished the rose shaded lamps the actress in her frame the clay sketched lilith the yellow backed novels dissolving into the actual grays and greens of this guernsey moorland geoffrey found himself ringing with a somewhat quickened pulse despite his indifference to every form of feminine caprice at the front bell of tintajeux manoir chapter v marjorie the door was opened by a french serving man who bestowed on geoffrey a bow such as valets used to copy from their masters in days when the first country in europe possessed a manner had not sylvestre made the grand tour with the reverend andros bartrand more than half a century before the present time he was clad in a faded livery of puce and silver wore long white locks that in this uncertain light gave geoffrey the notion of a pigtail and hair powder and had a wrinkled astute face in which official decorum and a certain thin twinkle of humour if not of malice contended together agreeably for precedence monsieur demands these ladies from her earliest years marjorie bartrand had received a kind of spurious chaperonage through this plural phrase of sylvestres will monsieur give himself then the trouble to enter the look of the old manoir was cheery its atmosphere was sun warmed and still the prospect of his approaching ordeal chilled geoffreys courage the thought of standing before miss bartrand on approval caused him to pass a bad five minutes as he paused in the drawing room whether sylvestre had ushered him for her coming could the initial letters of his terrible pupils character be deciphered as one constantly hears it asserted of women through the outward and visible presence of the house she inhabited the tintajeux drawing room was over vast for its height it opened towards the south upon the cedar shaded lawn it communicated through a double row of fluted pillars with a smaller apartment towards the west the uncarpeted floors were of oak black from age fragrantly and honestly beeswaxed as floors used to be when sylvestre was a boy nothing like your gray headed butler for keeping up conservative habits of industry among the servants of a younger generation over the chimneypiece and doors were half moons those graceful lunettes of a hundred years ago carved in bas relief and tinted in flesh colour the lace window draperies looking as though they must fall to pieces at a touch were relieved by an occasional fold of rich hued crimson silk venetian mirrors hung at all available points along the tarnished white and gold walls on either side the mantelpiece were miniatures of eighteenth century bartrands in velvets and brocades no prefiguring of destiny looking out from their unconcerned half closed patrician eyes in the centre stood a grand buhl clock its design a band of cupids hurling down rose leaves on some unseen object the guillotine perhaps behind the dial in each of the deeply bowed windows stood a petit trianon gilt basket they were full of odorous roses pressed close together as cunningly set roses ought to be and showing no green between their damask and pink and faintly yellow petals as geoffrey arbuthnots eyes took in one after another of these details the room seemed to him a piece of special pleading for the whole past bartrand race he stood here in a world that knew no better he was amidst the shades of a generation which had heroically paid the price of its misdeeds and the fancy true or false predisposed him towards the present owners of tintajeux they had at least he felt the fascination of a pathetic background rare charm to an imaginative man whose business has led him among the dusty tracks of our modern low horizoned english life moving to a window geff looked forth across lawn garden orchard upon as fair a sweep of sapphire as ever gladdened human eyes for here in the heart of the channel you got beyond the north seas yellowish green and have real deep ocean blue in the foreground so near indeed that geff instinctively stepped back within shelter of the windows embrasure a clerically dressed tall man was slowly pacing to and fro on the grass somewhat rakishly placed on one side his head was a black velvet skull cap an after dinner glow shone on andros bartrands bronzed four score year old face between his lips was a cigar a couple of excellently bred brindled terriers slunk at his heels ho dipus why thus delay our going taking his cigar from his mouth the seigneur of tintajeux recited a passage from sophocles in the oxford greek accents of sixty years ago looking about him with the leisurely physical enjoyment of the moment that was more common probably at the time of his own youth a time when gthe still walked upon the face of the earth than it is now something towering individual audacious was in the old figure geff watched the reverend andros with admiration a man so richly vitalised that he could smoke an after dinner cigar declaim greek verse for his own pleasure at eighty a man who had so proved himself superior to the common shocks and reverses of human life should be one worth knowing even though his fine moral equipoise must perforce be studied in the murky and dubious atmosphere engendered by a girls temper tintajeux manoir with its weather bleached walls its courtly faded drawing room its half lights its rose scents had already laid hold of geoffreys imagination the seigneur with his antiquated greek accent his wise subtly ironical old face reciting sophocles under this late sky had for him a personal interest if only the one jarring note need not be struck if the capricious heiress were but a full fledged graduate a resident ma say within the distant walls of st margarets hall or of girton scarcely had the thought crossed geff arbuthnots mind when he heard a door behind him open and close turning quickly he saw to his pleasure a child dressed in a white and red cotton frock confined by a bright coloured ribbon round the slim waist and who advanced to him a pair of brown beautifully carved small hands outheld you are ten minutes late mr geoffrey arbuthnot the faintest un english accent was traceable in her voice but you are welcome a thousand times over to tintajeux now geff was a veritable child lover and if this young person had only been two years younger than she looked he would likelier than not have finished several of his lifes best chances by lifting her in his arms and kissing her on the spot with a little princess of thirteen or fourteen one must be on ones guard for the first five minutes at least of acquaintance he took her offered hands and held them enjoying the arch vivacity of that upturned face brimful of sunshine as a water lilys cup a face good as it was sweet poor cambridge ba poor abashed big coach thought marjorie bartrand the worthy man must be used to cold receptions i should say on his wifes account now let me set him at his ease crossing to one of the trianon baskets she softly signed to geoffrey to follow do you see that bon espoir mr arbuthnot a hawk moth hovered at the moment with poised vibrating wings above the mass of roses in spain we have a superstition about the bon espoir when he enters a house if he is powdered with black we say bad luck if he is powdered with gold good ah clapping her hands and our bon espoir is gold we are to be lucky sir you and i in our dealings now i shall tell you another spanish saying to begin a friendship with a gift is a happy omen take this rose from me and with a movement of quick grace most artless most unconventional one of the finest roses in the basket was transferred by the pupils hand to her future masters button hole grazias muy grazias said geff hazarding the only two words of spanish he knew marjorie clasped her hands over her ears you pronounce frightfully ill though the words are true mr arbuthnot decent people say the z in grazias sharp they say mou y yes sir and although you do teach me classics and mathematics spanish and french are my natural languages and i shall always think myself free to give you a little lesson in pronunciation classics and mathematics stammered geoffrey arbuthnot reddening as the unwelcome image of miss bartrand was brought back to him i believed i mean my impression was he stopped short english university manners are not good thought marjorie shaking her head pityingly but i like my poor ba yes just because he is shy and rugged and has that ugly scar across his forehead i respect him for his unpolished manner i will call on his wife to morrow my impression was she remarked aloud showing such a gleam of ivory teeth in her smile as rendered a large and rather square mouth lovely my impression was that i advertised in the chronique guernsiaise for some one good enough to help me in my attempts at work and that mr geoffrey arbuthnot offered to be that some one i hope sir you do not repent you of the offer already so he stood in presence of the heiress a little country girl with sun kissed hands innocent of inkstains a childs fledgling figure a childs delightful boldness and not one barleycorns weight of dignity in her composition should he obeying first impulse believe in her and so incur the fate of well snubbed predecessors or should he arm himself against the coquetry which this very frankness this assumption of simplicity in dress and speech might mask long ago in gastons cambridge rooms geff came across a french volume entitled the bad things which men have said of woman he extracted therefrom at more than one reading such bitter nectar as his scanty knowledge of the tongue allowed several of the maxims had slumbered in his memory they reawakened at this moment and bade him play the philosopher remember at what price per hour the heiress was about to hire him and for what work self respect was in his keeping still cried half a dozen wicked old well chosen french cynics in a breath let him retain it and geff followed his own impulse he looked on marjories unblemished prettiness and believed in her with a circumspect belief one or two things i know want explaining a wave of miss bartrands hand signalled to geoffrey to take a chair then she seated herself opposite him the rosy western afterglow falling directly on her clear truth telling face you thought my advertisement bizarre did you not on the contrary i thought it sensible and to the point geffs answer was given with stiff courtesy but too independent for i had never consulted my grandfather understand i never spoke to the seigneur till an hour ago about my having a coach tell me you dont think the worse of me for this had he fallen asleep lying among the blue leaved campanulas on the moor with the waving sedges at hand with the falcon soaring high overhead was this drawing room with its mirrors and rose scents and cupids a dream could it be possible that marjorie bartrand the heiress who never bestowed a civil word upon any man should plead in sober reality for his geff arbuthnots good opinion i am obliged to think and act for myself there is my defence my grandfather whom you will see presently is clever oh cleverer than any man in guernsey perhaps in spain mathematics classics you even could name no branch of learning mr arbuthnot that grandpapa has not of that i am sure miss bartrand he was known in oxford sixty years ago the revolution so disgusted my great grandfather with everything french that he turned protestant out of revenge a mean action say that depends upon the manner of conversion well he had come to be seigneur of tintajeux through the inheritance of his guernsey wife and to be a proper seigneur in this country you should be a reverend how great grandpapa got to be ordained i dont know andros his son was sent to winchester and oxford the seigneur i am about to see yes and andros became a fellow of his college he was one of the three best classics in oxford but he stands right away out of my reach marjorie stretched up her slight arms as though pointing to the inaccessible mental plane occupied by the reverend andros he lives with the gifted people of sixty years ago for me that is too old rather said geff unable though he would fain stand on his dignity to repress a smile grandpapa is an eighteenth century man he was just born early enough to be able to make that his boast and he has eighteenth century ideas unless a woman be a madame de stal says the seigneur let her keep silent if she be a madame de stal let her keep a thousandfold more silent now i cried small marjorie mean to make my voice heard i want to know nineteenth century life straight through i want to learn facts at first hand as a matter of lesser moment i want a degree do you think london university would be beyond me i must know first answered geoffrey to what height of learning you can reach on tiptoes a flash of indignation swept over marjories face the possibilities of temper showed round that acute square cut mouth of hers it is correct masculine taste to laugh at a girls ambition i know the seigneur mr geoffrey arbuthnot all have the same fine generosity but why do we lose time perhaps if you will come to the schoolroom you will look over my books sir it is too late of course to do any work to night not too late for me answered geoffrey in his heart liking the girl better and better i came out hoping we should begin to read at once my time is yours miss bartrand led the way her face held somewhat aloft into a room plainly furnished as a study and strewed with books and papers on the west side of the inner drawing room as geoffrey followed every sense tempered to a keener edge than usual he could not help remarking with what curious grace marjories raven black tresses were braided he had been to a few very few london entertainments in his life had glanced at most varieties of our current female heads none tolerable to him beside a certain recollection of soft gold worn in little waves that way poor dinah had with her curls upon a madonna forehead but marjories ebon locks gathered high in one thick coil upon the summit of her head compelled his admiration the style was too foreign altogether for english taste and the white and red dress the gaudy waist ribbon were too evidently got up for effect geoffrey decided now that he could draw breath and criticise the complexion too to a man who for years had had a living ideal of snow and rose bloom before him was certainly sallow and those great black eyes stopping short marjorie waited for her visitor on the schoolroom threshold at the moment he overtook her she turned looked up at him and behold her eyes were blue intensely blue as i think only irish or spanish eyes ever are with a sweep of jetty lash with a hidden laughter in them although the possibilities of temper still lurked round the corner of her lips this is to be your torture chamber from the time i was five i have worked myself up to my present state of ignorance at that inky desk you see and under the rule of a long line of governesses most of whom gave me and themselves up in despair now put me to the test if you please mr arbuthnot dont spare my feelings treat me as you would treat any backward schoolboy and geff arbuthnot obeyed the command to the letter he did not spare her feelings marjory bartrands attainments were to the last degree patchy and scrappy the typical attainments to be looked for in a quick self willed child indifferently taught by a succession of teachers and whose faulty studies had been supplemented by an avid indiscriminate consumption of good books your classics are weak miss bartrand geoffrey remarked this pushing papers and books aside and looking kindly across the table into his pupils face oh i never liked the subjects i knew that you would say so with an effort marjorie bartrand kept her voice under control but your classics are stronger than your mathematics yes mr arbuthnot you will have a great deal of work before you can bring either to we will not say a high but an ordinary level yes mr arbuthnot you spoke of a london degree let us look at london matriculation first children are trained at high schools for about six years i understand for london matriculation and many more than a third of the candidates fail i spoke of london because london gives you letters after your name the older universities would be more thought of in spain i have grandpapas leave to go to newnham or girton when i am eighteen the first of all my governesses lives in cambridge so i should have one friend there the girton and newnham work is on the same level as the other colleges and you think that work beyond my reach geff arbuthnot thought that a girl with a head so graceful with eyes so blue with soft brow gleaming under such a weight of dusky hair might be content amidst the flower scents and cedar shades of tintajeux manoir content to let euclid and greek particles go to be a woman to accept the homely happy paths wherein women may walk unguided by exact science or the philosophy of all the ancients the opinions he knew were heterodox and not to be uttered especially by a man who at five shillings an hour had engaged himself to lighten the thorny road that leads to knowledge memory will get one through most exams miss bartrand you have a good memory for all useless things yes in don quixote for instance you would find it hard to puzzle me you know a little spanish five words at most how deplorable a person who has no spanish is not quite in possession of his faculties if one had time to spare in these long summer days i marjorie broke off abruptly colouring to the roots of her hair as she remembered the existence of her tutors wife a girl not ignorant of spanish only a girl who could just overcome the difficulties of the prayer book and lessons perhaps or write a letter without any glaringly bad spelling on a push if one had time to spare in these long summer days miss bartrand geoffrey arbuthnot found a pleasure it had been hard to him to account for in her confusion i was going to say i would teach you spanish as if spanish mattered as if there were not nobler lovelier things in life than book learning but that was a real bartrand idea we bartrands mouldering among our owls in this old place cannot see daylight clear we think too much of ourselves our minds are as narrow as our garden paths i teach you spanish indeed ill tell you what i call that proposal she leaned across till her sweet bud of a face was close to geoffreys and spoke with a suspension of the breath i call it a bit of devilish bartrand pride and stiff neckedness geff started with a pantomime of horror from the adjective italicised you know the meaning of tintajeux tint jeu in old norman you english in cornwall say tintagel the devils castle a fit abode for us look at grandpapa he quarrelled seven years ago with m noirmont the rector of our next parish over a latin quantity never in this world will grandpapa speak again to that innocent old man a wrong quantity is no jesting matter observed geoffrey arbuthnot then he has three daughters my aunts neither of the three has spoken to the others or to him for five and twenty years no vulgar quarrel to start with we bartrands wage war on a grand napoleonic scale says the seigneur an exchange of reproachful epithets is sheer waste of brain power the marriage of each sister in succession wounded the other sisters pride all wounded grandpapas it was quite simple you colour highly miss bartrand i am giving you sketches from life no colouring could be too high for showing up our bartrand traits the little faults of our virtues as the french say prettily geoffrey felt himself on the road to disenchantment the girl might have marvellous eyes a wealth of dusky hair tones of liquid music a sunburnt hand that was a poem the heart within her was hard to the core linda thorne by hidden affinity perhaps was not so very far out in her judgments marjorie knew too much had learned bitter lessons in human nature not from books but from keen reading of the men and women nighest to herself in blood yes we think too highly of our small talents i with my shallowness to propose teaching a bachelor of arts anything i ought to be grateful to mr arbuthnot for condescending to read with such a pupil now which three mornings in the week could you give me he could give her tuesday thursday and saturday they gravely arranged their hours they talked over the work say a book of cicero the two first books of euclid to be looked over before their first lesson then geoffrey arbuthnot rose to his feet putting on a staid and tuitional manner he stated that his terms in guernsey would be five shillings british currency per hour marjories face grew one hot blaze of shame oh of course please do not speak of money it is far too little it is an honour i mean for me to learn and i am coming she was just about to commit herself and so considerably simplify geffs position just about to blurt out and i am coming to call upon your wife when a footstep alert though it had paced the earth for more than eighty years sounded on the garden path outside the glass door of the schoolroom was pushed open and old andros bartrand walked in chapter vi two in arcadia an atmosphere of fresh country air blent with tobacco smoke surrounded him as we like to think it surrounded parson adams he saluted geff with that nice mixture of personal reserve and general expansiveness which among a bygone generation was called breeding he bestowed a partial smile on marjorie those bartrand company smiles as she used to bemoan when she was a younger child counters that i must make believe are sixpences until the visit is over until the round game melts back into our grim duel at solitaire mr arbuthnot i presume welcome to tintajeux mr arbuthnot he shook geffs hand with a distant affability glad always to see a man from the alma mater in our little island oxford is not the oxford of my days still mr arbuthnot hails from cambridge grandpapa shrieked marjorie with energy in the seigneurs deafer ear then in one sense mr arbuthnot is to be congratulated for cambridge is nearer to newmarket a bitter blow to the talent that victory of mademoiselle ninettes in the one thousand last april was it not the proverbial uncertainty of fillies retaining their form said geoffrey the usual reason for strong fielding still the performance of maydew in the two thousand was so good that the odds seemed legitimate geff arbuthnot cared as much for horse racing as for the native industries of japan but the tastes of a man of fourscore must be respected and with a glance at the seigneur of tintajeux you could detect the sporting element softened not ungracefully through a course of sixty years by the learning of the scholar and the quiet life of the priest you come over to england of course sir for the big events of the year not i not i when you arrive at the age of a hundred you will find yourself content with newspaper reports of most human goings on great or small i have my books about me here my farm my dogs a horse or two and my cure of souls marjorie small witch where are you did you not say mr arbuthnot was to take holy orders mr arbuthnot is to cure bodies not souls marjories answer was given in a tone of altissimo derision geff put himself through a little exercise of moral arithmetic the result required being the precise sum of dislike which a man of his age could feel towards a scoffing girl of seventeen a girl with eyes like marjories silken black hair and exquisite hands it was not perhaps so large an amount as one might have looked for an sculapius observed the reverend andros you know the parable mr arbuthnot two stalwart men nature and disease are fighting a third man the doctor seizes his club and rushes into the mele sometimes hitting disease and sometimes nature you are to be the man with the club i am to be the man with the club answered geff relishing the old seigneurs manner as long as i confine myself to the setting of broken bones sir i hope to do as little harm as may be the doctors kill us no quicker than they used admitted andros bartrand liberally when i was an undergraduate they relied on their brains as you do now on your finger tips and i believe killed us no quicker you are an honours man of course at a hundred years old one is naturally ignorant as to the university regulations of the times i know next to nothing of your cambridge triposes you won your laurels i assume among bones and minerals the seigneurs prejudices were mellow and crusted as his own port a born and passionate lover of classic literature he regarded the admission of natural science into the universities as a mistake a sort of shuffle among examiners and liberal governments that enabled lowly born classes of men to take high degrees unfortunately for myself i did not said geff when my real college life was over i saw bread and cheese in a remote perspective and had to begin bones and minerals from their abc in my day i came out eighth and being exceedingly human geffs face flushed a bit in the classical tripos the seigneur put his hand within the young mans arm come for a walk with me mr arbuthnot eighth in the classical tripos eh i will point out the limits of my vast estate to you marjorie small witch go and set ready the tea table mr arbuthnot will spend the remainder of the evening with us the daylight by now had gone into odorous dew freshened dusk a big solitary planet looked down upon the woods of tintajeux geff felt himself in a new world a thousand miles removed from pale work a day prosaic england the affluence of air and sea the largeness of sky took possession of him played in his blood evoked that precise condition of mind and body which is so often at four and twenty the prelude to human passion the talk of andros bartrand accorded well with the scene and moment they spoke of men measures books of books chiefly i belong really to the eighteenth century said the seigneur as with his hand on geffs arm they paced the lawns goodly limits old andros had the vanity of his age in seeking to exaggerate it he had been known or so marjorie would affirm to speak of himself as alive at the dawn of the french revolution perhaps you appreciated his real age best when you reflected that the bride of his youth might have been a contemporary of emma woodhouse i was born before moral pulse feeling came into fashion this modern verse singing maugre the music dont please me i never mix my wines i like to take my verse and my philosophy separate hand made paper rough edges vellum constitute poetry nowadays dont they the sthetic fever is on us still sir i fear in regard to church matters i was middle aged mind when tract decimated the country tractarian or evangelical theist or pantheist the church went on quite as profitably before parsons began calling each other by such a variety of names names that all mean the same thing geoffrey suggested if men had temper enough to examine them coolly possibly let me direct your attention to my young wheat you see it in the enclosure just between that red stable roof and the orchard i mean to cut my wheat with the guernsey sickle mr arbuthnot the same pattern of sickle it is believed that was used under louis xi i mean to get more for my wheat per quarter than any grower in england there is the advantage of being a channel island farmer one may not only be a conservative but like certain great statesmen make ones conservatism pay a resonant call from marjorie summoned them before long to the tea table a meal at which old andros with his grand seigneur air made his guest pleasantly welcome the dinner hour at tintajeux was five the late dinner of andros bartrands youth by half past eight in this keen atlantic air broiled mullet hot potato scones with other indigenous guernsey dishes were adjuncts to the tea table which no healthily minded person could afford to despise afterwards came a cigar smoked just inside the open french windows at a hundred years old the seigneur apologised there was one thing a man might not brave with impunity night air and then geoffrey arbuthnot prepared to take his leave business like he reverted to pounds shillings and pence it was a settled thing that he should read classics and mathematics with miss bartrand on three mornings of the week at the sum happily the darkness veiled the blushes on marjories face of six francs an hour classics and mathematics cried old andros assenting to the money part of the transaction with suave courtesy what will the little witch do with classics and mathematics when she has got them enter newnham or girton with them in the first place answered marjorie unhesitatingly newnham or girton the unfavourable summing up of all arguments that have been put forth on the subject of womans higher education was in andros bartrands enunciation of the words newnham and girton send forth good men remarked geoffrey arbuthnot in the future sir when the girls shall make greek iambics and the boys black currant jams we look forward confidently to seeing girton head of the river at my age i am unmoved by new theories said old andros new facts i am not likely to confront there has never yet been a great woman poet mrs browning grandpapa nor a great woman painter rosa bonheur nor a discoverer in science mrs somerville nor a solitary musical composer the girl was silent yet all these fields have been as open to them as to men have they not witch marjorie bartrand had passed into the garden she stood impatiently tapping a slender foot on the turf and looking up her arms folded an expression on her face curiously like that of old andros at a strip of crescent moon that showed between the cedar branches a new moon i curtsey to her twice thrice and i wish a wish did you hear my question witch in poetry art music have women not had just as ample chances as men spanish women have had no chances at all cried marjorie raising her tone as she adroitly shifted her ground after the manner of her sex for their sake i mean to work yes to get to the level of a ba grandpapa in spite of your most withering contempt for the sake of spain benighted spain remarked the seigneur genially my granddaughters blood is half spanish mr arbuthnot i had a son once an only son could it really be that andros bartrands firm voice for a second faltered when he was no longer a young man he went to cadiz for healths sake and married poor fellow a spanish girl who died at the end of the year marjorie has stayed a few times among her mothers family and has gone spain crazed as you will soon find out for yourself crazed rang marjories tuneful voice through the night i want to hold my hands out to my own people yes to teach if i ever know anything myself among the girls of our poor benighted spain and i am proud of my craziness i thank you for the word grandpapa it is the prettiest compliment the complexion of the family talk was threatening geoffrey arbuthnot hastened his adieux but andros had still a farewell shot to discharge against the little witch our poor benighted spain is the one country in europe with a decent peasantry of its own get mr arbuthnot get anyone who understands the matter to talk to you about the english ploughman and compare the two pictures the spanish peasants wife sews knits embroiders reads her mass book and can cook a capital stew her drink is water infanticide is unknown the men are hospitable courteous dignified among benighted people like these marjorie bartrand proposes to preach the benefits of a liberal pauper education as exhibited in england by the time the seigneurs ironies came to an end marjories small figure had vanished among the deepening shadows of the lawn fearful of losing sight of her altogether for indeed marjorie bartrand was suggestive of something weird sprite like and of a nature to take other form at an hour when owls do fly geff bade his host a hasty good night and followed the girl herself was invisible but a clear childish voice chanted the old ditty of roland somewhere in the neighbourhood like steel among weapons like wax among women or as marjorie sang with spirit fuerte qual azero entre armas y qnal cera entre las damas i have found my gardening scissors mr arbuthnot she cried emerging through the schoolroom window a basket on her arm flowers smell sweetest that are cut with the dew on them i mean to cut some roses and cherry pie for for your wife was on marjories lips but she stopped herself abruptly all cassandra tighes warnings about geoffreys domestic embarrassments coming back to her let me help you said geoffrey a minute later marjorie on tiptoe was vainly endeavouring to catch a bough of swaying yellow briar you are just one foot too short to reach those roses miss bartrand marjorie sprang up in air she plunged with bold final grasp among the thorns and succeeded in getting scratches destined to mark her right hand for some weeks to come scratches that might perhaps recall this moment to both of them in the pauses of some tough mathematical problem some arid point in latin grammar or greek delectus the result of over vaulting ambition thus from his calm altitude of six foot one geff moralised how many roses am i to pick you are to pick three beauties said marjorie somewhat crestfallen wont you have the scissors these briars prick cruelly but geff wanted no scissors his skin so he told her was of about the same texture as a stout dog skin glove when the briar roses were duly laid in marjories basket he put on the grave manner of his profession it was his duty as a surgeon to make immediate inspection of her injuries you are losing a good deal of blood miss bartrand taking both her hands he held them up in the streak of moonlight not very distant from his lips but while there is life there is hope three four deep wounds for my sake dont faint if you can help it faint marjories laugh was a thing good to hear a thing fresh as the chatter of birds in april pungent as the smell of new turned earth i wonder whether any of the old bartrands ever fainted i mean before they were guillotined confess we are queer specimens grandpapa and i are we not sir asking geff this question she left her hands in his simply until he should choose to let them go the first ineffable coldness of girlhood was on her she knew no more of passion than did her own roses not very pleasant people to live with say in an out of the way guernsey manoir so much must depend on the taste of him who survived the ordeal geoffrey arbuthnot quietly surrendered the slim hands resting unresponsively in his at the present moment life in an out of the way guernsey manoir seems to me endurable a stronger word was very near escaping geoffrey arbuthnots lips you are taken in by our picturesqueness said marjorie with decision england must be an astonishing ugly country judging from the effect our bit of channel rock appears to make upon english people now to me who have seen spain it is all so cramped so sea weedy look away to the left there sea to the right sea move a little step nearer close here dont be afraid and look where i point across the moor sea again let an out and out big wave come some day and the whole nation would be submerged like victor hugos hero the glimpse of silver gray tranquil moor brought back before geoffrey the thyme grown bank the falcon high poised the tuft of wood rush associated with the last rose visions of the squalid barnwell pavements of the men and women forced deserters from the army of progress who dragged out their span of human existence there i should like to know what you are thinking about marjorie asked noting with a childs acumen the changed expression of his face i am thinking about england about the hard battles some english men and women have to go through with a night like this said geff brings sharp thoughts before one of ones own life ones own uselessness in an instant marjorie was softened tears almost rushed to her eyes her thoughts true to her better self followed geoffreys as if by instinct then the good impulse passed it entered her wilful head that this excellent young gentleman from cambridge meant to sermonise her she resolved to shock him i used to feel goody goody myself very long ago you would not believe it sir but as a child i was pious i believe it thoroughly answered geff grave of countenance when i wanted my lettuce seed to come up i would perform little acts of propitiatory contrition to pouche the poor old pouche who lives in cambridge now when grandpapa went out shooting i carried his game bag and used to offer fervent prayers whenever the dogs came to a point that he might kill his bird facts undermined my faith sometimes the point was false sometimes grandpapa missed his aim chaffinches and slugs ate my lettuce seed i turned infidel i have remained one grandpapa says i have the hardest flint soul in or out of christendom still that is one bartrand judging of another i am not a bartrand remarked geff arbuthnot i do not think you have a hard flint soul you believe in wishes addressed to a strip of new moon for instance they were standing at the highest point of tintajeux a small plateau the approach to which was fashioned on the exploded system of puzzle or maze long before marjories lifetime this plateau who shall say on what morning of youthful human hope had been christened arcadia the country folk around tintajeux called it arcadia still cool draughts of air were stirring from the moorland they brought fragrance of distant hayfields honeyed whiffs of the syringa hedges that formed the maze would marjorie ever curtsey to future moons without the scent of hay the over sweetness of blown syringa returning on her senses some day observed geff as she maintained a caustic silence i mean you to tell me what you wished for a quarter of an hour ago under the cedars marjorie bartrand turned from him the determination of a long lineage of dead high tempered bartrands on her face to command implied or spoken had she never yet bowed during her seventeen years of life without asking the reason why she asked nothing now her cheeks happily the starlight betrayed no secrets were glowing damask for the girl knew deep in her fiery heart what the wish was a wish by no means unconnected with her feelings towards geoffrey arbuthnot chapter vii on the brink of a flirtation meanwhile the solstice night grew at each instant more purple more mysterious geff felt himself in love with midsummer starlight with guernsey with tintajeux marjorie he would fain have engaged for a game of hide and seek among the neighbouring orchards or of follow my leader along the beach white in the crescent moons shining for what was this poor small heiress but a child with a childs cold sweet unopened heart a childs quick temper a childs readiness for play in whatever shape play might happen to be offered her you will not tell me your wish to night miss bartrand never mind you will tell it me some day to show you i bear no malice you shall hear mine my present wish as i must leave tintajeux is to return to millers hotel by the longest road possible you could point it out to me i should rather think so cried marjorie brusquely if you dont mind a quarter of an hours nice hard scramble your plan is to go up the gros nez cliffs about a mile from this and so back to your hotel along the edge of the steep you are tolerably steady on the legs i suppose tolerably a too shallow purse a too well endowed brain had combined to force geoffrey arbuthnot out of the ranks of the big and world renowned athletes but ask the all england football team ask the men against whom the all england football team has played if arbuthnot of johns be tolerably steady on his legs i dont know that i am unusually feeble miss bartrand my weakness perhaps is more of the nerves than the limbs point out some path to me that you and the seigneur are in the habit of treading assure me on your honour that you think that path safe and perhaps i shall have courage to attempt it well when you get free of tintajeux you must go straight across the corner of the moor to les hets at the end of a few hundred yards you will find four water lanes meet you must take the one that seems to lead away from petersport and follow it until you get to tibot you know tibot of course i am shamefully ignorant miss bartrand i do not know tibot after that a brisk two minutes walk down down through spongy wet earth churning at every step over your ankles brings you to the shore right in face of you are the gros nez heights and if you get to the top all right even in broad day it is not considered a very safe climb for strangers your road home will lie straight before you along the edge of the cliffs geff arbuthnot clasped his forehead when i get clear of tintajeux i must go across the moor to an unpronounceable place where four water lanes meet of these i must choose the one that looks least likely to lead anywhere then down down through spongy wet earth churning up to my ankles at every step until i catch sight of the cliffs where i shall finally break my neck miss bartrand will you allow me to ask a favour doubtless a gleam of white teeth showed the heartiness of the girls amusement it rests with me though she added maliciously to say yes or no to it unfortunately it rests always with feminine caprice to say yes or no to the proposals made by men the hour or the moonlight or some curiously occult and unknown influence must have been telling on arbuthnot of johns he stood on the brink of a flirtation as you may have proved to your cost sir thought marjorie not quite without a movement of pity as you may have proved in that hour i wonder how many years ago when the devonshire peasant girl decided on becoming mrs geoffrey arbuthnot and my proposal is that you come with me at least as far as the unpronounceable meeting of the water lanes start me on my downward spongy way to the sea and then unless i descend too quickly from the gros nez cliffs i shall have a fair chance of finding my road home to an agonised wife it might be so mixed is human happiness thought marjorie ironically to the least little domestic lecture on the subject of late hours feminine caprice she observed gravely is in your favour for once mr arbuthnot i will look after your interests as far as tibot after that your fate will be in your own hands on the outside chance of your getting back alive to your hotel i may as well present you with some rather better flowers she flitted about moth fashion from one garden plot to another ever rifling the choicest and sweetest bloom of each for her basket afterwards the lodge gates passed she accompanied geoffrey across a strip of common land and down a few hundred yards of darksome lane to the hets from which point the trickle of a little moorland stream guided them to tibot here emerging into such light as the young moon yielded the moment came for bidding good night and here an exceedingly delicate question in social tactics presented itself with force to marjories attention what decorous but strictly indirect message ought to accompany her gift of flowers to geoffrey arbuthnots wife you dont mind carrying things i hope sir as long as they are not from the butchers or done up in a brown paper parcel guernsey is not cambridge you know grandpapa and i carry everything on the end of our walking stick from a conger eel downwards i will carry a conger eel for you any day with delight said geoffrey i shall remember that speech i shall present you with a conger eel four feet long in the market and watch to see you carry him to your hotel to night i only want you to take these flowers for me to to some one in the town observed marjorie with staid composure but she was in no courageous mood really she listened as though she would ask counsel of it to the familiar little black veined moor stream eddying away with chill clear voice to the sea you have only to command me said geoffrey with an absurd a reasonless sense of personal disappointment and i obey the address of your friend is you will have no difficulty about the address indeed i am afraid stammered marjorie that at present for another few days i have scarcely a right to speak of the person as my friend the difficulty is sir how will you carry the flowers in your hands you say a man who would climb gros nez cliffs must pretty nearly hang on by his eyelashes like the heroes in jules vernes stories at times he wants as firm a grip i can tell you as all his ten fingers can give if i surmount these terrific perils if i reach petersport safely your flowers will share my fate dont be anxious about them miss bartrand marjorie paused her face set and thoughtful after a minute or two with the unconsciousness of self the ignorance of possible misconstruction which rendered her actions so absolutely the actions of a child she unloosened her waist ribbon a length of twine lay in her basket with this she bound the flower stalks firmly together then knotting her ribbon she attached it in a long loop to the bouquet before setting foot on the cliffs you must pass the loop round your neck so for geffs better guidance she pantomimed her instructions round her own girlish throat by that contrivance you leave your hands free and you must take care of my ribbon if you please sir and bring it back next lesson it is a bit of real spanish peasant ribbon one of my cousins bought for me in cadiz a thing not to be replaced in these parts of the world good night mr arbuthnot you have not said half enough you have not even told me whom your flowers are for my flowers are for a person i hope before long to know and like well the description is tantalising it would scarcely furnish me i fear with the one name and address of the person wanted among all the narrow twisting streets of petersport the flowers are mr arbuthnot cannot you guess for whom they are meant i am ill at originating ideas miss bartrand i can guess nothing because you cannot or will not which because i cannot because i am blankly unimaginative for a few moments marjorie stood masterfully inactive then she flew discreetly back into the shadow of the lane on a slightly rising mound she stopped what light there was touched the upper half of her face and geoffrey could see her eyes he knew that her mood for marjorie bartrand was a softened one the flowers are for yourself mr arbuthnot so her voice rang through the sea scented night for your better self you understand dont lose my ribbon and if you can help it dont fall over the gros nez cliffs good night and with a wave of her hand though he was blankly unimaginative geoffrey believed it might be with a wafted kiss from her finger tips she disappeared geff arbuthnots first experience in snubbing had come to an end pondering over many things most of all over the cruelties and caprices of youthful woman he ran lightly down the ankle deep water lane then across a miniature bay of argent shell strewn sands to the base of gros nez cliffs the ridge rose sheer above his head a dark wall of over a hundred and fifty feet polished as glass to the limit of the breakers but above that line fissured lichened rough miss bartrands sarcasm had not exaggerated the gravity of the ascent the man who in an uncertain light should successfully scale gros nez must have not only his hands and feet but his wits thoroughly under command and here the loop of ribbon attached to marjories flowers proved of great use i have tried to represent in geoffrey a man little moved by the nicer shades of cultivated or hothouse feeling a man more likely to be wrapped up in one grim fact of the mortuary or dissecting room than in all the pretty uncertainties of sentiment put together but to night a change had certainly passed over him before beginning his climb he found a delicate pleasure in suspending marjories bouquet exactly in the mode her fingers had taught him round his neck he found a pleasure the cliffs dizzy height hardly won in unknotting her ribbon smoothing it out from its creases with a hand unversed in millinery tasks finally in hiding it away jealously in the breast pocket of his jacket concerning this jealousy he asked himself neither why nor wherefore in transitional moments like these an old tender image fading even as a new one rises above the horizon few of us in our inmost thoughts care to be motive seekers geoffrey knew that he would not for an empire have let dinah see that ribbon to night or any other night he knew that between him and the little girl with carved sweet lips and ebon hair there existed a secret he knew that tutoring was a far pleasanter business than he had bargained for also that the flowers marjorie had given him and which he carried in his hand smelt of tintajeux but he took out his embroidered tobacco pouch his short black briar notwithstanding he smoked his cavendish vigorously as he trudged back to petersport arbuthnot of johns might stand on the brink of a flirtation he was not as yet in a state that need occasion a mans staunchest bachelor friends anxiety chapter viii cross stitch dinah was still busied over her embroidery frame when geoffreys entrance brought the coolness of the night the wholesome odour of heliotropes and roses into the chronically dinner oppressed atmosphere of millers hotel her blonde youthful face looked weary the lightless far away expression which you may always observe as a result of unshed tears was in the glance she lifted to geff what you are up still do you know that it is past eleven mrs arbuthnot four years ago when geoffrey first saw gaston and dinah in the bloom of wedded happiness not two months old it was decreed by gaston least jealous of men that his wife and cousin should call each other by their christian names upon dinahs joyous lips geoffrey without an effort became at once a familiar household word dear good old geff through whom obliquely her introduction to the husband she passionately loved had come about but geoffrey after a few stammering painful efforts abandoned the calling of dinah by her christian name for ever he could and did call her so to gaston only he intended to stand by her heroically absent or in her presence intended god helping him to be the good brotherly influence of her life and of her husbands looking upon the eyes that met his with such cruel self possession upon the lips which he had once madly coveted to press geoffrey arbuthnot realised that he could never feel towards dinah as a brother feels he resolved that his speech knowingly should not play traitor to his heart gastons wife must for him be coldly stiffly conventionally mrs arbuthnot until his lifes end yes i am up still geff theres no chance of seeing gaston till long past midnight a lady like mrs thorne accustomed to india and indian military society said dinah would be sure to keep late hours so i thought i would shade my poppies straight through i must wait for daylight to put in the pinks and scarlets crossing to the table where dinah was laboriously stitching geoffrey seated himself at her side he looked attentively down at her work with those acute deep browed gray eyes of his your embroidery is very he was about to say beautiful but checked himself the star strewn night the hay scents along the cliffs the roses of tintajeux were in his soul lifting it above sympathy with poor dinahs wool work your embroidery is very delicate and smooth he went on truthfully and how quick you are about it you only began the top yellow rose when i stayed with you and gaston i recollect last easter dinahs pieces of work were on a scale that carried one back to the female industry of the middle ages yet was their ultimate use nebulous vast ottomans vast cushions yards of curtain border imply a mansion and the arbuthnots mansion at present existed not but on what else should a childless woman cut off from household duties not over fond of books forlornly destitute of acquaintance and with an ever absent husband employ herself once long ago the poor girl made gaston a set of shirts as a birthday surprise these shirts were lovingly exquisitely stitched as dinah thurston had been taught to stitch in her childhood they were also a consummate failure as a monument of patience he observed they were beyond praise as a fit well said gaston kissing her cheek in careless gratitude it is not a case of eureka he never wore them never knew on what day in what manner his wife fired by sharp disappointment got them out of existence simply the shirts did not adjust themselves well round his gaston arbuthnots shapely throat it was not a case of eureka the subject interested him no farther plain sewing for grown men and women dinah promptly decided was fruitless labour of dressmaking proper gaston would never excusably perhaps suffer a trace in his rooms and so the sweet fashioning of tiny childrens clothes not belonging to her lot dinah arbuthnot it would seem had no choice no refuge on the planet she inhabited but cross stitch at moments of more than common loneliness she would feel that her life was being recorded mournfully for a life of two and twenty in these large and not artistic embroideries it seemed as though she stitched with a double thread as though a dull strand of autobiography for ever intertwined itself among the flaunting roses the impossible auriculas and poppies that grew beneath her hands the piece at which she now worked was begun in london at a time when gaston used to dine out regularly every night of his life and when his days from various art callings were perforce spent apart from her as geoffrey spoke she could see her st johns wood lodging her afternoon walks in the regents park worked gloomily in with every shade of those topmost yellow roses after london came a short stay at weymouth here gaston had a convict study to make on order and with his usual good luck discovered he knew several capital fellows in the regiment quartered at portland the capital fellows naturally delighted in having the versatile artist at mess and dinah passed almost as many lonely evenings as she had done in london it was in weymouth she remembered that her auriculas her impossible auriculas began to take colour and shape and now in guernsey the heavy drops gathered in dinah arbuthnots eyes pushing her work frame away she turned to geoffrey the lamp shone on her full the delicate outlines of her cheek and throat stood out before him in startling whiteness and so you have come back from your coaching geff her tone was quiet long practice had taught dinah to repress that sound detested by gaston as by all husbands tears in the voice how do you like the sensation of being snubbed by an heiress pretty well i thank you said geff snubbing as you know mrs arbuthnot is a sensation i got used to in my youth was the heiress very bad did she make you feel miserably uncomfortable no i cannot go so far as that i cannot say that i felt miserably uncomfortable but you dont care for her if you keep the work on it will not be for pleasure dinahs heart was fuller than it could hold with love for her husband geoffrey was nothing to her except the best friend that she and gaston possessed yet she asked this question quickly with interest in her secret consciousness it was an accepted fear perhaps though dinah knew it not that geoffrey would never care as men care who mean to marry for any girl work that is to be decently done must always be done for pleasure it was geff arbuthnot who uttered the aphorism and your evening snubbing and all has been passed pleasantly i have breathed ampler air geoffrey made evasive apology man like i have seen more blue sea and sky than ever in my life before miss bartrands snubbing was not beyond my strength the seigneur of tintajeux is a specimen of the old scholarly high and dry parson worth walking any number of guernsey miles to see some day mrs arbuthnot i shall take you with me to tintajeux to come in for my share of snubbing too dinah asked the question faintly colouring marjorie is a frank generous hearted child you cannot think of her in the light of a grown up woman she is a bartrand with the faults and virtues of her inheritance the faults pride and temper visibly on the surface i am very sure added geff bending his head as though to examine the intricate shading of dinahs poppies that you and marjorie bartrand might be fast friends if you chose i have no friends said dinah except my own people down home of whom in truth gaston allowed her to see little enoughand and you geff the voice was unfaltering the full good mouth was steady dinah made the admission not as a matter of complaint but of fact and geoffreys heart fired that friendlessness is the one huge mistake of your life he exclaimed gaston is not selfish would not be selfish unless your unselfishness forced him into being so you should never have allowed this morbid love of solitude to grow on you you ought to assert yourself to go into the world at gastons side whether you like it or not i should not like it now when i was a girl when we first married my heart was light against what it is now it was the end of the london season you remember no i dont suppose you do did he not though that late july time when after seeing the marriage ceremony over he went back to his scholars attic in johns that long vacation when the skies were brazen to him when day and night alike were one feverish pain it was the end of the london season and when gaston took me to the opera and twice down to dinner at richmond i did feel confessed dinah with humility that i had it in me to be fond of junketing oh geff theres one of my country words luckily gaston cant hear it of pleasure i mean and society but the taste has died of what lingering cruel death who should know better than geoffrey ladies of my husbands class have not called upon me i have neither rank talent nor a million without these gaston says no woman can make her way in the english world hot words were ready to rush from geoffreys lips but he kept them back to remain on equal terms with husband and wife in this strange triangular friendship did sorely tax his powers of self repression at times gaston would rejoice in knowing that your life was cheerfuller no matter how the cheerfulness was brought about he has told me so often now here in guernsey eight sea going hours removed said geff lightly from english philistinism what should hinder you from joining in any little bit of junketing that may offer itself the hindrance of having no introduction to the guernsey ladies mrs thorne has called on you on gaston he is dining with them now he will dine with them four evenings a week yes dinahs voice fell i know at a glance the kind of clever person who will amuse my husband mrs thorne is one of them she is magnetic with the magnetism that repels rather than attracts remarked geff that is your feeling about her you and gaston would be safe not to admire the same woman geoffrey arbuthnot was mute although his face was too sunburnt to admit of visible deepening in hue it may be that just then geoffrey arbuthnot blushed you have no change in your character you could be content a happy thing for your wife whenever mrs geoffrey appears on the scene with one mood one voice one face day after day before you for forty years is not that true i am not an artist said geff after a pause for a humdrum man prosaically occupied the one face mrs arbuthnot the one voice ah fool that he was his own voice trembled might constitute as much happiness as we are likely to taste any of us this side death and gaston is an artist in every fibre poor dinahs estimate of mr gaston arbuthnot was invariably mr gaston arbuthnots except that she believed in him a vast deal more than he believed in himself i ought to know that my dull days my silent evenings are matters of course it is not gastons fault that he can only get inspiration through change some day when the world is bowing down before a really great work of his my hour of triumph will come who knows geff if gaston had married in his own class if he and his wife had led just the usual life of people in society it may be his genius would not have fared so well dinah never looked more perilously lovely than when with flushed cheeks and kindling eyes she spoke aloud of her ambitions for her husband the poor girls whole life lay in her one passionate oft bruised affection more than common beauty a look of divine all hoping all forgiving love shone on her face at this instant geff arbuthnot recollected it wanted only ten seconds to midnight and that he must fly had not long habit trained him to recognise the moment when flight was his surest his only wisdom you and gaston understand each other as no third person can hope to do mrs arbuthnot i consider you the two happiest mortals alive though perhaps you do not know the extent of your own happiness and you are off to your pillow to dream of the heiress who has not snubbed you said dinah as he moved from her side why geff for the first time she caught sight of the bouquet somewhat cunningly held in shadow hitherto what roses what jasmines what heliotropes i have been wondering all this time what made the room so sweet and speaking thus she stretched forth her hand for marjorie bartrands flowers during nearly four years a portentously large slice of life under five and twenty it had been one long case of give and take between geoffrey and dinah the take invariably on dinahs side she took his heart from him to start with she took the happiness out of his youth silently unrecognised geoffrey constituted himself her knight errant in the hour of his own sharpest pain till her death dinah could never know the part played by geoffrey at the time of her engagement and marriage in a hundred ways he had since steadied her husband in the path of right by a hundred unselfish actions he had smoothed nascent domestic discontents any one of which might have worked mortal havoc with dinahs peace she had received all his devotion a prevalent weakness it is to be feared among gentle unimaginative women of her type as the simplest thing in the world if dinah as once there was promise had had children doubt not that her moral nature must have widened but this was not to be a tiny dying creature held between weak arms for half a day some yellowing never used baby clothes jealously hidden out of gastons sight a kiss stolen when her husband was not by to see from any fair cottage babe she might chance to come across in her walk this much and no more was dinah to know of motherhood and the love blindly centred on gaston had in it an element which although the word is hard must in justice be called selfishness nothing gaston likes so well as the smell of flowers on his breakfast table and dinah still carelessly held out her hand in a receptive attitude he says his brain must be like the brains of dogs or deer smell colours all his thoughts you will see geff those heliotropes and roses will just set him kneading some new idea into clay to morrow morning but the heliotropes and the roses did not quit geoffreys hand in this moment ay while dinah was speaking a current of new keen healthful life had swept through him he felt more thoroughly master of himself than he had done since that may evening when he first blindly surrendered his will with his heart to a blonde girl watering flowers through a casement window at lesser cheriton marjories roses fresh from her pure touch a friendly gift from the world scorning child who somehow looked upon her tutor as out of the scope of scorn were his if gaston needed inspiration from flower scents doctor thornes garden any other garden than that of the seigneur of tintajeux must supply the inspiration he made a dexterous exit rushed away boy fashion light of spirit three steps at a time to his own room and before half a minute was over dinah arbuthnot had forgotten him poor old faithful geff his lesson giving his heiress his bouquet what were these nay what were the alien concerns of the universe to a pathetically tender soul quick smarting under its own immediate and narrow pain had linda thorne the power of holding an artists restless fancy captive the genius of making time pass swiftly the talent of clever talk of giving genial little dinners of dressing perfectly above all was she a woman to expect nothing whatever in return for her devotion a woman strong enough to be philosophical even towards a rival who should vanquish her in her own world with her own weapons if she were thus gifted dinah moved to the window and looked out across the hotel garden to a point between an opening in the trees where the sea showed blue and foamless if linda thorne were thus gifted then might to night be taken as a foretaste of what the next six weeks the bloom and glory of a mid channel summer had in store for herself chapter ix half way towards little go sixties and forties are traditions happily of the past although sarnian spinsters may still go out to tea with a maid and a hand lanthorn the number of their candles is no longer a rigorous type of their social condition but the society of an island twelve miles long by four broad must always be cousin german to the society of a ship wherever choice is circumscribed human nature tends to eclecticism sixties and forties may have had their day a stranger is amazed still at the number of island families who do not visit other island families seemingly from hereditary topographical reasons the eastern people have not much to say to those of the west the country districts hold scanty intercourse with the townsfolk at the time i write of the remote little peninsula of tintajeux was probably the most exclusive parish in the island while we were on terms with the rector of noirmont we had four people in our set marjorie would say the rector of noirmont his wife the seigneur of tintajeux marjorie bartrand since grandpapa and m noirmont had their big latin fight we have split up into further faction our set consists of the seigneur of tintajeux and marjorie bartrand we are a nation of two of the things done and left undone by the petersport inhabitants this nation of two was ofttimes as ignorant as though some dark continent divided them the dances picnics military bands garden parties and general gossip of urban life concerned the bartrands languidly old andros had his farming his dogs his classic authors and a curiously mixed performance which he called parochial work to occupy him marjorie had her study a boat fishing tackle gardening tools in days not so very far distant had a carpenters bench all the wholesome outdoor interests of a country nurtured child if cassandra tighe chanced occasionally to rattle round in her village cart and communicate to them the last town news they heard it rarely otherwise it thus happened cassandra remaining away with her nets and her sea monsters in sark that the comedy in course of rehearsal between geff and marjorie went on for several days without interruption the master and pupil met seldom save during the hours of work when geff professionally severe discouraged idle conversation it did not become easier to marjorie than it had seemed on the first night of their acquaintance to say the words your wife the terms on which they met were frank slightly stiffer perhaps under the broad sun of noon than they had been among the syringa blossoms by starlight they stood on the outside at least in the position of any commonly dense freshman and of a coach conscientiously minded to get his man if possible through previous on the outside growing to know marjories transparent nature better and better deriving keen refreshment from the badly trained fine intelligence which might have risen so high above the commonly dense freshmans level geoffrey grew hourly more sensible that their seasons for meeting were ower lang o comin that each intervening day was a space of time to be lived through at this point stood geff secure she was fain to think contented in the knowledge of a mrs arbuthnots existence marjorie worked with an unstinted zeal a vivid delight such as the whole defunct race of governesses morning or resident had failed to awaken in her so things progressed through half a dozen lessons then one sunless afternoon sky and sea and speck of island painted in half tones misty dubious as the happiness of human life came the rattle as of a score of chained captives along the avenue of tintajeux marjorie pacing up and down the schoolroom as she boldly struggled with the irregularities of a greek verb recognised the sound of cassandras cart wheels pushing delectus and exercise books aside she ran forth joyfully to meet her friend had not important news to be told our cambridge ba thinking good things possible in the direction of girton the emancipation of those benighted spanish women who only know how to manage their house or fold their mantilla gracefully a few prospective inches advanced you are inkier than ever marjorie bartrand this was miss tighes first personal observation thrown back over her shoulder as she knotted midge the unkempt brittany pony to a rail with one of the sundry odds and ends of rope stowed away in readiness within that all containing cart of hers only about the wrists marjorie pleaded holding out the sleeve of her holland pinafore but i dont see that university teaching puts flesh on your bones you are growing too much like that picture of your mother eyes are all very well especially handsome ones but one wants something more than eyes in a face you would have done much better who shall say cassandra was not right much better to come with annette and me to sark jelly fish hunting the speech gave an impression of being double shotted but marjorie with unwonted meekness made no retort until she and her visitor were within shelter of the drawing room there in the familiar presence of the buhl cupids of the miniature bartrands who had danced loved or hated each other and gone to the guillotine with such easy grace the girl felt herself protected oh marjorie from what dim vision of a sin could that white soul need protection she began the story of her days and of her intercourse with geff arbuthnot bravely i feel half way towards little go miss tighe i get my six hours teaching a week and you have always had teaching in abundance remarked cassandra wilfully misinterpreting her since you were twelve you have had madame briquebec six hours a week madame briquebec a music mistress six hours lessons and twelve hours practice it would require a cambridge mathematician observed cassandra to reckon how many years solid capital out of a lifetime are given by young women to such an instrument as the piano i am not talking of the piano as you know miss tighe cried marjorie the heart within her rallying at the scent of coming strife i never practised less for poor old madame briquebec than i do now i talk of my six hours solid reading with mr arbuthnot ah i trust you find mr arbuthnot solidly satisfactory my tutor thinks well of my staying power mr arbuthnot sees no reason why if i gave my life up to it for four years i should not some day come out low in a tripos mr arbuthnot like the rest of the world knows perhaps upon which side his bread is buttered the suggestion was cassandras bread buttered let me tell you maam i think that a most harsh speech yes cried marjorie bartrand her face aflame and verging on spiteful a speech most unworthy of cassandra tighe to my mind the subject scarcely necessitates so much indignation marjorie and to mine it does if you implied anything it must be that mr arbuthnot flatters me from motives of self interest which is vile old cassandra took off her leather driving gloves she pressed out their folds slowly then she examined a signet ring masculine in size and device which was always worn by her on the third finger of the left hand mr arbuthnot comes to visit you professionally three days a week speaking thus she did not lift her eyes to the young girls face he comes to tintajeux at other times naturally he came on that first evening when we engaged him i mean when mr arbuthnot was good enough to promise to read with me it was fine warm weather you must remember the night before you left for sark grandpapa invited mr arbuthnot to drink tea with us and afterwards i walked as far as the hets to put him on the right track for getting home by gros nez he speaks to you frequently of the poor stay at home griselda wife i make no doubt the blood rose up less at the question than at cassandras way of putting it to marjories cheeks my tutor has never spoken to me of mrs arbuthnot you decided miss tighe that day when we talked it over under the cedars that there might be an indelicacy in my mentioning her too abruptly and during our hours of reading we work and work hard i think said marjorie lifting her small face aloft that as regards the learning of classics and euclid it matters nothing to me whether mrs geoffrey arbuthnot stay at home or walk abroad mrs geoffrey repeated cassandra oh that certainly is not the name i may have led you wrong in the first instance geoffrey is not the name of the man people talk so much about marjorie walked off to the schoolroom from whence she presently returned with geoffreys card one that he had enclosed in his first stiff business note to the heiress of tintajeux samson samuel cyril i am nearly sure of samson mused cassandra accuracy as to names and dates was a kind of heirloom in our family the name of my coach is geoffrey said marjorie bartrand behold it miss tighe in black and white geoffrey arbuthnot ba cantab i cannot make this out at all the whole thing is so fresh in my memory coming up from the harbour i called in at millers it was but human to ask that poor weak unreliable woman about her throat well although she has swallowed dr thornes drugs marjorie she is recovering nature is so perverse in these chronic invalids recovering sufficiently to retail a fruity bit of gossip which miss tighe enjoyed i wonder whether the world was as scandal loving in your days said marjorie addressing the calm eyed group of bartrands beside the chimneypiece you were not a moral generation perhaps when glass heads were universal stone throwing was less in vogue poor mrs miller threw no stones she told me plain and sad facts about these young arbuthnot people the husband for ever philandering in the train of certain idle ladies belonging to our island society the wife watching up for him till all hours of the morning people very naturally speculating right and left but cassandra tighe stopped short like an arrow from a bow marjories slip of a figure had shot across the drawing room she stood at her old friends knee a pair of eyes glowing with all the force of strong fiery yet most generous temper looked down upon cassandras face i hate the speculations of malicious tongues miss tighe i will never believe that geoffrey arbuthnot philanders whatever the term means or treats his wife neglectfully i know him to be manly straightforward true i think griselda ought to be happy oh happy quite beyond the common lot the last words were not uttered without a quiver of marjorie bartrands lip miss tighe finished we may well believe with the theme of love and lovers some thirty five or forty years before the present time was the subject ever of vital personal moment to her a jealously worn signet ring the portrait of a scarlet coated dark eyed lad that hung in her drawing room were the only evidence to warrant intimate friends in hazarding a tentative yes her present interests said the people of a young and irreverent generation were of fish fishy are fibres discernible under the microscope in a dogfishs brain can a mollusc see or only distinguish between light and darkness one thing was certain in cassandra tighes breast lingered all tender all womanly sympathy in the troubles of humanity at large and something in marjories voice touched her not to distrust but compassion she looked with the pain that is half foreboding at the young girls ardent indignant face marjorie bartrand we are old friends you always take the lectures i give you in good part i may do so occasionally miss tighe very occasionally let us keep to facts i hope you will take a little lecture in good part now drive to petersport to morrow and call on mrs samson arbuthnot mrs geoffrey arbuthnot with so many fables afloat let us snatch maam pray at whatever truth we may mrs geoffrey if you choose although my conviction is unshaken drive in to petersport to morrow call upon your tutors wife remember her want of birth and education imagine a little excusable jealousy put yourself in short in her place and i am sure your good heart i have no heart grandpapa the whole of my governesses have impressed that upon me often your good common sense then will teach you how you can best befriend her that is my lecture marjorie moved away into the nearest window she looked out athwart garden orchard moor towards the atlantic gray sullen as though the season had gone back from june to december a sense of deeply wounded pride of cruel inexplicable disappointment mingled in the girls heart i ought to have done the right thing so she communed with herself i ought to have done it at once i have just drifted into meanness as though it could matter to us bartrands if every woman in the island declined to call on mrs arbuthnot it was you miss tighe she turned round incisively on cassandra who preached to me the gospel of mammon and one hears such nice things said of her poor dear the faults are so obviously the husbands really if i could have known all one knows now my wisest advice would have been keep clear of them both in these prickly affairs in anything connected with a msalliance you are pretty sure to get your hand stung whichever way you grasp your nettle too late in the day for pensive regrets miss tighe i have not kept clear of mr geoffrey arbuthnot the more the pity as matters stand marjorie i know that your conduct will be full of the sweetest tact we have a few old fashioned rules said good well meaning cassandra to guide us in our perplexities the first is to do unto others as we would they should do unto us to day is not sunday marjories foot tapped a quick little tune on the polished floor please dont let us have sunday talk how should we feel if we were mrs arbuthnot if you were mrs arbuthnot how would you wish marjorie bartrand should do unto you cassandras tone was plaintively sentimental infalliblest tone of all to stir up mischief never far from the surface in marjorie bartrands heart how should i feel if i were mrs arbuthnot wish that i had my precious liberty back of course and envy every girl i met hers the natural feelings one would hope of all well conducted sensible married women ah ejaculated marjorie folding her lithe arms and with darkness like that of a swiftly gathered thunder cloud on her southern face and to hear people talk as though such things as roaming husbands and weeping wives were necessities as though the doom of the serpent was laid upon every son and daughter of adam a dieu ne plaise that it should be so there is one girl striking her breast emphatically in her british majestys dominions who will shed tears for no man while she lives we will hope so marjorie said cassandra as she put on her driving gloves a good many of us have held the same opinions at seventeen and yet had occasion to modify them later on chapter x they say but the thunder shower soon broke the blue sky showed beyond tears marjorie bartrand shed none what sorrows had she of her own what sweetheart philandering or otherwise to weep for in regard of geoffreys unknown wife her brief lived cynicism shifted ere cassandra had been gone an hour into most genuine most girl like pity after an outburst of temper however scornful or unjust there was ever in marjories heart a pungent and fiery fidelity which led her back straight as magnet to steel to her better self that she should be disappointed in geoffreys character was she told herself inevitable what is there in any man that one should not on close acquaintance be disappointed in him she had thought judging from frank and plainly given confidences that she knew to a minute how her tutors time was passed here in guernsey a little hospital work daily geff having met an old college friend in the house surgeon a little study for his next cambridge exam a good deal of boating a good many walks round the island three days a week his reading with herself at tintajeux the picture had been a clear a pleasant one in marjories sight and now matter so alien as this of fashionable fine ladies midnight domestic scenes idlers speculating right and left must come unwelcome and ugly blots on the canvas she was disappointed in geoffrey personally she felt with the certainty of her age that she could not work under him again with the bright unblemished interest of the past days the change of feeling should be made up marjorie determined by kindness shown to his wife on mrs arbuthnot she pledged herself to call to morrow meantime yes during the forenoon lesson she would assume a sterner manner towards this recreant husband this sober mannered student who after all one hoped of him was so little raised at heart above the pitiful vanities of his sex and in the first place her own waist ribbon must be summarily returned this was marjories resolve when her head rested on its pillow the waist ribbon which for fear of wounding geoffreys feelings his wifes perhaps vicariously she had suffered her tutor to keep must be returned looking upon him in this new alas to marjories experienced mind this too familiar character of a philanderer she could imagine him married though he was exhibiting that bit of ribbon among his companions as a trophy a gift dont you know bestowed on one by a fair hand that shall be nameless or he might show it among the idle fine ladies oh the hot shame at marjories sleepy heart the idle ladies in whose train he followed while his wife ignorant of euclid or greek but not devoid of human nature shed tears not one single drop whereof the man was worthy at home marjorie bartrand fell asleep in a state of the most pointed and virtuous indignation morning brought her back as it brings back all of us not to accidental emotion but to the common habit of life her habit was to rise the moment her eyes unclosed open her window and gladly welcome the new day she did so now standing in her white night dress the elastic air blowing on her face she looked across a corner of the orchard to the spot where geoffrey the crescent moon shining plucked the briar roses above her reach away in the distant fields she saw the reverend andros as he walked to and fro with firm slow step among his men on her dressing table lay an algebra paper always her hardest work which she intended resolutely to floor before her tutors coming how sweet life was thought the little girl how full of fine things that no mans hand can take from us might it not be wisdom even in a mrs geoffrey arbuthnot as she had committed the error of marriage to make the best of it enjoy the sun that shone the wind that blew by day and look upon sleep not weeping as the state for which nature designs our race at midnight after a swim in the bay a brisk run up to the manoir marjorie with hunger befitting her years kept her grandfather in excellent countenance at his breakfast a solid country meal at which broiled fish ham and eggs from the farmyard home made rolls and guernsey buttered cake predominated then she went to the schoolroom and long before a figure she watched for rose above the moors horizon had got the better of her paper her wits were at their brightest this morning geoffrey arbuthnot for the first time since they had known each other threw out a few crumbs of praise when the reading closed crumbs of plain household bread be it understood no sugar no spice but that caused marjories heart to beat the blood to leap swiftly into her mobile all confessing face geff watched her with admiration he sought not to hide they had been working under the cedars as was their custom in these fair summer forenoons a solitary beam of sunlight pierced the thick and odorous shade it fell full on marjorie looking more like a child than usual in an unadorned cotton frock and with her silky raven hair spread out to dry unconfined by comb or ribbon over her shoulders the endowments of life certainly dont go to those who need them most geff gave utterance to the truism with the want of preface that was his habit many a pale faced hard working village schoolmistress would have her path smoothened by possessing a tenth part of your brains while for you the words were leaving his lips in blunt fidelity they were not well considered words perhaps which of us can stand on mental tiptoe every hour of the twenty four but they were about as innocent of premeditated flattery as was ever speech offered by man to civilised woman marjorie interrupted him shortly dormant indignation against poor geff as a frequenter of idle society a midnight reveller a careless husband flaming forth on him lightning wise for me marjorie bartrand living on rose leaves in tintajeux manoir oh i should be equally charming with brains or without them should not i thank you immensely for the compliment sir if i could change places i would rather be the village schoolmistress plainly doing her days work for her days wages than live idly on all the rose leaves all the flatteries the world could heap together then lifting her eyes a look in them to pierce a guilty mans soul at what time should i be likely to find mrs arbuthnot at home she asked him with cold directness i shall drive in to millers hotel i shall call on mrs arbuthnot this afternoon a flush of undisguised pleasure went over geoffreys face all these days he had hoped that some offer of the kind would come from marjorie not doubting that in this small island rumours of dinahs beauty perhaps of dinahs troubles must have reached as far as tintajeux i am afraid mrs arbuthnot is to be found at home at most hours so i am told dinah goes out too little in this fine june weather mrs arbuthnot must amend her ways to day is our guernsey rose show there will be military bands playing dandies promenading said miss bartrand witheringly as she glanced at geffs undandified figure fine ladies thinking and talking of everything under gods sun save the roses some of mrs arbuthnots friends will surely tempt her to join the gay crowd in the arsenal dinah has no friends i mean we have been too short a time in guernsey to look for many callers in the matter of visiting cards ladies i am told are prone to be sequacious so did geff with single minded good will seek to round off the edges of dinah arbuthnots isolation of gastons neglect and yet they say cried marjorie her heart palpitating well nigh to pain that mrs arbuthnots husband has acquaintance without stint you must not believe half they say when men and womens domestic concerns are the theme of conversation mrs arbuthnots husband chanced to meet accidentally with a doctor and mrs thorne here the lady was a friend of former student days in paris it was the kind of meeting added geff apologetically in which a man has no choice but to renew an acquaintance and and linda thorne of course has called upon mrs arbuthnot the question came like a sword thrust from marjorie bartrand i i am afraid not yet answered geoffrey with hesitation gastons careless conduct in regard of dinah was just the one subject that could occasion straightforward geoffreys tongue to stammer ah linda thorne has not called on mrs arbuthnot that lowers ones opinion mused marjorie not too high at any time of linda thorne when you meet dinah you will see that she is a woman to care little for the common run of morning callers i shall endeavour just the same to make her care for me marjories tones were icy a swell of curiously mixed feeling was in her breast endeavour will not be needed i never made too sure said geff modestly that you would pay this visit but i know that dinah in her heart is more than prepared to bid you welcome he rose visibly reluctant from the cool greensward then with a sense that some subtle intangible change had crept into his relations with his pupil geff prepared to take his leave but perilous stuff had yet to be dislodged from marjorie bartrands conscience she would not call upon the wife while that bit of spanish ribbon a loan made in a moment of foolish high spirits remained unchallenged in the husbands possession i hope you have taken care of something i lent you sir a piece of coloured ribbon tied round those flowers i sent the first evening grandpapa and i had the pleasure of knowing you to mrs arbuthnot to mrs arbuthnot this is rough on a man cried geff why miss bartrand you must have forgotten those flowers were given to me dont make too certain of that but i am certain i can see you as you stood in the strip of moonlight by the water lane wishing me good night your last words were the flowers are for yourself your better self the ribbon at least was given to no one retorted marjorie changing colour under his gaze it was lent to hinder you from breaking your neck you meant to climb the gros nez cliffs if you could to do that a real good guernsey man needs his hands both of them and i thought it a pity the real good guernsey night should be disfigured by a stupid stranger leaving the world too tragically i thank you heartily went on geff as the girl blushed deeper and deeper i measured the extent of your sympathy to an inch at the time a ring of absolute independence was in his voice a suspicion lurked there too of hardly restrained laughter for the situation was taking hold of him let us see thought geoffrey in this feather light matter of keeping or not keeping a morsel of sash ribbon how far the small shrew could be tamed let us see which of the two should fitly in the end be styled conqueror so he thought by no means forecasting that this feather light matter of keeping a morsel of sash ribbon might be the pivot on which his lifes fortunes should one day turn chapter xi dodos despair my sympathy i believe was rightly bestowed said marjorie frigidly i would not see the poorest wandering pedlar start for the gros nez cliffs without helping him to the extent i helped you even a pedlar might have a wife at home sir a foolish fond creature shedding tears of anxiety for him in his absence the side thrust did not seem to scathe geoffreys conscience as it should have done would you make it a special point that this married pedlar should return you your ribbon miss bartrand i make it a point that mr arbuthnot shall do so marjorie delivered her ultimatum unflinchingly the ribbon is worthless except as a memento of some happy days i spent in cadiz once totally worthless to any living person but me and why should it not be a memento of happy days spent in guernsey by myself she looked him straight between the eyes too hotly dangerously irate to make immediate answer suppose leading a prosaic life in the thick of bricks and mortar that length of ribbon could act as a kind of talisman i dont understand you in the least a charm bringing back to ones tired eyes and heart the blue summer night the smell of moon coloured hayfields the whole moment when it was given to me i will suppose nothing of the sort it was not given this is vapid sentimental talk said marjorie concentrating her thoughts firmly on absent dinah and i abhor sentiment on that solitary point we agree the ribbon i lent you to tie round mrs arbuthnots flowers is just a yard of woven parti coloured silk buy the best match you can find to it in the nearest mercers shop it will be as good a talisman are you a materialist miss bartrand would you say that the ragged colours of one of the dukes regiments the pennants of one of nelsons ships were so much woven silk more or less stained and weather torn i do not see that my sash ribbon can or should be of the smallest interest to mr geoffrey arbuthnot observed marjorie the blood leaping more swiftly than it had done under his praise to her cheek in this moment she was a woman the childish cotton frock the hair hung out to dry the slim immature figure notwithstanding a dawning of her sexs shame burned at her heart as she turned her looks away from him in this moment were it possible to assign place and date to matter so intangible i should say that geff arbuthnot first distinctly began to fall in love and suppose i feel that your sash can and ought to be of the greatest possible interest to me he urged marjorie found no answer to her hand if she had been reared under a different rule to andros bartrands if she had associated more with girls had frequented afternoon teas and garden parties she would doubtless even in innocent little sarnia have learned the formula by which a married man hazarding idle speeches ought mildly and effectually to be crushed marjorie knew no more of flirtation or of its dialects than she did of sanscrit she had gone through an engagement once during a brief uncomfortable fortnight an experience which took the taste for lovers and lovers vows most adequately out of her young mouth and now oh now she never meant to marry she had her greek and latin in the present a large outlook for herself and others in the future of flirtation she knew nothing of engagements she knew too much and she liked geff arbuthnot and did not like the duties of repressing his frivolity or of ranging herself against him in the civil wars of his home life yet to the utmost of her strength should both these duties be fulfilled your interests were appropriated long before you ever saw me she replied at last what hour this afternoon would it be convenient pray for me to visit mrs arbuthnot her tone her look might for a moment have suggested to geoffrey that the secret of his youth had made unto itself wings and flown to tintajeux only the very supposition were wild gaston dinah herself had never suspected the passionate madness which in the may twilight of long ago used to draw him night after night to the little thatched rose covered cottage at lesser cheriton mrs arbuthnot for anything i know to the contrary dinah will be at home between three and four oclock and at our next reading sir you will bring back my ribbon i made no promise of what mortal use can a bit of ribbon be to you mr arbuthnot i have had thoughts of turning this particular ribbon into a book marker said geff boldly imaginative a book marker i ask you do you think it honest to keep property that belongs to other people my conscience i must confess does not prick me if i order will you obey marjorie had turned abruptly pale her mouth quivered if you order i submit said geff watching her gravely i will never go against your smallest wish while i live you shall have your ribbon before our next lesson miss bartrand i promise the shadow of a quarrel was between them when they bade good bye and at the thought of this shadow marjories illogical spirit was sore vexed but i think geff arbuthnot walked back to town with a lighter spirit in his breast than had reigned there since the moment when he first saw dinah and gaston as lovers hand clasping hand in the little cambridgeshire orchard his knowledge of young girls their instability their hot and cold fits their tempers their fluctuating emotions had been derived from books so his theories on the subject were mainly worthless but men who in after days rival neither thackeray nor balzac do often during one phase of their own experience make keen enough guesses as to the source of female weakness geoffrey felt with an instincts force that marjorie bartrands blanched cheeks her quivering lip her passionate tones were not the outcome of childish anger he felt with an instincts force that the girl herself was a child no longer whither must this altered state of things tend the question was complex and geoffrey willingly let it rest as he walked the warm air was briar scented the birds murmured lazy midday nothings to each other amidst the lush hedges the voice of marjorie bartrand filled his heart what need to hope or fear for the future when one is twenty four years old and the actual living hour has a hold delicious as this upon the senses dinah and her husband were alone together a quiet little picture of domestic still life when geff reached the hotel a vine trellised slip of courtyard lay outside the north window of mrs arbuthnots sitting room here during the sunny forenoons gaston picturesquely bloused found it pleasant to work when he was sufficiently in the vein to work at all he wore his blouse was in the vein now that which two days ago was a mass of rough clay showed the airy outlines of a baby girl seated on a brobdingnagian shell one small foot neatly shoed and socked the other clasped naked between her dimpled hands in an attitude of inimitable three year old dismay we label this work of genius the lost shoe or dodos despair or some equally pathetic and unhackneyed title remarked the sculptor as geff entered upon the scene we get our so many guineas for it from our masters and solicit further orders do we not dinah you should have no master but your art was dinahs answer that is easily said my wife as usual geff is urging upon me to fulfil my mission to deliver messages to begin big and serious work but i fancy i gauge my own depths justly i have no messages whatever to deliver to anybody these trickeries of philistine sentiment gaston pointed with a shapely clay stained hand to his model are always a success in the first place they draw tears from mr and mrs prudhomme in the second the dealers approve them what more can an artists heart desire everything replied dinah but she spoke in parenthesis and under her breath am i anatomical geoffrey this must always be important whether a man work with or without a mission how about this bend in the left knee joint are my muscles right geoffrey offered one or two strictly professional criticisms then after admiring the grace the charm of the little clay sketch gave his uncompromising moral support to dinah whoever possesses genius well talent no need to fight over words lies under the behest of duty gastons duty the one straight and unmistakable road that lay before him was to abandon conventional prettiness to go in for the expression of the highest thoughts that were in him i am destitute of high thoughts said gaston his refined intellectual face belying the assertion i have not the prophets rle if i tried to soar i should immediately afterwards have to climb down i have no original ideas to embody gaston broke with an accent of denial from dinahs lips and the dealers farrago in pall mall especially are my masters before i left town farragos advice was memorable the market demands nothing classic in statuettes mr arbuthnot nothing romantic above all nothing to make us think the market demands trifles sir trifles objects for the smoke room or boudoir domestic amenities as you agreeably say for monsieur and madame prudhomme and for wider sections of society flavour in any case trifles nothing if you please to make us think instead of obeying exclaimed dinah you ought to say i gaston arbuthnot must do such and such work no other let mr farrago take my statuettes or leave them as he likes that style of talk is for giants my dear child putting aside the fact that i am bound to farrago for another six months carlyle talked so to the edinburgh reviewers viewed by the light of after success his talk may sound grand if carlyle had not speedily written the french revolution it would have been called tall but i want you to write your french revolution in clay dinah persisted here in guernsey you know you planned to make studies always studies for the great work you will set about in florence but then a piece of embroidery was between dinahs hands she lifted her eyes from her wools and silks at this juncture and fixed them full of earnest reproach on gaston there have been unfortunate throw backs throw backs as how gaston arbuthnot applied himself to the correction of one of the points anatomically criticised by geoffrey as long as i am bound to farrago even feminine morality my love will allow that i should be honest every saleable thing i do must pass as per contract through farragos hands taking one day with another i have got through rather more work than the average here in guernsey have you put your own thoughts into form gaston this model when it is finished she glanced somewhat coldly at dodos despair will be a portrait of rahnee thorne simply rahnee thorne idealised gastons rejoinder was made with the unruffled temper that characterised him my clay infant has flesh upon her bones and an infants face rahnee though i love the child is but a poor little wizened bengalee at her best will the portrait of rahnees mamma the model you have on hand at the bungalow need to be idealised also dinah you should be magnanimous and with a movement that in a less composed man might have been a shrug of the shoulders mr arbuthnot prepared to clean the clay from his hands a pretty woman well if you shake your head an exceedingly beautiful woman need never utter a sarcasm about a plain one at the negative compliment a colour soft as the pure pink veining of a shell cameo stained dinahs face her breast throbbed and all the time the speech delicious in sound signified nothing gaston had been engaged for days past to escort plain mrs linda to the rose show and felt not the smallest temptation to break his engagement dinah must be magnanimous dinahs husband after two or three hours facile work on dodos despair needed relaxation and would have it you ought to take me to the show geff she pleaded turning round half jestingly half in earnest to geoffrey what would linda thorne what would gaston think if i suddenly made my appearance among all the fine ladies of guernsey linda thorne might have her own views said gaston when dinah arbuthnot shows her face every fine lady in guernsey or elsewhere must be on the spot eclipsed whatever dinah thought geff knew that a certain insincerity underlay the speech and controlled a pungent remark with effort the friendship of the arbuthnot trio was never more sharply paradoxical than at this moment chapter xii yellow backed novels the june rose show stands second only to her majestys birthday among the big events of the channel islands calendar by three oclock the road between petersport and the arsenal plateau was filled with a growing stream of men and women simple rose lovers many of them but some lovers of another kind and some roses themselves what buoyant young figures fluttered past the window whence dinah arbuthnot shrouded from view undreaming of her own future watched the crowd what ruddy fine complexions were here what well shapen noses and mouths what dark norman eyes why you might scour half a dozen english counties before you could bring together as many handsome girls as would soon be within the guernsey arsenals four walls must not excuse be made the thought was dinahs for an artist who should long to stock his brains tablets with so much beauty even though an idle tear or two a little discontent in some one left at home must be the price of his experience she strove her best to be magnanimous to give a valiant yes to this self propounded question then even as she made the effort a group of persons drew nigh from the direction of petersport at the sight of whom poor dinahs magnanimity and the wifely heart that beat in her breast stood instantly at variance her hands turned cold and rigid a prophecy rather than an actual living look of jealous anger swept all the youthful gentleness from her face a group of four persons mr gaston arbuthnot mrs thorne the small daughter rahnee and a native nurse dazzling was mrs linda in whatever furbelows and head gear local parisian milliners had impressed on the feminine sarnian mind as the last thing out overdecked in embroidery and ribbons was rahnee a sorrowfully thin little child with dark ringed eyes sallow cheeks bangles on wrist a typical indian child perverse sickly unruled and who at the present moment was dancing knowingly and deliberately on her mothers fragile flounces at every second step i am sure one ought to reform her thus linda would make confession among her matron friends but what is to be done as long as you keep an ayah you must reform the ayah first that is just the one enthusiasm of humanity which is outside my reach to reform an ayah rahnee i repeat danced persistently and with effect on her mothers cobweb furbelows as she capered and twisted herself along the street lindas expression was as little honeyed as the expression of a coquette can ever be in the presence of a man she seeks to charm the ayah vainly gesticulated vainly uttered expostulations in unknown eastern tongues from the rear breakdown and rout of one or other of the forces seemed imminent suddenly just as they were passing the hotel perhaps it was this incident stabbed dinahs unreasoning heart to the quick gaston came to the fore as mediator holding out both hands gaston arbuthnot offered small rahnee a place on his shoulder dinah could hear his pleasant voice indicative of a mind content with its surroundings as he began some sage nursery talk all engrossing it would seem to rahnees soul the thin arms closed round his neck the tiny primrose gloved fingers played with his hair mrs linda a restored picture of amiable maternity trotted behind the ayah followed after her black orbs pantomiming unspeakable things to such portions of the guernsey world as had been chance witnesses of the scene then domestic wise the group of four persons went their way a choking hysterical lump rose in dinahs throat with a vague sense of her own worthiness a suspicion that if dinah arbuthnot was out of keeping with sunshine and flowers and little children dinah arbuthnot herself must be to blame she watched gaston and his friends until they had turned the corner towards the arsenal barely was the final shimmer of lindas flounces lost to view when a clatter of hoofs approached rapidly along the petersport road a miniature phaeton with a girl driver and drawn by a pair of small black ponies came in sight a minute later and marjorie bartrand who had drawn up before the portico of the hotel was inquiring yes there could be no mistake through the open windows the sound of her own name reached dinah distinctly if mrs arbuthnot was at home dinah had not received one morning visitor in guernsey how many morning visitors upon mrs not mr arbuthnot had dinah received since her marriage the unexpected respectability of the event for our tintajeux bartrands mind you with all their eccentricity stand on the topmost rung of the social insular ladder moved mr millers mind a man of tact and discrimination the host proceeded himself to usher marjorie in the arbuthnots parlour door was thrown open with an air miss bartrand of tintajeux was announced in millers most professional voice then came the meeting to which marjorie had looked forward with resolute conscience perhaps with lurking doubts as to the cordiality of the reception that should await her this is very good of you dinah spoke in her usual voice she came forward with the simplicity that draws so near to de vere repose geoffrey never warned me i was to look for such a pleasure i take it very kind of you to come miss bartrand dinahs trouble had just reached that level when the smallest act of good will from friend or stranger may cause the cup to overflow her eyes suffused her colour heightened mr arbuthnot thought i should be likely to find you at home this afternoon i wanted to see you long ago cried marjorie her gaze fixed on the face whose delicate beauty so far overpassed her expectations but i waited i thought stammered the girl for the first time since she could remember feeling an excuse needed for her conduct i thought of course mr arbuthnot might ask me to call who geff answered dinah with a fleeting shy smile no indeed miss bartrand geoffrey would not make so bold he knows too well that i live retired dinahs phrases were certainly not those of the educated world but marjorie looking open eyed at the mouth and throat and golden hair was in no mood to be critical i have lived retired pretty well from the time i married my husband does whatever visiting is required of us that is unfair to the world at large cried marjorie bartrand drawing up a chair to the table where wools and silks lay heaped beside dinahs patiently progressing canvas whatever hermit rules you observe elsewhere we shall make you break through them in guernsey i may look at your work what intricate shading she scanned the pathetic mass of dinahs stitches what a labour of love embroidery must be to you it helps pass the time said dinah arbuthnot wool work fills up long hours that must else be empty for i am not a scholar like you miss bartrand or like geoffrey and i only learnt the piano for two years at boarding school not enough to play well still you do play marjorie glanced across at a piano that stood open a goodly heap of music scores lay on a neighbouring ottoman not in such a public place as an hotel the notes you see there are my husbands mr arbuthnot sings as i dare say you know he was thought once on a time to have the best tenor voice in cambridge some day said dinah doubtfully i may play just well enough to accompany him unfortunately for me the most beautiful of his songs are in french marjorie bethought her of geoffreys accent and was silent you will have good opportunities of learning french in guernsey mrs arbuthnot geff wants me to take lessons we have a french waitress here in the hotel but she speaks too quick for me so do my husband and and mrs thorne i only understand the sort of french we learned at boarding school the sort of french the girls talked together said poor dinah modestly no books no languages no music only cross stitch the counting of canvas threads to fill ones existence and ones heart and for life companion thought marjorie a husband who frequented afternoon teas who warbled beautiful french ditties in a bad accent to audiences of women on the level of linda thorne this vision of geoffrey as a singer added the crowning touch to the girls disappointment in his character throughout the brief bitter tasting epoch when her unwilling hand wore an engagement ring she was accustomed to hear french sentiment in an english accent and an english tenor voice during at least three hours out of each twenty four at this moment the tinkling burthen of one frequent song came back with a sense of repulsion that was pain upon her heart si vous navez rien me dire pourquoi passez vous par ici she remembered how the white hands of major tredennis used to rattle out the accompaniment of that song she remembered the flower major tredennis wore at his button hole the last day he visited tintajeux remembered when she got knowledge of his treachery how instant and far reaching was her scorn with what honesty did she now scorn all human creatures of the tredennis stamp how loyally would she put herself forward as dinahs friend yes although she must forfeit the reading of mathematics and classics with mr geoffrey arbuthnot as her reward you have not been here long enough to see much of the island of course you are fond of the country well i was country born and bred real country folk my husband says set less store upon green fields and hedgerows than the town people but you like being out of doors you will walk or drive with me sometimes i have a pair of welsh ponies capital at scrambling up and down our guernsey lanes you are very kind miss bartrand but i cant quite give an answer you see i should have to speak to mr arbuthnot poor dinah coloured with actual shame at the proposal now to day why are you not enjoying yourself with the rest of the world at the show guernsey roses i can tell you are worth looking at i asked geff in joke of course to take me dinah answered but he was not polite enough to say yes will you come with me cried marjorie as i drove in from tintajeux i was getting my courage up all the way to ask you this i have no chaperon and now that i am seventeen nearly a grown up woman the old ladies tell my grandfather it is improper i should go about without one i who know the island like a cat you would be doing an act of charity by coming with me to the arsenal dinahs face grew irresolute at this piece of special pleading she crossed to the window and looked with wistful eyes up the street she recalled the group which had passed along a quarter of an hour before she heard gastons voice again saw the tiny primrose hands clasped round his throat she thought of linda thornes rainbow coloured flounces and of linda thorne herself i should like to go the truth broke from her after a minute more of hesitation i was feeling duller than usual when you came miss bartrand and i do like a flower show above all things we used to go to the tiverton shows when my sister and i were girls uncle william who lived bailiff at lord luftons would take us when the gentlepeople were gone but that dinah interrupted herself hastily was different we were with uncle william we were in our place i should not be in my place with you perhaps you are too young miss bartrand to see this my husband is at the arsenal with his friends and wherever a husband goes is a place for his wife according to my ideas of matrimony said marjorie in a careless tone but with her veracious face aflame i will not hear another excuse it will be a curiously pleasant surprise for mr arbuthnot when he sees you in my society the ladies are dressed so elegantly objected dinah at the same time moving towards the door and i never wear smart things neither do i in truth marjorie wore one of the plain washed frocks the sunburnt straw hat that she wore on the moor at tintajeux what do smart things or smart people matter to you and me dress as you choose mrs arbuthnot you will look better than every woman in the arsenal i had best put on black my husband fortunately has lovely taste even in ladies dress he tells me black is always the safest thing for me to wear black cachemire and silence dinah remembered those were the requisites gaston advocated obliquely the hint concealed by charming flowers of speech on the solitary occasion when he introduced her to some female members of his family in london i shall ask you to tell me miss bartrand about my gloves and ribbons thus speaking dinah passed away through a side door into her own chamber for gaston with his knack of organising daily life after the manner that best suited himself had taken a compact little suite of apartments on mr millers ground floor and marjorie left to her meditations glanced around the parlour in writing of guernsey and of dinah the old fashioned word must be excused for land marks that should point out its present possessors tastes dinah was not a woman whose affections tended towards ornament in art or in dress had they done so dinahs life had probably been happier her work basket with its outlying heaps of silk and wool was the only sign marjorie could detect of feminine occupation what of dinahs husband pipes and cigarette holders of varying patterns were ranged on either side the mantelpiece a tobacco jar stood in unabashed evidence on a table an odour not to be mistaken clung round the draperies of the windows so this man smoked thought marjorie irefully smoked in his beautiful refined wifes living room yellow backed french novels abounded french novels i must confess were an abiding inspiration of gastons genius the neighbourhood of the piano was strewn with french songs a volume of greek poetry lent to geoffrey by old andros bartrand lay on a bookshelf in a corner by the door marjorie discerned a rough briar walking stick which she recognised as her tutors property as she looked around the room her impulse was to burst into tears it was but an inns best parlour you could not expect the perfume the grace of tintajeux under good mr millers roof but it was not louis seize furniture or pompadour cabinets or trianon rose baskets that marjorie missed to pipes and tobacco smoke her life with the seigneur had accustomed her yellow backed novels did not disturb her conscience within limits she could endure french songs the room repulsed her because it destroyed every dream she had had of geoffrey without the greek volume she thought without the briar stick even her disenchantment had been less vivid she had not been forced to remember him to admit the lapse into bathos of her own ridiculously high pitched ideal but so the facts stood one may be made a fool twice the girl told herself first by a sweetheart secondly by a friend happily dinah arbuthnot not marjorie bartrand must this time pay the reckoning and the tears were in her eyes still in spite of all disillusionment her liking for geff lingered obstinately she thought she could never again be glad of heart as on that mid summer night when she curtsied to the moon and wished a wish by her tutors side on the lawn at tintajeux it took dinah arbuthnot fifteen minutes a real quarter of an hour of rabelais for marjorie to put on hat and gown fifteen minutes ere she could be sure her appearance would pass muster in the eyes of linda thorne the best and simplest women infrequently dress for the other sex or for the world at large or for themselves they dress for each other oftenest of all for one especial feminine criticism which they have reason to fear shall i do miss bartrand dinah peeped her exquisite face aflush through the half opened door then she crossed the room to marjorie instinct true as a childs informing her that in geoffreys pupil she had found a friend i want you to pick me to pieces find as much fault with me as you can shall i do do repeated marjorie and a volume of hearty admiration was in the monosyllable dinah thurston in her girlhood had learnt dressmaking as a trade of dress as a difficult social art dinah arbuthnot knew not the initial letters here her husband was an unfailing monitor gaston had an artists knowledge of colour and effect he had the sense of fitness belonging to a man of the world dinahs apparel might not accurately follow the fashion books it bore the seal of distinction at all times thus the safe black dress was absolutely perfect of its kind plain of make as was meet for such a bust such shoulders as dinahs but draped by a parisian hand that knew its cunning a ruffle of mechlin lace enhanced the sweet whiteness of the wearers throat a velvet lined hat threw up the outline of the head the waves of short cut english coloured hair in rich relief you are lovelier than any picture cried marjorie looking at dinah arbuthnot with as generous a pleasure surely as ever woman felt in the beauty of another advise me about my gloves dinah blushed and drew back at the girls frank praise here are cream coloured ones you see the same shade as my ruffle and here is a box of long black silk gloves my husband had them sent from paris with the gown of course the cream coloured are the dressiest the tone of dinahs voice betrayed her own leaning mr arbuthnot warns me generally against light gloves my hands he says are half a size too large still for a flower show you must wear the black gloves mrs arbuthnot no shadow of doubt about it as you see i dont go in for dandy dress myself said marjorie but one cant help hearing the whispers of the milliners these long silk gloves are at present the one righteous thing to wear in london and in paris and no ribbons no ornament i have a gold necklace that looks nice on black and you want no ornament at all you must take our little world by storm just as you stand at this moment miller has some crimson roses in his garden we will cut one as we pass the black of your hat would be better for a single spot of colour by the time marjories fiery welsh ponies had rushed up to the arsenal four oclock was striking the rose show festivities were for the weak and frivolous at their culminating point it was the hour when staid flower lovers sensible souls who came to see the real not the human roses were leaving cassandra tighe among them i am starting off to tintajeux she told marjorie as they passed each other at the entrance the seigneurs duc de rohan has taken a prize and i must be first to carry the news to the manoir then with a kindly glance at dinah you have done the right thing have paid your visit she whispered i dont see the necessity of mixing yourself up with it all in public linda thorne presides at the refreshment tent and that wretched man is simply infatuated in his attentions but the error is generous being a bartrand you can i suppose do nothing by halves i consider myself honoured by appearing with mrs arbuthnot returned marjorie very low i want to judge of that wretched mans conduct at first hand see facts alive and extract their meaning by the light of my own common sense chapter xiii through smoke coloured spectacles the refreshment tent was pitched at the most conspicuous point of the arsenal just within the gates here linda thorne assisted by three or four white muslined aides de camp dispensed strawberries ices and tea liberal of smiles but most illiberal in charges to the crowd gaston arbuthnot hovered near not engaging mrs thornes attention but with the air of a man whose freedom is nominal of a prisoner on parole the ayah had vanished small rahnee in a corner was busily laying up a weeks trouble for her tropical digestion over a plate of stolen macaroons a swarm of well gloved well set up young gentlemen subalterns for the most part of the maltshire royals newly returned from africa clustered ornamentally around lord rex cried linda in a playful voice appealing to a youth who stood behind her chair a plain but ultra dandified youth with a sun scorched face sandy hair and eyelashes and who wore his left arm in a sling my dear lord rex where are your thoughts to day for the third and last time of asking will you run across to madame the archdeaconess and press her to drink a second cup of tea for linda a clever politician never allowed the present to divert her mindfulness from the future belonging sub silentio to the extreme left of any society in which she found herself mrs thorne kept a firm grip here in european coteries as formerly in indian stations on whatever conservative mainstay might be within her reach her guernsey mainstay was the archdeacons wife linda was a member under madame corbie of cutting out clubs district visiting corps societies for persuading members of all denominations to change places with each other and similar intricate philanthropies of the hour and place if occasionally serious circles looked with misgiving upon some little new escapade some unaccustomed outbreak of vivacity at the bungalow lindas usefulness floated her there was such a fund of sterling worth in linda thorne so some old lady would say at whose house linda perhaps on the preceding evening demure as a mouse had been painting christmas cards for the caribbee islanders such energy such zeal for the weaker brethren such a genius for collecting subscriptions or organising fancy bazaars and then one must not forget the stock she came of one must always remember what our dear flighty lindas grandpapa was hence perhaps the leniency of the judgments the old sarnian ladies never forgot that our dear flighty lindas grandpapa was an earl madame corbie tea echoed lord rex basire the sun scorched dandy absently ah there she goes again the prettiest girl yes by jove the out and outest girl every way i have seen in guernsey golden hair a complexion a figure let me take the venerable her cheering cup at once and set me free to fly after my dulcinea a new dulcinea asked linda with a glance as sweet as the cup she had prepared for madame corbie i thought lord rex basire had flown after every dulcinea in the channel islands a long time since lord rex broke away without reply causing a good deal of the venerables tea to overflow by reason of his impetuous movements but he was not set free again as quickly as he desired madame corbie was what the scottish bailie called a fine respectit half worn sort of woman her set of immediate worshippers poorer cousins for the most part would speak of her beneath their breath as so superior madame corbie never smiled madame corbie never retracted a step once taken it was her harmless boast that she had never read a novel in her life as one would say he had never cut a throat or picked a pocket she would wear no black satin that cost less than ten shillings and sixpence guernsey currency per yard and she surveyed the moral as she did the physical world through a pair of smoke coloured spectacles even the archdeaconess however had her little stock of human vanities and foibles persons of title though they exist in adequate number on the british mainland are scarce and prized like the pink flowering hydrangea on these smaller islets with the rectors wives from half a dozen country parishes sitting around neglected it was a distinctly soothing sensation for good madame corbies unworldly heart to have lord rex basire the fifth son of a very impoverished duke in attendance upon her a second cup of tea why lord rex and dear linda were certainly conspiring to spoil us all and might she the archdeaconess ask if there was such a thing to be had as a macaroon too late madame corbie lost your chance cried lord rex that young limb rahnee has been beforehand with you i saw her devouring the last three macaroons at a gulp just as linda sent me off with your tea lord rex was forced to shout these words into madame corbies ear for the band of the maltshire royals were playing a forcible much kettle drummed polka not twenty feet distant so his attentions even to the obtuse perceptions of country rectors wives must be unmistakably marked sadly unwholesome diet to be sure but poor linda thorne is so indiscreet in minor matters you agree with me do you not lord rex nothing more sadly indigestible for a young childs stomach than macaroons lord rex basire heard her not it may be doubted whether lord rex heard the horns and kettle drums as they echoed resonantly from the arsenal walls he was absorbed in the vision of a distant lovely head poised flowerlike on a white throat its waves of amber hair set off against the soft velvet of a rubens hat no other interest existed on our planet at that moment for lord rex basire he was a man who from his birth upward had followed the desire of the hour for evil or for good mainly not for good his desire now was to become acquainted with the exquisitely pretty girl whom his eyes pursued bluntly abandoning the question from a physiological side of macaroons he addressed himself to the archdeaconess did madame corbie the polka by now had stopped lord rex could ask his question without a shout did madame corbie know the name of the girl who was walking with marjorie bartrand of tintajeux golden haired girl straight features the loveliest complexion in the world added lord rex with the frankness of a momentarily real feeling it will be my husbands cousin once removed ella corbie of la hauterive observed madame corbie blandly the hauterive yellow roses are fine this year i have not a word to say against their celine forestier but in my poor opinion the archdeacons marchal niel ought to have taken the prize yes yes madame corbie gazed through her smoked spectacles into the perspective of history ella corbie is still nice looking i remember her dressed for her first evening party more than a dozen years ago and now my dear madame corbie i beg a thousand pardons your cup is empty allow me to set it down interrupted lord rex basire for at this precise moment the perfect features the lovely complexion were again setting towards him in the crowd but madame corbie the head of our local society rose to the occasion and to her feet let me have a good look lord rex and if it is my cousin ella i will introduce you to her a young lady walking you say with marjorie bartrand that is certainly most unlike ella the hauterive family keep so exclusively to themselves still there they are coming this way by jove cried lord rex breathlessly you see the girl i mean splendid girl in black lace ruffle a red rose lying on her hair madame corbie looked through her smoke coloured glasses straight then she looked through her smoke coloured glasses obliquely then she pushed them high away on her ample forehead and gazed stoically upward in the broad light of the merry june day the person she pronounced with awful solemnity who is walking with marjorie bartrand of tintajeux does not belong to this island and so speaking and with the folds of her satin doing credit to the price paid for them madame corbie there in full presence of the inferior clergys wives sat down ah i thought not thought i had never seen such a pretty woman in the place observed lord rex addressing his own consciousness rather than the ill pleased ears of the archdeaconess what are the odds i dont get properly introduced and properly snubbed before another quarter of an hour is over as a preliminary step lord rex rushed back to the refreshment tent madame corbies tea cup his ostensible excuse he threw himself on linda thornes ambiguous sympathy mrs thorne you know all about every one by fine natural discernment ive heard you say so a hundred times who is this wonderful girl in black that marjorie bartrand is walking about with a suppressed smile lurked round linda thornes thin lips let us give mr arbuthnot the task of learning her pedigree it is an act of charity always to find work for idle men mr arbuthnot she turned to gaston i want you to find out something for the peace of lord rex basires mind and of my own existence who is this wonderful girl in black who is walking about the arsenal grounds with marjorie bartrand if i were of a brave disposition i would go myself said lord rex when gaston had sauntered placidly off on his mission but i am not i am a coward down to the ground peace at any price is my motto politically and otherwise to day i am feeling more than usually nervous not half go enough in me to stand up under one of marjorie bartrands snubbings i cannot say your modesty makes itself known to the world by outward and visible signs modesty no i understand you madam a man may have forward manners but a faint heart lord rex basires arm in justice let it be spoken got a bullet through it in hot warfare this dandified boy was in the thick of more than one african fight when clouds gathered dark above the english colours was all but drowned on a never to be forgotten night while attempting to carry succour to the wounded left with their solitary gallant surgeon on an abandoned position i tried once at a militia review or something to talk to marjorie just in the usual way one talks not without success you know to girls of her age and the result was asked linda she looked at me coolly grand spanish eyes of hers those are bar the temper in them you are fresh from eton are you not she observed i confessed that eton had known me in my youth talk about eton then struck out miss bartrand straight from the shoulder talk about cricket football boating latin grammar if you learnt any i will not with a murderous flash from her big eyes listen to foolishness from any man by the time lord rex finished this characteristic anecdote gaston arbuthnot with his usual expression of genial impenetrability had sauntered back to the refreshment tent picking up rahnee he asked the child what ailed her for rahnees face sickly at all times wore a look and hue forlornly out of keeping with the bravery of her attire what in the world has befallen the infant mrs thorne her complexion is of the lively arsenic green the doctors forbid us to use in wall papers rahnee mammas own darling pet what is the matter cried linda suddenly recalled to the fact of her darlings existence me eat matazoons bad matazoons whimpered rahnee with the tender conscience the quick physical repentance of her age that is a wise little rahnee said gaston arbuthnot kissing her right morality pitch into our pleasures the moment our pleasures begin to pitch into us have you seen her exclaimed lord rex this kind of trifling remember may be fun to all of you its stretched high above a joke to me a tall fair girl dressed in black with a crimson rose in her hair added linda and walking with marjorie bartrand of tintajeux well yes gaston admitted in the lapses of whispered consolation to poor rahnee i have seen her and who is she exclaimed linda thorne i am almost as curious as lord rex have you discovered this new dulcineas name her name is dinah arbuthnot replied gaston cheerfully yes mrs thorne incredulous though i know you feel the wonderful girl in black and who is walking with miss bartrand of tintajeux is my wife lord rex sank in an attitude of despair half mock half genuine upon the nearest bench chapter xiv brought up by the jesuits dinah arbuthnot had been more than woman could she have run the gauntlet of this guernsey rose show unconscious of her success but admiration to dinah was no new thing as a girl she never went through that chrysalis or ugly duckling stage the remembrance of which to many women puts an edge on after triumphs heads were turning after her to day she saw just as heads used to turn when she was a baby toddling along the devonshire lanes or a slim maid walking in the procession of young ladies from tiverton boarding school she had known since she knew anything that she was beautiful and rated beauty at a pathetically low standard thanks to roseleaf tint or well cut features a sweethearts fancy can easily be won who should say that cleverness knowledge of the world tact are not the solid gifts that bring happiness the qualities that might chain a husband wearied say after modelling from hired beauty to his own fireside if you do not object miss bartrand i would like to find some place where we could rest away from the crowd a little bent upon displaying their friendship before the sarnian world marjorie had by this time paraded her companion bravely throughout the length and breadth of the arsenal my husband has seen me he is in the tent near the entrance the tent where mrs thorne is serving refreshments as mr arbuthnot does not come forward to meet us i am afraid he is displeased displeased that is a great idea cried headstrong marjorie put all the blame on me i think i shall be strong enough to bear the brunt of mr arbuthnots wrath if i rest myself well first they succeeded in finding a bench withdrawn somewhat from the crowd yet within sight of the stall at which linda presided here dinah could pluck up her drooping courage while marjorie communed scornfully in her heart as to the pitiful weakness of married women in general and of this most neglected most mistaken married woman in particular their seclusion lasted for two or three minutes only then a blush started up into dinahs cheek vivid bashful such as a girls face might wear on catching sight unexpectedly of her lover for she saw gaston approaching at his side was a very dandily dressed sun tanned youth his arm in a sling a youth whom as yet dinah arbuthnot knew not he is coming miss bartrand i look to you to smooth things over just say you pressed me to come to the show and i refused at first and i will say everything that can decently be compressed into one act of contrition marjories tone was fraught with ironical seriousness but your eyes are better than mine mrs arbuthnot a guilty conscience perhaps sharpens the external senses i am looking with the best of my seeing power over the whole arsenal i see no mr arbuthnot then his companion must stand in the way the light haired gentleman with a plain like reddish face whispered dinah and who wears his left arm in a sling that is our popular hero lord rex basire newly returned from south african fighting and as proud of his gunshot wound as a foolish girl might be of her first conquest well and there is my husband walking with him your husband mrs arbuthnot marjories world was reeling a possibility she knew not of what a wild and passionate hope trembled on the outside edge of her thoughts perhaps i am not a fair judge murmured dinah the two young men having been arrested on their road by that incorrigible button seizer doctor thorne but to my mind gaston must always be the most noticeable man in any company he enters no matter how high that company may be gaston marjorie bartrand was in a state of such bewilderment that the echoing of dinah arbuthnots words seemed about as great originality in the way of speech as she was mistress of geoffrey must have sounded my husbands praises to you pretty often that is a right good point of poor geffs his love and admiration for gaston at cambridge he was called the handsome american i know it said dinah with earnestness which became those sweet lips of hers mightily because aunt susan had relations in the town on market hill you know before my marriage we used to hear something flattering of gaston every day it is the same in london the tailors will give him any credit i believe they would make his coats gratis so long as they got his promise to wear them and mr geoffrey arbuthnot it cost marjorie no small effort just then to force geffs name from her lips what relationship is there between him and you geoffrey is our first cousin his father and my husbands died both of them when their children were young gaston has always been geoffreys good genius in saying this dinah believed herself to be enunciating truth clear as crystal they did not meet as boys geoffrey spent his young years in a gloomy city school my husband was brought up you can tell it they say by his accent in paris when they came together in cambridge nothing could be more different than their positions poor geff a scholar at johns was forced to work without amusements almost without friends for his tripos while gaston mr gaston arbuthnot had livelier things than work to think about suggested marjorie as gastons wife paused he was clever enough to come out first in any tripos he had read for but his friends would not let him read he was sought after popular said dinah with a sigh just as you see him now however that made no difference for geff gaston treated him like a younger brother always he does so now i have grown myself to think of geoffrey as of a brother she stopped short for gaston arbuthnot and lord rex basire were now within hearing distance doctor thorne adhesive as goose grass addressing them by turns as he followed with his nimble limp in their steps yes mr arbuthnot you must grant me my postulate doctor thorne packed up all of nature or of books chiefly of books that came within his reach in little neatly labelled comprehensible forms dilettante demonstrations of the universe ready for his own daily use and the misery of his fellows grant as a postulate that the magnitudes we call molecules are realities and the rest follows as a necessary deduction let us look around us at this moment evolution teaches us that these bright blooms we behold actually come into being through the colour sense of insects and and lord rex basire you i am sure are fascinated by the subject lord rex had not heard a syllable breaking away from doctor thorne lord rex stood still his eyes pointedly avoiding dinahs face gaston meanwhile his hat held low after the fashion of broadway or the boulevards was saluting the two ladies making marjorie bartrands acquaintance and jesting amicably with dinah as to the march she had stolen upon himself and an unexpectant sarnian world when two or three minutes had passed lord rex gave evidence of his presence coming forward he delivered a set little compliment to marjorie bartrand on the seigneurs roses it was a source of agreeable satisfaction to lord rex basire that the duc de rohan should have taken a first prize he would like the seigneurs dark roses have taken a prize every june show for the last quarter of a century marjorie interrupted him cruelly when once we islanders flower show judges included get into a safe groove we keep there what an improving place guernsey must be to live in gaston arbuthnot remarked i have been trying vainly through the best years of my life to keep in safe grooves to keep in safe grooves repeated marjorie with rather stinging emphasis you would need to get into them first would you not you are severe miss bartrand gaston came over to the girls side and i like it severity gives me a new sensation now i am going to ask a favour which i can tell beforehand you will grant i want you to show me these conquering tintajeux roses tintajeux is not an unknown name to us gaston added this last clause in a lower key then watched to note how much the colour would vary on her ever varying face under any other circumstances than the present ones marjorie would i think have selected gaston arbuthnot as the type of human creature least to be encouraged under heaven was he not obtrusively good looking a popularity man a dandy for whom bond street tailors would be content as a flesh and blood block a living advertisement to stitch gratis was he not a coolly neglectful husband a pleasure seeker a frequenter of the afternoon teas of frivolous attention loving women but in her rush of joyous surprise of contradictory relief in her gratitude to him for not being geoffrey the girl was ready to extend a hand of hearty friendship to dinahs husband during the first half hour of their acquaintance at all events you wish to see the tintajeux roses come then and let me play show woman unfortunately marjorie added i dont know in which quarter of the globe the duc de rohan lives i believe i can guide you i know the whereabouts of every stall in the arsenal and lord rex neatly affixed himself to the party as marjorie and dinah rose dinahs breath came short she knew instinctively how the eyes of this pale haired sun burnt youth avoided her face and in that avoidance read the fact of his admiration she divined that lord rexs intention was to walk at her side she foresaw with terror the necessity of conversation gaston arbuthnot gave his wife a quick comprehensive look lord chesterfield embodied in a glance then he went through a brief informal word of introduction lord rex basire my wife i fancied dinah that you and basire had met already now miss bartrand let us make an exploring tour of the arsenal we shall reach the seigneurs dark roses sooner or later i look to you gaston added for enlightenment as to some of the human elements of the show marjories mood was abundantly bright the enlightenment was not slow of coming her prattle with its brisk bitterish flavour amused gaston as he would have thought it impossible to be amused by any classico mathematical girl extant as they passed the bench that still supported madame the archdeaconesss sacerdotal weight marjorie broke into a laugh that hearty human unmistakable laugh of hers for doctor thorne stood beside the great female pillar of the church delivering an oration in his most verbose little manner to which not only the archdeaconess but the wives of the inferior clergy listened with respect and marjories quick ear had caught his text one ought not to laugh at our betters mr arbuthnot ought one asking this marjorie looked gravely up in gastons face it is so written in the copy books miss bartrand for my part i think the greatest good a man ever does his fellows is when he furnishes them consciously or unconsciously with materials for farce at least one should not laugh loud enough to be heard i think you ought to laugh very often and loud enough for all the world to hear replied gaston doctor thorne is too much for me i have an old sandford and merton among my books and when i hear him talk i think of mr barlow moralising at tommy mr barlow turned scientist grant as a postulate that the magnitudes we call molecules are realities evolution teaches us that these bright blooms etc dr thornes flower show speech we had it last autumn with the dahlias we had it in the spring with the tulips i heard him addressing it just now to that poor small boy lord rex mrs corbie is orthodox to the core i suppose he will make a big jump as they do over the words in plays when he gets to anything so brimstony as evolution the crowd as it happened was setting in the direction of the tintajeux roses by the time gaston and marjorie had made their way into front places before the stand they discovered that dinah and lord rex basire had parted company from them in the crowd i brought mrs arbuthnot here it was through my persuasion she laid down her cross stitch cried marjorie and now we have let her fall victim to lord rex how wearied she will be of him i am not so sure of that my wife has the old fashioned weaknesses of the sex the sight of a wounded soldier is dear to her all women at heart are thoroughgoing jingoites i am not i am an ultra red hot radical exclaimed marjorie as to lord rex i believe his wound was well long ago he wears his arm in a sling to get up sympathy it will secure mrs arbuthnots said gaston then what a world of good it will do my wife to have been here he added warmly that is just what poor dinah needs to come out more mix more with her fellow creatures brighten up her ideas to lay down her cross stitch in short that hits the nail on the head to lay down her cross stitch it was charming of you to call on us miss bartrand i take it for granted you see that you have called you heard of our existence probably from geff i heard from mr geoffrey that mrs arbuthnot was staying at millers hotel but marjories voice faltered her soul clothed itself in sackcloth and ashes as she thought of her own error of the generous delicate motives which had prompted her pharisee that she was to call on dinah whatever geff does comes to good he cannot take a mile long walk without some man or woman being the better for it geff has a kind of genius for bringing about the welfare of other people at the mention of geoffrey every artificial trace left gastons manner the best of the man showed always no matter how trifling the occasion in the honest regard he bore his cousin now look miss bartrand at the way geff is spending his time in this island where marjorie had suspected him of easy going callousness of philandering in the train of idle fine ladies of singing french songs of putting himself on the social and intellectual plane of a major tredennis six hours a week must i own be grudged to him the hours he spends at tintajeux manoir spare yourself the trouble of being polite mr arbuthnot if you knew how i detest politeness but remember all his other hours the art of thought reading was certainly to be reckoned among gastons accomplishments within ten minutes of his introduction to this little classico mathematical girl behold him discoursing with cunning naturalness on the subject likeliest to interest her in the world geffs virtues remember how his days often his nights are really passed mr geoffrey arbuthnot reads does he not marjorie gazed into the heart of a glorious duc de rohan with interest geoffrey reads as i said gaston passing into a lighter strain meant to read once you look sceptical miss bartrand there was a time when i had bookish ambition yes i talked like many a fool before me of going in for two triposes and left cambridge without a degree but geff has a gigantic physique a real hunger for hard work he simply does not know the meaning of taking a holiday as they chatted gastons eyes dwelt with artistic satisfaction on the girls slender figure and hands on the chiselled southern face overkissed by sea and sun for some english tastes but pure fresh as the wine dark roses over which she bent i am a sculptor by trade he went on it might be truer to say a poor manufacturer of statuettes for the london market geff has told you how we get our daily bread has he not my tutor speaks of little beyond my reading stammered marjorie still without meeting the penetrating glance of gaston arbuthnot well even after work as light as mine i find said gaston with a clear conscience that amusement varied in kind and ample of quantity is needful the heartiness of ones work seems determined to a nicety by the heartiness of ones play geoffrey takes his recreation just now in the wards of the guernsey hospital there was a bad quarry accident the day after our arrival here i know exclaimed marjorie paling the worst accident we have ever had at st sampsons geoffrey i need not say went to the fore as a volunteer between the poor lads in hospital and those who lie still in the houses to which they were carried from the quarry his hands are full that is the way geff recreates himself for a good many seconds marjorie was speechless could it be that conscious weakness weakness in her a bartrand hindered the girl from trusting her own voice then giving gaston her profile still she turned brusquely aside from the tintajeux roses and from the discussion of geoffreys qualities she remembered her grandfathers dinner hour the sun was getting low it would be only human to search for mrs arbuthnot and deliver her out of the hands of lord rex we shall find them perfectly happy and eating ices said gaston dinahs is not such a critical spirit as yours miss bartrand let us bend our steps to the refreshment tent dinah and lord rex were all this time advancing haltingly monosyllabically towards acquaintanceship gastons happy many sidedness his power of adapting himself without effort to the tastes and moods of others were gifts in no manner shared by lord rex basire dinahs intelligence differed about as widely from marjorie bartrands as does placid english moonlight from a flash of tropical lightning thus starting as a cleverer man might do along beaten tracks the first remark made by lord rex was meteorological splendid day this isnt it for a rose show certainly the chilling assent was not spoken for some seconds dinahs education having failed to inform her that the smallest platitude uttered by men and women when they meet in the world needs instant answer as a rule you see one gets beastly weather for this sort of thing silence festive gatherings i mean und so weiter speech day at eton was always the wettest day of the three hundred and sixty five was it indeed lord rex basire dinahs gentle nature prompted her to be civil to all created beings she would be civil kindly even to this plain and sun scorched boy who had elected to walk beside her and whose eyes took so many covert glances of admiration at her face in the heart of eves simplest daughter were such glances one short quarter of an hour after introduction ever registered as crime not only would dinah be civil knowing little of titles and less as to their modes of application she would fain give lord rex basire the fullest benefit of his he paused and doing so looked with a straighter gaze than heretofore at gaston arbuthnots wife she was surpassingly beautiful fairer than any woman he had seen with his fleshly eyes or dreamed about in such soul as he possessed was she stupid not one whit for the higher feminine intelligence or the higher feminine culture did lord rex care in society he held it womans duty to supply him rex basire with straw for his conversational brick making hooks and eyes dont you know gleanings from the comic papers hints at politics easy openings for unsentimental sentiment a distinctly stupid woman frightened him makes one feel like being on ones legs for a speech lord rex basire would say you are looking forward to a long stay in the island i hope mrs arbuthnot at the italicised verb dinahs eyes turned on her companion with a vague distrust then she changed colour a rose flush vivid as sunset on snow overspread her face for she thought of gaston if you are a friend of my husbands i can understand your wishing to keep us here there was a smile on her lips the stiffness of her manner began visibly to relax lord rex for a moment was taken aback then he plucked up heart of grace to see a married woman blush like a school girl at the mention of her husbands name was a new and puzzling spectacle to him he could scarcely flatter his vanity that he personally was receiving encouragement still dinah had smiled and with the burthen of conversation making resting heavily on him he was glad enough to follow any cue that might present itself friend i should think so best fellow in the world arbuthnot and a man of genius too good all round sort of man never heard a briton sing french songs as he does rather proud of my own accent as lord rex progressed in confidence his speech grew more and more elliptic sent to paris in my infancy brought up by the jesuits there were jesuits in those days you know till i went to eton but arbuthnot puts me in the shade ra ther your lordship was brought up by the jesuits side by side with many wholesomer qualities dinah had inherited not a few of her yeoman forefathers prejudices at the word jesuit she regarded lord rex with an interest that had in it almost the tenderer element of pity i was you look doubtful you dont think the fathers could give one such a parisian roll of the r as your husbands of that im ignorant my lord i am no french scholar i thought of the jesuits fearful underminded dealings dinah gave a half shudder in the warm sunshine i thought of the doctrines they must have instilled into you underminded from what sect or denomination could arbuthnot have taken his handsome wife that dinah was a rustic mixed up with the great bucolic interests lord rex felt certain the devonshire burr the staid shy village manner betrayed her what were her tenets what sort of conscience had she a puritanical conscience of course but of what shade what dimensions he harked warily back upon the safe subject of gastons songs arbuthnot was singing to us magnificently last night he was in his best form faure himself could never have given a vingt ans in grander style and then he was so well accompanied the accompaniment is half the battle in a vingt ans gaston arbuthnot it should be explained dined on the preceding night at the mess of the maltshire royals he had dined at mess often of late and on each occasion dinahs heart felt that it had got a reprieve dinah believed that dining at the mess of the maltshire royals meant for one evening at least seeing nothing of the bungalow and of doctor and mrs thorne you have good musicians among you no doubt i know she observed remembering long and not successful practising of her own that the accompaniment of this song is hard but it has become the fashion for young men to play the piano lately we can most of us get through a polka played with one finger or malbrook when i am alone said lord rex i execute the marseillaise with chords no man in the regiment could play a true accompaniment to a vingt ans no my husband played it for himself then asked dinah unaccountably persistent not a bit of it a singer never sings his best unless he stand head up chest expanded lord rex dramatised the operatic attitude as they walked mrs thorne accompanied arbuthnot deliciously as she always does it was seldom dinahs policy to discover her feelings by speech so much worldly wisdom she had learnt through most unworldly forbearance towards gaston her complexion showed one of its over quick changes her mouth fell but she spoke not that there must be deviation from truth somewhere she divined with a bitter personal sense of humiliation but where she shrank from the possible answer to this question a good humoured epitome of the dinner party had been given by gaston over this mornings breakfast table for her own and geoffreys benefit the usual guest night at mess curious how precisely alike all mess dinners are the engineer colonels never finished commencement when we were in the lines before sebastopol the majors tiger slaying adventures in bengal the elderly captains diatribes against liberal governments and enforced retirements a man in the very prime no sir a man before he is in the prime of life put on the shelf and the irishmans story and the subalterns witticisms gaston i say had enlivened the breakfast table with his lively putting together of these oft used materials he had made no reference to the singing of french songs or to linda thorne then lord rex basires memory must be at fault you cannot mean last night you must be thinking of some former time mr arbuthnot dined with you at mess yesterday of course he did after dinner we adjourned we the favoured few as our manner is to the bungalow where mrs thorne played accompaniments for gaston dinah made the observation with mechanical self control hardly knowing what cold repetition of words this was that escaped her yes we had quite a chamber concert a lot of rehearsing that accompanying business seems to want hardly ever drop in at the bungalow of an afternoon without finding them at the piano dinah knew a moments cruel pain there was a proud hurt expression on her face she stopped short involuntarily then it would take much rehearsal she said before i should play well enough to accompany mr arbuthnot in public but mrs thorne seems clever nearly in everything i wish i had her talents and she resumed her walk and began to speak the village shyness thawing fast away about the flowers and the music and the people it became clear as daylight to lord rex basire that his society was duly valued chapter xv a love letter when gaston and marjorie approached the refreshment stall they saw a picture which many a genre artist in ink or oils might have been glad to study for there outside the tent stood dinah arbuthnot fair and flushed she and lord rex were eating ices as gaston the materialist predicted the western light shone on dinahs bright hair it touched the rose she wore and the outline of her lips and chin lord rex dutifully attentive held her sunshade an archdeaconess with surroundings of inferior female clergy loomed large on the horizon nearer at hand was linda thorne patiently enduring long stories of the tiger slaying majors while her eyes and ears were elsewhere sarnian society generally in dubious groups of twos and threes looked on it was dinahs first step across the border of a new world gaston arbuthnot seized the points of the situation at a glance he played the part that fell to him with acumen towards dinah his manner was simply irreproachable so thought marjorie no over lenient judge so from afar thought linda thorne it were premature to hint at any forecasting of storm in dinahs own hot heart he insisted upon supporting his wifes plate while she finished her ice he contrived to bring her and linda so far into friendly juxtaposition that at parting a chilly handshake was exchanged between these ladies but he also was true to his colours he had come to the rose show in mrs thornes society in her society he remained the last glimpse marjorie got of her new friends revealed a perspective of linda with sprightly energy pointing out distant roses to mr arbuthnot while dinah walked slowly homeward from the arsenal gates lord rex at her side had the afternoon been one of unmixed good had her interference with the arbuthnot trio brought about good at all marjorie asked herself these questions as she urged her ponies to a gallop along the tintajeux high road that she had discovered a foolish error appositely might be matter for congratulation so far as pride went had she performed a very generous or delicate action in bringing untaught dinah from her cross stitch pushing her into the glare of public notice obliging her to tolerate the attention of a man like rex basire if unprompted by the bartrand thirst for governing she had left destiny to itself had been content as in old times to help in the hayfield or the dairy at home might not her days work have been fruitfuller dinner had waited long when she reached tintajeux and the seigneur was in the disposition most dreaded of marjorie throughout the meal he talked more than his custom displayed a genial and grandpaternal interest in her doings at the arsenal tintajeux had taken a first prize of course and how did the duc de rohan look among the baser herd was he well placed in sun or in shadow marjorie the seigneur supposed had scarce found time among her numerous friends to give a glance that way i looked more at our roses than at any in the show said marjorie truthfully were not her eyes fixed downcast on the duc de rohan when gaston arbuthnot talked to her of geff would you believe sir that the hauterive corbies have taken a prize i think the archdeaconess would sooner have been cut out by any farmer in the island than by her husbands cousin no need to tell me the local tittle tattle on that head cassandra tighe has been a more than sufficient oracle by the bye witch with the memory of over boiled fish strong upon him the seigneur turned his piercing old gaze towards his granddaughter cassandra informs me that mrs arbuthnot is an extraordinarily pretty woman good too as she is pretty your tutor shows poor taste in dancing attendance on anything so vapidly commonplace as doctor thornes indian wife marjorie bartrand who three weeks ago had never changed colour before mortal was conscious at this moment of blushing furiously before the reverend andros still more did she quail under the eyes of sylvestre who stood in his faded puce and silver listening with the unabashed frankness that characterises servants of his age and nation to their talk from her grandfather all she need fear was a little searching banter directed towards herself let the dramatic instincts of sylvestre be aroused and he was capable of waylaying geoffrey arbuthnot yes and of inviting confidence respecting the most intimate family concerns at geffs next visit it needs personal acquaintance with a frenchman of sylvestres type to realise how the passion for scandalettes smouldering through long years of solitude and disuse would be ready at the first handful of fuel supplied to break forth anew doctor and mrs thorne were at the rose show the proceeds of the refreshment stall go this june to some sort of charity so mrs thorne of course presided there but mrs thorne is one of the people i never can find two words to say to our solemn eyed cantab finds a great many more than two words it would appear let me help you to a merry thought witch you have nothing but bones on your plate marjorie picked her merry thought as she finished her dinner in silence over dessert however sylvestres inquisitive face fairly vanished from the scene she plucked up courage and spoke we have been making nimble but ridiculous conjectures sir one could not well speak of this before sylvestre miss tighe made sure of the arbuthnot family history you know and avoid expletives i know nothing until it is your pleasure to inform my ignorance i mean cassandra believed from whispers she heard in petersport that mrs arbuthnot was kept too much in the background it would be a right and kindly thing we thought for me to call on her and so and so take your time marjorie slur over nothing we have a long evening before us well sir desperately i called and our solemn eyed cantab is not a married man at all the name of the mr arbuthnot who dances attend who visits at dr thornes house is gaston he is a cousin of geffs i i mean of my tutors the seigneur looked deliberately at his granddaughters face then as though politely reluctant to take further notice of her embarrassment he lifted his gaze to a full length portrait in pastels of some bewigged and powdered bartrand on the opposite wall and why should we not speak of miss tighes mistake of mr geoffrey arbuthnots celibacy before sylvestre remember the rascals gallican blood sylvestre requires an occasional bit of comedy more than any of us and so you have been acting a charade my love solemn eyed tutor and all a very pretty charade upon my word the reverend andros bartrand laughed drily it was about the first time on record that he had addressed his granddaughter as my love and marjorie was prompt to recognise latent sarcasm under the endearment how terrible to reach old age thought the child of seventeen to read to think and yet outlive the power of loving intellect surviving heart by many a year as bodily strength in the end must survive all what had she ever been to him but a plaything from the hour she arrived at tintajeux with her tempers her four year old tongue her foreign ways the necessity of keeping a kitten to gambol before the seigneurs study fire had possibly been done away with just that she had diverted him at the present day she might be picturesque shed the pleasing charm of youth upon his lawn and dinner table she understood the arrangement of his books she could dust his library to admiration and she was not afraid of him marjorie omitted this the leading clause from her mental summing up of personal virtues she was not afraid of him when did fearlessness fail of carrying weight with a cold strong nature like the seigneurs though her colour went and came though her lips quivered under his irony the girl was not afraid of him at this moment i might have known sir that if i was distressed it would furnish you with amusement that is our amiable bartrand spirit our way of showing sympathy with others distressed you astonish me distressed at finding that an intelligent studious young man is in possession of his freedom the charade we may almost call it the arbuthnot drama grows mightily puzzling to me a spectator let our worthy cantab be bachelor or benedict what concern is it of ours marjorie rose from the table with difficulty choking back her tears i love gossip as little as any one she said coldly you introduced the arbuthnots name sir so i chose to mention that the thornes friend and my tutor are two distinct persons and i have no interest in mr geoffrey arbuthnots concerns and if a drama is being acted let me tell you grandpapa that i for one play no part in it like yourself i am a spectator only her tone was high but when she reached the schoolroom friendly sanctuary in many a dumb pain of her childhood when she looked at the ink stained desk the piles of books the window through which the china roses peeped her humour changed marjorie stood a self convicted impostor in her own sight for she knew that she was not a spectator only in the arbuthnot drama that she was not unmoved by the discovery of geoffreys freedom bachelor or benedict what concern is it of ours she knew also that under the seigneurs irony lurked wholesome truth pluming herself on her own strength on the bartrand immunity from vulgar human error she had drifted into a position from which the pride of any simple village maiden must recoil she remembered her airs of easy patronage towards geoffrey from the first evening when he walked out to tintajeux on approval until this morning what could she have seemed like in his sight had he rated her as an over forward miss in her teens a hoyden wearing her heart ah shame upon her sleeve or had he doubted her worse humiliation still as every honest man must doubt a girl who under the convenient shield of greek and euclid could lend herself to the small meanness of coquetry she walked to the window buried her face amongst the cold swift falling rose petals then looked out on the landscape something strange had crept into its familiarity there trotted sylvestre rake in hand his livery exchanged for a fustian jacket to the clover field there were the farm buildings there was the row of poplars showing distinct against the sunset the china roses gave out their faint evanescent odour the big vault of northern sky was stainless and here was marjorie bartrand to all outward seeming the same marjorie bartrand as yesterday but out of tune for some queer reason with her surroundings the dew smelling roses the poplars the farm buildings yes old sylvestre himself had been her friends through her whole span of childish life with the new life that was awakening with the stir of alien emotion in her breast they were unsympathetic geoffrey arbuthnot what geoffrey thought of her what geoffrey felt towards her these were the questions burning in marjories soul transforming her as no lengthening of skirts or plaiting of hair had ever done from a child to a woman suddenly a mans quick step advanced along the gravel road that led from the side lodge to the manoir the step stopped marjorie heard her grandfathers voice she put her head forth through the window hoping dreading that geff repentant after their half quarrel of the forenoon might have walked out to tintajeux to be forgiven in lieu of geffs stalwart outline the diminutive figure of the country postman met her sight the seigneur ready always as a boy for the moments amusement was overlooking the contents of the village letter bag a letter for you witch clear resonant rang the old voice as andros bartrand caught sight of marjorie a letter and a bulky one the address is written in a hand that savours of the alma mater the postmark is local i am to open it for you of course if you do i start for spain to night this moment cried marjorie with fine bartrand presence of temper her grandfather meanwhile proceeding in pantomime to carry out his suggestion if you do sir but the sequel of the threat remained unspoken away flew marjorie through the low schoolroom window away without drawing breath over flower border over lawn till she reached the seigneur a few seconds later her letter her first love letter whispered a voice in the white and girlish conscience lay with seal unbroken between her hands she could not read it here under this open largeness of air and sky with her grandfathers searching eyes fixed on her face she must heighten her pleasure as not so many summers back she was wont to heighten the coveted flavour of peach or nectarine by eked out anticipation not here not in the schoolroom peopled by commonplace remembrances of sophie le patourel and all the long train of sophies predecessors in this ineffable moment are not our mistakes the sweetest things we taste on earth she must be alone must know that a bolt was drawn between her happiness and the world she entered the house with eager limbs sped up the stairs light still with the brief flicker that comes between sunset and dusk she sought the shelter of her own room a little white draped room where fragrant alder blooms flecks of foam on a deep green sea of foliage brushed the casement where you could feel the coolness from the orchards where only the tired evening call of the cuckoo the murmur of late bees still awork in blossom dust broke silence miss marjorie bartrand tintajeux manoir guernsey prolonging her suspense to the utmost marjorie ran over aloud each syllable that geff arbuthnots hand had traced then with fast beating pulse she opened the envelope drew forth its contents and prepared delightedly to read the love letter was written upon blue most unloverlike foolscap and consisted of three words geoffrey arbuthnots compliments within carefully folded lay marjories waist belt intact as when she looped it to his bunch of roses and heliotropes in the moonlight so she had won obedience even in the light matter of keeping or not keeping a bit of ribbon she had had her way and her breast swelled with disappointment the hot tears rushed to her eyes in this moment marjorie bartrands illogical heart owned geoffrey as its master chapter xvi a rash resolve the strength the delicacy of geff arbuthnots character were never better shown than in his present relations to dinah weaker men pay allegiance readily enough to the passion under whose sway they happen to rest geff was loyal with a fine a rare fidelity to the love that had passed away he was dinahs brother always and the story of saturdays rose show told him late that evening by dinahs lips sufficed to fill him with a more than vague misgiving he had wished often thinking over the difficult question of her welfare in his rough and ready way that dinah could be forcibly saved from solitude and cross stitch lo the rescuer was at hand but that rescuer geoffrey arbuthnots common sense informed him should be a very different galahad to lord rex basire acting on the moments impulse marjorie bartrand had made a tentative effort at lifting gastons wife into the fellowship of her kind and the experiment was too successful dinah so geff divined had scarcely taken one step in public before the little hero of a lesser hour the most popular man in his regiment the most sought after partner at the island balls thought fit the world looking on to throw himself at her feet and did you find pleasure in it all did you for a single moment feel amused to day something in geoffreys voice suggested a sharper note of interrogation than was supplied by his words dinah and geff stood together on the same spot of lawn where we first heard the arbuthnot trio talking of sentiment while they breakfasted gaston was dining out whether at the fort william mess or at doctor thornes house dinah had not sought to know of what avail to ask for truth when you have once been answered with a fable no matter how prettily that fable was illustrated i was pleased for a time gaston showed no anger at my coming it amused me to hear lord rex basire talking down as he thought to my rustic understanding then without warning dinah turned away she looked at the pale horizon line of sea i had a few moments horrible pain you were ill exclaimed geoffrey uncertain of her drift no geff no i dont mean such pain as people consult the doctors for the pain was at my heart a sickening doubt of every one a feeling that i stood on one side and all the rest of the world on the other a sudden despair of life geoffrey she went on with the gay people walking about and the flowers smelling sweet and the music playing it did seem to me for a few seconds space that my heart must break and on which side did you range me in your thoughts was i with you or with all the rest of the world asked geoffrey arbuthnot these half confessions of dinahs were no new experience to him she never uttered an ungenerous suspicion of gaston never made a complaint as to her own neglected life and still a kind of moral moan had of late been constantly in poor dinahs talk the warm womans heart ill at rest jealous with no wholesome work or interest to keep emotion subordinate was always unconsciously on the brink of betraying its secret he looked with pity that could never tire at her averted face you geff she cried putting on a brighter tone why you were on my side of course you do everything good that is done for me in this world through you for certain miss bartrand came all the way from tintajeux to call on me dont give me credit on that score marjorie bartrands doings are guided by no living person save marjorie bartrand she had made up her mind to know you had heard doubtless about you and gaston among the islanders and of her own free will sought you out count me for nothing said geoffrey arbuthnot in any action or caprice of marjorie bartrands had heard about me and gaston dinah repeated his words with the preoccupation of morbidly strained feeling i think one may know pretty well what that means no wonder so many people turned round to look at me at saturdays rose show people turn to look at you generally do they not mrs arbuthnot there is as much human nature depend upon it in the heart of the channel as in hyde park or piccadilly that is more like a speech of lord rex basires than of yours cried dinah with a laugh unlike her own throw in a lisp varnished shoes a waistcoat and a double eyeglass and i could believe it was his lordship not geff arbuthnot who was condescending to talk to me you must have put forth all your charity have exercised a great deal of wasted patience in allowing his lordship to condescend at all chiefly through gastons spirited character sketches over the breakfast table geoffrey had long ago known with certainty what manner of man lord rex basire was instead of answering dinah stooped above a head of garden lilies the dense white of whose petals showed waxen and spotless through the gloom i like the smell of lilies better than of all other flowers that blow so after a minute her rich low voice came to geoffrey i can never smell them nor yet lavender without thinking of aunt susans garden at lesser cheriton where geff first saw her the garden amidst whose crowding summer verdure he stood at the moment when his youth went from him when dinah and gaston hand clasped in hand bent towards each other in the level sunlight at this hour with the whispers of a new love stirring in his heart geoffrey arbuthnot could not hear that distant time spoken of above all by dinahs lips without a thrill of the old passion the old maddened blinding sense of loss overcoming him it might have been well for some of us he began if we had never heard the name of lesser cheriton but dinah interrupted him quickly no geoffrey i can never believe that if it means anything it must mean i had better not have married gaston i should have no hope no religion i should be a woman ready for any desperate action if i thought that my life just as i have it was not the one god had cut out for me as best the fact is you know i have been too narrow she went on hurriedly something has been running in my mind all this evening some idle talk of lord rex basires that i may repeat to you another time and i begin to see my conduct in a new light from the day gaston married me i have been too narrow far in what way give me one or two specimens of your overnarrowness i have tried to make the sayings of one class fit in with the doings of another i have thought that right and wrong must be the same everywhere this was my ignorance if i had taken up well with gastons sort of opinions she added making an unsuccessful attempt at gaiety it might be better for me and for him too now i differ from you said geff somewhat coldly right and wrong are the same in every class it would be an excellent thing for your health and spirits to get more change more society stop there remain for ever added geff warmly in such ignorance as yours and indeed the thought crossed him that at this hour what dinah needed was safer anchorage not wider ship room your happiness and gastons would be wrecked if you attempted to rule life by any other sayings than your own but there was a goodly alloy of mild obstinacy in dinah arbuthnots character a given idea started and she was slow to part with it the recesses of her mind would seem to shut with pertinacious closeness over any decided impression once made and the key for opening these recesses could not always be found even by dinah herself from whatever source the sudden conviction of her narrowness arose another four and twenty hours showed geoffrey that the conviction was genuine dinah had made some kind of compact with herself not only in the matter of opinions but of conduct on the following day sunday it happened that lord rex walked home with mrs arbuthnot from morning service at the town church invited by gaston whose easy hospitality extended itself to most men lord rex remained to lunch he stayed on long after gastons afternoon engagements had taken him elsewhere and dinah although her cheeks flushed her spirit chafed endured this her first experience in the difficult duties of a hostess without complaint lord rex basire kept his sabbath it seems in millers hotel observed geff when the arbuthnot cousins were smoking one his short briar pipe the other a delicately flavoured cigarette after dinner geoffreys own sabbath had been kept in the wards of the hospital full to overflowing with the survivors of the quarry accident no wonder dinah confesses to a headache that lads talk a nice mixture of slang and assurance judging from the specimens he gave us at lunch would scarcely be of the nature dinah loves oh i dont know basire can be very fair company when he likes said gaston with philosophic optimism he is not a giant intellectually but in their heart of hearts geff however unflattering this may be to you and me women dont care a straw for intellectual men until they have been authoritatively labelled the island ladies from madame the archdeaconess downwards delight in lord rex title disabled arm slang assurance all imagine five hours of him at a stretch that is about what your wife had to live through to day dinah is rousing herself i hope and believe it will do her all the good in the world to live through being bored this was said with amiable imperturbability by dinahs husband i trust for her own sake poor girl she is learning reason beginning to discover there may be other music in the spheres besides that of the eternal domestic duo without accompaniment geoffrey arbuthnot puffed away at his pipe in silence it was a great thing getting her to the rose show for that geff i suspect i must thank you gaston gave a penetrating glance at his cousins face miss bartrand would certainly not have called on us but at your instigation and through miss bartrand my poor dinah has been introduced well to lord rex basire an open sesame let us trust to the strictly guarded gates of insular society chapter xvii the first crumpled rose leaf rex basire showed no disposition to let his newly made acquaintance with dinah arbuthnot cool long before the hour for visitors on monday afternoon louise the french waitress entered the arbuthnots parlour she placed before dinah a card also a bouquet made up entirely of white and costly hothouse flowers just like the bouquet gaston gave her on her wedding morning thought dinah with a rush of bitter sweet recollection the monsieur who was here yesterday le petit milor au moustache blond demanded news of madame was madame visible should she louise pray milor to enter dinah glanced with indifference at card and flowers alike then she rose from her work table gaston arbuthnot it happened was at home putting the finishing touches to dodos despair in his improvised studio walking quickly to the open window dinah in a whisper appealed to her husband gaston how shall i get rid of lord rex basire he has sent in his card and some flowers as if flowers from a stranger could give one pleasure he demands news of me the french girl says but that is too senseless tell me the civil way to to shut the door in his face observed gaston arbuthnot looking up from his model as dinah hesitated why shut the door at all the poor boy will be better off talking to you than he would be making useless purchases for young ladies in the petersport shops but i am at work i am counting off stitches for the forget me nots round aunt susans ottoman and then i shall come outside i want no company but yours basire will help you to count forget me nots the very employment he would delight in and raising his voice gaston arbuthnot called cheerily to the servant that madame was visible there was no time for dinah to escape in another minute lord rex had followed his hothouse bouquet his card and the french waitress into her presence she suffered him to possess her hand for one chill unwilling instant determined after a somewhat confused and halting fashion to amend the error of her ways to instruct herself as in a book in the usages of gastons world poor dinah shrank like a child from the initiatory chapter of her lesson she had endured lord rex yesterday in the spirit of martyrdom but to day to morrow over what space between the present time and september was her endurance to last i was afraid if i waited till the afternoon you would be out mrs arbuthnot and i have a weighty matter to put into your hands i i mean an awfully great favour to ask of you rex basire as garrison society knew him was a youth weighted by no undue modesty no obsolete chivalrous deference in his manner towards woman he really shone little though dinah might appreciate such shining as he stood hesitating for a moment half abashed before the calm coldness of her face you will forgive me for calling at this unholy hour he proceeded as she remained silent dinah arbuthnot glanced towards the flood of sunshine that rested on the flower bright borders of mr millers garden why is the hour unholy she inquired with slow gravity i mean an hour when you were certain to be busy said lord rex approaching her work table now i can see i am interrupting you mrs arbuthnot am i not he drew forward a chair for dinah then after standing for some appreciable time and finding that she neither spoke to him nor looked at him he seated himself uninvited awful shame isnt it to interrupt you like this it does not matter much my lord my time was occupied in nothing more important than counting stitches for a border that dreariest form of feminine arithmetic dinahs lips relaxed as my husband calls it does your husband say so really just what one might expect all husbands are alike modelling his clay outside mr arbuthnot smiled good humouredly to himself at the remark now to me you mustnt mind my saying so lovely woman is never so lovely as when she is absolutely a woman dead against the higher education business girl graduates platform females you know the style of thing i mean only one out of my tribe of sisters vic the eldest works at her needle my favourite sister from my cradle rex basire felt that he threw a shade of discriminative yet unmistakable flattery into this avowal of family preference dinah held her peace having in her possession none of those useful colloquial counters which less uninformed persons have agreed to accept as coin rex basires generalisation about husbands lingered in her mind with unpleasant with personal significance was it possible that gastons coolness towards her had become matter of comment in the idle little world to which linda thorne and lord rex basire both belonged i work at my needle she remarked presently because i am not gifted enough to do better things if i had talent a tenth part of talent like gastons i should not spend my time counting threads of canvas so the discriminative flattery had fallen through lord rex tapped his exceedingly white teeth with the top of his cane he searched diligently throughout the length and breadth of his brain for subject matter and found the land naked his want of inspiration must he began to think be mrs arbuthnots fault these constant allusions to the absent husband were crushingly unsuggestive tended indeed towards irksomeness arbuthnot was a well looking man enough of the usual american type clever possibly in his way could knead up clay into droll little figures and sing french songs without accent it was distinctly not to listen to gaston arbuthnots praises that lord rex had toiled under a hot sun and at this unholy hour from fort william barracks up to millers sarnian hotel he asked himself if dinah were really as beautiful as during the past two days and nights she had appeared before him in his dreams with a world full of charming women most of them disposed thought lord rex to value one adequately were this particular womans good graces high enough stakes to be worth playing for was she really if one watched her dispassionately so beautiful dinah set up her frame and leaning over it began or went through the semblance of beginning to count her stitches in doing so the line of down bent golden head the sweep of lash on the pink cheek the outline of throat and shoulder were given with full unconscious effect to lord rex and the young mans heresy left him whatever his other scepticisms he felt while he lived he could never doubt more on one subject the flawlessness of dinah arbuthnots beauty please let me help you in your dreary arithmetic mrs arbuthnot lend me a needle at least and give me a trial i have only one hand to use but i have been shown often how worsted work stitches are counted and indeed rex basire had had a pretty wide training in most unprofitable pursuits each little painted square of the pattern goes for two threads does it not i am sure i did not know gentlemen understood about cross stitch and dinah reluctantly surrendered her canvas to his outstretched hand your lordship she added will never make out the different shades of blue this forget me not border is the most heart breaking pattern i have worked your lordship your lordship gastons face assumed an unwonted liveliness of colour as his wifes voice reached him would dinah never leave off talking as the young ladies talk behind the counters in glove shops he asked himself would she never learn the common everyday titles by which men and women address each other in the world the clay was no longer plastic under mr arbuthnots touch he moved without sound to the window he took a discerning glance at the two people seated beside the table lord rex with masculine awkward fingers solemnly parcelling out canvas forget me nots as though his commission depended on his accuracy dinah a look of shy amusement on her face demurely watching him gaston arbuthnot took one glance then he put aside his tools wrapped a wet cloth hastily around dodos despair and with a manner not devoid of a certain impatience prepared to quit his studio could it be the question presented itself unbidden that a shadow of coming distrust had fallen on him the thought was absurd he gaston arbuthnot distrustful of the gentle home staying girl whose devotion to himself had at times poor dinah amounted to something worse than a fault an inconvenience that to morrows sun should rise in the east was not a surer fact than that his wifes griselda like fidelity should endure to the end and still in the inmost conscience of him gaston arbuthnot was uncomfortable he had spent nearly four years of absolute trust four golden years of youth of love with the sweetest companion that ever blest the lot of erring man in this moment he realised the sensation of the first crumpled rose leaf commonly jealous he could not be his temperament the circumstances of his lot forbade ignoble feeling he knew that for a man like rex basire toleration must be the kindliest sentiment that dinah with difficulty could bring herself to entertain it was not jealousy not distrust it was simply the reversal of all past experience that disconcerted gastons mind it was the whole abnormal picture the diverted look on dinahs face her embroidery needle and canvas hers between rex basires fingers that was so blankly unwelcome in his sight if gaston arbuthnot ever in his life was an actor in a similar bit of drawing room comedy you may be sure the rle chosen by him had been the one now played by lord rex some other fellow mortal in a blouse and with clay stained hands may have watched from the slips it was gaston who counted the stitches he was not cut out by nature to take subordinate parts and this his first little taste of abdicated power had a singularly insipid flavour to his palate chapter xviii how dinah said yes rex basire meanwhile counted manfully on a hundred and ten from the corner scroll to the first line of blue and seventy six either way of grounding emboldened by success he insisted upon filling in the yellow heart of a single forget me not just as a souvenir he pleaded contriving to get through the task cleverly enough a twelvemonth hence when half the world lay between them he thought mrs arbuthnot might look at the centre of this forget me not and remember to day i shall remember a length of filoselle wasted your lordships stitches must be picked out at once they are worked the wrong way of the silk taking back the needle and canvas dinah began to put her threat into instant execution a twelvemonth hence she added i hope to be looking at something more interesting than wool work most of my pieces get stored away for no one in particular this ottoman is for my aunt susan in cambridgeshire it will be a great set off to her front parlour dinah admitted this with a tinge of artists pride but i am not likely to see it there we have not been to cheriton for four years and happy aunt susan exclaimed lord rex who was wont to be a little impudent without awakening anger what would i give to have not an ottoman for my front parlour but something modest a kettle holder with an appropriate motto say worked for me by fair and charitable fingers by your favourite sisters perhaps dinahs voice was cold and clear as ice as she offered the suggestion you are in an unkind mood mrs arbuthnot so unkind lord rex took up a pair of scissors and regarded them solemnly as though they had been the shears of fate that i feel beforehand you mean to say no to everything i ask i told you did i not that i had come to put a weighty matter into your hands do nothing of the kind my lord i am unused to receiving favours from a stranger your flowers are very beautiful with a touch dinah placed the bouquet two or three inches farther from her and i daresay your lordship meant it kindly to bring them that is enough i live quite retired and stopping short dinah coloured violently at this moment she heard gastons tread as he ran down the outer stone staircase she knew that she was left alone with rex basire for just as long as rex basire might think fit to stay but we hope to win a favour from you the subalterns of the regiment are getting up a party for wednesday and we want to know if you will condescend to play hostess for us we mean to be original lord rex hurried on not giving dinah time to speak and refuse instead of having a humdrum dance or dinner on terra firma we mean to charter a yacht the princess now lying in guernsey harbour and carry all the nicest looking people in the island out to sea dinahs eyes gave him a look of momentary but severe disapproval for this a hostess is imperatively needed chaperonage in its most venerable form we can command ive been spending the forenoon i give you my word i have in paying court to old ladies miss tighe smiles on our project the archdeaconess does not frown of course we have mrs verschoyle but we want a great deal more than venerable chaperons we want a young and charming lady to do the honours for us mrs arbuthnot we want you now dinahs nature held as little commonplace vanity as could well fall to womans share through commonplace vanity had lord rex never at this juncture won her to say yes from pleasure so called she had shrunk more than ever since the taste she got of pleasure at the rose show yes during the very hours when with rash strategy she had been planning to act a part in gaston arbuthnots world among gastons friends but every human being given a wide enough scope must end by justifying the cynics aphorism the resisting powers of the best man of the best woman living have their price so far as insignificant mundane matters are concerned no need to seek far for poor sore hearted dinahs price whispers of the projected yachting party had for several days past reached her chiefly in fragments of talk between her husband and the other boarders in millers hotel she knew that gaston was an invited guest she had an impression based on air and yet like many a jealous fear not all foundationless that linda thorne was to be the quasi hostess the graceful presiding influence of the hour me you ask me she faltered sensible of a blinding rush of temptation and not lifting her eyes from the canvas where she had now effaced the last trace of lord rexs handiwork i should think others would be more suitable i should think the blood forsook her lips as she suggested the name that mrs thorne oh we have decided all of us against linda said lord rex with his usual cool sincerity mrs thorne is the nicest woman going on shore of that i am convinced and she has been kind enough to murmur an experimental yes though no one acknowledges to having asked her a suspicion goes about that it was arbuthnot but mrs thornes qualities are not sea going she has not the marine foot as your husband would say she and the doctor will be of our party of course but linda could never play the part of hostess for us oscar jones took her and the de carteret girls out sand eeling you know little oscar the one handsome fellow in the regiment and mrs linda was sea sick straight through the jolliest night of may moonlight you like the ocean i am sure mrs arbuthnot yes i like it years ago when we had not long been married mr arbuthnot hired a little cutter yacht we spent four weeks at sea off the coast of scotland they were the happiest weeks of my life dinah said this with her accustomed quiet reserve yet had lord rex known her better he might have discerned a tremor in her voice as she recalled those far off days days when neither mistrust nor coldness had marred the first ineffable joy of her love for gaston arbuthnot that is all right i am a second byron myself the sea is my passion it would have been a sort of blow i hope you understand me when i say that it would have been a sort of blow to hear you say you were a bad sailor dinah who never helped out a flattering speech direct or implied looked away from him a suspicion goes about that it was arbuthnot the words rang in her ears light words heedlessly spoken yet destined to swell the total with which gaston arbuthnot was already too heavily credited on the balance sheet of his wifes heart we may count upon you may we not arbuthnot has accepted for himself now we want your promise if the weather continues like this we may rely upon seeing you on board the princess next wednesday you have not explained what seeing me on board the princess means dinahs tone was evasive probably thought lord rex the puritanical conscience required time to collect itself i dont know at my staid age she added that i should countenance you what did you say about carrying all the nice looking people in guernsey out to sea upon this slight whisper of encouragement rex basire entered voluminously into details the proprieties to begin he declared solemn of face with the facts of greatest significance the proprieties were set at rest an undeniable archdeaconess a cassandra tighe minus nothing but her harp were secured the de carteret girls and rosie verschoyle four of the guernsey beauties regnant had accepted it would be a high spring tide on wednesday and the princess must start early to reach the race of alderney before the ebb afternoon would find them anchored off langrune in normandy where we shall land observe the manners and customs of the natives eat a french dinner take our little whirl perhaps in the casino ball room said lord rex and so back la pepys to our virtuous homes the scheme is too gay for me cried dinah with an uneasy dread of gastons disapproval i never danced in my life i hope no i am sure my lord that i shall never set foot inside the walls of a casino not of a french casino mrs arbuthnot lord rex argued warily still mindful of the puritanical note certainly not a french casino why that only makes it worse a french casino is an innocent kind of sea side dancing school papas and mammas of families sit around small boys and girls exhibit their steps papa drinks his little glass of absinthe mamma her tumbler of sugar water we go back to our hotel hand in hand with the babies at ten oclock except the zoological gardens on week days i know no human form of dissipation so mild as a french casino i should have to meet too many strangers on board i should be alone among them all the only lady in guernsey who has called on me is geffs pupil miss bartrand of tintajeux who will be invited to come under your charge lord rex adroitly left more delicate social questions untouched marjorie bartrand would be rough on a chaperon i should think difficult to say whom the girtonian of the future would not be rough on but you mrs arbuthnot seem to have stepped into her favour and is geoffrey to be asked geoffrey ah to be sure your cousin senior wrangler was he not geoffrey took his honours in classics frightfully boss man any way does not look as if he cared about frivolous amusements in general still lord rex hesitated some finer prophetic sense informed him that geoffrey arbuthnots might be a name as well omitted from the programme of pleasure he was chalking out with such zealous trouble for next wednesday but is the party to be frivolous i hardly understood that no one loves the sea better than geff he will go im sure if i go this was said by dinah with conviction through long habit she had come to regard geoffreys obedience to her smallest wish as an accomplished fact notes shall be despatched to miss bartrand and to your cousin without an hours delay i am awfully indebted to you mrs arbuthnot you cant think what a load of moral obligation you have taken off my mind by saying yes and when lord rex left millers hotel he was radiant a possibility of geoffrey arbuthnot saying yes also the one little shadow of a cloud that obscured next wednesdays horizon on his return to fort william later on in the day his road took him past the garden gate of doctor thornes bungalow the gate stood open and lord rex sauntered in as it was the habit of unoccupied insular youth to do during the afternoon hours of tea and gossip small rahnee and her ayah were picturesquely grouped upon a bright square of persian carpet on the lawn a macaw and two tame parrots gave a local or eastern colour to the scene as they screeched from their perches among the garden shrubs within one of the drawing room windows bay windows opening to the ground reposed linda her dress was of embroidered indian muslin not absolutely innocent of darns perhaps for the doctor retained so much of old bachelor habit as to be his own housekeeper and poor linda must practise many a humiliating economy in her lot of femme incomprise bangles similar to rahnees concealed the outline of the ladys thin wrists her black hair worn in a single coil revealed sharply the outline of her head lindas one incontestably good point the cunningly arranged shadow of a rose coloured window awning if it did not hide at least threw possible defects of complexion suspicions of coming crows feet into uncertainty linda thorne was not a pretty woman lord rex his eyes still dazzled by dinahs wild rose face felt more than usually cognisant of the fact and still with rahnee and the turbaned ayah with the macaws and parrots the embroidered indian dress the indian looking bungalow linda composed well she formed the central figure of a benjamin constant picture right pleasant to behold a hum of animated voices was in the air three or four young and pretty girls were distributed spots of agreeable colour about lindas sober hued drawing room the prettiest of them all presided over a miniature tea table drawn close beside the hostess at the open window and the burthen of everybodys talk the clashing point of everybodys opinions was next wednesdays yachting party we are to start at seven mamma heard it from captain ozanne himself at midnight of tuesday the princess will be away twenty four hours a week at least rosie and madame corbie is to be chaperon i heard cassandra tighe there are to be no chaperons worth speaking of for of course dont be offended linda we cannot look upon you as one so so you are quite wrong all of you exclaimed lord rex his head peeping up suddenly across linda thornes shoulder miss verschoyle will you give me a cup of tea if i promise to set you right in a few of your guesses a cup of tea and your protection for i am certain to be well attacked this stimulates our curiosity to the proper point the young lady answered with a doubtful smile but making place for lord rex at her side at the same time it is an admission you have been doing something rather less wise than usual do you take six or seven lumps of sugar in your tea lord rex i never remember the precise number rosie verschoyle was a bright complexioned dimpled girl of nineteen with an exactly proportioned waist of society an exactly correct profile the exact mass of nut brown hair that fashion requires descending to her brows and a pair of large nut brown somewhat spaniel like eyes until dinahs advent lord rex thought rosie the fairest among the beauties regnant and was openly her slave at all the picnics and garden parties going miss verschoyle had not the air of encouraging these attentions she seldom lost a chance of making rex basires vanity smart and had been known to say that she positively disliked that plain forward boy who managed to scare away really pleasant partners and monopolise ones best dances and still throughout the whole island society among rosies more intimate girl friends notably there had been a growing suspicion for some time past that miss verschoyle would one day marry lord rex basire i take as many lumps as miss verschoyle chooses to give me he received the cup with mock humility from her plump white inexpressive hands the sweets and bitters as they come bitters in tea echoed rosie opening her brown eyes wide steer clear of metaphors lord rex they really do not suit your style of eloquence rosie rosie while you two children spar the rest of us are dying of curiosity the admonition was made in lindas smoothest voice lord rex recollect your promise you know you are to set us all right what are the plans for wednesday why are we certain when we have heard these plans to attack you come here and make confession lord rex perched himself obediently on a stool near mrs thornes feet then sipping the tea sweetened for him by rosie verschoyle with more trepidation of spirit so he afterwards owned than he ever felt before the fire of an enemy he thus began his shrift we have made due inquiry from the harbour master and find the princess must clear out as soon as the first english steamer is signalled will seven oclock be too early for you all a chorus of cheerfully acquiescent voices answered no we have also invited madame corbie and the archdeacon it seems for an expedition of the kind one ought to have a real substantial chaperon or two i beg your pardon mrs thorne but oh dont apologise cried linda with good humour willing like most of her sex to condone the accusation of over youth and madame corbie accepts conditionally i have been paying my court to aged ladies half the morning so unconditionally does miss tighe as regards chaperonage one may say really really hesitated lord rex feeling in his guilty soul how red he grew one may say mrs thorne that in the matter of chaperons there will be an embarrassment of riches especially as mamma never allows me to go anywhere without herself was it about the superabundance of chaperons that you knew we should attack you rosie verschoyle asked the question in her gay thin little voice her unpremeditated manner yet with a directness of aim that poor lord rex had not the cleverness to parry attack me why that was only a foolish joke dont you know yes we we have mrs verschoyle and the archdeaconess as chaperons in chief only poor mrs verschoyle the moment the princess moves will be in the cabin and the archdeaconess try not to look so conscious the archdeaconess if the wind veers between this and wednesday will not start at all and so as we must have a married lady to do hostess for us and as you mrs thorne are also not a first rate sailor i have asked mrs arbuthnot a heavy silence followed upon this announcement linda thorne was the first to break it and mrs arbuthnot has accepted i need hardly ask the question yes returned lord rex staunchly enough i am glad to say that mrs arbuthnot has accepted rosie verschoyle turned over and examined a band of silver on her round white wrist mrs arbuthnot surely that is the same person we saw with marjorie bartrand at the rose show how wonderfully handsome she is mamma has talked of nothing else one will be quite too glad to see her near in these democratic days we must all bow unquestioningly before beauty the capital b renders it abstract lord rex felt the speech to be ungenerous vague questionings that he had once or twice held within himself as to whether he might or might not be in danger of liking miss verschoyle too well received an impromptu solution at this moment he was in no danger at all held the local estimate of her good looks even to be overstrained as she stood before him in her fulness of youthful grace the delicate profile held aloft the little cruel sentences escaping one by one from her pouting red lips rosies prettiness seemed changed to rex basire as though the wand of some malignant fairy godmother had secretly touched her my political opinions outstep democracy miss verschoyle but if i were as starched a tory as as my own father by jove i should think mrs arbuthnots society an honour i dont understand that sort of thing the tone people put on in speaking of a woman whose only crime is her beauty mrs arbuthnot if she needs a defender is fortunate in possessing so warm a one the remark was made by rosie verschoyle with unwise readiness but one could never imagine her poor dear needing anything of the kind it was linda thorne who spoke i have been introduced to mrs arbuthnot by her husband i have heard about her also from him and i am sure she is quite the most harmless of individuals not naturally bright like too many other gifted creatures mr arbuthnot may know the want of household sympathy gets along capitally without it interrupted lord rex never saw any man better satisfied with himself and with his life than arbuthnot not naturally bright and lacking the education which in more fortunate people serves as a varnish to poorness of ability if they stay here long enough i shall persuade mr arbuthnot as a duty to make his wife take lessons in music riding calisthenics anything to beguile her from that patient that perpetual cross stitch lord rex gave a searching look at linda thornes face his was no very high or luminous character as will be seen in the after course of this history yet were his failings chiefly those of his age and circumstances when he erred it was without premeditation walking along tracks trodden hard by others his virtues were his own and among these was the virtue of thorough straightforwardness it trembled on lord rexs tongue to ask linda a crucial question relative to gaston arbuthnots duty when approaching footsteps made themselves heard along the gravel drive there came a shrill shout of welcome in rahnees voice a torrent of pigeon english presumably from the ayah in which the words missy butnot might be distinguished linda thornes indian bleached cheeks assumed a just perceptible shade of red talk of angels she observed raising her finger to her lips and straightway we hear the flutter of their wings it would be wise to choose a rather less invidious theme than the demerits of cross stitch and then almost before she finished speaking gaston arbuthnot with the quiet air of a man certain of the reception that awaits him entered upon the scene next wednesdays yachting expedition continued to be the subject of talk among lindas visitors but it was talk with a difference the character of ophelia cut by desire from the play hard to bewail the lot of gifted creatures or discuss the necessity in these democratic days of bowing down to beauty with dinahs husband taking part in ones conversation when the party had dispersed however lord rex in spite of his disenchantment escorting rosie verschoyle home when linda thorne was left alone with gaston arbuthnot she spoke her mind and her tone was one which all her social knowledge all her powers of self command and self effacement failed to render sweet now it was a peculiarity belonging to gaston arbuthnots character that he was apt to mystify every human creature his cousin geoffrey excepted with whom his relations were near the more intimate you became with this man the less firm seemed the moral grip by which you held him dinahs over diffident heart perpetually doubted the stability of his love she was unhappy with him dreading lest in her society he were not enough amused she was unhappy away from him dreading lest in her absence he were amused too well linda thorne was equally at fault as to the texture of his friendship long years ago gaston arbuthnots boyish good looks perhaps it must be owned gaston arbuthnots devoted attentions won all of tender sentiment that linda then a neglected overworked governess had to give she had been to india in the interval she had learnt the market worth of sentiment there was dr thorne rahnee there were her duties real and histrionic to fill her life and the days of her youth had reached the flickering hour before twilight but linda had not forgiven gaston arbuthnot she had not forgotten how near she once came to loving him and she was sorely unreasonably wounded through vanity rather than through feeling by dinahs fresh and girlish charm an anomalous position perhaps a commoner one than some young wives morbidly sensitive as to alien influence over their husbands may suspect so there has been a small imbroglio about wednesdays arrangements i cannot tell you how glad i am to be relieved from a weight of sea going responsibility mrs arbuthnot i am sure will enact hostess for our young subalterns so much more gracefully than i could she is a good sailor doubtless gaston had taken up a morsel of drawing paper and some red chalk every kind of artistic appliance had found its way of late into mrs thornes drawing room some ideal womans face with beauty with anger on it was growing into life under his hand he finished in a few delicate subtle touches the shadow between a low greek brow and eyelid ere he spoke dinah is a famous sailor we look back to a little scottish yachting tour we made soon after our marriage as about the best time of our lives linda thorne a fair decipherer of surface feeling in general could gather absolutely nothing from gastons level tone he raised his eyes during a steady second or two from his paper he met her interrogative glance with one of strict neutrality i am relieved and at the same time stupidly inquisitive now why in the name of all things truthful did you not mention that mrs arbuthnot meant to go with us on wednesday gaston was silent too absorbed perhaps in his creation slight chalk sketch though it was to give heed to matter so unimportant as this which linda pressed upon him possibly you were not aware that mrs arbuthnot was going linda thorne hazarded the remark with a suspicion of innocent malice that really is the truth taking a folding book from his breast gaston stored away his sketch carefully between its leaves you must excuse me mrs thorne an idea struck me just now suggested by a look i surprised on the face of miss verschoyle and i hastened forthwith to make my memorandum dinah to enact hostess for the subalterns on wednesday do you say surely not i could almost wish that it were to be so but my wife as you know keeps to her own quiet way of life we have lord rex basires word for it according to lord rex mrs arbuthnot has most decidedly accepted their invitation dinah does not mean to go lord rex deceives himself gaston arbuthnot spoke with sincerity he had told geoffrey as a jest that dinah was turning over a new leaf beginning to discover poor girl that there might be other music in the spheres besides that of the eternal domestic duo without accompaniment of dinahs profoundly changed mood her resolve of gaining wider views by frequenting a world which as yet she knew not he was ignorant linda thorne watched him sceptically pray do not dash my hopes i trust and i believe that mrs arbuthnot will play hostess to us all next wednesday come she added with rather forced playfulness will you make me a bet about it i will give you any amount of odds you like in jouvins best it is against my principles to bet on a certainty mrs thorne i am as certain that dinah has not pledged herself for wednesdays picnic as that i have pledged myself to dine with dr and mrs thorne this evening but in spite of his assured voice a shade of restlessness was to be traced in gaston arbuthnots manner he would not remain as it had become his habit to do at the bungalow singing or drawing or chatting away the two hours between afternoon tea and dinner in lindas society even rahnee to gastons mind the first attraction in the house must forego her usual game of hide and seek with missy butnot even rahnee threw her thin bangled arms round her playmates neck in vain frankly so at last he was brought to make confession he had forgotten to tell dinah of his engagement must hurry back forthwith to millers hotel to set dinahs heart at rest unnecessary ah mrs thorne and as he spoke gastons eyes looked straight into the ladys soul that question of necessity just depends upon the state of ones domestic legislation regarding these small matters my wife and i fortunately for ourselves are in our honeymoon stage still this was always gastons tone in speaking of dinah at the bungalow he painted truth in truths brightest colours whenever he afforded linda thorne a glimpse of his own household happiness chapter xix gaston arbuthnots philosophy the first dressing bell was ringing by the time he reached the hotel dinahs parlour was empty her embroidery frame silver paper shrouding its impossible forget me nots and auriculas from the light of heaven stood on her work table passing into the adjoining room without knocking mr arbuthnot beheld a sight not new to him save as regarded the hour of the day dinah on her knees beside her bed her head bowed her face hidden between her hands she rose up hurriedly at the sound of her husbands entrance she brushed away some tell tale tears not however before gastons quick glance had had opportunity to detect them all men dislike the sight of a wife in tears a small minority may dislike the sight of a wife on her knees gaston arbuthnot shared both prejudices he concealed his irritation under a kiss cold mechanical the recipient felt those kisses to be bestowed on each of dinahs flushing cheeks i beg a thousand pardons for disturbing you at your prayers my dear but i was not praying i wish i had been interrupted dinah promptly to pray ones heart must be at rest now gaston arbuthnot looked upon all strong and unpleasant emotion with a feeling bordering on actual repugnance and dinahs voice had that in it which threatened storm his irritation grew i beg your pardon for interrupting a mood not calm enough for prayer although it required a prayerful attitude yet sad enough for tears that terrible habit of weeping will wear away even your good looks in time dinah a time far distant surely never had she been fairer in gastons sight than at this moment in her fresh cambric dinner dress with her hair like a nimbus of gold around her forehead with a colour vermeil as any italian dawn on the cheeks his lips had newly touched i should like to keep my good looks till i am fifty years old if good looks were only faithful servants if they brought one only a taste of real happiness as it is my dear girl although you chance to be a little out of temper with life dont forget you have a husband i am a vain man so you and geff tell me and the chief of all my vanities is that i am blest with a handsome wife out of temper with life i think not gaston life has been sent me the rugged with the smooth and i must learn to fit myself to both if i had been clever i should have learnt my lesson long ago i must shape myself to things as they are not want to shape them according to my poor village notions i was trying to reason about it all just now in an attitude that i misunderstood observed gaston arbuthnot i go on my knees when i need to think clearly and humbly i would not dare to say at such times that i pray talk like this was beneath or above gaston arbuthnots level he told her so plainly my afternoon has been passed in a thoroughly mundane and grovelling manner dinah i left this house at about three just when you were giving lord rex basire a lesson in cross stitch since then i have been spending my time not in solemn thoughts that required genuflexion but in listening to the last little version of the last little bit of island gossip it seems you mean after all to go into the world where as i have often told you so many more sink than swim you have accepted rex basires invitation for the picnic next wednesday the accusation if it were one came with a sharpness of ring foreign to gaston arbuthnots modulated voice dinahs colour deepened i have accepted lord rex basires invitation for wednesday yes you cannot i think mean to go the picnic will be a helter skelter kind of affair it was got up by these young men in the first instance more as a frolic than anything else and you are going yourself are you not gaston that is uncertain i believe i did give a conditional consent over the dinner table before it was at all sure the thing would come off and mrs thorne is going oh linda goes everywhere there is a legend that she and the doctor dined one night at mess and madame corbie dont you think a party that is staid enough for an archdeacons wife must be safe for me it was dinah who spoke yet the tone the words were curiously unlike dinahs some other woman surely stood in the place of her who during four years had been as wax to every careless turn of gaston arbuthnots will i can see that you have made up your mind confess dinah you have run already to madame voisins and ordered your dress for wednesday she turned away impatiently at the question well i will not be unwise enough to argue at least persuade geoffrey to go too get geoffrey to take care of you had i been consulted remarked gaston drily i should have advised you to come out anywhere rather than on a yacht hired in this kind of way by lord rex basire and his brother subs gaston oh not because of the right or wrong of the thing i dont said gaston go in for transcendental attitudes morally or physically my advice would have been simply offered on a matter of taste you my love are doubtless the best judge what time is it seven then i have scarcely half an hour left to dress to dress faltered dinah and my briar roses our walk to roscoff common i have been looking forward to it for days did you not promise to draw me some real briar roses for the finish of my border of course i promised and of course i shall fulfil my dear child the roscoff roses will keep and you are going out to dinner again gaston only to the bungalow mr arbuthnot made a move towards the door of his dressing room mrs thorne is amiable enough generally to condone a morning coat to night i believe there will be more of a party than usual dinah rested her hand upon her husbands shoulder but not with the clinging imploring touch to which gaston arbuthnot was accustomed if i could have an answer to one question i should be content she exclaimed almost with passion it is an answer you can give what are mrs thornes gifts what is the cleverness which draws a man as difficult to please as you five days a week to her house the situation had become critical a feverish colour burned on dinahs face her question was trenchant and desperately to the point but it was just the hardest thing imaginable to get gaston arbuthnot into a tiptoe posture the drama of his life so he himself avowed consisted a good nine tenths of it of carpenters scenes if he were forced to declaim some passage of high and tragic blank verse it would inevitably sound like a bit of genteel comedy from his lips a husband of warmer temper it would be unjust to say of warmer heart must have kindled at the daring of dinahs words the ardent eagerness of her face gaston arbuthnot was interested rather than moved he answered with the chill candour of an impartial judge lindas gifts first on the list we must place the cardinal one of vocal silence mrs thorne does not sing she can accompany other people who do said dinah with imprudent significance and can accompany them well have i ever told you dinah how and where i first saw the lady who is now doctor thornes wife you have not you have never spoken to me about mrs thornes life past or present dinahs tone was as nearly acrid as her full and rounded quality of voice permitted she felt intuitively that gaston would parry her question as he had so often done before by apposite narrative which yet led no whither felt that though every word he spoke might be true to the letter the one truth of vital moment to herself would be in the words left unspoken it was in paris my love in long past days before i went to cambridge and when i was much less of an englishman than i am now my mother with a wholesome dread of my artist friends and of the quartier latin cultivated what she called occasions of family life for me one such occasion came to her hand under the same roof with us but on a lower floor as befitted their purse lived a rich jew family with a bevy of young daughters and an english governess linda thorne at that time linda smythe yes linda constantia was seated at a piano the first evening my mother forced me down to madame benjamins salon i think i see her now poor soul playing accompaniments to the singing the terrible operatic singing of papa benjamin by and by we danced in a round have you seen the bakers girl mary soak thy bread in wine and other mild dances of the unmarried french mees the governess remained at the piano still our good smeet she knows so well to efface herself said madame benjamin giving me a tumbler of sugar water to present to my countrywoman i might almost answer your question dinah in madame benjamins words linda thorne understands perfectly the difficult social art of effacing oneself was she effaced at saturdays rose show she was a locum tenens good naturedly presiding over the refreshment stall for some friend with a sprained ankle with an affection of the throat gaston so the story ran when you first told it me you are severe dinah if a pretty woman could possibly be tempted into feeling bitterly towards a plain one i should say that you were bitter towards linda thorne dinah was unsoftened by the compliment to efface oneself she repeated that means in homely plain english such as i talk and understand to keep gracefully in the background while others fill the prominent parts said gaston with a laugh if you knew linda thorne better if you could see her at one of her own charming little parties you would appreciate the knack she has of not shining she is quite the least selfish least self absorbed creature in the world straight warm living flew a denial from dinahs lips mrs thorne is wrapt in selfishness if she was a good true woman she must guess how the hearts of other women other wives bleed only at a thought of neglect i cant cope with her gaston for conversation she was born and educated a lady and i belong to the working people less taught when i was a child than they are now but that should make her generous she is rich in good things has she not got little rahnee and i have but the hope weak that hope grows at times of keeping your love a flush of annoyance overspread gaston arbuthnots handsome face if you would only take life in a quieter spirit dinah content yourself with the moments common happiness like the rest of us i speak in kindness my dear girl mr gaston arbuthnot here fell to examining his signet ring closely perhaps because he did not wish to meet his wifes eyes if you would care for any mortal thing in addition to that somewhat unworthy person gaston arbuthnot it would be better for us both dinah turned deadly white if the child had lived she uttered if we had her now nearly the age of rahnee my heart would not be so athirst for love it would come to me naturally just as i am no cleverer or brighter or more original you might find my company sufficient if we had the child we cannot cut out our lives by our own pattern said gaston with irrefragable philosophy the disappointment god knows was bitterly keen to both of us at the time looking round the world now i am disposed to wonder sometimes if the possession of a child be an unmixed blessing it would have been so to me the wound had never so thoroughly healed that dinah could bear a careless touch on the cicatrice but i have no right to complain she said this through her tears god gave and took away who am i to question his wisdom during several seconds mr arbuthnot seemed to grow more and more absorbed in the contemplation of his ring then by an alert side movement he contrived to reach the door of his dressing room you are going you intend really to dine with the thornes this evening dinah brushed her hand hastily across her eyes certainly i intend to keep my engagement answered gaston arbuthnot you would not break it if i asked you i would do any conceivable thing you asked me with sufficient cause i have too much opinion of your good taste to dread your ever placing yourself or me in a ridiculous position if you would i should give up all this plan for wednesday we would go back a soft far off look stole over dinahs face as though for a moment she indulged in the retrospect of some too dear dream go back ah fool that i am to the early days days when you said the best dinner party in london could not tempt you to leave me for an evening while she was speaking she had followed him her hand rested on his sleeve her eyes with piteous imploring earnestness sought to read his face there is no returning to old days said gaston arbuthnot people of our age should have sense enough to realise this the exclusive boy and girl idolatry of one year of life would be rank absurdity in a dignified darby and joan of our standing dinah shrank away from him perhaps it occurred to her that exclusive idolatry had never existed at all on gastons side how long in truth did he keep to the declaration made in his honeymoon of preferring quiet evenings with her to the best dinner parties in london when i came in just now dinah i interrupted you at some spiritual exercise not high enough to be called prayer yet that required a kneeling attitude it is a pity said mr arbuthnot looking disagreeable that the self communings of good people so seldom lead them to charity i dont mean almsgiving i mean a broader more charitable frame of mind if you could only recognise one fact that there is a great variety of human nature about you in the world it would be something gained i know it gaston what i want is to be lifted out of my own narrow ignorance take geoffrey for instance in geoffrey we have a man sound to the core no caprice no vanity in our cousin none of the discontent and levity and thirst for amusement which disfigure some characters that might be named for contrast gaston arbuthnots eyes rested discerningly on his wife look at rex basire an empty skulled little tailors block doubtless yet with a brave soldiers heart in him all the same by the bye my dear i need not exhort you he added lightly to be charitable to lord rex if women would only be as fair towards each other as they are towards us i really admired the philosophy with which you gave that young gentleman his lesson in cross stitch to day the careless tone of banter brought back dinahs accustomed self control nothing so effectually checks emotion as the absence of emotion in our fellow actors lord rex was bent upon working three or four stitches in my ottoman it cost me the trouble only of unpicking them and when he asked my leave i was ignorant i always am ignorant about the politeness of saying no that is what i must learn the art of saying no observed mr arbuthnot not in a very hearty voice the art of speaking and acting well as mrs thorne as every woman of your world would do theres no going back to old days gaston you are right there i must shape myself to things as they are not to try to shape them to my needs that is chiefly why i accepted the invitation for wednesday i mean to learn from the example of others i mean to turn over a new leaf from to day keep true to your own transparent self child be what you have been always and i for one shall be contented chapter xx james lees wife the speech was really the best chosen prettiest thing that a somewhat errant husband could have found to say in every moral encounter that befel gaston arbuthnot and whether his antagonist floundered in the mud or no gaston seemed invariably to find himself at the last in a graceful attitude but dinahs heart was no more warmed by honeyed little phrases than by the reconciliatory kiss her husband bestowed on her ere he started to his dinner party she was reaching nay had reached the miserable stage when honeyed phrases and reconciliatory kisses are in themselves matters of distrust how her lonely dinner over would she get through the evening hours long counted on hours when she was to have walked her hand within gastons arm to distant roscoff common for her briar roses for a space dinah looked listlessly forth at the garden it was full of people who knew each other who talked together in friendly voices the boarders of the hotel with whom gaston mixed with whom gaston was popular then she seated herself before her embroidery frame but recollections of lord rex basire of the effaced stitches of gastons commentaries on her patience made the thought of work repugnant to her if she could only read she thought not after her dull country pattern repeating each word to herself as a child cons his task ere he can take in its meaning if she could read for pleasure as she had watched geoffrey read quickly easily with hearty human interest like one bent on receiving counsel from some well beloved friend a book of geffs lay on the mantelshelf dinah rose crossed the room with languid steps and took it in her hand then as readers invariably do to whom the shell of a book matters more than the kernel she fell to a careful examination of the text binding title page the poetical works of robert browning vol vi dramatis person well four years ago during the brief fortnight of geoffreys madness it chanced one evening that he walked out to lesser cheriton with this very book in his pocket did some ineffaceable rose odour of that dead june cling to the pages still rendering vol vi dearer in geffs imagination than its fellows he read james lees wife aloud to dinah thurston a poem totally outside the girls comprehension and during the recital of which her decently suppressed yawns must have rebuffed any man less blindly in love than was geoffrey arbuthnot at james lees wife the book opened now ah love but a day and the world has changed dinah read through the first stanzas untouched pretty love warblings the cry of a happy womans heart what had they to say to her dinah arbuthnot in the last stanza of by the fireside her pulse gave a leap did a woman ever would i knew watch the man dinah went back to the window the volume in her hand she returned to the beginning of the poem pored over it line by line stanza by stanza in the fading light yet this turns now to a fault there there that i do love watch too long and wait too well and weary and wear and tis all an old story and my despair fit subject for some new song and when she had got thus far the clouds of her ignorance lightened she began to understand shortly before ten oclock entered geoffrey the parlour lamps were not lit dinahs figure was in dense shadow as she leaned absorbed in her own thoughts beside the open window geoffrey believing the room empty sang under his breath as he groped his way across to the mantelshelf no very distinguishable tune an ear for music was not among geffs gifts but with sufficient of a quick triplet measure in it to recall a spanish barcadero that marjorie bartrand was fond of singing to herself to dinahs sick heart the song was consciously wounding she had been so long used to geffs undivided homage that sense of power had little by little grown into tyranny gentle rose leaf tyranny whose weight geoffreys broad shoulders bore without effort and yet having in its nature one of tyrannys inalienable qualities lack of justice always in spirits geoffrey the reproach came to him through the gloom it is good to think whether the day is dark or shining our cousin geoffrey can always sing geoffrey was at her side in a moment it is cruel to speak of my horrible groanings as singing mrs arbuthnot crueller still to hint of them as betokening good spirits where is gaston you are back earlier than i expected from your walk to roscoff the walk fell through i shall have to border my work with a rose pattern bought in the shops gaston was obliged to dine at dr thornes he made the engagement of course without thinking of our walk i ought never to have counted on those roscoff wild roses i dinahs voice lapsed brokenly into silence if you would like the roses you can have them by breakfast to morrow said geoffrey few things i should enjoy better than a six mile trudge in the early morning no geoffrey no gaston always tells me that my bought patterns are atrocious and the walk was planned by him and he was to have sketched from the fresh briars by lamplight my heart in it all is over the roscoff roses may go as so much of weightier delight had been allowed to go negligently irrevocably out of dinah arbuthnots life dinah herself might not suggest the thought but to geoffreys mind it was a vivid a pathetic one and why should you not take my escort you know i am never burthened with engagements let us go to roscoff to morrow you owe miss bartrand a visit well we will take tintajeux on our road and make marjorie show us the way to roscoff common miss bartrand will not expect me to return her visit she came here because because you dear geff with or without words bade her come i should never have courage to face the grandfather gaston would be the right person to call on the seigneur of tintajeux the seigneur of tintajeux might think otherwise geoffrey laughed old andros bartrand made minute inquiries about mrs gaston arbuthnot the last time i saw him about me always the same story cried dinah uneasily why should people talk of us what is there in my life or in gastons that need arouse so much curiosity shall i answer as your friend lord rex would do answer truly geff not like lord rex basire but like yourself why should the good people of guernsey talk about you do you ask because mrs arbuthnot even in this country of fair faces yours may have gained the reputation of being the fairest the speech would have fitted lord rex better geff was sensible in the darkness that his cheek reddened the fairest echoed poor dinah petulantly oh i sicken of the very word fair shades of hair or of eyes a white skin a straight profile how can people think twice of these trivial things the woman best worth speaking about in guernsey or elsewhere should be she not with the fairest but the happiest face her own certainly was not happy to night growing accustomed to the parlours darkness fitfully broken by a reflected light from one of the garden lamps outside geff could note her exceeding pallor he could note also that dinah arbuthnots eyes revealed no trace of tear shedding that a look rather of newly stirred interest of awakening excitement was in their depths and you have spent your evening not only without gaston but without cross stitch it is a fresh experience he told her gravely for you to be idle i read until the light went dont you see i have got hold of a book of yours a book of verses that i did not understand when you tried to read it aloud to me at lesser cheriton ah how the old name spoken by her tongue stabbed him always geoffrey arbuthnot bent his face above the volume in dinahs hand robert browning but for my bad reading you ought to have liked these poems four years ago i think not geff uneducated people can like only where they feel and in those young days oh unconsciously cruel dinah i felt so little but i have an object now in learning i want to learn on all subjects out of books as well as from life that reminds me of something i had to say to you geff lord rex basire was calling on me this afternoon lord rex basire was calling on you the greater part of yesterday and i took upon myself to accept an invitation for you there will be a picnic party on wednesday it is some yachting expedition to the french coast got up by the officers of the regiment to which you will be asked but to which i shall certainly not go i can get as far out to sea as i like with the fisher people wednesday is one of my busiest days miss bartrand will be invited too if you are thinking of her miss bartrand can do as she chooses i have more important work than my two hours reading at tintajeux if i ask you geff will you refuse i refuse unconditionally i hate gay parties what mortal interest could i have in the society of men like lord rex basire and his brother officers only that i am going that gaston i mean i looked upon it as a matter of course you would accept and the words died on dinahs lips she had an unreasoning sensation that her firmest safety ground was at this moment cut abruptly from her feet as she stood faltering uncertain geoffrey took the volume of browning from her it opened at page little girl with the poor coarse hand there was just sufficient light for him to make out the letters of the first line is this the poem you have been reading mrs arbuthnot why i distinctly remember your pronouncing james lees wife to be meaningless i have my lesson shall understand said dinah james lees wife is the story of a woman whose heart is broken and she turned from him geoffrey could only see her face in extreme profile the cheek with its drawn oval the exquisite sad lips showed in strong relief like a cheek like lips of marble against the night sky he first broke silence do you care seriously do you care a fraction one way or the other about my accepting this invitation of basires for wednesday he asked her is it possible my going could be of help to you a big lump in poor dinahs throat kept her during some moments from speaking then with trembling eagerness her answer broke forth she cared more seriously than she could say about geoffreys not forsaking her gaston of course would be of the party but then gaston was so popular so sure to be unapproachable she would never never want geoffrey to martyrise himself again it was the first great favour she had asked him when she was once launched in the world said dinah rallying with effort she would know what to say and do and look unhelped by a prompter and all geffs hatred for gay parties and for men like lord rex basire and his brother officers went to the winds that dinah was beginning to anatomise her pain unhelped by suggestion from without that dinah had grasped the subtle meaning of james lees wife were facts that could not be lightly put aside her cry to himself geoffrey thought was that of a child who seeks succour from instinct rather than from knowledge of his danger the martyrdom would not last long urged dinah misjudging his intention to any one so fond of the sea as you geff twelve or fifteen hours on board a steamer are not much we are to leave early in the morning and be back in guernsey the following night if you know what a kindness you would be doing me i mean to go said geff arbuthnot shortly twelve hours he felt just then that he would pass twelve weeks or months on a steamer if by so doing he could lighten one ounce of dinahs burthens to her and gastons conscience will be at rest she exclaimed the truth is you see gaston was not well pleased at my accepting at all he bade me ask you geoffrey to look after me to a more sophisticated mind than geffs it might have occurred that the most fitting man to look after gaston arbuthnots wife would be gaston arbuthnot himself chapter xxi is my virgil passable i have written that in a softened and remorseful moment marjorie bartrands heart owned geoffrey for its master in a character like marjories softened and remorseful moods are apt however to be intermittent on the evening of saturday her pride had melted ay to such a point that holding her tutors love letter between her hands she went into a storm of penitent tears she marjorie bartrand whose boast had been that there was one woman in her british majestys domain who would shed tears for no man while she lived looking back upon these things from the cool and bracing heights of a tintajeux sunday the girls stout spirit recoiled with derision from the image of her own weakness the seigneurs after dinner sarcasm she felt with tingling cheek was true of aim she had played a part unknowingly in the arbuthnot drama thanks to cassandra tighe had no doubt treated geoffrey with kindness not his due for the imaginary wifes sake now would everything be on a frigidly proper footing her tutor had shown very good sense in returning property that had wrongly fallen into his keeping whatever small halo of romance hung around his life was dispelled the construction of latin prose the working out of mathematical problems would henceforth go on with dignified and scholarlike serenity but as a first step geoffrey arbuthnot should hear the truth old andros happened to give a longer sermon than usual on this sunday morning of june a sermon wearing a french garb now but which was first preached fifty years ago before the university of oxford and whose polished sentences breathed the safe and sleepy theology of its day the whole of the congregation slept save one the gentlemanly optimism of eighteen hundred and thirty appealing moderately to hearers who in the evening would revive beneath the burning eloquence of some neighbouring bethesda or zion marjorie only was awake keen restless preternaturally stirred to mundane thoughts and desires as she had ever found herself from her rebellious babyhood upward under the inspiration of a high oak pew and monumental slabs she thought over all her hours with geoffrey from the first evening when she saw him in the tintajeux drawing room until their half quarrel on saturday she thought of her visit to dinah of the disillusionment wrought in her by the vision of french songbooks and yellow backed novels she thought of the moment when she rescued her letter from the seigneurs hands happily the comedy of errors approached its finish geoffrey arbuthnot should hear the truth should have his masculine vanity soothed by no further misinterpretation of her conduct into a debateable land where a mature woman her heart already touched had shrunk from venturing marjorie with the madcap courage of seventeen resolved to rush as a first step geoffrey arbuthnot should hear the truth and this resolution formed in the dim religious light of the tintajeux family pew did not melt away like too many excellent sunday purposes under the secular warmth of work a day open air when geoffrey walked into marjories schoolroom on tuesday morning he found grim fate in a pink chintz frock with blossoming maidenly face ready to place him in the outer cold for ever good day to you mr arbuthnot the girl held herself stiffly upright with smileless lips with hands safely embedded in the pockets of her pinafore i was much obliged to you for returning my ribbon on saturday but i need not have put you to the trouble to the expense of postage i could have waited until to day geoffrey a backward interpreter always of feminine petulancy sought for no latent meaning in her words marjorie bartrand had never looked sweeter to him than now in her fresh summer frock with a livelier damask than usual on her cheeks and with her hands cruelly holding back from their wonted friendly greeting he had it not in his heart on this june morning to find a fault in her inheritress of all the sins of all the bartrands though she might be my poverty is heinous miss bartrand but i could just afford the penny stamp required for the postage of your waist belt after the lecture you read me on saturday morning went on geff good humouredly i really dared not face you with that morsel of ribbon still in my possession marjories lips lost their firmness taking her place at the schoolroom table she cleared her throat twice then she pushed across a pile of copy books in geoffreys direction she signed to him to be seated presented him with a bundle of pens drew forward the inkstand finally intrenched as it were behind the implements which defined their social relationship she delivered herself of the following singular confession when my lecture as you please to call it was given i did not know that you existed mr geoffrey arbuthnot miss bartrand the lecture was meant in good faith for another person if an apology is needed there you have it i i had listened to idle gossip said marjorie taking desperate courage at the sound of her own voice and so i must say it out little though i like such subjects i thought you were a married man sir i thought so from the first evening you came here i thought so until the hour when i saw mr gaston arbuthnot at the rose show and your motives when you called on dinah exclaimed geoffrey thrown off his guard when i called on mrs arbuthnot i believed her to be my tutors wife i had heard a great deal about her goodness and her beauty and i had almost grown to hate you added marjorie with one of her terrible bursts of outspokenness for leaving such a woman as dinah at home neglected while you amused yourself then she lifted her eyes she was startled to see how geoffrey arbuthnots face had paled paled under the incivility so marjorie supposed of her speech as a fact of course i never hated you at all her voice shook a little that gentle beautiful mrs arbuthnot is not your wife not my wife echoed poor geoffrey absently his tone was chill dipping a pen in the ink he began to trace meaningless curves and lines on the cover of the exercise book nearest his hand during a few seconds he was obviously unmindful of his pupils presence her lips with their sad expression haunt me remarked marjorie presently mrs gaston arbuthnot i should think must be the most beautiful woman in the world as she is certainly the truest and best geff had got back his self possession he spoke his credo as valiantly as though marjorie bartrands eyes were not fixed upon him and so he found voice to say you could actually believe on hearsay evidence that a girl like dinah would have chosen me for her husband and i have neglected her geoffrey laughed not very joyously then taking up another copy book he glanced with mechanical show of attention over a sentence or two of marjories latin translation he held the page upside down a fact which her memory in after times might recall as significant i honestly believed you to be married have you forgotten the first evening you walked out to tintajeux that evening when i told you the bon espoir was a good omen for our friendship a fortnight ago to day i have not forgotten it i looked upon you as my friend before i saw you i had heard your history the history it would seem of your cousin gaston i honoured a man who had had the courage of his opinions i respected i drew to you on account of the wife you had chosen and now mr arbuthnot exclaimed marjorie hotly the comedy of errors is finished i have learned my mistake you see and i trust that my apology has been sufficient this time geoffrey broke into a fit of wholesome unconstrained laughter i am afraid i see through everything miss bartrand your apologies say too much i have been treated with humanity by accident and may count upon dark days for the future that i am not married is my misfortune he added watching her face a misfortune which if i could only thereby re establish myself in your favour i would gladly remedy would you do you mean and then looking up into her tutors eyes marjorie knew that they were both of them talking unwisdom were trenching as nearly on the forbidden ground of sentiment as a young man and woman who had met for the hard study of classics and mathematics could well do i believe i got through some fair work yesterday she remarked with an air of cold business as to morrow is to be wasted on folly we may as well lose no time now it is your system never to praise sir a good one doubtless yet i hope you will think my virgil passable i promise you it was done without the crib geff read the halting translation aloud no longer holding the manuscript upside down he did not think marjories virgil passable and put the copy book aside without a word of comment he showed himself severer than usual over greek aorists was stringent to cruelty in regard of marjories shakiest point her mathematics but at last when the professional work was over when he had risen to take leave geoffrey arbuthnot extended his hand to his pupil as the girls heart knew he had never done before you have tolerated me hitherto he observed for my imaginary wifes sake do you think you can tolerate me in future for my own with his eyes fixed on her face her small fingers crushed in his grasp marjories cheeks turned the colour of a pomegranate you know you ought to have been the other arbuthnot cousin she stammered glancing up under her long lashes then drawing her hand away warily i ought you think to have been gaston he would never have pleaded as i plead for toleration every woman living would tolerate gaston of her own free will save marjorie bartrand pray make one exception to your rule i come of an arbitrary and stiff necked race we we tintajeux people belong to minorities we like in most cases dislike where we can give me credit for a short time longer of being the other arbuthnot cousin geoffrey whispered as he left her dislike me only as much as you did on that first evening when you gathered roses and heliotropes for my wife chapter xxii linda as an art critic wednesday mornings sun rose cloudless a few persistent fog wreaths lay even as the day advanced to leeward of the islands there was an undue ground swell although the surface of the water glistened smooth as oil when the high spring tide began to flow in from the atlantic none but an inveterate croaker could however prophesy actual mischief from signs so trivial lord rex basire declared aloud certain of his guests arriving not as the time for departure drew nigh that the day must have been manufactured expressly for the subalterns picnic no wind no sea a nicely tempered sun above ones head a favourable tide what more asked lord rex especially if one add the item of a powerful steamer could the never satisfied heart of woman require the heart of the most venerable woman in the island required that there should be neither ground swell nor fog bank at the eleventh hour came an excuse on the score of weather from madame corbie the post of chaperon in chief stood vacant happily for the youthful hosts rosie verschoyles mother was faithful a little white passive lady accustomed to the iron rule of grown up daughters who only stipulated that she should lie down within reach of smelling salts before leaving guernsey harbour and neither be spoken to nor looked at until they arrived in smooth water off the coast of france old cassandra in her scarlet cloak was to the fore with cans for fish with crooks for sea weed with a butterfly net with stoppered bottles cassandra burthened by a sole regret that she had left her harp behind if these young people had wished in mid ocean to dance how willingly would cassandra have harped to them doctor thorne and his linda were punctual so were the trio of pretty de carteret sisters whom poor mrs verschoyle according to a trite figure of speech was to look after and still rex basire glanced vainly along the harbour road for the only guests concerning whose advent he cared the steam was up the skipper stood ready on the bridge in another ten minutes the princess of necessity must quit her moorings and still the sunshine of dinah arbuthnots face was wanting you look frightfully careworn lord rex said rosie verschoyle with malicious intonation as she followed the direction of his glances pray has your lobster salad not arrived is your ice melting or does some anxiety even yet more tragic disturb your peace there they are no by jove only the men twelve feet two of the arbuthnot cousins exclaimed lord rex with frank disrespect of rosies sympathy is it possible mrs arbuthnot can have thrown us over the thought is too atrocious the tall figures of gaston and geoffrey twelve feet two of the arbuthnot cousins were descending by quick strides the stepway that forms a short cut from the high town of petersport to the quay before rex basires disappointment had had time to formulate itself more coherently a clatter of ponies hoofs a rush of wheels made themselves heard round the corner of the adjacent harbour road a few instants later and the welcomest sight the world could just then have offered to lord rex was before him marjorie bartrand in her pony carriage and at marjories side fairer than all summer mornings that ever dawned the blushing lovely face of dinah arbuthnot have we to apologise are we really behind our time cried gaston as lord rex came forward to welcome them at the gangway it has been a case of the fox and the goose and the bunch of grapes my wife would not start without miss bartrand geff would not start without my wife i was not allowed to start alone the most delightful weather and the most delightful party added gaston looking at the sunlit world around him with his pleasantest expression miss verschoyle the miss de carterets marjorie bartrand why all the pretty faces in guernsey are assembled on board the princess the four or five hours that followed were hours destined to be marked with a red letter in the calendar of dinahs life she felt the youth at her heart enjoyed the salt freshness of the morning entered into the mirth and spirit of the expedition like a child gastons conduct was unexceptionable before they had quitted the harbour he took his place beside his wife jotting down each new effect of sky or wave or passing fishing boat in his note book he remained beside her throughout the voyage the pretty island girls capital sailors all of them chatted in picturesque twos and threes with their bachelor hosts lord rex basire devoted himself with a show of perfect impartiality to every one if this was growing used to the perils of a factitious world the first plunge into a social vortex where more neophytes sink than swim dinah found the process distinctly pleasant and i am afraid the thought of linda effaced for once in grim earnestness by all effacing sea sickness down below failed to take the edge off mrs gaston arbuthnots enjoyment herm with its fringe of shell spangled sands was soon left behind the high table land of sark became a fairy like vision hanging suspended as on mahomets thread between heaven and sea ere it vanished out of ken after an hours steady steaming alderneys tall cliffs were sighted through the haze and then shortly before one the south west swell gave signs of lessening the princess was to leeward of the point of barfleur and lunch served after a desultory and scrambling fashion began to find hearty welcome among the watchers on deck at the cheery whizzing of champagne corks old doctor thorne aroused himself from a comfortable siesta he had been enjoying in the bows and came aft the sight of lindas husband a tumbler of moet in his hand his puggareed hat pushed back from his sun shrivelled indian visage brought back the thought of linda thorne to the general mind mrs thorne shall mrs thorne not have champagne sent to her cried gaston who was reclining a picture of virtuous contentment beside his wife or better still now that we have a smooth deck doctor shall mrs thorne not come up into the light of day the old doctor shook his head as he accepted a goodly plate of lobster salad from the stewards boy poor girl my poor dear lin a typically severe case of mal de mer always stop a bit no hurry just give me a trifle more of the dressing i have collected a mass of data about sea sick persons observed the doctor draining down his champagne with relish and i am wholly against any attempt at nourishing them quite a mistake to administer stimulants thank you lord rex you may give me another quarter of a tumbler of your excellent moet a mistake to imagine persons as sea sick as my poor wife can digest anything i think you are disgracefully heartless doctor cried rosie verschoyle in her thin gay accents mrs thorne and dear mamma must require wine much more than all we well people i declare it is positively shameful to think how we have been enjoying the voyage while they were in misery now who will help me carry something to our poor martyrs below who of course meant lord rex basire following the airy flutter of rosie verschoyles dress lord rex dutifully assisted in conveying biscuits champagne and sympathetic messages to the martyrs as far as the cabin door though the deck was smooth linda showed coyness as to returning thither her belief in human nature especially in gaston arbuthnots human nature was i fear frailish the livid cheeks pale lips and sunken eyes of recent sea sickness were tests to which linda under no conditions would have dreamt of exposing a sentimental friendship mrs thorne is quite too good the dearest most unselfish creature living rosie verschoyle announced these little facts before all hearers on her return to upper air doctor thorne i hope you are listening to my praises of your wife mrs thorne is not ill not very ill herself but she will not leave my poor frightened mother for a moment i call that real quiet heroism in glorious weather like this to remain shut up in the cabin of a steamer for another persons sake our good smeet she knows so well to efface herself there was a twinkle in gaston arbuthnots shrewd eyes possibly as rosie verschoyle spoke the words of madame benjamins eulogy came back to him a league or two beyond barfleur a french pilot was signalled for the pilotage from the point to langrune being tortuous and difficult does the reader know the fairness of that little visited strip of norman coast fairness at its zenith perhaps in april when the orchards bordering the shore are heavy with white pear or rose pink apple bloom when the black thorn blossoms so lavishly that if the wind be south you may distinguish whiffs of the wild half bitter aroma far out at sea but exquisite too on a late june day like this the yellow colza in full harvest the barley fields ready for the sickle the caen stone spires and homesteads standing out in white relief against the level horizon line of sky a french pilot was signalled for after his coming the princess steamed slower and ever slower eastward by and by langrune already visible across the expanse of yellowish sea it became observable that the vessels movement could scarce be felt by those on board the skipper stood consulting with the pilot on the bridge the figures of the men at the wheel were motionless there was a simultaneous hush in everybodys talk a momentary tension of the breath at the thought of something happening and then came the blank unmistakable order stop her before leaving petersport wrong reckoning had been made as to the difference between the hour of ebb in guernsey and along the coast of france the skipper had no choice but to anchor would the passengers await the turn of the tide and deeper water or land by help of the boats on some rocks within easy reach and trust to getting ashore across a tract of wide wet sand as best they might the stout nerved guernsey girls accustomed to scores of bigger adventures at sand eeling parties and conger expeditions laughed at the horrors of the position with cassandra tighe as leader these young women announced their determination of reaching the shore forthwith though not dry footed among the chaperons arose murmurs of contumacy poor mrs verschoyle a ghastly figure emerging tremulously from the cabin observed that she looked on all voluntary sea going excursions as a tempting of providence with a spot like lancresse common not three miles from petersport lancresse common where one could have had the society of our excellent archdeacon and of madame corbie why said mrs verschoyle with the acerbity of mortal digestive revolt why put ones self at the mercy of tides and pilots at all old dr thorne was flatly rebellious there was good champagne on board the princess thought the doctor there were burmese cheroots a warm sun there was the ultimate certainty of floating up with the tide if any one be at a loss how to pass the afternoon hours let him take a siesta or inquire if the skipper have a pack of cards stowed away you see the wisdom of my remarks i am sure lin do you not i see the wisdom of them for you and me my dear said lin graciously under cover of a doubly folded gauze veil protected by rice powder a parasol a well adjusted indian shawl linda thorne had at length committed herself to the cruel eye of noon my own election is to abide by mrs verschoyle whatever happens i am afraid we shall hardly win over the young ones robbie to our staid philosophy if rosie and the miss de carterets land i shall land said mrs verschoyle with dreary resignation the poor little ladys elder daughters were married she had three girls in the schoolroom still she had also boys chaperonage at balls and picnics nursing of measles or scarlatina love affairs school bills breakages all came to mrs verschoyle as the burthens of her widowed many childrened lot heavy burthens to be borne under sorrowful protest if the picnic had only been at lancresse common she repeated we should have the archdeacon and madame corbie with us and need never have got wet shoes at all a consultation with the skipper resulted in a general lowering of the boats a quarter of an hour later the whole of the party save the doctor were landed on the smaller cancale a reef of rock separated by a mile of treacherous sands from terra firma and upon whose limited area a crowd of parisians of both sexes were fishing no were following la pche the terms are not convertible after the guise and in the vestments sacred to the parisian heart mrs verschoyle sank down on the first slippery point of rock that presented itself vainly wishing little though she loved the steamer that her maternal duties had allowed her to remain there with the doctor and the sailors cassandra tighe started off the lightest hearted of the party perhaps to hunt for zoophytes and molluscs among the tide pools the younger people all pronounced themselves in favour of an exploring walk inland before dinner all except mrs thorne i mean to look after your mother rosie said linda removing her double folds of gauze as she took her place at the elder ladys side please let me indulge my indian laziness some one positively ought to stay with dear mrs verschoyle and i like to be that some one it makes me remember my queer old governess days to find myself among parisians linda was prone to these little bursts of retrospective humility and then there is my husband robbie no doubt will eventually drift up with the tide quite too charming to leave all us sober elders together sober elders so dinah realised with a contracting heart was a sufficiently elastic term to embrace mr gaston arbuthnot before landing from the boats gaston with keen artistic vision had descried some marvellously pretty fisher girl among the crowd of french people on the rocks not a real red handed rough haired fisher girl but the latest worth idea of a duly got up pcheuse the very subject gaston declared for his own meretricious pencil he must make a stealthy study of her forthwith and indeed at this present moment not many paces distant from mrs verschoyle and her devoted friend gaston arbuthnot sketch book in hand was already at work dinah lingered aimlessly the desire of her heart was to stay beside her husband her pleasure would have been to watch his quick clever pencil to hear him discourse in his light strain about these foreigners whose theatrical manners and dress overwhelming to her in her ignorance must to him be familiar she felt that the brightness of her day would be clouded if she left gaston and yet mused dinah troubled of spirit do wives in society hang jealously at their husbands elbow or watch their pencil or listen to their talk with delight would she expose herself far worse would she expose gaston to ridicule by shirking the walking party an expressive glance shot from mr arbuthnots eyes set these questionings only too sharply at rest look carefully in through the cottage windows dinah he bestowed on her a little valedictory wave of two fingers capital bits of ware are still to be unearthed in these parts of the world if you see a likely cup or saucer get geoffrey to talk french for you gaston arbuthnot was a dabbler in most branches of bric brac and up to the present date had never lost money by his dealings mrs thorne when we have got rid of these young people i want you to criticise me my beautiful fishing girl grows too much like a figure from the mode books linda thorne promptly obedient took up her position at the artists side chapter xxiii a swagger and a sword it was the hottest most deserted hour of the day when the walking party reached langrune plage an hour when such of the young parisians as do not follow la pche drive donkey carts those wonderful springless seatless langrune carts along the country roads or start by rail to distant trouville for toilettes and distraction here and there were elderly ladies at work before the doors of their canvas bathing sheds in the road two portly fathers of families were solemnly sending up messengers to a very small japanese kite some fifty or sixty feet above their heads two other middle aged gentlemen played at battledore and shuttlecock a few irrepressible boulevard lovers sat over their cards or dominoes outside the restaurant windows of the principal hotel the shrill sounds from a fish auction held on the monster slab of rough granite which constitutes the langrune market place alone broke the stillness before one had thought it possible that dress or speech could have betrayed the nationality of the new comers up ran a brown legged tattered sand imp holding out a bunch of shore flowers he announced his name with some pride of birth as jean jacques la fert of these parts offering his services as cicerone to the english strangers the gentlemen without doubt make a pilgrimage to la delivrande half a league away up the country at la delivrande is the church and the altar where the miracles are wrought there are the little ships of the sailors the crutches left by the cripples who get back use of their legs and for the ladies there are the stalls with the relics every one in the country ran on the child with voluble distinctness jean jacques a source of revenue to his parents was trained to speak good french with the visitors every one in the country who is sick gets cured every one who has a grand espoir goes to la delivrande and if he has faith attains it or so the cur says added jean jacques with a roll of his black eyes and a knowing shrug of the shoulders at seven years of age even sand imps in these advanced french days like to show we are no longer bound by the priestly superstitions that were well enough for our grandmothers lord rex made a free paraphrase of the childs narrative in english and was witty thereupon every one who is sick gets cured every one who has a grand espoir goes to la delivrande and if he have faith obtains it miss verschoyle what do you say have you a grand espoir have you faith shall we make our pilgrimage confess our little peccadilloes and get cured together miss verschoyle rebuked his flippancy but with lips less severe than her words for rosies mood was a lenient one had not lord rex throughout the day conducted himself as well really as though that poor mrs arbuthnot were non existent it was decided that every one had unfulfilled hopes that every one stood in need of cure and that a general confession of peccadilloes would be the best possible employment of the afternoon in another five minutes the pilgrims were on their road ragged jean jacques leading the way towards the distant white twin spires of la delivrande the plage i have said was deserted not so the lane with quaint wooden houses on either side which forms the high street of langrune here were bare limbed dark faced fisher lads busily mending their nets clear starchers plying their delicate craft in the open air housewives roasting coffee pedlars chaffering over their outspread goods huge cats with sleepy watchful eyes the sun shining comfortably on their ebon barred coats reposed on the window sills lace makers were at work their headgear antiquated as their faces their bobbins twirling in and out the pins unerringly as though they were the very threads of fate itself everywhere was the din of voices everywhere were open doors open windows and within such plentitude of frugal cleanliness such polished oak cupboards such well scoured cooking pans such snow white bed draperies such balsams and geraniums in brilliant scarlet pots as might have put a dutch village to shame marjorie bartrand and dinah paused beside one of the lace makers chairs allowing the more ardent of the pilgrims to get on ahead a distinct shade of constraint was holding marjorie and geff arbuthnot aloof to day they had not met since yesterdays friendly parting no further misunderstanding in respect of geffs celibacy was possible between them but a change had come across marjories manner towards her tutor geoffrey was sensible that she answered him with pungent and monosyllabic curtness during the whole of their outward voyage and seeing that among the knot of pretty sarnian girls excellent temper reigned supreme also that geoffrey had joined the party for other motives than his own pleasure one can scarcely wonder that this philosopher of four and twenty suffered himself without over difficulty to be consoled at the present moment disappearing in the perspective of langrune village geoffrey walked to all outward seeming well content beside the prettiest and least wise of the three miss de carterets of which fact marjorie took a brief and scornful note in her heart one can imagine a mans becoming a senior wrangler she made the remark to dinah as they watched the everlasting bobbins whirl yes even i with my halting euclid and weak algebra of which no doubt mr geoffrey arbuthnot has spoken can imagine a mans becoming a senior wrangler i can no more conceive of bobbin turning than i could of a world in which two and two shall make five dinahs slower brain needed time for reflection there could not be a world where two and two make five she observed with certainty and lace making once you have served your time steadily is easy enough two of my cousins down honiton way are lace makers and i learned a little of it when i was a child the number of threads looks hard to strangers miss bartrand but it just gets to one twirl of the bobbins in time many of the workers keep to the same pattern for life when they know it well after a bit your fingers work without your eyes how horrible one twirl of the bobbins one pattern for life and to think that lace makers do not commit suicide by scores i dont know that theres much difference between lacework or wool work or plain sewing said dinah arbuthnot we have all of us to go through with our days task whatever the stitch may be the speech came so naturally was so fraught with unconscious womanly humility that marjorie felt abashed what real heroism of an incomprehensible kind must not gaston arbuthnots wife possess this girl of two and twenty who worked perpetual cross stitch who kept her tongue and spirit calm who loved with soul and might yonder dbonnaire gentleman of the handsome eyes and decorative smile sketching charming parisian fisher girls on the beach under linda thornes criticism if i speak hotly against needlework it is that i am thinking of spain my mothers country in spain you must know the miserable girls to this hour scarcely learn more than embroidery in their schools and convents with reading enough perhaps to stumble through the announcement of a bull fight or decipher a love letter of course admitted marjorie bartrand coldly it is said that when a woman marries in england or in spain she must do as her husband wills i never see the force of that must i think a woman should do what is right for herself with large trust in providence as to the rest the question is not one that concerns me still mrs arbuthnot one cannot help feeling indignant about all very crushed people i am dead against slavery especially when slavery puts on a domestic garb by this time they had passed the last straggling houses of langrune fair level country the fields already on the edge of harvest spread around their road along the wayside path was a very mosaic of brilliantly blended hues the corn flowers blue and purple the scarlet poppies the white and gold of the wild camomile making up the purest chord of colour a slight south west wind dry and elastic after its transit over so many a league of sunny land was invigorating as wine how the spirit rises the moment one treads real solid earth cried marjorie bartrand i feel at this moment like walking straight off to spain the country i love and where my life will be spent why with twenty francs apiece in our pockets and camping out by night under stacks or hedges you and i might easily reach the peninsula on foot mrs arbuthnot dinahs geography did not embolden her to hazard a contradiction something in marjorie bartrands tone jarred on her reasonlessly it were hard to believe that she considered geff a man likely to fall in love had not the conditions of her life for years put speculations as to geoffreys future happiness on one side and still a true daughter of eve in every weakness belonging to the passion dinah was an inchoate match maker she would fain have seen the whole world blest with such fireside beatitude as constituted her own ideal of highest good with firm and true perception she had noticed a dozen trivial things of late all proving geffs imagination if not his heart to be in his teaching of latin and greek at tintajeux manoir she had hoped that the notice taken of herself by marjorie was an earnest of the pupils liking for her master had furtively and with misgiving dug the foundations of many an air castle that marjorie and geff at some far off day might jointly inhabit the girls diatribes against domestic slavery her open avowal of love for spain and of her hopes of spending her life among spanish people caused a troubled look to come on dinahs face your plans dont point towards an english home miss bartrand yet i think geoffrey has told me you mean to study at girton to fit myself for my future work yes the spanish school boards are just as conservative as english ones a young woman armed with cambridge certificates would have more chance of coming to the front than another equally strong minded who should rely on her own merits strong minded dinah ejaculated with horror at your age with all the sweet happiness of life still to come you talk as though you approved such things of being strong minded marjorie swept off the heads from a cluster of wayside camomile flowers with the stick of her sunshade an expression of will which yet was neither unlovely nor unfeminine glowed upon her girlish face let us understand each other better mrs arbuthnot it may well be that our notions of sweet happiness are not the same dinah looked uneasy and kept silent power i will make a confession to you such as i never made before power is my ideal of happiness i want to rule we will hope for good in any case to rule to be needed on all sides sought after distinguished to see my name in print that is the truth no matter how i may wrap truth up in fine sounding words said marjorie bartrand that is the secret of my enthusiasm for humanity and of my personal ambition to lead others to command is my ideal of happiness and mine exclaimed gaston arbuthnots wife unhesitatingly is to obey for a woman to look up to another stronger life to be ruled by a stronger will gladly to take all little household worries on herself i speak badly miss bartrand but you guess my meaning and feel more than paid by one kind look or word in return to know that as much as she wants of the world is safe between four lowly walls to have her hours filled with the care of others to keep her parlour bright and cheerful to hear the voices of the children dinahs own voice broke and marjorie who had watched her with looks of lofty compassion softened involuntarily so far from speaking badly mrs arbuthnot you speak with very pretty eloquence you draw a picture of constant giving up which if one could believe it to be from life would i confess be attractive it is drawn from life perhaps oh no i said only that would be my ideal of happiness faltered dinah with a pang fancied or real such an existence would never do for me i have not much taste for obedience i have none at all for household worries babies i bar miss bartrand yes i do grandpapa and i visit about in our pagan way among the guernsey country people and i know that i absolutely bar babies of every shade and degree i am not sure i would go so far as to injure one said marjorie stealing a glance at her companions shocked face but i feel that they are safest kept out of my sight i tell the mothers so you are too young to know what you feel miss bartrand there was a standstill of some moments ere dinah recovered herself enough to speak long before you are my age youll begin to see things differently young girls are a bit hard ive sometimes thought in all classes of life until the time comes what time may i ask the time for having a sweetheart and getting married said dinah arbuthnot from any other lips marjorie would have regarded such a suggestion as an indignity dinah was so true a woman had a soul so whitely delicate that the speech carried with it no possible suspicion of offence it was homely common sense kindly and simply uttered what you say might be true of most girls of my age if i am hard it is not because of my youth or my inexperience i have had marjories face flamed to the hue of the poppies in the corn what the world is pleased to call a sweetheart but for the interposition of providence i remember that interposition night and morning on my knees i should be married now unless he loved you above everything you are best as you are miss bartrand in marriage it is all or nothing i mean i mean dinah hesitated no wife could be happy with half a heart bestowed on her half what do you say to a quarter a fraction exclaimed marjorie hotly what do you say to a creature stuffed as the dolls are with sawdust in lieu of a human heart at all a creature well set up as regards shoulders six feet in measurement with fine white teeth blue eyes yellow moustache a swagger and a sword his would scarcely be the larger soul mrs arbuthnot the stronger will which it should be a womans crown of honour to obey down went another head of clustering camomile felled by a well aimed stroke from marjories hand her eyes flashed fire and yet a wayward girl scarcely past sixteen and with no mother to give her counsel might for two or three weeks you know be hurried into thinking such a man a hero i was that girl mrs arbuthnot vanity blinded me or the love of power or something stronger than either at all events when major tredennis asked me one fine morning to be engaged to him i said yes and the seigneur of tintajeux asked dinah looking round at the dimpled indignant face of seventeen major tredennis comes of a race of gentlemen said grandpapa if major tredennis can make adequate settlements and my granddaughter elects to spend her life with a popinjay she may do so and with no better advice than that you were engaged i was engaged major tredennis used to write me foolish notes he gave me a ring i never wore he gave me chocolate creams and a setter puppy he sang french songs to me in an english accent looking back at it all now i think the chocolate creams were the best part of that bad time except of course the setter whom i loved when it was all broken off for the owner of the white teeth and the sword was a right wicked craven and should have married a girl in england who cared for him without once looking at me when it was all broken off and i had to send jock back i did weep scalding tears at parting from him the only tears i have ever shed or shall shed in connection with love matters wait was dinah arbuthnots answer if i see you as i hope to do two or three years hence it may be you will tell a different story marjorie glanced at the yachting party sauntering contentedly a hundred yards or so in front among the lights and shadows of the orchard bordered road there was lord rex outrageously devoted in manner to rosie verschoyle with whom he loitered apart and there a little divided also from the rest was geff arbuthnot well entertained one must surmise by the shallow talk fascinated by the pink and white charms of ada the most soulless and the prettiest of the de carteret family if such a revolution takes place a dozen years hence that i marry she observed after consideration the husband i choose shall be a head and shoulders taller than myself morally no singer of ballad sentiment no popinjay with yellow moustache and a sword and uniform next time if i take to myself a master he shall be a man with a temper a will a purpose in life all nobler than my own such a husband as geoffrey would be the thought obeyed the wish in dinahs heart and i must be first first in his affection i would have no rivals past or present if bayard himself walked the earth and wished to marry me marjorie bartrand i would ask him if i was first yes mrs arbuthnot i would ask chevalier bayard himself if he had looked at any other woman before he loved me and if he had and though my heart broke for it i would refuse him a red light broke on marjories cheeks her eyes dilated the likeness to old andros which came out in every moment of strong emotion was never more marked than now if we ask too much we may lose all said dinah not perhaps without a pang of dread as visions of geoffreys youth rose before her i never heard anything about this gentleman chevalier bayard the first gentleman the world has known but if he was put upon his word yes and though he stood with his bride before the altar i think chevalier bayard might have to confess to some foolish fancy in the past i spoke of love not of foolishness exclaimed marjorie bartrand then as though quickly repenting of her warmth we have talked more than enough she cried about a peradventure that will never become fact let us forget with all speed that so much nonsense has been spoken but the conversation was one which neither of these young women could by any means forget while she lived chapter xxiv rex basires humour a rough paved village square green shuttered houses sweltering in the afternoon sun a pair of openwork spires delicate as lace dazzlingly white as caen stone could make them silhouetted against the burning sky tattered children with mercenary hands full of wild flowers a knot of british pilgrims irreverently loquacious outside the churchs western door gruesome beggars making exhibition of wounds honest peasant people dishonest relic sellers such were the salient features of la delivrande at the moment when marjorie and dinah descended into its closer air out of the field smelling wind blown road that brought them hither from the coast we will ask mrs arbuthnots opinion and abide by it cried lord rex coming forward a few paces to meet them she will be far better versed in this kind of thing than the rest of us ought we to carry candles in our hands mrs arbuthnot when we seek our cure there is a candle stall conveniently opposite and miss verschoyle and i will head the procession as penitents in chief please help to keep lord rex in order mrs arbuthnot he is really doing and saying the absurdest things rosie verschoyle must have been surely at the zenith of good temper when she thus addressed that poor mrs arbuthnot now lord rex i command you to drop this talk about candles instantly of course the whole business is a ridiculous piece of popish superstition still observed rosie with a certain largeness one has ones ideas a church is a church positively i will not speak another word to you to day unless you behave yourself with decorum when we are inside the awfulness of the threat appeared for the moment to check lord rex basires playful spirits he made no purchase of candles save that he affected a sudden and very marked lameness of gait he behaved no worse than his companions on entering the church guided by ragged jean jacques the english people walked up to a fretted stone screen dividing the choir from the nave in a small side altar on the left was a doll clothed in woven gold unlovely of face with eyes dreadfully staring with a crown of paper lilies with a score of rushlights burning before her in a row la delivrande who that has travelled in primitive french districts can fail of knowing these little miracle chapels their atmosphere their votive offerings their sincerity their tinsel their pathos at least a hundred graven memorials on the wall beside the virgin told the story of simple human hearts that had suffered believed of anguished human hopes that had here found fulfilment dinah arbuthnots cheeks paled as marjorie in a whisper translated the meaning of the inscriptions here a mother recorded her gratitude for her child a wife for her husband a daughter for her parent here the names were graven in full here in initials occasionally there was one word only reconnaissance and a date dinahs cheeks paled her eyes filled if she were alone dinah felt puritan heretic though she were she would gladly kneel and make her confession lay bare her sorrow on the spot where so many stricken and weary human souls had cast away the sad garment of repression before her lord rex basires view of the place and situation continued irresistibly comic and the faces of his companions the rose pink face of miss verschoyle not excepted failed to condemn him for his levity a heap of pious gifts testimonials in kind from the cured lay incongruously as they had been offered before the altar of the virgin there were crutches big and small a childs reclining carriage models of ships innumerable a wooden leg the stoutest faith might long for an explanation of that wooden leg well reader with the fair church solemn and hushed five or six black clad women telling their beads before the different altars its only catholic inmates lord rex it must be concluded found the temptation towards practical jocularity too strong for him hobbling up to the altar this humorous little lord stood with bowed head with contrite manner in front of the lily crowned figure for some minutes space slowly ascending a step he next deposited his crutch a silver and ebony toy upon the heap of worn and dusty peasant offerings then walked away with tripping resonant step with head joyfully erect down the western aisle as who should say behold me a believer cured ragged jean jacques held his mouth between two sun blackened hands showily pantomiming his appreciation of the englishmans costly waggishness the subalterns of the maltshire royals tittered aloud alas in a marching regiment as elsewhere has not human nature its weaker side is not a dukes son with two inches of brain and wit in proportion a dukes son even when he jests the young ladies with one exception looked about as frigid as italian snow looks under the kisses of an april sun the exception was marjorie bartrand away out of the church flew marjorie brushing against rex basires elbow in her exit she waited in the porch outside eager beggars pressing forward with their wounds children with their half dead wild flowers relic mongers with their chaplets and rosaries blest ay to the last bead blest tout bonnement by his holiness away in rome by and by when the last of the loud talking merry spirited knot of idlers had issued forth from the church marjorie fastened upon the offender in chief with luminous eyes with drawn breath with hands tightly clenched in her hot indignation she scathed him thus you have played a delicate bit of comedy have you not lord rex it was the finest stroke of humour to scandalise a few poor peasant women saying prayers for their dead for me looking one by one round the group i felt ashamed more ashamed than ever i was in my life before of belonging to the same nation as you all i read once said marjorie in a wise book where we are ignorant let us show reverence the ignorance only has been shown to day dinah arbuthnot and geoffrey who had lingered behind the others in the church arrived on the scene just in time to hear the last accents of this denunciation then ere the culprits could utter a word in self defence away shot marjories arrowy figure along a shadowed by street away neither stopping nor hesitating along the old chausse that leads from la delivrande paris wards in an exactly opposite direction to the langrune road by jupiter i was never so frightened in my life rex basires limbs collapsed under him in well dramatised alarm have all girton girls got dynamite in their eyes does their speech invariably bristle with torpedoes is marjorie bartrand protestant or catholic or what ah what repeated rosie verschoyle ever ready with a little amiable platitude a hundred years ago the bartrands were papists remember it is a moot question among the people who know them best what the tintajeux religion is at the present day i know one thing cried geoffreys friend ada de carteret all through tintajeux parish the seigneur is looked upon as more learned than canny when the country folk come near old andros after dark declaiming greek and with a couple of black dogs at his heels they will run a mile round sooner than meet him the seigneurs term of endearment for marjorie is witch when they happen to be on speaking terms at all said another voice poor girl in spite of her temper one cannot help liking her extremely who was it said of marjorie that she had such an olive like flavour you always feel there must be a fund of goodness in the dear child somewhere this finishing note was given in miss verschoyles thin voice as to the lecture you came in for lord rex you deserved it richly it is quite too in saying this i mean it quite to laugh at other peoples beliefs even when they are most ridiculous and then they all sauntered off to the stalls where lord rex we may be sure found ample scope for his veiled yet poignant irony among the crosses medals rosaries and relics that had been blest tout bonnement away in rome by his holiness marjorie meanwhile pursued her way through shadow and sunshine unconscious in which direction the fiery haste of her steps was bearing her when her temper had burnt out in the space say of two minutes and a half she perceived that she was once more in open country alone among colza stacks and fields of ripening barley but on a less frequented road amidst a landscape with wider horizons than the road and landscape she and dinah had traversed in coming to langrune from the sea how good it was to breathe this wild well oxygenised air with what glad senses marjorie gazed about her across the plains rippling as the sun lowered in lucent amber waves and shaded deliciously at intervals by rows of pearly smoke coloured poplar a family of peasant farmers drove by in one of their old world norman harvest waggons coeval perhaps with andros bartrands sickle friendly nods gleaming smiles from sunburnt faces were bestowed on the little girl as the homely cartload jolted on she watched with wistful eyes until the waggon lessened was lost to sight in the long perspective of white road seating herself beside a ditch under shadow of a solitary pollard willow a sudden vision of vines and olives and spanish sierras arose with all the strength of inherited nostalgia in marjories breast if the harvesters would only have carried her a league or two onward with them she had nothing of value in her possession but a watch how many francs could one raise upon a watch marjorie bartrand wondered in some primitive unsuspecting norman town enough surely living among peasant people and eking means out by an occasional days work at onion weeding or colza stacking to carry one down to the frontier the cherished land of dreams a letter could be sent to relieve the seigneurs mind and and then glancing back along the chausse marjorie saw a mans figure advancing towards her with steady quickness a figure she knew over well darkly outlined against the chrome yellow of the sky so ada de carteret was forsaken her heart went pit a pat she would have given a fortune to fly yet stirred not one minute later and her nostalgia was cured longings for vine and olive and spanish sierra had vanished all before the unromantic english presence of geoffrey arbuthnot chapter xxv you and i you have found out a right pleasant spot geff settled himself coolly into repose among the long wayside grasses that clothed the opposite or field side of the ditch our friends when they have bought themselves each a cross and medal are going down to watch the parisians return from fishing you and i will have the best of it among the barley here you and i you and i does the expression displease you miss bartrand if you have any intention of remaining you had better take out your pipe at once mr arbuthnot why because an idle man his feet dangling over a ditch and not smoking would be a spectacle too wretched to contemplate the description may be worse than the fact i am idle my feet dangle over a ditch i am not smoking i was never less wretched in my life i spoke of such a person as an object of painful contemplation is the spectacle painful to you at this moment speak frankly i i only wished to let you know that you might smoke if you chose thanks i would rather do nothing to alter my present state of feeling and then they came to a full stop a rather marked one marjorie spoke first the charm of a spot like this she brought out each word with incision is its solitude solitude deux the french have such an expression have they not geff arbuthnot asked the question pronouncing his eu vilely solitude a doo i am hopelessly stupid said marjorie holding her head aloft a doo is it meant for a farewell or what i really do not see the drift of the idiom a quotation perhaps from one of the classic authors geoffrey was sensible that she had never been more dangerous than at this juncture mutinous pride struggling with merriment on her clear girlish face as she turned his terrible french accent into ridicule he was sensible also of a new an unexpected pleasure in being laughed at by her were you enjoying your solitude without the doo truly and thoroughly when i disturbed you thoroughly no i had not got the flavour of folly enough out of my mouth for that you relished i hope the exquisite wit we english people showed in the church mr arbuthnot you appreciated the fun of wounding simple beliefs by depositing our oxford street finery among the real piteous crutches before la delivrande and to think that young women exclaimed marjorie waxing warm are stigmatised in masses as frivolous how can they be anything but frivolous with such examples before them let us cast up both columns of the account would a man no as we are talking of lord rex basire let us say would a foolish youth display his foolishness among a bevy of pretty girls unless they were ready to give him smiles as an encouragement i am sure mrs arbuthnot would not be among the smilers her beautiful face looked so good and calm when the rest of us stood giggling there before the altar my cousin is serious a little over serious always geoffrey arbuthnot gazed attentively at the horizon as he made this remark it would do your cousin a vast deal of good to run away from that feather weight husband of hers look shocked if you choose i am in earnest i consider said marjorie displaying her worldly wisdom with gravity that mr gaston arbuthnots character is thoroughly spoilt he is a charming fellow doubtless still everybody need not remind him of his charm to his face and you believe in retributive morality you think the curative treatment for a charming fellow is that his wife should run away from him my experience of charming fellows would incline me towards heroic treatment as we walked up from langrune i asked mrs arbuthnot to start with me on foot for spain with twenty francs in our pocket i told her and doing a days work on the road whenever our resources ran low we might get down safe to the frontier in time but mrs arbuthnot did not seem to see it dinahs is not an adventurous spirit if you would accept a substitute miss bartrand perhaps i go on pray might be allowed to follow with a thick stick at a distance keep your stick for england i would not be afraid on the loneliest road between this and barcelona without the stick then shall we start marjorie shifted her posture a little she became suddenly interested in a plant of marshmallow at her side when next i enter spain mr arbuthnot it shall be with dignity when i meet my mothers people i hope to be armed with degrees certificates whatever the english universities will confer on me dont go until your name has been bracketed high on the list of wranglers as geoffrey made this venture on thin ice he watched his pupil narrowly one of the storm flashes that lit marjorie bartrands face into such frequent such perilous beauty was his reward you mean never go at all do you feel a pleasure mr arbuthnot in throwing cold water over my dearest hopes and ambitions an enormous pleasure miss bartrand i have felt it from that first evening when you were good enough to hire me as your teacher at tintajeux the girl looked away from him her colour changing that evening when i had to receive you in state to make formal speeches and curtsies all my great aunts and uncles looking on through their bartrand eyelids do you remember our bon espoir he was an omen of better temper perhaps than has prevailed between us since were you taken aback was i quite unlike what you expected she asked these momentous questions with the keen curiosity characteristic of the passion in its earlier days but all the time she shrank from encountering geff arbuthnots glance you really desire to know yes i will tell you on one condition what was your wish when you curtsied under the cedars to the new moon my wish turning farther and farther away from him why folly unrepeatable the sort of nonsense my nurses taught me to say when i was little your memory is inconveniently good accurate to the smallest detail how clearly one can see the meeting of those four water lanes and the flowers you gave me as i know now alas for mrs arbuthnot and the ribbon you tied them with the ribbon said geff coolly which you will some day send me back for a book marker yes the fairest summer evening of my life was the one when i first saw tintajeux manoir and you and he believed his own words sure sign that the heart within him was sound healthiest life at its core guessing at the confessions of that ingenuous maidenly face as marjorie half blushes half wilfulness persistently gave him her profile geoffrey arbuthnot had clean forgotten lesser cheriton ay and a drama played out there in which he took a not unimportant part i think this norman evening is to the full as fair said marjorie there are bigger sweeps of outline there is more quality in the air than falls to our lot in the channel islands then again there came a pause broken softly by the occasional hum of an insect on the wing by the swaying of stalks the whispers of the ripe and restless grain by the chirp of the hedge crickets by the solitary treble of a lark lost somewhere pouring its heart out in the sea blue vault above marjorie could not be silent long to begin at the beginning what did you think of me when you got my first note the two lines i sent in answer to yours nothing very good or you would not be so reluctant to tell it i thought said geff that you required my services as a coach that there was a little affectation about your greek es and that your name was marjorie d bartrand that terrible signature of mine the one bearable name i possess reduced to a d you know mr arbuthnot i hope what d stands for dorcas suggested geoffrey or perhaps deborah we have a number of fine old hebrew names beginning with d but i am not a fine old hebrew i am a spanish woman heart and soul and i bear my mothers name dolores grandpapa and i met an american in paris when i was younger who used to call me miss dollars the thought of that pronunciation always makes me shy of bringing my beautiful spanish name to the fore dollars is more beautiful than dolores saying this geoffrey took studious care to imitate her accent dollars is at least suggestive of human activity of the market place not the graveyard why should a child with all the good chances of life open have such a name as grief imposed upon her by worldly wise godfathers and godmothers i speak of dolores not grief and and you have no poetry in you mr geoffrey arbuthnot you dont know all that a word says to us southern people think of plain marjorie bartrand nothing but ar ar if i could only change bartrand for a name with no ar in it i the supposition was rushing forth with velocity then in a trice marjorie stopped she coloured to the roots of her hair and then she and geoffrey laughed so loud that the stilly air rang with their laughter if these two young people did not actually tread the primrose path they were within a stones throw of it ignorant though both might be of the route which lay so near them that ar is the worst of all your cruelties said geff presently to show my greatness of mind i will return evil for good i will tell you what you wish to know as i walked out for the first time to tintajeux i had you constantly before my minds eye miss bartrand i saw you with the vision of the spirit every inch an heiress every inch an heiress repeated marjorie abashed with rigid manners hair drawn back chinese fashion and overwhelming dignity whenever people are of more than common volume i fancy that is the euphemistic term is it not dignity and you found me a scarecrow she measured mentally and with self abasement the leanness of her unfledged figure what did you think when a lank country child in a cotton gown and without either dignity or manner appeared before you i felt it was my duty to accept facts as they came i summoned up courage and mastered my disappointment with tolerable ease said geoffrey arbuthnot his face supplied a postscript to the admission which caused marjories heart to beat faster we must not stop here all day she cried springing promptly to her feet although if one had something to eat it might be pleasant to do so yonder to the left is courseulles spire we saw it no you were hemmed in by sunshades i saw it from the steamer if we take this footpath through the cornfields we might visit courseulles and make a small turn round the country before going back to our company and our dinner at langrune but geoffrey did not move i will have my bond he uttered with tragic emphasis i will never stir from this spot until you tell me what your wish was when you curtsied to the moon i would rather not say you have the right to insist of course it was a bargain but please let me off why should i repeat such puerility here in the wise and sober light of day i will have my bond repeated geoffrey arbuthnot tenaciously i have made my confession in full now do you make yours what was your wish a flood of shame by this time suffused marjories cheeks but geoffrey was stubborn he exacted his pound of flesh to the uttermost i curtsied as the children do thrice and each time while you were talking solemnly to grandpapa i said quite in a whisper dont mind punctuation miss bartrand it will be the sooner over i like my coach may my coach like me cried marjorie nearly in tears but giving to the refrain the true sing song of the nursery remember sir when i was so inane i had only known you two hours and and i believed you to be the other mr arbuthnot geoffrey slipped down to his feet as marjorie was standing on the bank it thus happened that their faces were on a level and very near each other geoffrey observed more closely than he had done before the texture of her skin delicate in spite of sunburn as perfect health and guernsey air could render it he looked into the depths of her gray eyes even in their quietest expression touched with fire he admired the character so superior to all mere prettiness of her serious large mouth the wish has come true he whispered in a tone never to be forgotten by marjorie bartrand although i have the misfortune of being myself not gaston let me help you he held out his hands but marjorie with her agile young strength had cleared the ditch almost before his assistance was proffered they paused a moment or two irresolute they discussed a little as to latitude and longitude and then away the two started in the direction of courseulles across the cornfields a third figure dove winged golden quivered walked with them although they might not discern his presence chapter xxvi cut and thrust never was a man surer of tumbling into little unlooked for sociabilities than gaston arbuthnot had he been shipwrecked on a south sea island i believe gaston would have chanced upon an acquaintance there some vanished shade from london club or paris caf would have seized him by the button hole before the day was out he was button holed in langrune sur mer when the pilgrimage returned from la delivrande linda and her robbie were found seated with mrs verschoyle on a trio of hired chairs before the hotel taking their pleasure rather mournfully cassandra tighe her scarlet cloak conspicuous from afar was dredging happy cassandra among such rocks as the tide still left uncovered gaston arbuthnot was invisible a real case of forcible abduction cried linda thorne addressing herself to dinah you are not a foolishly nervous wife i am sure mrs arbuthnot you could philosophically listen to a story of how two pretty french girls carried away an english artist against his will dinah assented with one of her rare smiles the knowledge that gaston was finding amusement otherwise than in the half clever talk the too ready too flattering sympathy of linda herself cast retrospective brightness upon the afternoon that his absence had clouded from jealousy of a selfish or little kind dinahs heart had never bled earlier in their married life when gaston still affected dancing and as a matter of course went to balls without his wife it was her usual next mornings pleasure to scan his programmes enjoy his sketches of his partners his repetitions of their small talk all without a shade of hurt feeling once or twice she hinted that she would fain accompany him as a looker on nobody looks on long in this wicked world was gastons answer you do not dance you do not play whist you have a brain under your yellow locks and you are too young to talk scandal ball room atmosphere is unwholesome i would not hear of such a sacrifice and as it was not dinahs habit to pose as martyr she obeyed trusting in him always beautiful pure of soul herself she simply honoured the beauty believed in the purity of soul of other women gaston was popular spoilt an artist with an artists more than this with an american temperament a degree of youthful immaturity seemed ever to lurk amidst his astute knowledge of life and of men he had but a half share as he would tell her of the fibres derived from long lines of bored ancestors he sought diversion for diversions sake she had made no quarrel with the inexorable facts of her husbands existence or of her own if only she had been his equal intellectually if she could have supplied him with the mental companionship he needed or interested him in his childless fireside ah could she thus have risen to his level gastons heart had been in her keeping still hence came the morbid unrest of her present life hence the dread increasing daily hourly strive with it as she might of lindas influence i am afraid one gets used to most things mrs thorne i have seen gaston run away with so often that i am not much moved by the thought of these pretty french girls linda thorne rose she rested her hand confidentially within dinahs arm much to dinahs chagrin and proposed that they should walk together along the sands to look for mr arbuthnot yes i must positively tell you the whole story your husband had finished his sketch of the lovely fisher girl the young person was not at all lovely in fact but she was striking she had distinct genre artists care for genre you know much more than for beauty dinah resolved to question gaston as to the truth of this she resolved to cultivate distinct genre in herself for the remainder of her days striking that word sums up all the big cobalt blue eyes that say about as much in reality as a china tea saucer and are supposed by imaginative men to say everything blonde hair worn in a pigtail palpably not original to her heels complexion carefully toned to a shade one point short of freckles bare arms akimbo excellently shaped arms of course a native prawn basket and a fishing dress from worths i got to know the type so well said linda in my governess days during one summer especially when the benjamin sent me to houlgate with her children dinah who as we have seen had no genius for supplying the hooks and eyes of conversation remained chillingly silent your husband had finished his sketch of her an admirably idealised one i have it here and dinah for the first time perceived that mrs thorne held possession of gastons sketch book let us look at it together impulsively or are you no doubt you are blase about sketches well well it may be natural married to an artist if one has no real strong natural talent for art i have no real strong natural talent for anything interrupted poor dinah petulantly oh naughty you must not say such things i will not allow you to be modest mr arbuthnot tells me your needlework is linda looked about her as though an encomium were hard to find most elaborate in these days needlework ranks among the fine arts of course you are wild about this exquisite new stitch from vienna i have not seen it the only wool work i do is old fashioned cross stitch just fancy and mr arbuthnot i am convinced spends his time half his time in designing quite lovely patterns for you dinahs breast swelled as a vision of the roscoff wild roses overcame her she made no attempt at a parry if i had married an artist i would never have gone to the shops for patterns or rather if i had married an artist i would never have embroidered at all i should have thrown myself into his ambitions his work have spent my life so utterly at his side dinah stooped to pick up a little pink shell from the strand by this action freeing herself from linda thorne she put the shell inside her glove thinking she would keep it as a memento of langrune and of this summer day that had passed so nearly without a cloud so nearly but the summer day was not over yet all this time i am not accounting to you for your husbands disappearance am i my dear creature it was really the drollest thing robbie had not as yet floated up with the tide and mrs verschoyle and i your husband with us had made our slippery way across the rocks to mainland well just as gast i mean as mr arbuthnot was putting a last touch to his sketch up ran a little frenchman full dress a rose and white daughter in each hand and an enormously stout wife with a bouquet following he threw his arms round your husbands neck and but for mr arbuthnots presence of mind would certainly have kissed him kissed of course have you never lived among french people it was some old artist companion of gast of your husbands bachelor life you can imagine the recollections of former joyous days spent in paris as students together the inquiries for mutual friends now dead or married the history each had to give of his marriage and present happiness i cannot i am not imaginative it must be confessed that a tinge of displeasure was audible in dinahs voice every syllable of mrs thornes unpremeditated chatter had wounded her like a stiletto prick ah and i am imaginative to my finger tips we seem the very antithesis of each other in character as we are in looks linda had really a very graceful way of admitting her own plainness when occasion offered i can assure you i filled up a dozen little blanks in our benedicts exchange of confidences i traced out a full and rounded whole most satisfactorily people may slur over half a dozen years in as many words if nature has endowed you with imagination you read between the lines the barest outline suggests the finished picture something in her tone would seem to imply that gaston arbuthnots married life had been a spoiled life or so it seemed to dinahs irritated heart dinah felt that the half dozen words must have yielded latent hints of her own intellectual shortcomings hints which linda thornes talent for filling up blanks had developed into certainty the next part of the ceremony was the introduction to madame de camors and the children two small parisian coquettes about the age of my rahnee who fell in love with mr arbuthnot on the spot little children fall in love with gaston always said dinah hastily the family party was taking its departure it seemed under the broiling sun to a childrens ball at luc casino at a word from papa the small imps seized a hand each of gas of mr arbuthnot and dragged him away nolens volens all children are tyrants generalised linda with a dismal yawn occasioned probably by the recollection of her virtuously spent afternoon but these terrible french children are the worst of all perhaps it is in imitation of the americans i consider the way american infants are brought forward in public places is a disgrace to the century you think children without exception should be kept in their nurseries dinah called to mind a group of four that passed her window on their road to the rose show she remembered a small figure dancing with exultation on rainbow hued flounces my dear soul fancy putting such a question to me a mother of course i make an exception of my own daughter she is a good quiet little monkey added linda although mr arbuthnot is positively spoiling her fast i hope i impose her on no one children as a rule i look upon from the governess point of view you know how my bread was earned when i was young mr arbuthnot has told me that he first met you in paris yes in the domestic service of madame mose benjamin i got twenty pounds a year and my washing i had to sleep under the roof to play dance music to remodel madames dresses to teach english to the three girl benjamins and a boy ah that boy said linda between her teeth if you think me like becky sharpe confess now you do think me like becky sharpe i do not indeed dinahs manner grew colder and colder i never heard of becky sharpe before well if you had said linda in high good humour and storing up all the little scene against future dramatisation if you had heard of becky sharpe and had thought me like her where would be the wonder i was brought up just as becky was to live by my wits my mamma i connect her hazily with sofa cushions much white embroidery an italian greyhound doctors and the smell of ether my mamma died when i was four years old she lies in brussels cemetery ran on linda drawing a hasty outline of a tombstone on the sand with lady constantia smythe and more than one side allusion to the peerage graven above her head at the time she died we had not very definite daily bread still my grandfather was an earl and poor papa found one of his few consolations in making much of our nobility frankness it would seem was linda thornes strong point but dinah was unmoved by it the earldom dazzled gaston arbuthnots lowly born wife no more than lindas personal confidences propitiated her dinah had a childs instinct for friends and for enemies she liked she disliked unerringly and was too transparently honest to mask her feelings stooping down she picked up another shell from the seas smooth edge she sought once more to widen the space between herself and her companion linda thornes quick brain observed the movement divined the intention excellent stupid well meaning ill acting young woman and i have not a reprehensible sentiment at all towards her thoughts like this shot through lindas mind linda who really had it not in her to know sterner passion than a drawing room malignity with her youth her goodness her complexion her upper lip to be jealous of poor plain cynical elderly me she needs a pretty sharp lesson children who cry for the moon deserve to get something worth crying for then sweetly you seem interested in shells dear mrs arbuthnot she observed aloud you study conchology as a science perhaps under the platonic auspices of that severe looking cousin of yours geoffrey arbuthnot of johns i study nothing unfortunately for myself i am quite ignorant said dinah lifting her face and meeting her tormentors eyes full i am picking up a shell or two she added to keep as a remembrance of my day in langrune i should say you would remember langrune without any tangible memento remarked linda rather ungrateful you know if you did not how ungrateful well because the picnic was given unconditionally in honour of you i do not understand you interrupted dinah with ill judged warmth the party was planned before any one in guernsey knew of my existence i was asked accidentally because i could be of use four or five girls had promised these young officers to come and they wanted a married woman as a chaperon this was what lord rex basire said when he invited me on monday and you believed him you accepted out of pure kindness to faire tapisserie mrs arbuthnot you are too amiable by this time dinah arbuthnots face blazed from brow to chin her conscience over sensitive in the lightest matter smote her sore was not a selfish longing for widened experience nay was not a certain distrust of gaston a contemptible sense of triumph over linda at the bottom of her acquiescence what unusually correct taste dame nature displays in her colouring this evening mrs thorne gazed with decent vacuity at the sky and away from dinahs face soft primrose fading into pearly green with just those few vivid touches of deep crimson it suggests thoughts for a ball dress and still beautiful though the effect is i would rather not see that sort of shimmer on the water if we come in for fog banks somewhere about the race of alderney it will matter little whether the picnic originated for the chaperons or the chaperons for the picnic how atrociously hungry this sort of thing makes one surely dinner time must be drawing nigh chapter xxvii growing old gracefully in two words you have amused yourself my dear under cover of the friendly twilight gaston arbuthnot pressed his wifes hand as it rested a little shyly on his arm a good sign for the future you must enter into the world more dinah you must cultivate this faculty for being amused i desire nothing better though fog banks and disaster might lie in ambush about the race of alderney nothing could be tranquiller than the fair summer evening here on the coast of france after an excellent dinner vraie cuisine normande served in the quaint red tiled salle of the htel chateaubriand the collected yachting party were now progressing along the pleasant sweep of road that leads to luc luc alone among this group of villages has a jetty and off luc the princess lay moored daylights last flicker was dying from the sky already deep fissures of shade intersected the white sand dunes bordering the shore the sea lay motionless a vague iridescence far away northward the only foreboding of coming change cassandra tighe a bold spot of colour in the gloaming had exchanged her dredging net for some amphibious structure of green gauze and whalebone she flitted hither and thither among the bushes that skirted the path moth hunting the younger members of the expedition in groups of two loitered slowly along their way for it was an hour when girlish faces look their fairest when mens voices are apt to soften involuntarily dinah arbuthnot after a good deal of strategy had contrived not merely to get possession of her husband but to hold him strongly guarded and at safe distance from the rest linda thorne herself and linda had at will a longer or a shorter sight than other people could scarce do more than guess at the outlines of the two figures the little lover like fact that this sober couple this darby and joan of four years standing walked arm in arm could be known only to themselves yes gaston i was amused at sea for you were there and i was amused differently by miss bartrand i wish you had been with us at la delivrande it was the first time i ever went inside a popish church said dinah gravely and yet popish though it was i could scarce help saying my prayers as we stood before the altar the tears came in my eyes as i remembered i mean as i looked at the heap of offerings and thought of the sad hearts that had brought their troubles there was the smell very detestable a smell one could sketch had you beggars had the beggars wounds of course votive churches and such things have to be done in ones youth i am too old said mr arbuthnot my digestion is too touchy for me to run the risk of physical horrors of my own free will i thought an artist should seek out every kind of experience gaston had so often insisted upon the duty of pursuing inspiration among all sorts and conditions of men still more of women that the remark from dinahs lips had a savour of mischief every sort of agreeable experience my dear child the disgusting is for the great masters mine is pocket art a branch that the critics discreetly label as decadent although lucrative besides said gaston i have sold my soul to the dealers and the dealers have sold theirs if they have any to a puerility loving public an honest manufacturer of paper weights and clock stands needs nothing but prettiness i wont say beauty the prettiness of a parisian masquerading as a fisher girl or of parisian children dancing at an afternoon ball mrs thorne told me about your meeting with some old student acquaintance and how his daughters led you away captive small tyrants i had to dance four dances with each of them and then be told i was un monsieur trs paresseux for my reward and so mrs thorne and you are becoming better friends observed gaston arbuthnot looking hard through the veil of twilight at his wifes reluctant face she is a dear good soul is she not so bright so spontaneous really i think that is mrs thornes crowning charm her spontaneity i am no friend of hers dinahs voice had become cold i did not like mrs thorne at first i dislike her now impossible dinah impossible a woman with your face should dislike no created thing i dislike her because her words sting even when they sound softest because she will never look at one straight i dislike her said dinah feeling her cheeks burn with shame and indignation because she calls you gaston when she speaks of you at this terrible climax mr arbuthnot laughed so heartily that the quiet undulating sandhills echoed again far ahead mrs linda might perhaps have caught the ring of his voice have marvelled what subject people who had been married four mortal years could find to laugh about this is a black accusation happily whatever her sins in my absence mrs thorne does not call me gaston to my face dinah was silent gastons assurances had never carried the same weight with her since saturdays rose show the occasion when she learned of midnight adjournments to dr thornes house and of the singing of french songs after a certain mess dinner her own conscience was rigid to suppress a truth was according to dinahs code precisely the same as to utter an untruth she allowed no margin for her husbands offhand histories as a woman of larger mind would possibly have done she could not see that carelessness a quick imagination and an intense love of peace were factors sufficiently strong to account for any little inconsistencies that might now and again creep into gaston arbuthnots domestic confidences of that i cannot judge i suppose i ought not to care what mrs thorne does or says in my absence of course you ought not the speech is worthy of your thorough common sense dinah but mrs thorne calls you gaston to me and i think it a very wretched unkind thing to do i think it mean you ought not to think of it at all artist people are called by the first name that comes to hand mrs thorne is not an artist she remembers me in the old days when i knew camors as a budding one and she corrects herself with over care having once said gaston it would be better not to go back to mr arbuthnot ah there my dear girl you are too strong if linda thorne excuses she accuses herself although i must confess i dont see the heinousness of her crime you are becoming a casuist dinah am i it seems to me that i am remaining what i always was they walked on after this mutually taciturn the interest seemed to have gone from their talk at last just as they neared the first lights of luc village dinahs fingers closed with significant tightness on her husbands arm i have an important word to say to you gaston all through our walk i have been wishing to bring it out but i had not the courage some one else calls me by my christian name perhaps or are we only to discuss more enormities of linda thornes there was a threat of impatience in gaston arbuthnots voice this little running accompaniment of domesticity gave a quite new character he decided to picnics viewed as a means of social pleasure i was not thinking of linda thorne i wanted to ask gaston forgive me if you would keep nearer to me till we get back to guernsey nearer will not everybody be near everybody else on board the steamer dont i beg ask me to do anything absurd he added with emphasis you have no idea how ready ones best friends are to laugh at one under given circumstances but if you were just to stop at my side on board i mean so that no one else could come near me i will do nothing of the kind you have no perception of the ridiculous dinah it is a want in your nature a woman with the slightest sense of humour would never wish her husband to be demonstrative before an audience demonstrative jealous might be nearer the mark a variety of reasons could be given as to the miserable wretchs motives in such a position jealous of little rex basire probably gaston arbuthnot laughed this time his laughter had no very hearty sound you must learn to be self reliant he went on presently your first lesson in worldliness was to be taken to day remember well you must go through with it i was not especially anxious for you to join the party you were not i came to please myself only and you have pleased yourself and me you are the most charming woman present and let me tell you these handsome guernsey girls are formidable rivals i am proud of you the opening page of the lesson is a success dont spoil it dinah by picking a childish quarrel with me now i am proud of you the unexpected praise sent a thrill through dinahs heart her petition to gaston to keep near her was made in a very different spirit to that of childish quarrelling on the road back from la delivrande to langrune it had come to pass that the walking party following a natural law broke up into couples and that dinah unprotected by marjorie or by geff found herself alone with lord rex basire being for his age a very thorough man of the world lord rex uttered no word at which mrs arbuthnot or any sensible woman could take umbrage but his manner his tones his looks were eloquent with a feeling which to her straightforward rustic perception of things constituted an offence in the matter of admiration dinah as i have said was neither prude nor puritan she knew the greatness of her gift it was an everyday experience to see heads turn wherever she walked upon the earth and being a quite natural and single hearted daughter of the common mother such acknowledgment of her beauty had never yet been repugnant to her but the admiration covertly expressed by rex basire as they sauntered slowly through chequered light and shadow back to langrune was of another nature instinct warned dinah that if she were an unmarried girl she might well read on this foolish young mans face and in his manner signs of love and the warning to gaston arbuthnots wife was in itself a humiliation she was unacquainted with the weapons by means of which differently nurtured women parry equivocal attention save from linda thornes lips to night she had never heard the term platonic geoffrey was her only friend of men like lord rex basire she knew nothing to gaze and hint and sigh after this tormenting fashion might she thought be a received habit among young officers of his rank and the torment would soon be over if gaston would only keep near her on board the princess once safely back in guernsey and dinah felt she could take absolute care of herself for the future there should be no more lingering afternoon visits no more instruction in wool work for lord rex basire of the lesson learnt to day one paragraph at least was clear should be reduced to practice before another twenty four hours went by if gaston would only keep near her in the interval but at gastons praise she forgot everything in the sweetness of that unlooked for avowal i am proud of you all dread of the future all unpleasant recollections of the past were swept clean away out of dinahs brain she would not risk the moments happiness by another word her hand trembled as though they had gone back to the old romantic days at lesser cheriton as it rested on gastons arm proud of me ah my love she whispered i hope that you and i will never have a worse quarrel than this while we live and when the pair of married sweethearts emerged into the glare of lamps outside luc casino dinahs face was radiant lord rex devotedly attentive at the moment to pretty rosie verschoyle saw and felt mystified decidedly the methodistic heart like the methodistic conscience was a book wherein rex basire might not read linda thorne approached at once a tall figure diaphanous graceful in the lamplight an indian shawl was on lindas arm one of those exquisite dull hued cachemires capable of investing the plainest woman with ephemeral poetry her hand held a bunch of wild flowers a long trail of bindweed was twined by fingers not unversed in millinery round her hat i hope you approve my ball attire she asked this with a little curtsey her eyes addressing gaston rather than gastons wife our hosts tell us that we have all free entrance to the casino the result i suspect of some liberal bribe to the administration really the way our subalterns have preconcerted every detail of their picnic has quite a monte christo flavour you are engaged to me remember mr arbuthnot for your first waltz there will be neither first nor last mrs thorne i exhausted the very small dancing power that is in me on hortense and eulalie this afternoon i have not waltzed with a partner over seven for years added gaston my step dates from the days of louis philippe nevertheless he moved away from dinah he followed whithersoever mrs thorne might choose to lead she chose the luc dunes that broad belt of wind blown sand held together by coarse grasses or sea thistles which stretches the entire length of the straggling village and forms a welcome contrast to the burnt up turf terrace with burnt up geraniums mildewed urns and peeling stucco goddesses of loftier watering places this evening luc was merry making there were fireworks there was a procession of torches one of those ever recurring processions by which the hearts of parisian children big and little are gladdened at the seaside tiny figures marched two and two with chinese lamps along the village causeway a band of small boys evoked martial melody from drum and fife catherine wheels rotated rockets scurried up into space by and by an artfully constructed bonfire of colza stalks flared up in the centre of the plage hand linked in hand the children danced around it nous irons aux bois les lauriers sont coups their shrill voices rang across the dunes gaston arbuthnot could descry his friends hortense and eulalie wildly circling around the red flames with the rest as he did so he thought involuntarily of his sketch book forgotten from the moment when the children laid violent hands upon him hours ago until this instant oh i know your sketch book is gone cried linda as he felt in pocket after pocket this is the nemesis that falls on creatures of impulse mr arbuthnot but it is no joking matter every memorandum i have made during the last month gone for once gastons voice was tragic he knew full well the market value of those rough notes of his every memorandum from your first bit of sarnian still life an old market woman dozing knitting pins in hand at her stall down to our fisher girl of the boulevards taking into account the studies of rahnee and of myself there must be literally scores of valuable jottings in that book you are laughing at me no i divine you have taken care of my book mrs thorne like the dear good fortunately gaston arbuthnot broke off would mrs thorne would any woman still conscious of youth and charm forgive the man who in exuberance of gratitude should say to her like the dear good creature i know you to be i have taken care of your sketches she answered drawing the book forth from beneath her cachemire i have done more you ask sometimes why i always carry a housewife in my pocket you shall see the part my housewife has played to day while i sat quietly with robbie and mrs verschoyle the young people very rightly enjoying themselves elsewhere i sewed all your ragged leaves together for you thus linda thorne was a notably clever worker perhaps the length of her stitches the breadth of her hems were not always in accordance with the orthodox feminine standard she could effect things with her needle such as fine drawing a rent in cloth or improvising an anchorage for a buttonless collar which might be the despair of many a mistress of the craft she did her stitching with brains at an out of the way indian station so the legend ran mrs linda under stress of some unlooked for gaiety once manufactured an evening waistcoat for her robbie and a pair of neat white satin boots for herself at a sitting this is capital cried arbuthnot joyfully recovering possession of his sketches each page hinged on with a splendid contrivance of red silk to the dislocated remains of back i have often wanted dinah to devise some sort of surgery for my veteran sketch books she must take a lesson by this oh no no mrs arbuthnot is a far better needlewoman than i am when i sew anything tolerably said linda it is by accident i must have a motive for what i do if i lived with i mean now if dear robbie were an artist it would be my passion to help him in all the mechanical part of his work if i were staying with you and mrs arbuthnot you would discover that i can really in my way be useful michael angelo himself must have had a poor obscure some one to grind his paints for him the pathetic image of robbie as an artist made gaston laugh inwardly he was not struck by the humour of hearing his own name coupled with michael angelos nay it might be well he thought if dinah felt this passion of unselfish helpfulness well if dinah occasionally gave him the kind of praise he got from linda thorne for dinah never flattered her words of encouragement unlettered country girl though she was were full of soundest criticism there was no honey in them true love has its intuitions dinah knew that to feed this man on constantly sugared words was to poison him she would gladly have seen in gaston a noble discontent gladly have listened to less frank avowals that he had found his level and got on pretty well there dinah in short was not a delightful acquaintance but a steadfast loyal wife and her praise in common with that of other steadfast wives was apt to take the wholesome bitterness the slightly sub acid flavour of a tonic michael angelo my dear mrs thorne how much how very much you over estimate me if you spoke of me as imitating from afar the little affected prettinesses of a greuze the compliment would be too high i fixed my standard for you years ago mr arbuthnot in the days when you used to thank me me a governess for playing dance music at madame benjamins i had my convictions as to the place you would one day occupy in art at other times on the morning for instance when we first saw the arbuthnot trio in the garden of millers hotel linda remembered her aspirations as to the place her friend would one day hold in the house of commons but gaston if he noted the discrepancy passed it generously over hard for a man to believe a charming woman insincere simply because she a little over estimates his own genius those light hearted salad days when i was with de camors this afternoon the effusive little frenchman who so nearly kissed you as long as i forgot the children and the twelve stone of mamma and the fact that de camors himself is growing bald i could have believed he and i were six and thirty again six and thirty used to be the sum of our joint ages do not talk of age it is a subject about which a man may jest while a woman just breaks her heart and linda extended towards him her thin adroit hands clasped in a pose that she had studied not unsuccessfully as one of pained entreaty women are younger relatively than men answered gaston with the sincerity of his sex when i was two and twenty dinahs age i knew more of the world than i know now whereas my wife ah your wife interrupted linda thorne the mask for a moment dropping the voice hardening i was thinking of living palpitating flesh and blood women inhabitants of a world where nothing is faultless save over faultless perfection i i mean she went on rapidly recovering her self control that at thirty and i am past thirty alas who looks at me under broad daylight but must see it at thirty a man is scarcely in the noonday sun a woman already feels the breath of evening her one chill hope is to grow old gracefully mrs arbuthnot is a girl still and you were a child when i first knew you in paris observed gaston cleverly quitting the dangerous territory across whose borders he has been betrayed how natural it seems mrs thorne that we should be walking together you and i in the old country with the old language round us again do you hear what the children are singing down on the sands yonder linda set herself to listen her expressive hands clasped her face bowed nous irons aux bois les lauriers sont coups shouted the shrill young gallican voices in the distance mr arbuthnot repeated the nursery rhyme as murger wove it into his delightful letter to a cousin nous nirons plus aux bois les lauriers sont coups nous nirons plus aux bois oh ma cousine angle the lady at his side bowed her face lower and believed in all integrity that she was about to be overtaken by tears mrs linda to do her justice was not of a lachrymose temperament at the zenith of their boy and girl flirtation years ago she had never shed a tear for mr gaston arbuthnot until he appeared with his beautiful wife had indeed clean forgotten her youthful weakness and his existence but she possessed considerable imagination a gloss of surface sentiment she was also an insatiate novel reader and had fallen into the habit of perennial strong emotion leading nowhere she could realise how a woman who had loved ought to feel as she recalled past happiness with the lover of the past both married and one alas fast nearing an age when the most pathetic drama turns without help from the burlesque writers into parody linda thorne believed herself to be on the brink of tears gaston arbuthnot believed so too and his heart could not but soften over the poor things impressibility so widely different in effect are tears shed in bitter earnest by ones wife and tears shed in pretty make believe by the wife of another man do you hear mr arbuthnot the dancers have changed their tune she asked this as the children eddying like spirit figures in an opera scene round the fire broke into a new measure marie soak thy bread in wine universal refrain of all french children from the pyrenees to the channel marie soak thy bread how that foolish rhyme brings back the benjamins salon and my place behind the piano and you mr arbuthnot handing round refreshments with the small slave driver mose marie soak thy bread alas mrs thornes utterances grew mystic we women have to soak our bread in sour enough wine have we not the benjamin refreshments sugar water orgeat mused gaston arbuthnot keeping safely to the practical yes those were charming evenings especially when papa mose did not sing i remember as though twere yesterday how my poor mother used to suspect madame benjamin of putting bad almonds in the orgeat chapter xxviii for auld lang syne meantime whilst this mature pair of sentimentalists recalled the past under the starlight the younger people sound of heart and limb were making the most of the present inside the walls of luc casino fine weather for their voyage an excellent french dinner and now a ball with distractingly pretty girls for partners what further enjoyment could hearts as light as the hearts of the subaltern hosts desire lord rex only played spectator while rosie verschoyle danced waltz polka american to outward seeming in gayer spirits than her wont lord rex remained fixed in his attendance on mrs arbuthnot beside one of the open ball room doors dinah was curiously staunch of purpose about trifles as about serious things she clung to first principles it was a first principle with her never to enter a casino english or french and rex basire vainly expended his best special pleading in seeking to change her mrs arbuthnot objected perhaps to waltz with a one armed man would she give him a polka then would she rush an american quadrille it made it ever so much more diverting if one did not know the figures of an american well if she would not dance at all would she take his arm and walk round the rooms simply to put them in their place mrs arbuthnot i have my british vanity i want these bragging frenchmen accustomed to nothing handsomer than lay figures out of the pattern books to see you all in vain dinah wished neither to dance nor to dazzle only if lord rex pleased thus after a space she admonished him it would be wise for his lordship to join the rest of his party miss verschoyle was standing out there could not be a likelier time than the present for him to secure miss verschoyles hand his lordship however did not please and so when gaston and linda thorne returned later on from their walk the first fact patent to both on entering the ball room was dinahs absence with a quick look around linda discerned rosie verschoyle standing at her mothers side partnerless rosie verschoyle a wall flower oh this is too bad what can lord rex be thinking of exclaimed linda ingenuously mr arbuthnot i insist upon your asking poor little rosie to dance at once i thought you and i were to take pity on each other mrs thorne for auld lang syne think of rosie not me it is positively wicked for old married women to monopolise the dancing men while girls stand out are you sure miss verschoyle would care to have a man with deposited affections for her partner a veteran whose waltz step dates from the reign of louis philippe try her in my young days girls would sooner dance with anybody than remain partnerless that anybody gives me confidence it is good to know the exact compartment in which one is pigeon holed gaston crossed the room he made his bow before rosie who moved forward graciously now that mr arbuthnot had asked her said the girl in her thin staccato she would have the enjoyment of one really good waltz something in gastons looks made her certain that he was a splendid dancer louis philippe mr arbuthnots step dated from the days of louis philippe why that cried rosie was before we were all born she confessed to never remembering about those horrid french revolution people but had a notion louis philippe came next to the king who got his head cut off or was he egalit the man who insisted upon dying in his boots louis philippe came next to the king who got his head cut off said gaston as his arm clasped her well rounded waist i had no idea miss verschoyle that you were such a profound historian linda thorne took the chair left vacant beside rosies mother your dear child is looking her best mrs verschoyle i think our guernsey roses do us national credit we ought to produce an effect upon the foreign mind the young people are too much flushed every one of them a day like this may lay the seeds of lifelong malady i know as a fact mrs thorne that rosie is dancing in wet shoes better dance than sit still in them remarked linda cheerfully you never catch cold while you are amused could we not have been amused at a quarter the cost i have been trying in my own mind to reckon up the expenses of the expedition putting everything at the lowest i bring it to something fabulous fabulous if these young subalterns sons no doubt of needy men had only given us a tea drinking on lancresse common when colonel verschoyle was in command the time when her colonel commanded a regiment in guernsey was mrs verschoyles one unchequered recollection the standard by which all subsequent mortal events must be judged when poor colonel verschoyle was in command that is what the officers used to do give us a tea drinking at lancresse and a dance for the young people afterwards no show very little expense everybody pleased then of course if you got your shoes wet you could change them the advantages of lancresse over langrune as a spot whereat to change your shoes seemed to touch mrs verschoyle nearly her eyes filled the money that has gone on all this she mourned not to speak of the doctors bills we may have to pay hereafter when first the plan was chalked out i foresaw how everything would end i entreated rosie to reason with lord rex unfortunately i can never get my children to listen to me you should have gained over mrs arbuthnot said linda with a spice of malice as the picnic was got up for her no doubt she could have amended the programme mrs verschoyle looked more like a little bewildered white mouse than usual as this newly propounded idea made its way slowly to her intelligence it is a most unprecedented thing to get up a party of pleasure for a married lady without daughters mrs arbuthnot i believe has no daughters at all events not of an age to be introduced well she is a very sweet looking young woman said the meek motherly soul through whose lips no breath of scandal ever passed mrs arbuthnot has just that fair placid large look that used to be so much admired in my flo but the complexion is too transparent for health did i tell you flos husband was ordered to malta his regiment is on this seasons reliefs and flo talks of coming over to me with the children four babies and a native nurse i suppose i shall be able to take them all in easily you have only to give up your own room and sleep in the conservatory when rahnee is married and offers to come home with four babies and a native nurse sleeping in the conservatory observed linda is just the kind of sacrifice i shall be prepared to make you would have the old jungle ague back upon you in twenty four hours if you did neither you nor doctor thorne are people who should take liberties with yourselves indeed i think you have both been looking sadly this spring rosie my dear come here for the waltz had ended gaston arbuthnot was walking past english fashion his partner on his arm come and sit down by me out of the draught i do hope this is the last dance we shall stay for mr arbuthnot no indeed mamma we are to stay for the next it is another waltz and i am engaged for it to lord rex rosie glanced a little ruefully towards the door where dinah and lord rex still stood thank you so much mr arbuthnot for our beautiful waltz i hope said rosie verschoyle all my partners as long as i live will have taken dancing lessons in the reign of louis philippe when the opening bars of the waltz sounded lord rex with no very great alacrity came across the room to claim rosies hand gaston arbuthnot bent over linda for auld lang syne is this to be our dance mrs thorne linda thorne was not a pretty not by natural gift a graceful woman she was a perfect dancer poor dinah from her hiding place had found a genuine pleasure in watching gaston waltz with dimpled smiling rosie verschoyle for dinah like all wholesome minded mortals had unmixed sympathy with the spirits and enjoyment of light hearted girlhood she looked with very different perceptions at linda thorne looked at her with something of the feeling a true but unpopular artist might know on watching the facile successes of meretricious talent this tinselled pleasure loving linda with her clinging draperies her indian perfumes this wife whose heart was not with her husband this mother who contentedly could leave her child to servants was so far below the ideal towards which since her marriage dinah arbuthnot had faithfully striven below an ideal standard and yet in such vital points as talking amusing talk in dancing dressing dinner giving in the all important matter of pleasing men difficult to please like gaston arbuthnot how immeasurably was linda her superior dinahs heart contracted she was just going to shift away into deeper shadow when a hand touched her arm with friendly purpose turning she saw marjorie bartrand cassandra tighe laden with nets and specimen boxes in the rear marjories face glowed damask a pity you were not with us mrs arbuthnot we have been having a glorious time moth hunting in the luc lanes miss tighe and i and and every now and then mr geoffrey arbuthnot condescended to join when the chase got warm what are you all about here marjorie ascended a step she took a smiting glance round the ball room well this is as good as a sermon miss tighe come and be edified is it not fine to see middle aged couples waltzing for the public good with a little scornful gesture of the head marjorie indicated gaston and his partner mr gaston arbuthnot may be doing his steps from personal motives perhaps because he has the artistic temperament whatever said marjorie that elastic term may mean nothing but severe principles the determination to point a moral could make linda thorne go through violent exercise on a night like this linda thorne is considered the best waltzer in guernsey said cassandra your tongue is over sharp you speak before you think marjorie bartrand i feel before i do either whispered the girl her hand stealing back with half shy kindness to dinahs arm if mrs arbuthnot had been with us said cassandra she would have witnessed a sight worth laughing at marjorie scoffs at middle aged partners what would you think mrs arbuthnot of a white haired woman flying across hedges and ditches breathless with excitement over the capture of a butterfly scarce a dozen specimens of pontia daplidice have been seen in northern europe during the last twenty years went on old cassandra flushed still with victory and of these six only were netted like mine on the wing why it would be worth staying a week here a week a month on the outside chance of sighting a second pontia daplidice chapter xxix missing all this time the princess lying well outside the luc rocks was getting up her steam before the waltz had ended a red light hung from the vessels bows gave the signal for those on shore to hurry their departure there was a flutter of airy dresses as the english party emerged from the ball room into darkness a ripple of talk as they filed indian fashion hand steadying hand down the narrow path that led from the casino to the little fishing slip or jetty and then unexpectedly came the first misadventure that had arisen to mar this day of calm and sunshine when the party had embarked in two of the unwieldy flat bottomed boats of the country it occurred to lord rex as commander in chief that their number should be counted and soon the cry arose that one was wanting seventeen human souls left guernsey that morning on this point all were confident sixteen human souls only were forthcoming now and no efforts of memory individual or collective could hit upon the defaulters name mrs verschoyle exclaimed in a hollow voice that it was a most uncomfortable omen she would be sorry to depress the younger peoples spirits but for her part she would sooner set sail in the teeth of a hurricane than have had this thing occur let the counting be more systematic said the poor lady jumping to her feet and for once in her life launching into independent action let me repeat each name slowly beginning with the youngest of the gentlemen and let each person answer as he is called mr smith brown jones lord rex the two mr arbuthnots doctor thorne after doctor thornes name there was a moments silence then linda tragic of accent ejaculated robbie of course and then i regret to say most of the younger people began to laugh but it may be a matter of life and death cried mrs thorne if you please lord rex i will go on shore at once the princess may start probably will start without me my duty is to look for robbie oh i am most uneasy it is all my selfishness robbie ought never to have been brought on such an expedition i am certain something has happened to him i shall never forgive myself while i live these amiable anxieties were the exact sentiments suited to the occasion mrs thorne expressed them with agitated dignity and of course no one laughed again consolations even were forthcoming dr thorne had been seen in the flesh outside luc casino or if not the doctor some old gentleman exactly like him with a puggaree sand shoes a white umbrella and smoking an enormous cigar just like the cigar poor dear doctor thorne always used to smoke it was the prettiest least wise of the de carteret sisters who offered this bit of evidence the gentleman was observed to look in for a while at the dancing and then to walk away in the direction ada de carteret believed of the sea the sea and who can tell that the sea has not surrounded him in out of the way french places the tide always swells up with a circuit tears were in lindas voice as she proclaimed this maritime fact i am most uneasy she adjusted her indian shawl with grace round her shoulders then skipped lightly to land robbie ought never to have been brought it was all my selfishness i am torn in pieces by remorse the young ladies with the exception of one flint soul cried no no in chorus mrs thorne positively must not say these dreadful things when every one knew she had such a character for unselfishness mrs verschoyle felt for her smelling salts then settled herself gloomily down prepared for the worst mrs verschoyle felt within her the courage of a prophet whose own dark sayings are on the eve of fulfilment gaston arbuthnot in his quiet unmoved manner rose stepping on shore gaston volunteered to go in search of the missing doctor these were just the scenes wherein linda so infinitely diverted him frenchman as he was in three fourths of his nature little scenes in which on the boards of domestic life she played such admirable farce without knowing it i shall walk straight back to langrune mrs thorne notwithstanding your solemn tone in spite of miss de carterets evidence i believe the doctor has never missed any of us and at this moment is smoking his cigar possibly sipping his little glass at the hotel chateaubriand unless you are here in a quarter of an hour sharp we shall leave you behind called out lord rex when gaston had proceeded some paces on his errand the princess is chartered until to morrow only whatever the rest of us do the skipper will take care not to lose his tide linda thorne by this time in her agitation and her indian shawl was at gastons side so the exordium might be taken as addressed to them both all right answered mr arbuthnot leisurely langrune is not the end of the earth if by the time we secure the doctor the steamer has weighed anchor we must all get back to guernsey vi cherbourg that would fit in very well the lady of the isles crosses from cherbourg to morrow went on gaston raising his voice as he looked back over his shoulder towards the boats we should just have time to visit the dockyard before starting and then the two figures sped onward side by side they were watched with keen speculative interest by the occupants of the boats no one save simple mrs verschoyle felt disturbed as to the doctors ultimate fate was an old gentleman who had taken admirable care of himself for forty years in india a likely subject to be spirited away on the sands between luc and langrune but the situation had a dramatic piquancy that stirred even the unimaginative minds of the miss de carterets and their attendant subalterns for there was dinah impossible to forget that mrs gaston arbuthnot that lowly born young woman with the beautiful eyes and set sad mouth was also watching the two figures as they disappeared in the darkness a quarter of an hour by jove ten minutes of that quarter must be nearly gone and taking out his watch lord rex struck a vesuvian in order to learn the time it was exactly eight minutes to nine and at nine sharp the princess was to weigh her anchor the moment for action had come now what was the wisest thing to do one point seemed certain it was useless for both boats to wait longer let the smaller boat at the head of the jetty start for the steamer at once let the captain be told what had happened and asked to put off his departure as long as practicable if gaston arbuthnot and the thornes arrived in time the second boat would bring them off if not why common sense could really dictate no better plan than gastons own langrune was not the end of the world a railway to cherbourg existed the lady of the isles would no doubt bring the lost sheep comfortably back to their respective folds to morrow dinah as it happened was with ada de carteret and the elder ladies in the boat at the head of the jetty and soon before dinahs eyes as before the eyes of one who dreams the reflections of the casino lamps the childrens chinese lanterns were dancing with fairy like brightness across the moving water she realised that her day of pleasure was over that every one yes she could catch the voices of marjorie and of geff holding merry talk in the other boat every one took the adventure jestingly and that her heart felt like lead that her hands were ice cold that each breath she drew was a conscious and painful effort well if she had enough bodily strength to act her part out she thought say no word to betray her plebeian emotions and so bring down ridicule on her husband or herself she must be content once on board the steamer she could hide herself in the cabin away from sight and there wait until the comedy or tragedy had reached its next act this one wretched comfort remained to her she would be able to screen herself for a while at least from observation to be alone but a new and still more diverting incident was about to be woven into the text of the play if i were not in such a nervous state cried mrs verschoyle when the boat was within three or four lengths of the princess if i were not so morally shaken that i distrust my own senses i should say our good doctor was on board there came a flash of light just now beside the wheel the lighting perhaps of a fusee and for a second it seemed to me that i saw doctor thornes figure distinctly a pity some reliable person was not looking and mrs verschoyle to her own surprise had seen correctly the doctor it proved to be the doctor smoking one of the ships best cheroots and enjoying the summer night with unruffled innocence he advanced gallantly to assist the ladies in their embarkation and heard with gusto the story of his own supposed fate surrounded by the tide tut tut linda might have known had she exercised her reason whither he had betaken himself only you ladies never do reason said the doctor addressing mrs verschoyle it was growing damp on shore and let me give you a bit of advice my dear madam whenever you feel that clinging kind of chill after gun fire get on board ship if you have the chance get an honest plank instead of the abominable miasmal emanations of mother earth under your feet yes yes went on the doctor comfortably i hailed one of the princesss boats and came on board two hours ago have drunk my cup of coffee and beaten ozanne at his own game cribbage and your wifes anxiety my dear mrs verschoyle i am penitent only my wife you see might have reasoned it would have deprived you all no doubt of a harmless excitement but linda i think might have reasoned any way it is better to be drowned by ones friends imaginations than run the risk in earnest of a pair of damp shoes to this mrs verschoyle gave a qualified assent the mention of damp shoes affected her still she was not a little shocked at doctor thornes levity at his advanced age thought poor mrs verschoyle perturbedly and after the awful narrowness of his escape the fear is doctor that mrs thorne will be left behind cried ada de carteret with meaning at the first word of danger linda started off along the langrune road to look for you linda ought to have reasoned and lord rex declares the captain must weigh anchor at nine sharp it is like a scene in a novel the last scene but one with everything in a delicious tangle still why doctor you are the hero of the day i feel enormously flattered said the old doctor it is a very long time since a charming young lady has said anything so pretty to me but your wife doctor thorne expostulated cassandra tighe who with her nets and cases had been the last to leave the boat do you realise that if ozanne saves his tide if we return to guernsey to night mrs thorne will remain in france i cannot believe it ozanne would not surely be so ungallant allow me miss tighe to help you with a few of your packages no no the skipper would not be so ungallant and then my dear linda is the most famous traveller surely i have told you what wonderful presence of mind she showed once in the nilgiri hills lost actually lost for four entire days if by mischance linda should be left alone she will make her way home to morrow vi cherbourg and enjoy the adventure and mrs thorne is not alone cried ada de carteret clapping her hands and no doubt feeling that the position grew more and more deliciously tangled mr arbuthnot is with her not marjorie bartrands coach but the other one the singing flirting good looking mr arbuthnot added this vivacious young lady profoundly forgetful that the good looking mr arbuthnots wife stood within three yards of her elbow then my fears are set at rest observed the doctor genially if my friend arbuthnot is there my fears are set thoroughly at rest meanwhile i may as well speak to the skipper the tide of course must be saved still it would be only right to let ozanne know how affairs stand and dinah had listened to it all youthful jest aged philosophy all and standing among the others with a queer sensation that she had suddenly oldened by a dozen years some pallid ghost of a smile rose to her lips here was a grand opportunity verily of learning a lesson at first hand a chance in a thousand for readjusting ones standard for observing the nicer little shades of feeling and usage which prevail in the world to which one would fain belong a smile i say rose to dinahs lips which of us does not remember how in sharp mental stress he has found himself looking on at the trivial accessories of his pain as a stranger might derisively in the poor girls heart was death she knew that for gaston to have set at naught her pleadings for gaston to have quitted her thus might render to night a bitter crisis in the lives of both chapter xxx linda warms to her part but dinah was not unobserved not uncared for if cassandra tighes taste for piquant situation once in a hundred times led her astray the ninety nine good offices performed by the kindly old maid in the interval were sufficient surely to atone for the single blunder cassandras heart went out towards dinah at the first moment when the fair sad face passed before her in the garden of millers hotel she had listened with regret to stories of gastons fickleness even while her talents as a narrator assisted in giving such stories wider currency had felt remorse sharp and hard for her own unwitting share in the arbuthnot drama at this hour of which i write dinah standing mute wan beside her cassandras breast kindled with renewed compassion towards the simple unbefriended country girl a compassion none the less genuine in that it went somewhat wide of dinahs actual and present trouble you look thoroughly done up my dear mrs arbuthnot i am afraid to days gadding about has been too much for you let us see said cassandra in a whisper if we cannot find some quiet corner you and i where we may settle down and rest dinah turned on her a look of blank unanswering pain she wanted neither sympathy nor support wanted only to creep below out of sight to avoid all temptation to disobedience all possibility of bringing down ridicule on gaston i feel chilled nothing that is to speak of you are very good miss tighe but i had rather go down to the saloon alone please i am used to being alone and and i have a cloak which i must look for a note of suppressed passion was in her voice it betrayed emotion curiously at variance with the commonplace words the staid reserved manner and in a moment cassandra tighes valorous spirit had armed itself for action dr thorne will you stop that luc boat if you please never mind my nets they can go anywhere attendez matelots attendez moi cried cassandra in her own peculiar french and signalling with her handkerchief to the boat already a few lengths distant from the steamer it would scarcely do doctor to let matters shape themselves with such very slight rough hewing some one must go ashore without delay think of lindas anxiety if the princess should leave before she had been assured of your safety i think of many things said dr thorne with humour the dampness of the night pre eminently of course i must go still linda might have exercised her reason such reason as providence bestows on the sex linda is not a child what possible good could come from this kind of wild goose chase and the old doctor moved an inch or two exceedingly crusty of mien in the direction of the companion ladder but this was not the plan of cassandra tighes campaign you will just stay comfortably where you are you will keep a dry plank under your feet dr thorne and give me carte blanche to look after your wife if the princess starts without us linda and i must find our way back to guernsey i have a purse in my pocket linda has a brain in her head we both know how to travel to you mrs arbuthnot i confide my treasure turning round she gave dinah a little chip box clasping the girls cold hands for an instant as she did so take care of pontia daplidice my dear and take care of yourself look for your cloak by all means doctor thorne do you persuade ozanne to give us every possible moments law i have a presentiment that all will come right that your good wifes over anxiety will not lead her into mischief the unwieldy luc boat was by this time swaying to and fro at the bottom of the ladder a luc fisherman stood with bare brawny arms extended for cassandras reception a few seconds later cassandra and boat alike had become a dark spot on the water luminous now with the quick moving facets of the rising tide dinah was alone indeed she stood for a time mechanically watching the row of lights on shore mechanically listening to the steam as it puffed with energy unmistakable from the funnels of the princess then uncertain of tread heavy of limb as of heart she groped her way below resolved silently to endure whatever fate the coming half hour might have in store for her the cabin lamps were as yet unlighted dinah entered the ladies saloon at hazard she sank down on the couch nearest the door then burying her face between her hands she strove with might to collect her thoughts to stifle the resentment against gaston which conscience sternly just already condemned as paltry ungenerous it was of her own perverse will that she accepted rex basires invitation how often had gaston warned her that with her temper her opinions she would find society a dangerous experiment a game in which she would be likely to stake gold against other players counters she had come here to day to please herself she had no right of control over her husbands actions gaston lived according to the light of his own conscience not hers he was courteous by temperament fond of little unforeseen deviations from any laid down programme prompt always in putting his time his energy himself at the service of his friends langrune is not the end of the earth she recalled his cheery amused tone as he was vanishing with linda across the dunes if the princess should start without us we must get back by cherbourg to morrow it will fit in very well she remembered doctor thorne his self possession his confidence in gaston if my friend arbuthnot is there ones fears are set at rest she could imagine lindas witty reproduction of the whole too delicious accident when they should get back to guernsey oh let her gain mastery over herself mastery let to days lesson be a deeper one than can be gained by nice observance of tone or look or manner let her have learned to conquer small jealousies to be wary of quick judgments to construe the actions the intentions of others nobly dinah resolved in the spirit to be strong meanwhile she realised with growing certitude that she was weak exceedingly in the flesh her breath came with greater effort her hands grew colder and more clammy rising with difficulty she set herself to search for her cloak among a pyramid of wraps that lay disordered on a neighbouring couch dimly discernible by aid of a newly lighted lamp from the main cabin dinah arbuthnots cloak lay can fate not be ironical even in the disposition of a heap of shawls immediately above a soft long indian scarf belonging to mrs thorne as she lifted it the subtle eastern perfume associated always with lindas presence seemed to dinah in a second to fill the cabin a feeling of sickness a sudden access of keen personal repulsion took hold of her all powerful hold for this time it was instinct not reason that moved her anger she flung down her cloak with a childish sense of disgust at having handled it she sank back passively upon the sofa a few minutes later came in the steward to light the centre lamp seeing one of the guests alone and deathly white he took the commonsense or stewards view of the situation feeling queer already let him get the lady a brandy and soda a glass of wine then settle the system before they got into rough water though for the matter of that they would have a splendid passage sea like a millpond tide favourable nothing but running into one of these here channel fogs to be feared i will take some soda water if you please odd and far away dinahs voice sounded to herself i am a good sailor in general i would rather have a rough sea than a smooth one but this evening i am a little tired i feel thirsty she drank the soda water with a sense of refreshment the wretchedest preparation without the b that could be made for a voyage thought the steward as he stood salver in hand waiting for her glass then when the man had again left her alone she crept back into her place held her hands tight to her throat to relieve the cruel sensation that well nigh choked her and waited waited how long she knew not perhaps a short ten minutes only in recalling the whole scene later the swell of the rising water the murmur of voices in the adjacent cabin the clinging overpowering indian perfume in summing up i say each external detail of that miserable evening it would afterwards seem to dinah arbuthnot that no year of her life ever took so much hard living through as those mortal minutes at length they came to an end doubt was to be set at rest or turned into yet sharper certainty for she could tell first by the muffled thud of rowlocks then by the splash of oar blades in the water that the second boat was arriving she could distinguish geoffreys voice lord rex basires old doctor thornes very loud this last and didactic but yielding dinahs heart no consolation would not doctor thorne talk loud and didactically whether his linda had returned from her quest of him or not after a time the voices began to disperse there came the measured yoy a hoy of the sailors the shuffle of feet the fall of cable on deck then dinah heard the steward saying to one of the boys that they had weighed anchor and not a moment too soon with the air so thick and the glass nohow the skipper ought to have started on this badly buoyed coast a couple of hours ago a french pilot might be all very well but to his the stewards mind english daylight was better dinah knelt upon a sofa inclined her face to the cool air of an open porthole and watched the receding french coast there lay the villages of luc and langrune a line of lights flickering misty and irregular above the shimmer of the sea far away in the distance rose one larger light the signal lantern in the tower of la delivrande dinah watched automatically she noted scarcely more than a playgoer carried away by excitement notes the scene painting at the most thrilling situation of a drama to her as to a child the whole world was concentrated under the passion that governed herself had gaston come back she longed to know this with a longing which one must call to mind her narrow past life her more than girlish simplicity rightly to understand and still she did not attempt to leave the cabin her strength moral and physical seemed paralysed how should she make her way alone up on deck search in the darkness for gaston ask questions parry with a jest such airy explanation of her husbands disappearance as might on all sides be offered her a voice close at her elbow made her start guiltily no one in the ladies saloon well then mrs gaston arbuthnot must have tumbled overboard her husband and i have vainly searched the princess for her oh kindly cassandra was no small bit of embroidery tacked on just at this juncture over the bare truth so much for trusting valuable entomological specimens out of ones own hands miss tighe i am here i have been trying to get a little warm your moth is safe stammered dinah she scarcely knew in what fashion the words left her dry and trembling lips moth a country bred girl like you not to know that a speckled white although by luck we caught him out of hours is a butterfly well i have brought back our other pair of butterflies safe and sound before saying this cassandra had put on her spectacles and carried her box beneath the doorway lamp she made a great show of examining its contents critically thus allowing dinah to recover her self possession unnoticed from certain murmurings i overheard among the sailors i believe we all three narrowly escaped being abandoned to our fate mrs thorne had begun to think that her husband was on board dinahs constrained tone was one of doubt rather than inquiry my dear nobody ever knows what mrs thorne thinks linda is a charming woman the pleasantest companion when she chooses in the world but as the doctor says linda might reason these electric transitions from gay to grave and back to gay again are embarrassing in a world where the rest of us walk by rule linda thorne is all impulse ah at the first word of the doctors disappearance to run off helter skelter like a schoolgirl yes linda thorne cried cassandra peering round at some person or persons across her shoulder i am talking of you come down and hear all the wicked things i have to say at the first word of the doctors disappearance to run off like a schoolgirl taking somebody elses husband with her it was atrocious who is that behind you linda mr gaston arbuthnot tell mr gaston arbuthnot from me that everything worth looking after on board the princess is found as cassandra tighe scored her point not without a little air of triumph linda tripped gaily down into the cabin we are to have the very finest weather miss tighe and all the world means to remain on deck only of course one wants shawls what mrs arbuthnot pausing in her search among the heap of wraps it would seem that linda recognised dinahs presence with amiable surprise but dinah was coldly silent surely you of all people are not going to become a cabin passenger my dear creature i have just escaped the quaintest little adventure in the world but for miss tighes advent i should have eloped yes run clean straight away with your husband we were planning it all out from a commercial standpoint as we flew frantically along the sandhills after robbie were we not miss tighe i leave these matters to your own conscience was the dry answer possibly cassandra recollected that the butterflies were not flying very frantically at the moment when she captured them on the starlit dunes if you had run away with mrs arbuthnots husband i should have taken good care to run with you i warned the doctor of my intentions before i left the princess it was quite too unselfish miss tighe and pecuniarily most propos i possessed five sous in copper guernsey currency mr arbuthnot was worth something under twenty francs we should have had to leave our watches at the mont de pit for me alas no novel experience the moment we reached cherbourg things have turned out under providence for the best only i think i think admitted linda with arch frankness the doctor rather regrets having to retire into insignificance if i had not come back robbie would have remained the hero of the situation mrs thorne ran through all this in her accustomed little tired inconsequential way of talking winding up finally with a long and earnest yawn she then danced up to a strip of mirror at the best lighted end of the cabin and settled herself to the contemplation of her own image with interest she dabbed her cheeks first with rice powder then with eau de cologne then with powder again producing these cosmetics without a show of disguise from a tiny gilt case that hung at her waist belt she arranged the folds of her cachemire scarf above her sleek head in a certain gitana mode which like all good art gave an idea of unpremeditation and became her mightily she pinned a knot of feathery grass a memento doubtless of the starlit dunes in her breast easy to predict that linda thorne would not be sea sick to night she was warming to the situation intended to work up her part everything in human life was a part to linda thorne with spirit come up on deck mrs arbuthnot will you not surely with your splendid sea going qualities you are not going to stop down in this black hole of calcutta mrs arbuthnot will come up when i do cried cassandra who with an added pair of spectacles on her nose was pinning out insects under a lamp go your ways linda thorne wise ones if you can and leave mrs arbuthnot and me to follow ours i would not be wise if i might said linda giving an expressive backward glance across her shoulder if i were wise i should see myself as other people see me and having uttered this the acutest speech that ever left her lips away floated mrs thorne with her powdered cheeks her cachemires and her indian fragrance from the cabin dinah could hear the languid accents the little stage laugh learnt from the stalls for a good many seconds later she could distinguish the voices too of gaston and of rosie verschoyle how heart whole they all seemed how frequent was their laughter what a light time the past hours had been to every one of the party but herself gastons philosophy thought dinah taking an unconscious downward step might be the true one after all then live while we live what had she profited by a strain of feeling too tall for the occasion by the tiptoe attitude by throwing away gold where a more reasonable member of society would have quietly staked counters any admittance here exclaimed a masculine voice as an impatient hand pushed back the cabin door why mrs arbuthnot i have been searching for you everywhere i want you to come up on deck at once please and see a comet not a comet really you know lord rex went on looking hard at dinahs white face some kind of japanese fire balloon sent up by the french people however it does just as well as one yes my dear mrs arbuthnot go cried old cassandra glancing up over her double spectacles from her pinning it will take me an hours work to bring all my specimens straight and your colour shows you want oxygen you are right lord rex take mrs arbuthnot on deck to see this comet which is not a comet i shall follow by and by and dinah arbuthnot obeyed she did more dinah allowed the tips of her cold fingers to rest within rex basires hand as he pioneered her up the cabin stairs into the semi darkness of the night chapter xxxi wife and husband the outlook continued promising overhead the tide was at the right ebb for making barfleur point at an earlier hour than had been hoped for the friendly casket lights showed at intervals above the starboard bow of the princess the skipper cheerful of voice promised his passengers that in forty minutes more tide and weather remaining favourable the vessel would be lying well to leeward of alderney all this time dinah had found no opportunity for exchanging a conciliatory word with her husband she felt that gaston did not so much avoid as ignore her he always contrived to be deep in talk with some other person when his wife sought to draw near him he did not address her did not recognise her presence at length abruptly just as dinah was nerving herself to make some desperate first advance mr arbuthnot crossed the deck he came up to the spot where she and rex basire stood together with the pleasantest air imaginable he put his hand under dinahs arm suppose you take a turn with me wife mr arbuthnot made the proposal in his lightest tone rex basire listening do you see that revolving beacon no my dear no neither aloft on the funnel nor in my face but away far as you can look to the right that beacon marks the casket rocks and there straight ahead but without any lights showing as yet we are to believe is alderney let us make our way to the forecastle we shall have a better view the fore part of the deck was deserted save by two or three knots of sailors talking low together in patois french as they watched the horizon gaston and dinah were practically alone she felt the heart within her throb uneasily an icy politeness lay beneath the surface geniality of gaston arbuthnots manner dinah was prompt to recognise it what a long day this has been gaston i shall want no wider experience in respect of yachting picnics you are changeable dinah as we walked from langrune to luc it was agreed between us that the day should be considered a success a great deal has happened since then exclaimed dinah under her breath nothing very notable surely if i recollect right i did my duty to the extent of two waltzes in the luc ball room and you my dear child had a long a most amusing and intellectual conversation i cannot doubt with lord rex basire in one of the doorways lord rex basire is never amusing when he talks to me then i congratulate you on your proficiency in seeming amused it ranks high as a difficult social art even among veterans gaston she exclaimed a new and poignant doubt making itself felt dinah i dont know what to think of your tone why have you never said a word never looked at me during all these hours are you offended on the contrary retorted gaston they were now out of sight out of earshot of everybody as he spoke arbuthnot withdrew his hand from his wifes arm i am thoroughly your debtor it was the sense of my indebtedness that made me bring you here i wished to thank you without an audience quietly to thank me stammered dinah in a sort of breathless way for for she broke off reddening violently gaston watched her for your solicitude your kindly tact that idea of despatching the old lady in the scarlet cloak to chaperon me was boldly original a fine intuition of wifely vigilance gaston i never yet scarcely the sort of vigilance that passes current in a commonplace and scoffing world if you had the smallest spark of humour dinah that missing sense that one little flaw in your character you would see things as the commonplace scoffing world sees them should i you would divine that under no possible circumstances really it would be well to remember this for the rest of our mortal lives under no circumstances can i require an old lady with or without a scarlet cloak as my chaperon a different woman to dinah might here have turned the tables on gaston arbuthnot have stoutly truthfully disavowed responsibility as to cassandra tighes movements dinah was too transparently honest to defend herself as to the letter knowing that she had been an accessory in the spirit when the time was so short ten minutes more gaston and the princess would have started without you i felt that my heart must stop miss tighe any one could have seen on my face what i suffered i have no doubt that any one could and did see it said gaston arbuthnot with grave displeasure it would not occur to you to make an effort at decent self control whatever ridicule you might be bringing upon others does it never strike you dinah he went on unjustly that other women have human sensibilities as well as yourself linda thorne for instance she rushed off poor thing in the greatest agitation at the first whisper of the doctors disappearance fearing nothing from mrs grundy fearing all things for her husband was it generous charitable do you think to let your disapprobation be written so that he who ran might read upon your face i think said dinah faithfully that mrs thorne felt no agitation whatsoever gaston also thought so it was a point he would not commit himself to argue out there are feelings one must take for granted mrs thorne did the right thing in refusing to start without her husband i acted as i judged best in determining to remain by her that ought to have been enough for you yes it ought to have been enough dinah gazed before her at the purplish streak faintly dividing the sea line from the sky it grew blurred and tremulous her eyes had filled with tears you had plenty of people to bear you company geoffrey miss bartrand it is unbecoming in you dinah to act like a wayward girl however matters had turned out about doctor and mrs thorne what hardship would there have been in your returning to guernsey with geoffrey and without me none none i was wrong from first to last all this is my lesson remember one cannot get a lesson by heart without a little trouble one might learn it without making everybody else absurd persisted gaston you asked me why i had never addressed a word to you never looked in your direction since we put out to sea i will tell you why my dear i considered you dangerous i was afraid dinah lifted up her face she fixed her truthful and transparent gaze full on gaston arbuthnot i dont understand you gaston you know i never can understand when you speak with a double meaning well there was a certain electric look about you a look prophetic of lightning or thunder showers for neither of which i am in the mood you ought to have chosen a husband of more heroic mould dinah there is the truth a man like the hero of a ladys novel observed mr arbuthnot wittily always equal to a strained attitude a man fond of the big primeval human passions love hatred jealousy but you have married me and i am afraid you must take me as i am you must also as often as you can remember this dinah as often as you can endeavour not to render me ridiculous when mr and mrs arbuthnot re emerged out of the darkness gastons hand was resting on his wifes shoulder dinahs face had recovered its calm it would have taken a keen observer of countenance to guess that a breeze so stiff as the one we know of had just stirred the surface of these two persons lives was linda thorne such an observer linda was standing alone in the gangway her attitude one of deliberation when gaston and his wife came aft she kept her position speaking to no one until lord rex companionless like herself had managed to find his way to dinahs elbow then linda thorne made a move she crossed to the vessels side resting her hand on the bulwarks she gazed heavenward such good lines as her throat and shoulders possessed were well outlined against the pallid background of sky gaston arbuthnot followed her before long we are fortunate after all our misadventures are we not the mate tells me that we have sighted alderney it seems likely that we shall get back to petersport without fog and what may i ask do you mean by our misadventure there was a ring of sharpness in linda thornes tone ah what the moment said gaston when gleams of a scarlet cloak first flashed upon one along the sand dunes seems to my own consciousness about the most serious of them you are singularly insincere mr gaston arbuthnot i cannot agree with you mrs thorne my worst enemies on the contrary have the grace to credit me with a sort of brutal frankness and supposing no scarlet cloak had appeared you would willingly have been left a second robinson crusoe on the desert shores of luc the cases are not parallel robinson crusoe had only the society of his man friday and there were no beaux yeux to weep for him so many years observed linda stand between me and the literature of my childhood that i am uncertain about details but i dont think one ever heard of a mrs crusoe gaston knew that he was being laughed at he kept his temper charmingly and there is very decidedly a mrs arbuthnot when i think of dinah i cannot call miss tighes advent a misadventure poor dinah has a childs quick capacity for unhappiness her imagination would have conjured up a dozen possible horrors by sea and land if i had not returned to her that is all so very very pretty is it not linda stooped as if watching the rush of the sea gaston arbuthnot could not catch the expression of her face we professional old travellers are toughened and sun baked out of all rose water nervousness robbie has told you whom does he not tell the story of my being lost actually lost in the nilgiris if i were to be mislaid for a fortnight i really dont believe the doctor would suffer a moments uneasiness and yet you were so cruelly upset by his disappearance the superiority apostrophised gaston of the unselfish sex over ours i was not only upset by his disappearance said linda still taking an interest in the waves i am disturbed about him in my conscience still if doctor thorne takes the slightest chill to night we shall be having the old jungle fever back upon him gaston sympathised as to this contingency not as yet perceiving the drift of lindas alarms at robbies age one cannot be too prudent to run into one of these cold channel fogs might end in something quite too serious and although the stars make a pretence at shining linda raised her head with tentative playfulness the enemy is at hand i feel fog in the air the air is clearer than it has been all day in another three or four hours the sun will have risen we shall be in guernsey in another twenty minutes we shall be outside alderney harbour i was talking matters over some minutes ago with ozanne linda inspected the white hand resting on the bulwark with attention and he has most good naturedly consented to let me and robbie land by signalling promptly for a boat we shall not detain you princess people five minutes there is the dearest little primitive hotel in alderney close to maxwell grimsbys diggings you remember my telling you about it gaston remembered mrs thornes telling him about the dearest little primitive hotel the doctor will have a good nights rest to recruit his strength and to morrow afternoon if the day is warm we shall make our way back to our home and infant by the cherbourg steamer now maxwell grimsby a gunner by profession a painter by love was one of gaston arbuthnots best artist friends best too in the higher acceptation of the elastic word grimsby was no manufacturer of prettiness no amateur idler did not a series of beach studies bearing the well known initials m g testify to the world how diligently this very summers enforced imprisonment in alderney was put to use during the past fortnight gaston had constantly vacillated in his intention of looking up his friend for ever declaring how much better work a man might do on the grand old rock yonder than disturbed by the hundred distractions of pleasant idle sociable little sarnia never starting for ever wishing he were gone here was occasion to his hand a chance of looking up grimsby without even the preliminary trouble of packing ones portmanteau of course you could not come with us asserted linda in her little undertone of mockery mrs arbuthnot is such a child she would conjure up a dozen possible horrors if you were to be absent from her so long i am not sure that deserting the princess would be a courteous action to our hosts said gaston arbuthnot hesitating under the first touch of temptation you are made of poorer stuff than your cousin thought linda glancing for a second at his handsome face to gain a victory over monsieur geoffrey would be to gain a victory indeed then aloud if we were to carry away any of the younger people i should feel it treason to desert the princess she observed i would not go indeed if robbie and i were wanted as chaperons considering the existence of mrs verschoyle and miss tighe in talking of chaperons mr arbuthnot you and i must never forget miss tighe i think doctor and mrs thorne may very well be spared for you it is different in what way asked gaston wincing inwardly under her sarcasms oh different altogether too much depends upon your presence pray do not think of such a revolutionary proceeding as taking flight you would never be allow i mean i am sure you would not find it advantageous to run away what messages do you send to mr grimsby none that is severe you do not believe in my delivering them intact i mean to deliver them myself linda thorne laughed incredulously i wish i could make an enormous wager at this thrilling juncture she remarked with persistence come mr arbuthnot will you bet me a single pair of gloves that you will be that you will quit the princess when we do it would be betting on a certainty said gaston my mind is made up i am really glad of the chance of seeing old max you have told me something of the kind already you refused a wager i offered you last monday afternoon because it would have been betting on a certainty and yet as the event proved i should have won the event will prove that you do not win now there was more than a threat of impatience in gaston arbuthnots voice and you do accept my bet then you do stake a pair of gloves that you are that you will land at alderney with robbie and myself if you are bent upon giving me a pair of gloves mrs thorne iron gray seven and a half i shall accept them with pleasure done the bargain is concluded my number as you know is six and a quarter jouvins best i wear eight buttons and now added linda preparing to move away i must find our hosts and make excuses had i not better offer them on your behalf too you are too kind to me mrs thorne i think i have just courage enough to pull through the emergency unassisted lord rex was still lingering in dinahs neighbourhood when linda tripped airily across to the gangway gaston arbuthnot following her doctor thorne and i have to thank you all for quite one of the most perfect excursions in the world i shall put a mark against the subalterns picnic said linda diplomatically it has been one of the true red letter days of my life dont talk of the picnic as over mrs thorne the subalterns look forward to some hours more of your society even without the promised fog ah that terrible fog i must confess the word makes me nervous for the doctors sake a fog you know means damp that constant bugbear to us old east indians but the voyage is half over here we are almost in alderney harbour and here i am afraid my husband and i ought to bid you all good night captain ozanne has offered to signal for a boat we should not delay the princess five minutes really and truly lord rex i think the wisest course will be for doctor thorne to land doctor thorne to land another mysterious disappearance and shall you mrs thorne immediately follow suit as you did at luc of course i shall the whole luc comedy will be repeated and here lindas voice grew intentionally clear and resonant the luc comedy with the original cast and decorations for everybodys amusement it was a wantonly cruel speech dinah arbuthnot stood within hearing yet linda thornes conscience was void of offence she belonged by temperament to the irresponsible class of mortals who can never resist the temptation of histrionic effect for what save histrionic effect had she cajoled the skipper the old doctor gaston into this freak of midnight disembarkation and when once a womans tongue and actions are ruled by the eternal desire for smart dramatic point it must be clear that other womens sufferings will pay the price of her success dinahs heart froze she divined without going through any distinct process of reason what announcement she was likely to hear next if the luc scene is to be repeated i conclude you too are going to desert us lord rex basire addressed himself to gaston arbuthnot well it has been borne in upon one during the last fortnight that it was a duty to look up old grimsby began gaston and this and this is duty made easy go my dear fellow if you have had enough of us cried lord rex lightly but go on one condition that you do not take mrs arbuthnot mrs arbuthnot is our chaperon in chief we cannot spare her mrs arbuthnot has miss bartrand under her charge have you not dinah i am afraid you could scarcely i should under no circumstances think of landing at alderney said dinah in a voice uncomfortably strange to gastons ear i am not afraid of fog i do not wish to see mr maxwell grimsby why should i leave the princess where your presence is the life of the whole party pleaded lord rex you must not let your husband persuade you into throwing us over mrs arbuthnot quietly firmly came dinahs answer you need not be afraid there is no risk of my being persuaded lord rex i am a great deal too wise she added to go away from people who care to have me and no further word of explanation or of farewell was exchanged between dinah and her husband into the irrevocable mistakes of life is it not singular how men and women constantly drift after this blind automatic fashion only at the last moment when the princess had slackened speed when the boat that had been signalled for was fast approaching from alderney harbour only at this last moment i say gaston addressed a remark to geff which dinah felt might be taken by her if she chose i shall be back to morrow unless anything very unforeseen happens if it does i can telegraph for my portmanteau and geoffrey whispered a word or two in his cousins ear of course of course i have every intention of coming back i merely said if you will have a magnificent passage added gaston shaking hands heartily with lord rex duty takes me to old max inclination would have kept me with my hosts on board the princess despite the neat turning of this speech away mr arbuthnot and the thornes went linda with her cachemires her bouquets of wild flowers her fears for robbie her wafted kisses to her friends creating little theatrical sensations to the last the boat was visible for a few seconds only so swiftly did the princess again get under way there was a profuse waving of handkerchiefs good night every one rang cheerily across the water in gaston arbuthnots voice and then dinah awakened to the knowledge that she was forsaken this time by no accident but of cold blooded determined forethought forsaken with all the world to see with lord rex basire persistently talking as though nothing of moment had happened at her elbow chapter xxxii rose water socialism dinah did not turn from him nay although her brain was in a whirl although her voice was not under command although her heart was bursting dinahs lips smiled she was monosyllabic lord rex felt but monosyllabic with a difference and eager to improve the scantiest most meagre encouragement he began instantly to ransack such memory and imagination as were his for pertinent subject matter frothy small talk personal compliments local gossip were little relished as he had proved by dinah arbuthnot she did not read newspaper trials had never opened a society journal knew nothing about actors or actresses or novels or prime ministers or popular divines you could not get her even to talk about herself but then that face of hers if one might quietly stand gazing at her surpassing fairness as one does at a canvas or a marble lord rex basire on this summer night would have asked nothing more his duties as a host however the sense that others might construe his silence into deficiency of wit forced upon him articulate speech awful hole alderney for an idle man now i was stationed there for three months and got through an awful lot of work no good letting circumstances beat you i coloured a meerschaum first rate worked at it morning noon and night i taught two of my terriers to march on hind legs while i whistled the marseillaise favourite tune of mine the marseillaise so your lordship has told me dinah thought of their first conversation at the rose show i loathe classic music loathe everything in art and literature but what i can understand ever seen maxwell grimsbys alderney sketches by the bye dab of greenish gray for the sea dab of bluish gray for the clouds storms sunsets whirlwinds things you may as well frame upside down as straight if you choose no dinah had never seen them maxwell grimsbys an old friend isnt he of arbuthnots that accounts for your husband throwing over all us people on board the princess to this there was no answer the balls had certainly not broken well as regarded alderney clearing his throat twice after a more redoubtable pause than heretofore lord rex at length sought a wild and sudden refuge in english politics he had never in his life talked politics to a pretty woman reserving his views which were of the rose water socialistic school for after dinner eloquence among his brother subs so desperately new an experience as dinah required desperate measures to talk well above this young persons head thought lord rex who held no mean opinion of his own intellect might awe her into appreciation and the subject he chose for his experiment was that of class inequality the emptiness of all titles the folly of all social preeminence were themes on which lord rex waxed hot exceedingly perhaps he was sincere rose water socialism i must admit did not sit without a certain grace on this sunburnt little dandy a grace to which his slinged arm shot through in the forlorn defence of english empire gave the added zest of piquancy dinah unthawed at once she broke into talk in the matter of class differences gaston arbuthnots wife held fixed opinions and could express them incisively but her ideas were not lord rex basires ideas lord rex had got a vast deal of rabid rhetoric by heart very picturesque rhetoric in its way and coming from the lips of a dukes son dinah had sharp clear knowledge gained at first hand through the vicissitudes of her own marriage to lord rex social inequality was a party question kind of thing dont you know that vehemently taken up may sometimes land a man with a following in the house to dinah it was the hidden enemy the impalpable barrier that stood between her and her husbands heart lord rex had learnt pages of showy axioms to demonstrate that social inequality should never exist dinahs life was one long irrefragable stubborn proof that it existed your remarks have a terribly conservative flavour mrs arbuthnot when they had talked for some considerable time he told her this impossible you can be a conservative in reality gaston calls me an old fashioned whig i dont know the meaning of the word i only pretend to understand these things in the humblest way from my own standpoint but you are in favour of the nationalisation of the land you would do away with the laws of primogeniture you dont think a few thousand loiterers slave drivers should hold big estates for their pheasants because each elder son let him be fool knave or coward is heir to them without such laws where would our english families be my lord our barons and earls and great dukes like your father oh where they came from said lord rex disposing of the question jauntily labour was the original purchase money paid for all things you believe that much at least mrs arbuthnot if the succession law was swept away we might lose more than we can afford along with it dinah had heard ultra revolutionary notions freely aired at times among gastons friends and in her one sided feminine way had striven over her cross stitch to think them out i for one should not like to see any church or chapel in england turned into a lecture place for these new unbelievers unbelievers oh that is quite a different story we began by talking about the folly of class differences dinah was silent awhile then it would be impossible for you and me to think alike on all this she told her companion with a grave smile you have seen so much of the world lord rex perhaps have heard the debates in the houses of parliament lord rex confessed that this intellectual advantage had befallen him and i have just watched the lives the manners of a few more or less troubled men and women class differences as you call them may be folly they are the hardest facts i know the dinah saved herself just in time from adding the cruellest beauty is the universal leveller observed lord rex with presence of mind a perfectly beautiful woman would grace the steps of any throne in europe leave thrones alone lord rex basire if the beautiful woman wanted to make others happy she would have most chance to do so in her own class of life and suppose the beautiful woman wanted to be happy herself mrs arbuthnot happiness comes naturally if you see it on the faces of the people round you their politics had not taken the turn lord rex desired he harked back a little abruptly upon his first premises yes i am for absolute equality gardener adam and his wife and that style of thing i would make the shopkeeping capitalist just as much as the bloated aristocrat turn over a fresh leaf if i ever marry said lord rex basire dont feel at all like marrying at present but if i ever do i hope to get for my wife some simple little village barbarian who has never been to a ball never heard an opera never seen a racecourse in her life a village barbarian of what station asked dinah arbuthnot matter of blank indifference i should marry the girl not her station and afterwards would the barbarian be accepted by your family or would you accept hers or would you both give up society that would suit me best give up society united to the woman one adored said lord rex with fervour what could one want with artificial pleasures with the eternal bore of dinners and dances dinah gave a chill laugh she remembered the days when gaston arbuthnot was wont to use the like phrases as a preface so in her present jealous misery she thought to returning to the world and its pleasures unhampered by a wife when you marry my lord she observed distantly you will if you act wisely choose some dukes or earls daughter for your wife give up that notion of the village barbarian as time wore on and and the truth of things grew clear the dukes daughter would at least understand you there could be no discoveries for her to make lord rex turned and faced dinah arbuthnot good humouredly ignoring the coldness of her bearing towards himself your opinions are desperately mixed mrs arbuthnot you may be conservative in theory you would be a staunch republican in practice i am afraid now that a man with the misfortune i mean you know stammered lord rex lowering his voice that you could never bring yourself to care ever so little for a man with any wretched sort of handle to his name i beg your pardon my lord a man belonging to the most useless class of all the class that so many of us who are in it would gladly see done away with such a man would never find favour in your sight would have found do you mean when i was a girl of seventeen dinah asked in tones of ice i can give no answer to that girls hearts are moved by such trifles a title even might turn the balance but i and my sisters lived in a little devonshire village we saw nothing whatever of high folks and i am not talking of devonshire villages exclaimed lord rex interrupting her hastily but dropping his voice still lower i am not talking of the time when you were seventeen i mean now dinah recoiled from him on the instant idle compliments had moved her at length to an extent lord rex dreamed not of for she could not forget that this was all part of her lesson that her companion was making speeches such as better born women careless mothers wives of the type of linda thorne might just listen lightly to parry and forget with the thought came a thought of gaston a flood of shame tingled in her cheeks you ask me questions beyond my understanding lord rex so after a strong effort of will she brought herself to speak my choice was made happily long ago how could any man but gaston find favour in my sight now lord rex basire his tender years notwithstanding had seen plenty of good feminine acting of the kind which dispenses with footlights and the critics the acting required in the large shifting comedy of human life although his own delicacy was not extreme or his perception sensitive some unspoiled fibre in his heart vibrated responsive to the honesty of dinahs voice this woman acted not could never act her fealty to her light neglectful husband was part of herself duty and happiness for dinah were simply exchangeable terms she could taste of the one only in the fulfilment of the other that was very charmingly expressed mrs arbuthnot i hope when i marry my wife will say the same pretty things of me if i deserve them which i shall not characters like mine dont reform there will be more chance of reformation if you marry than if you dont especially if you choose the dukes daughter added dinah stiffly not the barbarian and without any marrying at all if some woman as good as she is fair would hold out her hand to me in friendship would let me think that i held a place rather lower than a favourite dog or horse would hold in her regard if if ah mrs arbuthnot if you but lord rex speedily discovered that he was apostrophising the waves and the stars at the moment when his eloquence waxed warmest dinah arbuthnot village barbarian that she was had walked away without one syllable of excuse from his lordships side he watched the outlines of her figure as long as they were discernible through the gloom then drawing forth his vesuvians and tobacco pouch prepared to smoke a lonely pipe of wisdom on the bridge lord rex was in a fever of perplexity until the last five days he had never cared for living mortal but himself his brief fealties to the prettiest face of the hour rosie verschoyles among the number had been so many offerings at the shrine of small personal vanity all this was over his surrender to dinahs nobler beauty his recognition of dinahs pure and upright nature had roused him thoroughly out of self made him look searchingly at the aims the pleasures of life and acknowledge that there were human affections human fidelities high above the range of his own light and worldly experience did happiness thrive in that loftier chill atmosphere was gaston arbuthnot to be congratulated wholly on his lot one thing was certain so rex basire decided as he betook himself gloomily to the bridge however this drama of domestic life might end it would be monstrous impossible that he rex basire should be peremptorily dismissed therefrom dismissed as one occasionally sees the frustrated stage villain long before the final falling of the curtain and even if it is so mused lord rex half aloud and drawing upon reminiscences of nap in his ill humour if no choice lies before one but to accept misery misery let it be the man who goes blue does not invariably find himself in the worst position at the end of the game but the lads philosophy was lip deep only lord rex basire had never felt less cynically indifferent to loss and gain than in this hour chapter xxxiii close to port the short june night drew to its close and still the weather continued fair the sky was full of stars a solitary lambent planet quivered in the east by the time the moon had sunk with pale metallic glow above the motionless channel a welcome point of fire was visible over the starboard bow of the vessel the beacon of castle cornet lighthouse a little flutter ran through the groups of expectant people keeping watch together upon the deck of the princess it was well to have got back safely and without fog and still whispered the younger ones regretfully the most delightful picnic in the world had come to an end all too soon even mrs verschoyle emerging with salts bottle with chattering teeth from the cabin conceded that for a yachting expedition and although lancresse common would have been a thousand times more reasonable their misadventures had been few how comforting murmured the poor lady with a shudder if it were not for the cold this curiously increasing cold to keep ones eyes on the familiar harbour light to realise that in another hour and a half at latest they would be all warm and asleep in their beds but the cold increased still and for a midsummer night was undoubtedly no common cold it found its way through plaids and waterproofs it got down throats it caused fingers to become numbed the mate was seen to button up his pilot jacket as he made his way with precipitate haste to the men on watch the skipper moved from one foot to the other as he stood consulting his compass both skipper and mate glanced anxiously ahead towards the west where no horizon showed one would scarcely have expected the stars to set so suddenly observed mrs verschoyle in this ladys youth it is probable that schoolgirls did not as now learn the exact sciences but depend upon it the captain knows his way the sailors are taking precautions i heard the steward say so downstairs by using the lead and i remarked that they were seeing most attentively to the small boats besides i have heard more than one gun fired no sound so reassuring at sea as the report of a gun a skilled old mariner like ozanne would not be dependent on anything so chancy as the stars but mamma the harbour lighthouse has set too cried rosie verschoyle who stood shivering at her mothers side everything is setting i dont see our own funnel i dont see the flower in your bonnet as clearly as i did two minutes ago i wish you would talk soberly child you know how much i dislike this kind of ill timed chaff who ever heard of a lighthouse setting observed mrs verschoyle with melancholy commonsense and why does the princess go so slow the skipper no doubt has his reasons still he might remember we are not all as fond of the sea as he is i was never less nervous in my life and sailor sailor mrs verschoyle flung herself before a figure wrapped up in tarpaulin crowned by a sou wester which loomed with gigantic proportions through the thick air would you say if you please why the steamer goes so slow and are we in danger off our track or anything and why does one seem all at once to lose sight of castle cornet lighthouse the sailor was a weatherbeaten old guernseyman possessing about twelve words of anglo saxon in his vocabulary mrs verschoyle however in her agonised desire for truth stretched her arms forth in the direction of the vanished red light she also articulated the words castle cornet with tolerable distinctness her meaning had made itself clear the answer proceeding from the depths of a gruff tobaccoey throat was incisive brouillard and brouillard it proved clammy ice cold yellow after the manner of all mid channel fogs at first every one affected to take this reverse of fortune as a jest the little bit of mock danger that was needed to point a moral to the preceding days enjoyment so providential said the ladies in pious but quavering chorus that the princess lay close on shore before the fog grew thick the skippers duty clearly was to make straight for st peters harbour and land them only why lose time why steam so slowly what object could captain ozanne have in exposing them to this mortal cold a moment longer than was needful mrs verschoyle after a few minutes suspense voted for independent action she had indeed broached a project of creeping up to the men at the wheel and imploring them to turn faster when there came a general stir among the crew followed by a rattling sound which most of the party had sufficient sea going experience to recognise the princess was about to cast her anchor just at this juncture appeared lord rex fresh from hurried consultations with ozanne and the boatswain a suspicious unconcern was on lord rex basires face a note of forced cheerfulness in his tone lucky we have got so near home is it not mrs verschoyle we are about two miles from shore they say ozanne of course knows every yard of water just within or without the grunes whatever the grunes may mean we shall only have to ride half an hour or so at anchor awfully jolly sensation i can tell you with a south west swell and then as the mist rises we shall steam clean into petersport but this show of jauntiness misled no one the de carterets cassandra tighe marjorie bartrand all understood their position better than did lord rex and it was a position of the utmost gravity the princess was lying in dense fog surrounded by shoals across the very highway of the channel night steamers for an old and wary seaman like ozanne to have been forced to anchor at such a strait did but render the fact of his helplessness more pointed what does it all mean are we not close to port madam the ladies were pressing together in groups dinah whispered the question across cassandra tighes shoulder close to port of one kind or another answered cassandra vaguely unorthodox to the last as long as nothing runs into us we may do well enough and dawn is at hand at sunrise the fog may lift your husband ought to be here with you she added misinterpreting a certain vibration of dinahs voice i thank god that he is not alone there is nothing to be frightened about i thank god that gaston is safe warmly housed away in alderney and in truth a reasonless half pleasurable excitement the reaction after so much dull pain had arisen in dinahs heart that a dark perhaps lay straight and immediately before them became at each moment more plain the continued firing of guns gave token that other vessels were in the same plight as the princess once indeed a steamer drifted so close that they could see the faint reflection of her signal lamps could hear the beating of her gong the dreary sound of the fog horn the muffled tramp of the men on watch the lights burning aloft in the ships rigging the partially lowered boats the solemn faces of the skipper and the crew all combined into one unspoken word danger chapter xxxiv dead rose petals dinah arbuthnot thought over the few quarrels the many misunderstandings of her married life grown little all before the hours largeness she thought how in five or six minutes more a collision in weather like this would be over briefly in five or six minutes more she and gaston might be parted with never another kiss from his lips to hers he would cherish the thought of her to his last breath if she were lost to night she recognised the true metal in the man was sure enough of that possibly the remembrance of her calm and untroubled in her grave might prove a stronger influence over him for good a keener stimulus to his genius than her restless jealous life had ever been on such terms she asked herself was death a thing to be met with craven fear most of the party obeying simple bodily wretchedness crept one after another below poor frightened frozen mrs verschoyle at length confessing that she would sooner be drowned comfortably in the cabin than stand up longer against the sickening roll of the anchored vessel on deck marjorie bartrand dinah and miss tighe lingered lord rex and geoffrey arbuthnot forced into comradeship for once keeping up their spirits with cheerful talk with stories well remembered or well invented until a pale forecast of daylight began slowly uncertainly to filter through the fog then came a new untoward event to crown this night of misfortune a lad on the forecastle had stumbled in the darkness over a coil of chain and a cry quickly arose that the surgeons hand was wanted the poor fellow lay in agony with a twisted or broken ankle was there not some doctor on board among the gentlemen who could help him away sped geoffrey arbuthnot on the instant bestowing no consolatory word marjories heart honoured him for the omission on the ladies thus abandoned to their terrors and their fate and now said old cassandra tighe hollow and far away her voice sounded through the blanket of fog i think we women folk will do well to betake ourselves elsewhere mr geoffrey arbuthnot has set us an example of duty you have been a pattern host she added addressing lord rex and it is right you should be set free we must take our chance with the others in the cabin you hear me marjorie bartrand marjorie heard but was stoutly recalcitrant it was her duty she said to die hard and according to act of parliament she would in no wise give up her chance of the boats should a collision befall the princess could swim like a sea gull if the worst came to the worst lord rex of course must be considered off duty for herself if mrs arbuthnot would stay with her under one of the covered seats she asked nothing better than to stop on deck and watch for sunrise cold how would it be possible to take cold at midsummer swathed too in all these wraps and with the excitement of a first class adventure to maintain the circulation of ones blood and indeed there burned a flame in marjories breast that kept her whole being warm a flame pure and delicate the like of which kindles in these poor hearts of ours once only perhaps between our cradle and our shroud we are dismissed miss tighe said lord rex gallantly offering his unwounded arm as cassandra tottered to her feet cling to me like grim death dont mind appearances if mrs arbuthnot and miss bartrand have the courage to freeze we must leave them to become icicles i want to see what can be done for our poor terrified ladies down below lord rex must have seen to the terrified ladies expeditiously five minutes later he was at his post again no rug no greatcoat about his shoulders with feminine appreciation of detail dinah was prompt to mark this sign of self forgetfulness simply hovering near ready she reluctantly acknowledged to buy her life with his own should the moment of peril really come and gaston arbuthnot all this time was taking his rest quietly irresponsible away in alderney dinah being a just woman did not credit her neglectful husband with the density of the fog still in danger as in safety the master passion possessed her heart her thoughts at one moment tender at the next reproachful were of gaston always and her lips kept silence marjorie bartrand also was disinclined for talk in marjories mind thrilled a remembrance so sweet so new that she was glad passively to rest under it as we rest under the influence of a good and wholesome dream a remembrance of the half confession made to her in the langrune lane whose flower smells and swaying yellow corn lingered in her senses still and thus happiness being a far likelier narcotic than pain it came to pass ere long that while dinah arbuthnot watched with ever increasing vigilance the young girls eyes grew heavy the sound of the fog horn at each interval roused her up less effectually her head dropped upon her companions shoulder your wish has come true although i have the misfortune to be myself not gaston the cold and darkness vanished blessed sunshine began to shine around her the fog horn changed to the note of the cricket among the ripening cornfields marjorie bartrand slept by this time dinah judged the sun must be close upon rising it seemed to her that the different objects on board were growing a very little clearer moving with difficulty from her position she rolled up a pillow out of one of the plaids and slipped it under marjories sleeping head she enveloped the girls whole figure in the thickest of their rugs then began to pace as sharply as her stiffened limbs would allow up and down a short portion of the deck we are not to say ta ta to the wicked world this time mrs arbuthnot the wise remark was lord rex basires he had been absent during the last quarter of an hour and now reappeared bearing a salver on which stood a cup of smoking coffee looking back in after hours on the shifting scenes of this night dinah often felt remorsefully that her most fragrant and excellent coffee was prepared by lord rexs own hand i overheard the steward talking with the mate just now and they prophesy a change of wind if this comes true the fog will lift in half an hour see i have brought you some coffee dinah glanced towards marjorie oh miss bartrand is fast asleep dreaming of triposes and girton i watched her nodding before i went below it would be cruelty to wake her i must say the coffee smells tempting dinah admitted then swayed by quick impulse lord rex you are very unselfish she exclaimed you have thought of nothing but other people and their troubles all this night on the contrary i have thought of myself i have had a capital time mrs arbuthnot for i have been near you dinah never looked more nobly handsome than at this moment a cold night passed without sleep a greenish yellow fog must be fatal adversaries at am to all mere prettiness dinahs beauty could stand alone without colouring without animation the lines of her head and throat the full calm eyelids the lips the chin could be no more shorn of their fair proportions than would those of the venus clytie should the venus clytie chance to be exposed to the mercy of a channel fog you have been near a very stupid person my lord i have had too much heaviness on my heart to talk confessed dinah i have scarce exchanged a dozen words even with miss bartrand mrs arbuthnot have you forgiven me do please drink your coffee before it is cold dont make me feel that i am in your way boring you as usual have you forgiven a horribly foolish speech i made just before you disappeared in the darkness you know which foolish speech asked dinah arbuthnot laconically but innocent of sarcasm ah which i am glad you are good naturedly inexact and still went on lord rex with characteristic straightforwardness foolish or not i meant every word i said if the woman i loved was free would look at me i should be a changed man would make my start in the world to morrow make your start repeated dinah off her guard yes look after sheep in new zealand plant canes or whatever they do plant in south america and feel that with her and for her i was leading a mans life and for a moment dinah arbuthnots pity verged on softness listening to the genuine emotion in rex basires tone glancing at the lad in his thin drenched jacket as he stood holding the salver ready for her coffee cup his devotion by reason perhaps of an unacknowledged contrast touched her for a moment only then she stood self accused filled with a sickening detestation of her own weakness that she was more than indifferent personally to rex basire that he would have been distasteful to her in the days when she was fancy free the girlish days before she first saw gaston extenuated nothing to dinahs sensitive conscience she had tacitly condoned the folly of rex basires talk latent in her heart there must be the same vanity the same small openness to flattery which she had without stint condemned in women like linda thorne was this self knowledge a necessary sequel to the abundantly bitter lessons which the last twenty four hours had taught her do you forgive me mrs arbuthnot speak one word only i should be the most miserable wretch living if i thought i had offended you consciously or unconsciously i have nothing to forgive but the tone was unlike dinahs she herself could detect its artificial ring on the contrary you have done me a service you have given me hot coffee when i was perishing with cold a smile touched her lips and seeing this and led away by her evasive answer lord rex took courage whatever evil luck the future may hold in store he exclaimed i shall have this moment to look back upon just once i shall be able to say on board a channel steamer in a fog the most beautiful of her sex beg pardon sir cried a hearty voice close at hand if you and the young ladyll just step aside from this rope here beg pardon little miss a stalwart rough handed sailor touched marjories shoulder as though he were touching a bird trouble you all to move a bit out of this ladies captains just a going to heave anchor we want a clear passage down the ship and as they moved and while marjorie was still rubbing the sleep from her heavy eyes began one of those gorgeous transformation pageants only to be witnessed in the fog districts of europe through the uncertain twilight a violet streak that might be taken for coast was already visible on the port bow anon to eastward came a glow felt rather than seen by the eager watchers on board the princess a tint of pinkish yellow began to filter through the driving mists then the wind strengthened in another minute an enchantment of solemn flame and amber rose over the distant table land of sark a sensation of warmth tingled in the air the fog wreaths sank as if drawn down by magic hands into the waters and petersport its windows twinkling its red roofs bathed in purest sunshine lay disclosed a quarter of an hour later the princess was in harbour not a carriage not a luggage truck stood on the deserted quays one conveyance only was to be seen cassandra tighes village cart her faithful old factotum annette stood at the ponys head among the smart anglicised young island servants it was the fashion to call annette a little weak headed tears of joy streamed down the honest creatures cheeks symptoms one would say of a strong heart rather than a weak head as cassandra scarlet cloak nets boxes and all crossed the gangway mistress and serving woman kissed each other on the cheeks then arose the question of transport how many souls could one tiny village cart be made to carry mrs verschoyle of course and mrs arbuthnot oh from mrs arbuthnot cried cassandra i will receive no denial millers hotel lies on the way to mrs verschoyles house and we would not for worlds cassandra glanced obliquely at lord rex basire take any of our tired hosts out of their way the young ladies can walk safely home together in a band a case of mutual chaperonage all but marjorie bartrand you marjorie said miss tighe are my bad sixpence i dont know how to get you off my hands lord rex rather faintly suggested that he should conduct miss bartrand to the manoir but marjorie laughed at the idea of wanting an escort i would walk alone from the pier to tintajeux any dark midnight in december and enjoy the walk many thanks lord rex but i prefer my own company i i she hesitated stopped short geoffrey arbuthnot had joined them his patient was going on well would be carried by his mates to the hospital as soon as the hospital doors were opened some two hours hence and i am free added geff just in time i hope miss bartrand to walk out with you to tintajeux oh no mr arbuthnot miss bartrand would prefer her own company cried a quartette of mischievous girls voices in chorus but marjorie had generally the courage of her opinions geff arbuthnot got one glance from beneath a sweep of jetty lashes which told him he was not rejected away started the village cart annette urging the pony to a gallop over the rough guernsey quays in less than ten minutes time dinah had bidden good bye to mrs verschoyle and cassandra and with nerveless touch was pushing back the garden gate of millers hotel mindful of mr and mrs arbuthnots possible return the servants had left unbolted an unconspicuous side door by which gaston usually came in when he was out late through this door dinah entered with weary steps she made her way to her sitting room then drawing up the blind she looked round her almost as one might look who for the first time after a death stands face to face with the familiar objects of his ruined life something had for ever died since she left this room gastons sketch books some of his modelling tools his chalks were scattered on a table a white rose she gave him before they started yesterday lay withered on the window seat dinah took the flower in her hand mechanically its indefinable delicate aroma gastons favourite scent unlocked a thousand poignant associations in the poor girls brain their days of courtship their first married happiness nay her own perfect unswerving loyalty seemed all to have become as falsehood to her she had learnt her lesson over well had eaten of the tree of knowledge would walk in eden at her lovers side no more it was a moment of such blank surrender such total sense of loss as comes but once in a lifetime fortunately the worlds average of hope remains constant poor consolation though an acquaintance with the law may be to the hopeless at this moment rapid steps approached along the pavement there was the sound of hearty youthful laughter looking forth the rose crushed with passion between her hands dinah beheld a young girl and a man pass the window it was marjorie and geff starting away with buoyant pace in the direction of tintajeux a prophecy of all the joint to morrows of their lives shone brightly on the faces of both chapter xxxv a traitress but their speech betrayed them not roseate stage of the passion when unacknowledged lovers are conscious each of the others secret yet talk upon commonplace subjects look celibacy stoutly in the face still if that hour only lasted if the clover would not lose its first honeyed sweetness if the gold would stop on the wheat fields if the thrushes would sing love ditties till september instead of becoming respectable heads of families in june you put forth to sea as a martyr so i will not ask if you have enjoyed yourself mr arbuthnot i have without giving up a prejudice against military folk in general said marjorie bartrand i pronounce the subalterns picnic to have been a success success looked at from whose focus miss bartrand poor jack with his twisted ankle scarcely appreciated the cleverness with which we managed to kill a day and night of our existence depend upon it nor did mrs verschoyle if we had only been drinking tea so i heard her make moan through the fog drinking tea as we used on lancresse common when the colonel was in command miss tighe at least enjoyed herself other conquests may have been made observed geoffrey a little inappositely miss tighe captured a new butterfly a human being with a hobby possesses a joy that all the sorrows and passions of our common nature cannot rob him of but neither mrs verschoyle nor cassandra served to open out wider interests the conversation flagged sensibly and marjories pace quickened for the first time since she began to read with geff marjorie felt that she was at a loss for subjects in talking to her tutor i am afraid your cousin mrs gaston arbuthnot did not take much pleasure out of the day she made the remark after some deliberation and without looking round at geoffreys face it was a mistake for dinah to go geoffrey answered keeping his gaze very straight before him dinahs life is a dull one the kind of bohemian wandering existence which suits gaston as an artist robs his wife of the household tasks in which she could take honest heart if i were not so mortally afraid of you miss bartrand of me i should use a french phrase please do i delight in your command of modern languages i should call dinah desuvre geff you may be sure pronounced the word atrociously but she will never find compensation by frequenting gastons world at this moment poor dinah i know feels heavier in spirit than if she had stayed quietly at home with her book and her cross stitch she is beautiful beyond praise in these regions one gets tired of mere pink and white prettiness it is a thing of the climate every girl in the channel islands has her day of good looks mrs arbuthnots is a face of which you could never grow tired i believe i am no judge of beauty gaston tells me frequently to admire people who to my taste are horrible monsters type rubens i think he calls them it requires an education to admire the type rubens one does not like a face or one does like it too much perhaps for ones own peace geff spoke in a tone that brought the blood into marjories cheeks the girl had blushed with other feelings could she have guessed she who would accept second love from no man that at this moment his thoughts had wandered to a remote cambridgeshire village and to the peace of mind he lost there mrs arbuthnot seems to me so thrown away you must let me speak although i know it is a subject on which you can bear no contradiction so cruelly thrown away upon a man like your cousin gaston no other woman would suit my cousin gaston half as well that is the true mans way of putting things suit gaston would not a less frenchified less universally popular husband suit dinah better i am quite sure dinah who should be a competent judge would answer no miss bartrand broke off geoffrey with notable directness and point i wonder why you and i are discussing other peoples happiness just at an hour when we ought to be thinking about our own the remark was made with geffs usual seriousness but marjorie reading between the lines discerned some obvious joke therein she laughed until the high banked road along which they walked re echoed to her fresh voice then starting at a brisk run she took flight along a foot track which diverging from the chausse led through a couple of breast high cornfields across a corner of the common land to tintajeux untaught daughter of nature though she was marjorie knew that every moment brought the supreme one nearer in which geoffrey arbuthnot must speak to her of love although the conclusion was foregone although her whole girlish fancy was won she strove with such might as she possessed to stave that moment off for she knew that she was a traitress to her cause an apostate from the man despising creed in which recollecting the sins of major tredennis she had gloried fast as her limbs would bear her the girl sped on geff arbuthnot with swinging slow run nicely adjusted to her pace following half a dozen yards behind renegade every bush along the familiar path cried aloud to her renegade whispered the stream trickling down between rushy banks through beds of thick forget me nots to the shore the cornfields were soon passed they reached the breezy bit of moor above the hets the ravine where the water lanes met lay in purple shadow all around was warm and joyous sunshine a scent of fern and wild thyme filled the air far away the tide curled round the dark base of the gros nez range the choughs and daws were flying across the face of the cliffs the gulls poised and swooped flashes of intense white against the background of green sea for very want of breath marjorie presently stopped short geff was at her side in a couple of seconds the young man caught her in his arms mr arbuthnot sir i thought it my duty to steady you he liberated her partially and with reluctance your pace miss bartrand is killing do the guernsey sixties ever play hare and hounds you would make a really respectable hare i can tell you i hope not with a little air of ill maintained stiffness marjorie contrived to put a few more inches between geoffrey and herself who would wish to be anything really respectable until one gets to the age of the seigneur at least we shall both of us be too stiff for hare and hounds by that time perhaps this was the first hour of his life when geoffrey arbuthnot talked nonsense with a childs sense of enjoyment a childs immunity from care hard facts hard work had made up the sum of his existence hitherto his staunchest friends complained that he was just a little too grimly lord of himself in his undergraduate days the men of his year despite their recognition of his muscular and sterling qualities had a suspicion that there lurked a skeleton in some hidden closet of arbuthnot of johns a memory or a dread which rendered the easy philosophy of youth impossible to him dinah who knew him well gaston who knew him better never saw the look on geff arbuthnots strong face which lit it in the red freshness of this guernsey morning how shamefully we lose the best hours of the day marjories hand rested as she spoke on a wicket gate overgrown by sweetbriar which led into the manoir gardens did you ever smell cherry pie so sweet before heliotrope was a passion with old andros bartrand rows of the odorous purple bloom profusely flourishing in this generous climate garnished the borders even of his kitchen garden i for one mean to mend my ways i shall get up with the sun from this day forth alter my hours then we could read together out of doors at sunrise just as well as in the schoolroom at eleven do you think we should do much serious work mr arbuthnot marjorie asked the question with assurance then coloured up to the roots of her hair not unless breakfast were part of the programme said geoffrey with discernment at this moment he added i am reminded of my schoolboy days in the city i recall forcibly the starvation pangs that used to unman us on dreary winter mornings over the pages of our latin grammar and greek delectus it was not a sentimental speech even when treading the primrose path nineteenth century young people are rarely indifferent like the heroic lovers of an older school to their meals and these young people had really eaten nothing since yesterdays dinner in langrune confessing that she too was famished marjorie proposed an instant sack of the tintajeux dairy and larder there was a broken pane in one of the dairy casements through which luck befriending them a bolt might be drawn from the dairy it would be only a step to the larder and then having secured their booty they could go forth and eat their breakfast together in arcadia it is a bigger adventure i can tell you mr arbuthnot than any which befel us on board the princess grandpapa and sylvestre keep loaded carbines and are quite careless as to time and place in the matter of firing their weapons off i am not fond of carbines still hunger overcomes my natural cowardice said geoffrey i would brave sylvestre i would brave the seigneur himself for a bowl of milk the dairy almost hidden from view by thickly planted alders lay at the northern end of the manoir immediately under a window of the old seigneurs study you hold your life in your hand whispered marjorie as they stepped noiselessly along grandpapa is always astir by this hour if he were to look through his window you see he might fire first and recognise you afterwards although you are my accomplice he would be in the right any way according to old norman law what is a seigneur worth if he may not use firearms at discretion we should lodge the accident officially au greffe plead self defence if the case ever came to be heard and pay an amende of a few hundred francs to the island poor she gave a little shrug of her shoulders which expressed that the subject was disposed of satisfactorily the broken pane shrouded in green leaves was conveniently near the casement bolt sufficient space existed for marjories slim hand to pass through the opening there came a click as she slipped the bolt back in its setting a slight groaning sound as geoffrey arbuthnot lifted the sash guardedly then the heiress of tintajeux made good a somewhat undignified entrance into her own house her tutor keeping watch for possible intruders outside oh the ice cool sweetness of this guernsey dairy the air entering in free currents through gratings in either wall the big pans filled with golden cream the butter of yesterdays churning standing in tempting pats upon the fair white shelves marjorie plunged a jug boldly into a pan of milk only set last night it seemed as she remembered suzette the fiery tempered dairymaid like a first plunge into crime conscience however as occurs in weightier matters than pillaging cream hardened rapidly to glide on tiptoe from the dairy to the larder to cut some solid trenches from a new baked raisin loaf intended for the seigneurs lunch table was a minutes work then miss bartrand handed out her spoils to geoffrey arbuthnot she cleared the window at a jump the sash was stealthily closed the boughs were pulled back into place and away the pair walked across the cedar shadowed lawn through the cool and dewy maze to arcadia chapter xxxvi the last of arcadia never could the spot have justified its name more thoroughly than at this hour the syringa bloom had fallen during the past week no odour save the delicate intangible freshness of sea and moor met the sense there was not a wrinkle on the far atlantic not a cloud in the arch of sky they chose a plot of grass for their breakfast table so small of dimensions it was not possible to sit far apart they had their platter of cake their jug of milk in common surely no shepherd or shepherdess in real arcadia was ever lighter of spirits than were these two i have learned the taste of nectar said geff when the wedges of cake had vanished when the milk jug stood empty in repayment of your hospitality miss bartrand i am going to bring a sharp accusation against you which is marjorie asked her blue eyes meeting his with steadiness the nectar you give may perhaps be poisoned an enchanted philtre taking the taste out of all ones future life i should call that a cruel an unjust accusation cried the girl her cheeks ablaze explain yourself i dont like a thing of this kind said even in jest i was never farther from jesting poison is a harsh word certainly still still broke off geoffrey with the abrupt courage of a shy wooer do you think a man could ever be as well contented with the grayness and plainness of english life after an hour spent here in arcadia at your side her face grew graver and graver if you mean this for nonsense talk mr arbuthnot you offend me i do not care for flattery marjorie bartrand rose to her feet as geoffrey followed her example he took out his watch then replaced it in his pocket without noticing the hour both were a little pale both had grown suddenly constrained an unaccustomed mist made the familiar objects round her seem blurred in marjories sight i must go back to the house she faltered the servants will have risen by this time of course one ought to feel tired and to want rest she stooped under pretence of picking up the platter and jug in reality to hide her face from the man who loved her but her fingers were unsteady an instant more jug and platter both were slipping from her grasp when geff quick of eye and touch caught them and marjories hand as well she did not say again that nonsense talk offended her i should like you to understand one thing mr arbuthnot it was a good while later on when she told geoffrey this her slight hands rested unresistingly in his the unmistakable print of love confessed was on the faces of both perhaps what i am going to say will make you alter your opinion of me it must be said all the same there shall be no bluebeard secrets between us to come to light hereafter there was a fortnights mistake in my life once i i the word seemed to scorch her lips as they passed them have been engaged before so the voice of gossip told me long ago miss bartrand in an instant marjorie rested her cheek with a childs rather than a womans gesture against geoffreys arm you ought not to say miss bartrand now from this day until death comes between us i must be marjorie to you marjorie repeated geff with quick obedience what concern of mine is it that you were engaged before you knew me i dare say i shall be an ogre of jealousy in the future i cannot be jealous retrospectively the evil passion will date from this present hour only but marjorie insisted whatever pain it cost her on giving him the details of her first engagement yes even to the ring she accepted to the tears she shed over jock the setter puppy and would geoffrey have felt no concern she asked him with a flush in conclusion had things been different could he have felt no retrospective jealousy if she had happened to care for major tredennis i like to think you did not care for him i like supremely to know you care for me was geoffreys answer because of course no human being can honestly love twice observed marjorie bartrand with conviction it must be all or nothing i wish you to know although i was weak enough to be engaged to major tredennis and to take his presents and to listen to his french songs it was nothing i could not look into your face as i am looking now if i had cared the value of an old glove for him or for any man no human being can honestly love twice so this was a fixed article in marjorie bartrands belief the reflection made geoffrey pause of the beliefs fallacy his own state of feeling was pertinent evidence four years ago he had loved dinah thurston with love as ardent as was ever lavished by man on woman and now this wayward southern child with her terrible classics and worse euclid this child with the deep sweet eyes that promised so much for the future and the chiselled sun kissed hands and the mouth and the hair had filled his heart to overflowing a certain tacit disingenuousness seemed forced upon him that prettily told episode of her first engagement of the majors french songs his presents and his flatteries was in absolute truth a challenge but geoffreys conscience smote him not as he let the challenge pass his passion for dinah was no fortnights mistake it was a part of himself in losing her he got a wound that he must carry with him to the grave he could no more have touched upon the theme lightly than he could have spoken lightly of his dead mother or of the childish prayers he used to repeat in the shelter of that mothers arms the girl he sought as his wife was exquisitely fresh and to be desired already in a brief half hour every hope of his future life seemed to have some silken thread of marjorie woven in its fabric she was unconnected with his past the passion that had died the regret that would never die were his own their history was not to be told save under dire necessity of which the present rose coloured moment gave no forewarning i knew from the first that you had been engaged to major tredennis and from the first geoffrey arbuthnot drew her towards him tenderly i began to fall in love with you not quite from the first marjorie questioned artfully ensuring a repetition of the honeyed truth not on that evening when you put me through my intellectual paces when you told me that my classics save the mark were stronger than my mathematics yes on that first evening it was not because of your prettiness only or your grace it was not even because you snubbed me so mercilessly i dont know why it was it seemed that a new world had suddenly opened out before me as i returned along the gros nez cliffs the tintajeux roses and heliotropes in my hand i felt like walking right above the mire and commonness of my former life and your thoughts were of tintajeux every yard of the road yes i am clear about it said geff i began to fall in love from the first moment that i saw your sweet spanish face marjorie shook her head at the compliment her looks were sceptical your manner i confess did not betray you mr arbuthnot she remarked drily did you condescend to notice my manner geff asked the whole of that evening remember except perhaps for a minute when you had wounded yourself among the briars you held me at arms length i thought you a married man sir but i liked i respected you brusque though you were because i believed you had had the courage of your opinions the strength of mind to marry dinah how strange she went on dreamily abandoning herself to his caress how strange it will be when we are old people to remember that our acquaintance began in such a comedy of mistakes because he had had the strength of mind to marry dinah the unconscious irony of her speech smote geff arbuthnots heart he had been credited then as a virtue with the fulfilment of that mad hope whose frustration took the keenest edge off his life the intoxication out of his youth one builds up an ideal foolishly or wisely went on marjories happy voice i had built up mine since i was eight years old well when i heard of a mr arbuthnot who was able enough to have taken high honours good enough to give up his time to others brave enough to have married a girl beneath himself in class for the excellent reason that he loved her when i heard these things the personal histories of the arbuthnot cousins cleverly mixed and transposed by poor cassandra i felt that my ideal was clothed with flesh and blood what could i do but care a little for my new tutor married though the tutor was that is beside the question i was thinking of his fine qualities only i held out my hand to him in friendship before we met even and i i know that i was never for one instant in love with mr gaston arbuthnot marjorie bartrand coloured with slightly illogical vexation are you quite sure that you are in love at all asked geoffrey for a few seconds an uncertain smile trembled round her lips she drew back from him half ignorant whether his question had been asked in earnest then lifting her eyes marjorie encountered the beseeching entreaty written on geoffreys face there came impulsive over quick submission i mean to love you with my whole soul some day does not that content you well then i mean if you will give me breathing space to love you now the midsummer morning was young the blackbirds called aloud for joy in the tintajeux orchards and geoffrey arbuthnots age was twenty four before they parted ere marjorie could repulse him or surrender he caught the girl in a swift embrace he kissed her reverently passionately on the lips chapter xxxvii a stone for bread the kiss cost him dear a fledgling girl is not finally to be captured without a struggle save by a master hand and geoffreys was the hand of a prentice marjories heart leaped with novel tenderness at the contact of his lips she suffered him to hold her in his arms she watched him with shy pride with a childs delight in the new sense of ownership as he walked away along the accustomed path from tintajeux then later when she found herself in her own little white draped realm when later still she had slept and awakened and dressed herself for a fresh day the current of feeling swerved she shivered at realising how absolutely her life had become entangled with his she was assailed by reminiscences all uncomfortable ones of major tredennis she was sensible of a longing that had almost passion in it for the liberty she had been betrayed into relinquishing i mean if you will give me breathing space to love you now here surely was what she needed time for becoming used to the new phenomenon of a lover during the past fortnight geoffrey had filled every thought of her waking hours a haunting sense of his nearness had touched her dreams at this point she had fain stood still six months a year tacitly engaged if need be but on the same fraternal footing as when they walked together yesterday among the langrune cornfields why hurry into commonplace the bartrands were not a kissing race geff ought to have divined their likes and dislikes thought the poor child petulantly and yet pleaded another voice in this conscience of seventeen the kiss was sweet it seemed that she had become suddenly and distinctly two persons one a girl weakly contented as our grandmothers used to be at the prospect of husband and home and fireside the other a strong headed minerva like young woman coolly criticising the question of love and marriage from a vantage ground and liking it ill which of the two she asked herself this pretty often throughout the sunny tedium of the long day which was the real which the artificial marjorie bartrand it had been settled between them that geoffrey should walk out to tintajeux before the seigneurs supper hour that evening when the time came when geff approached the manoir treading lightly as befits a man whose heart wells over with hope he found the friendly schoolroom window bolted no youthful flitting figure was to be seen among the growing shadows of the garden arcadia was empty andros bartrand leisurely pacing a cigar between his lips his terriers at his heels possessed the lawn with a dim sensation of chill geoffrey rang at the front door and was ushered in by sylvestre a whole lever de rideau in the old butlers expressive norman smile to the drawing room here marjorie mutinous of spirit but with a tenderly blushing face awaited him the western lights filtered through the half closed venetians above the cedar shade gleamed as unstained a sweep of atlantic as on the first evening that geoffrey visited tintajeux the petit trianon baskets were filled with glorious ducs de rohan the cupids were hurling rose leaves at the guillotine the miniature bartrands imperturbable as becomes mortals who have proved the nothingness of love as of life seemed to glance with rather more philosophic amiability than usual from their frames well all that geoffrey saw or thought of was marjorie she looked prettier than he had ever seen her look as she moved forward to greet him softer more womanly for the girl while she chafed in imagination under her new yoke had spent a good hour before her glass ere her lover came she had put on her one white dress of regulation length had clasped an old fashioned spanish necklace round her throat had pinned a little bunch of heliotrope and sweetbriar mindful of the mornings dominant odours in her breast a sense of his immense good fortune in having won her filled geoffrey arbuthnots heart he took both her hands looking down at their slender carving with the connoisseurship of possession he raised them within an inch of his lips i hope mr arbuthnot you will pardon me for receiving you here marjorie asked him this with forced composure but i thought i was not sure whether we were to read to night or not geoffrey arbuthnot involuntarily drew back the glance which met him from his new sweethearts eyes was he felt cold during an instants space mastered by one of those shadowy infidelities of which we repent ere they take substance geff bethought him of eyes that never could look cold in happiness or in trouble english coloured eyes from which perhaps the fire the mind of marjories sapphire glance were wanting i thought she went on with almost defiant ease that after yesterdays idleness our reading to night must be a sham so it would be unnecessary to see you in the schoolroom i can guess what that means said geoffrey without letting loose her hands you have no work ready for me i have done some virgil fuller i know of faults than ever but i thought for one evening sir we might let greek and latin go why not let them go for ever as things that have had their use cried geoffrey arbuthnot as things that have had their use are you speaking of my classics you who told me a fortnight ago i might come out in the third class of a tripos a fortnight ago is not to day your good opinion has had time to cool pray be frank mr arbuthnot it was in her mood to quarrel at least to reach the brink of a quarrel with him if twere only for sweet relentings sake i dont one bit come up to your ideal of a model woman i abhor models irrespective of their sex marjorie why are we talking in this strain and now her fingers reached his lips i want you to be like nothing to be nothing but yourself and i myself shall never alter i may be too dull witted to pass the entrance examination for girton that will be my misfortune i shall always be athirst for knowing things for seeing life on its seamy side especially with my own eyes for getting to the real worst of everything and i shall always added marjorie with a look that indubitably had in it the nature of a challenge retain my bartrand temper i have a temper also answered geff drawing her a little closer to him do not omit that item from our prospects of future joy you are passionate i am unforgetting stormy elements these to be brought into daily hourly contact under the same roof and has your ideal of life always been one of conflict asked marjorie at the domestic picture quietly touched in by geoffrey the lines of her lips had softened against her will i have had no experience save in conflict answered geff arbuthnot truthfully when you were a really young man four or five years ago did you look forward to the taming of a shrew as a likely sequel to your term of happy bachelorhood the question was jestingly meant lightly spoken but geoffreys dark cheek reddened oh if i have said anything indiscreet forgive me marjorie watched him with attention you must grow used remember to the faults of my fine qualities one of these is inquisitiveness it would delight me to know precisely what you used to think and feel when you were twenty years old i suppose you were not so preternaturally wise always as you are now i have never been wise at any period of my life said geoffrey arbuthnot but when you were nineteen say what did you think what did you hope what did you look forward to what i hoped what i looked forward to was madness the unguarded answer broke from him instantly if you would be kind to me marjorie he added let the past rest there is enough a great deal more than enough to be grateful for in the present marjorie on this drew herself to her full height she looked at him with the instinct of a child who would unriddle a secret by his own close reading of anothers face she freed her hands abruptly from his clasp what you hoped what you looked forward to was madness do you mean in regard of university laurels we are not talking of university laurels we are talking said geff honestly of the happiness beyond happiness the companionship for life of two human souls that suit each other and your hopes of these things her lips whitened as she repeated the words were madness singular contradiction you have told me that yours has been a secluded students life that until a fortnight ago you never cared for any society but that of men whatever i have told you has been true said geff with firmness then instantly relenting do not let us have a quarrel he pleaded on this first day that we are sweethearts she turned from him indignant breathless if we quarrel over realities mr arbuthnot the pity is we did not look realities in the face before becoming sweethearts miss bartrand marjorie oh i am thoroughly in earnest this morning when first i knew you cared for me a little i was open with you i told you what had to be said about major tredennis and you forgave me bluebeard secrets bad always must be doubly so between people who mean to spend their lives together i told you of my miserable weakness her frank girlish face burned so hotly that geff came to her relief you were very open with me marjorie true and straightforward as it is your nature to be i did not hide from you whatever the shame of it that i had bound myself once before geoffrey was no social diplomatist he might otherwise with mournful veracity have retorted that he had been a free man always but the statement would have implied a prevarication and it was not in geoffrey arbuthnots upright soul to prevaricate you told me you had been engaged you also gave an opinion as to its being impossible for people honestly to love twice most certainly i did i never cared more for major tredennis than i do for this flower i wear ask mrs arbuthnot i found courage yesterday to talk to her about that wretched time and i do care for you looking straight from her heart at her lover and it is utterly impossible for any woman or any man to love twice you think so i ought to have disagreed with you at once struck in geff promptly i ought to have told you this morning what i hold to be truth and this is that women and men may love a second time honestly although once only with success she turned away doubtfully with lowered lids hesitating a few moments then love twice and why not love three four five times she questioned looking up at him with a glance of fire why hold at all by constancy or honour or good faith what mystic limitation is there in the number two a woman troubled is heavens fairest work spoiled geoffrey believed as devoutly as do most men in the aphorism but marjorie was not a woman he remembered only an impetuous girl with southern blood in her veins with the bartrand pride on her lips with all sweet and modest and maidenly superstitions in her heart he felt he had never loved her more dearly than in this very outburst of unreasoning childish wrath against himself i know nothing about three four or five times you persisted recollect in making me talk of an uninteresting subject my own past life and and am i to think are you putting me to the humiliation now too late she exclaimed the thought of his kiss returning to her the humiliation of feeling here under my grandfathers roof that i am offered your love at second hand a few instants ago geoffreys impulse had been to take her in his arms to forgive her in spite of her injustice but her tone had changed it was hard suspicious it bespoke pride not only of race but of money all the inherited baser possibilities of her nature had under the moments white anger gained the ascendancy in poor marjories breast geff was sensible of them and recoiled for the first time to day it occurred to him that the girl he sought to marry was not only a bartrand but an heiress his superior in position as in purse i dont like to hear you say humiliation such love as i feel for you confessed geoffrey arbuthnot nobly and simply could humiliate no woman and if it comes at second hand if some one else before my time has appraised its value and flung it aside miss bartrand you must explain to me what you mean by that question i mean flamed forth marjorie her whole angry soul throbbing in her voice that i must be first first mr arbuthnot in the heart of the man i marry would you not be first in mine i should give him all i could accept nothing short of all in return if afterwards i found that i had been deceived you understand me if i knew that i had been chosen from other motives than love i should make his life and my own most miserable and indeed the passion of her voice and face gave to the prophecy only too much an air of certitude geoffrey arbuthnot walked to a neighbouring window pushing back the half closed shutters he saw before him a wide expanse of the manoir gardens through an arch of cedar boughs he caught a goodly vista of fields and orchards beyond and all that he looked upon would one day be marjories with crushing force came the conviction that he had fallen into a desperate error had walked blindfolded a second time into a fools paradise marjorie bartrands youth the intimacy into which they had been thrown his own absolute want of premeditation might be excused the facts were there looking as disagreeable facts have a knack of doing with transparent clearness in his face he had walked into a fools paradise to accept the position give marjorie bartrand back her freedom unconditionally were the moments immediate and exceeding bitter duties the wilful hot headed child of seventeen conquered at one moment at the next resisting repented her already of her bargain let that bargain be cancelled your life shall never become miserable through fault of mine miss bartrand turning round geff looked at her gravely pardon me whatever foolish words i spoke this morning in a week or two forget my existence you are bound to me by no promise and it costs you nothing to give me up you can talk of forgetting in this airy fashion interrupted marjorie with vehement recollection of her own surrender then you never sought me from liking i have had a second experience of the same cruel story the acres of tintajeux few though they be are matters it seems better worth caring for than marjorie bartrand herself from her cradle to her grave it would be safe to aver that speech so ignoble never issued from marjorie bartrands lips she recognised its meanness before the last word was spoken her cheeks crimsoned she could have flung herself at the feet of the lover her suspicion had dishonoured i was wrong forgive me for speaking like this she began to stammer brokenly but geoffrey arbuthnot could not condone a paltry accusation even from her with two strides he reached the girls chair he stood before her pale and strongly moved she hardly recognised the expression of his face and so you think that i with the full use of my muscles and brain sought to marry you for moneys sake the poor little handful of money that goes with tintajeux manoir the slight to my intelligence is severe had i been a fortune hunter miss bartrand i should have struck for a larger stake then why did you look at me why did you not let me go my way she clasped her hands together piteously for you have never loved me you confessed as much just now did i i can only remember a confession in which i spoke the truth a confession you believed this morning added geoffrey with as much steadiness as he could muster all this is waste of time she said with a miserable little laugh we have the habit of plain speaking you and i let us keep it up to the last your heart is not your own mr arbuthnot you have liked some other person better than you like me have liked did i say you like her i doubt not to this day this day when i have asked you wisely or unwisely to be my wife if your conscience were clear you could not trifle with me like this you would say no or yes and thus urged geoffrey arbuthnot said yes with unmitigated frankness without a hint either at penitence or remorse long ago in his undergraduate days thus the confession ran he had fallen in love possibly as men do not fall in love twice during their lives he was rough plain a student as marjorie saw him now no suitor to win a young girls fancy and so and so broke in marjorie with trembling interest she was false to you she was neither false nor true he answered i had no place at all in her heart my own best friend and here geffs voice sank each word of his avowal seemed wrung from him with pain became unconsciously my rival your best friend stammered marjorie upon whom a first flicker of light was beginning to dawn best then and i hope for ever just as she whom he married will i know be my ideal of all sweet and womanly qualities till i die although i lost her exclaimed geff arbuthnot i owe her everything it is using a commonplace to say that i would at any hour start to the other side of the world if by so starting i could confer on her the smallest service but it is the truth he was a man ordinarily of demeanour so reticent of emotions so controlled that this little outburst struck on marjorie bartrand with double force alas there could not be room for another instants doubt she recalled the morning when she had lectured her tutor on his frivolity she remembered his embarrassment when she spoke of dinah as his wife his absence of mind his pallor the story of his past life was laid open a clear page for her to read the confession of her engagement to major tredennis had met with an over full equivalent at last then she murmured i have got to the truth of things it might have been juster if i had not been deceived so long will you hear me out to the end there was a ring of command rather than of pleading in geoffreys tone four years ago it was my fate i can never say my misfortune to come across a girl whom it was madness for me to love i lost i suffered but many a man has met with a like overthrow and got firmly to his feet in time i am very firm on my feet said geff arbuthnot i have grown young again in knowing you if you had chosen to become my wife i could have loved you well yes i do love you too well now when it seems we are like bidding good bye for ever and geoffrey rested his hands for an instant upon the girls graceful down bent head and the dream is over over she repeated the words huskily not so much thinking of geff as seeking to bring home to herself the extremity of her own pain we are to be nothing to each other from this hour forth not even friends geoffrey arbuthnot walked a few steps away the movement was prompted by a definite and conscious weakness this saying good bye for ever was no easy thing he found so long as his hand rested upon the silken hair so long as the slender figure palpitated close to him the heliotrope sent its odour to his brain from marjories breast the dream is over because you discovered it to be a dream you must acknowledge miss bartrand that you have taken the matter wholly out of my keeping we might see each other as friends she stammered true to a time worn instinct of her sex offering a stone for bread friendship to the man she loved and who loved her surely our work need not be dropped because of this i as long as you stay in the island you will come out to read with me at tintajeux i shall return to tintajeux once more after to night was geff arbuthnots answer i shall return to shake hands with the seigneur and to be paid my money good bye for ever are hard words to speak he went on but we shall not make the hardness easier by trying to shirk them we have virtually said good bye already and we are never to be nearer reconciliation than this you are not a man to change there came a furtive play of feeling upon her mouth deep in her heart lurked a formless hope that geoffrey was not in earnest that at a smile a touch of hers he must yield if she so willed it i am a man he answered to change upon the day you bid me do so if at some future time you think less vile things of me mr arbuthnot well or without that if it should be your whim in some idle hour to remember my existence dare i say to send me a flower you have worn a bit of ribbon a sheet of paper with a single relenting word written on it you will have only to address your envelope to st johns cambridge and now for the remainder of this summer asked marjorie drear visions rising before her of a silent schoolroom of work laboured through without the poignant desire of geoffreys praise is it possible that you mean that you have no other course than to leave guernsey at once something in her manner made it seem that she referred their quarrel to him for final arbitration but geff arbuthnot tried his utmost to congeal his present temper indisposed him for compromise he had been cut to the quick by that one scornful imputation that one base utterance of marjories lips the acres of tintajeux few though they be are matters better worth caring for than marjorie bartrand herself he felt it impossible to forgive her i shall certainly not leave guernsey without calling on the seigneur to be paid geoffrey was not superior to a feeling of pleasure in the repetition of these words they were horribly cruel ones it might well be afterwards that he remembered with remorse how the girls slender figure drooped how her cheeks burned how her hands fell listlessly upon her knee one in the others palm and then for the rest of the vacation what are your plans she repeated presently i have no plans now the summer has gone out of my year maybe i shall follow in the footsteps of gaston and his wife dinah i know would not be sorry to leave this place he spoke without premeditation it had perhaps not occurred to geff arbuthnots coarser masculine perception that his meagre outline of the past had revealed a secret of which dinah was herself ignorant to marjorie in her despair the mention of dinahs name was a last blow the heavier perhaps in that geoffrey gave it with such calmness was prepared as a matter of course to seek refuge in the friendship of the fair and gentle woman to whom although she had never loved him he owed everything or i may cross at once to england that is likeliest in england one can always fall back on work i have had enough of idleness a boat calls here on sunday morning that will suit me well enough on saturday then grandpapa and i will look for your visit could you not suggested marjorie with magnanimity ask mr and mrs gaston arbuthnot to come with you to tintajeux geoffrey had a moments hesitation there was a note in her fresh and youthful voice which he had never before distinguished and which i think wrung his heart but he would not allow himself to soften he would not forgive her until she repented her of the thing which she had uttered gaston has not returned miss bartrand there are heavy fog banks still at sea the cherbourg boat was not signalled when i left town and dinah well dinah of course will be miserable until she sees her husbands face geff took up his hat in readiness for departure and marjorie rose from her chair the cherbourg boat will be back before saturday but in any case grandpapa and i will count upon seeing you good night mr arbuthnot this is not your last visit to tintajeux i do not acknowledge that we are saying good bye for ever she kept herself under singular control for a second or two she yielded her cold hand bravely into geffs keeping as he left the drawing room she accorded him a lofty minuet de la cour curtsey learnt in her babyhood from her first french governess then when he was gone when the figure she had watched so often had rounded the last turning in the tintajeux avenue the poor child with leaden steps made her way to the schoolroom sinking in her place beside the ink stained table marjorie bartrand rested her face upon a heap of books then burst into a very thunder shower of tears her scene with geoffrey had swept away all sense of the dual personality that troubled her before his coming the strong minded minerva criticising love and marriage with acerbity had vanished and in her place was a commonplace little girl sobbing her heart out as rosie verschoyle as ada de carteret might have done for the sweetheart her own unruly tongue had estranged if geoffrey would but come back take her in his arms kiss and forgive her so dumbly cried marjories heart but supper time came and went the sun dipped under the fading sea line the twilight waned the yellow stars stole forth one by one from the gray geoffrey arbuthnot returned not she had acted with family pride perhaps from virtue conceivably from jealousy without doubt as became a bartrand these cold consolations were all that the universe just at present seemed likely to offer chapter xxxviii temptation when the cherbourg boat reached guernsey twenty four hours behind her time no dinah with radiant expectant face waited on the quay to bid gaston arbuthnot good morning it was the first occasion since their marriage that she had in like manner failed after ever so short a separation it was dinahs habit to go bravely to the fore on harbour side or platform with a welcome for the husband she loved no dinah was to be seen this morning and gaston arbuthnots spirit sat more lightly on its throne by reason of her absence he was honestly glad to return a day and a nights detention on a rock with a thick sea fog and without ones dressing case was a test of sentiment and of friendship alike which gaston had felt to be beyond his strength but it was a relief to him that poor dinah effusive reproachful dinah half sunshine half tears should not be on the pier to enact a little scene of domestic interest beneath the sharp uncomprehending eyes of linda thorne useless to ask you to breakfast with us murmured that lady from beneath her treble gauze mask as she and gaston were passing across the gangway dear mrs arbuthnot i am sure will be in a fever of anxiety about your return scarcely every one in guernsey must have known that fog detained us if you will be at home this afternoon gaston added when their hands met at parting i will give you the latest bulletin as to dinahs condition oh i make no promises cried linda carelessly he who will not when he may you know the rest of the proverb long before five oclock to day some tragic event may have changed us in after times this prophecy made in jest might possibly return to linda thornes memory changed us for ever into enemies robbie love accept my arm as you are quite determined that two shillings worth of cab would bring us to bankruptcy we will return to our home and infant on foot doctor and mrs thorne turned on leaving the quay into a narrow street leading towards the old town and the bungalow gaston arbuthnot with the lightheartedness born of recovered freedom ran quickly up the hundred and eighty steps that formed the shortest cut from the pier road to millers hotel at the summit of these steps a new temptation assailed him in the person of old colonel de gourmet the bachelor proprietor of the most luxurious little house the best cellar and the best cook in the channel archipelago why arbuthnot some one told me you were at the bottom of the sea you and linda thorne locksley hall sort of thing so goes the story of the moment you are the very man i could have wished to meet sir come back to breakfast with me i have two of the finest mullet ever caught in this channel and kutscheel my black fellow could dress a mullet with brillat savarin himself now ill hear of no refusal i have a wife colonel the argument naturally does not carry weight with you still it is an argument i have a wife and she expects me send up a line from my house telling mrs arbuthnot where you are i positively wouldnt waste such fish on a man of less cultivated taste in the colonels lack lustre eye there came a momentary glow of feeling in my time we used to look upon a palate a palate sir as one of the essentials of a gentleman the young men nowadays dont know a mullet from a stickleback well reader a dual breakfast with old de gourmet was a temptation after its sort that gaston arbuthnot ranked high the colonels admirably arranged house was screened by just sufficient leafy shadow from the eastern sun refreshed by just sufficient air on the side where it opened to the sea the colonels black fellow was a finished artist his cellar the long result of half a lifetime to gaston true parisian in all the more important business of existence a noontide breakfast was the crowning meal of the day man dines he would contend as dogs or horses feed because his body needs replenishment breakfast with its delicate light dishes fine wine fruits and coffee breakfast succeeded by a prime cigar morning sunshine and morning talk is essentially a refined a human repast the nine oclock tea and toast the marmalade bloaters or bacon sacred to the british householder were scarcely less horrible to him than the buckwheat cakes and maple syrup the porridge the pie the shad of american breakfast tables if you can give me half an hours law colonel de gourmet time to have a bath to get a change of apparel and hear my wifes version of the locksley hall episode i will come to you otherwise i know the nature of mullet and i appreciate your delicacy my dear sir but my black fellow and i thoroughly understand each other those mullet said the colonel with a quiver of the lips are now reposing each in its paper shroud buttered flavoured to a nicety they will not approach the fire until kutscheel sees me turn yonder corner beneath the arsenal gates i will wait for you here putting the last finishing touch alas to a poorish appetite as i limp up and down in the shade but dont exceed thirty five minutes we owe it to our cook a human being with passions and weaknesses like unto our own to have a conscience in these matters a minute or two later gastons alert step had brought him to the outer gate of millers hotel he loitered for a few seconds in the garden enjoying its double sensation of warmth and flower scents then with hesitation for which he would have found it hard to account gaston arbuthnot entered the house he traversed a passage and opened the door of dinahs sitting room it was empty her work frame was shrouded in silver paper a bouquet of hot house flowers lay with petals browned and faded on the table a card of lord rex basires beside them gaston felt that the room had not been lived in since they left it last on wednesday morning madame had gone out volunteered the black eyed french waitress peeping in at him through the half open door the black eyed waitress building up dramatic likelihoods on the spot possibly from the recollection of madames tears of yesterday possibly from milors neglected bouquet on the table possibly from a certain blank look on arbuthnots face madame had gone out there was a good hour at least madame had left no message for monsieur for the first time since their marriage thought gaston arbuthnot not without a pang as he walked off in silence to his dressing room well there must be a first time he supposed in all ones disillusionments from to day forth he need never more expect a passionate greeting perhaps never dread a passionate reproach from dinah and it was best so gaston had seen clesingers rival statues of rachel one the phdre the other lesbia with her sparrow he infinitely preferred the lesbia sparrow silliness and all still mused mr arbuthnot whose emotions had a trick of mounting quickly from the heart to the head it might be a little stroke of wise and kindly diplomacy for him to exhibit discerning mortification make dinah feel that she had been forgetful of him forgetful for the first time surely since that morning in the rustic cambridgeshire church when she walked down the aisle in her white straw bonnet her simple cambric gown his wife accordingly when he re entered their sitting room presently dinah absent still mr arbuthnot pencilled the following note curtly amative as was ever one of captain steeles to his prue my dearest girl my existence i perceive has slipped your memory but i do exist i am at this moment going out to breakfast not in high spirits your devoted g a gaston arbuthnot pencilled this note then with affections it must be confessed undividedly centred on red mullet he started off lightsome of mien elastic of step in the direction of colonel de gourmets house at the first turning of the road a girl with golden hair with a face fair despite its pallor as the summer morning stood opposite to him dinah a basket of strawberries hung on mrs arbuthnots arm a bunch of white moss roses her husbands favourite flower was between her hands dinah my love this is fortunate i have been hunting everywhere for you said gaston hitting without effort upon one of those airy little nothings which float men of his weight like corks over half the whirlpools of life i am glad in spite of all that has happened to see you back and dinah who had never uttered an airy nothing since she was born looked hard at him traces unmistakable of tear shedding gave an expression gaston arbuthnot liked not to her eyes yet you did not show your gladness by meeting me on the pier grim and dirty objects we must all have been after our twenty four hours discomfort perhaps i deserved to be neglected said gaston in a tone of resignation but remember darling i am not accustomed to miss your face when i have been away the punishment coming immediately after a course of alderney and fog struck me as rough dont talk of punishment dinah answered her voice betraying the strong effort by which she kept it controlled your staying away has been hard to bear and now now i wish to forget everything but that you are back safe and what did you do with your time yesterday of course you were not anxious you knew that fog and fog alone was keeping me in alderney yesterday was the blackest day i have ever lived through and dinah lifted her face courting rather than turning from her husbands scrutiny blackest why i thought you had had sunshine in guernsey that the fog concentrated itself with vile partiality upon our horrible rock yonder and what did you do with your time then went on gaston with unabated cheerfulness where was geoffrey i did not think of geoffrey i had heart for nothing but to stay in my own room substituting tea for dinner close air for oxygen as woman loves to do when she is in trouble or has manufactured trouble for herself and had you no visitors at all to lighten your darkness lord rex basire seems to have called his card was lying this morning on the parlour table and you have no wider sympathies dinah no desire to know how we miserable deserters got along in alderney i like of course to hear everything that concerns you dinah accentuated the pronoun stoutly although you had not sufficient curiosity to meet me when i landed as gaston thus adroitly harked back upon his grievance his wifes eyes sank she turned from him with a movement of impatience the moment the steamer was signalled i got ready gaston i went straight down to the pier road and watched her come into harbour oh you never saw me dinah added quickly i was standing behind some piles of timber at the entrance to the pier a hundred yards distant and when i saw you and the thornes land together i felt certain you would walk with them to their house and i lost courage and got away to avoid the deadly risk of saying good morning to mrs thorne and the doctor i i remembered there were no strawberries for breakfast she stammered determined upon not giving him fresh offence no roses to last us until to morrow dont you see holding out her hands which trembled a little i have been marketing alone but i need hardly ask the question you always do your marketing alone his skilfully marshalled questions perplexed her vaguely she felt the same aching doubt which overcame her once on board the princess a doubt as to gastons belief in her perfect truthfulness yes and no she answered a piteous deprecation in her tone lord rex basire was in the market place his company was so wearisome that i could scarcely answer a civil word yet he followed me from stall to stall a lord it seems will not be affronted as a gentleman would i never shook him off till i turned the corner beneath the arsenal gates from which point lord rex no doubt caught a glimpse of me said gaston with his unfathomable candour tis a good enough little creature in its way although brainless we must be tolerant of all men dinah if one only frequented the society one loves best he pursued i should certainly not be going out to breakfast at this moment going out i saw de gourmet at the bottom of the hill and he invited me to eat red mullet with him thirty five minutes later you must admit dinah that the temptation was strong to this she made no answer for when de gourmet talks of red mullet he implies a menu our food in alderney was barbarous rougets en papillottes accompanied by fine old graves tartines de caviar poulet saut with chteau margaux of a souffl aux fraises a glass of wonderful tokai after ones morsel of stilton still added gaston if you had met me on the pier i could never have said yes especially as i am obliged to dine at the fort to night again dinah was mute she rested her hand upon the garden railing beside which they stood she kept the tears back bravely in their bed it is guest night at mess and there will be a larger party than usual my engagement dates really from a week ago i made some idle promise it seems of giving the maltshire youngsters a lesson in poker by the bye ran on mr arbuthnot with an air of spontaneous reminiscence i remember little oscar jones offered to put me up very lucky i thought of telling you you intend to be away till to morrow is that your meaning gaston till to morrow certainly when can one get away from a mess dinner before midnight this time however you will not be disturbed my love instead of being roused at an unearthly hour of the morning you will have your rest unbroken and you want it dinah do you know that you are losing your colour that your eyes are beginning to look dark under the lower lid and your evening dress when you breakfast with colonel de gourmet i generally see nothing of you for the remainder of the day my dearest girl you are all thoughtfulness just put together what i shall want in my gladstone miller will see that it goes up to the fort and do not keep in your own room dinah and do eat dinner instead of drinking tea for my sake by this time gaston arbuthnot had progressed some paces along the descending path dinah had no choice but to return to the hotel then settle down after a scarcely tasted breakfast to one of her accustomed days of loneliness and embroidery alas the mere mechanical business of cross stitch irritated her cruelly this conscientious sorting of coloured wools this rigid counting of threads this hour long stabbing of a needle in and out of canvas what good could be the outcome of it she asked herself the question ere her needle had taken a dozen stitches what ill has been lessened thought dinah what pleasure added to mortal lot by all the collective pieces of wool work which patient dull hearted women have executed since the world began a keen eager soul like marjorie bartrands would have settled the question unhelped and finally at about the age of eleven dinahs nature was essentially averse to revolution she was slow at imagining new futures and an existence without cross stitch would to her have been the newest of all possible existences but pain was beginning to sting her not only into rebellion but into quickened intelligence it was not merely the emptiness of wool work as an occupation that overcame her she felt humiliated by its want of art she pictured the tasteless adornment of aunt susans humble parlour rendered a few shades more tasteless by the added pinks and greens and reds of her own laborious ottoman she divined as she had never done before what her pieces must seem like in the fastidious sight of gaston and of his friends with a sensation of disgust poor dinah pinned a screen of silver paper over her forget me nots and auriculas then she took geoffreys volume of browning from the table seating herself in a corner of the room farthest away from the fresh air the enlivening summer odours and warmth which floated in from the garden she began to read the book opened at james lees wife during the past twenty fours hours she had pondered deeply over the wisdom to be gained at the hands of polite society what was the langrune expedition for her but an experiment a lesson whereby she might acquire the manners the temper the ideas if such existed of her husbands world the experiment had taught her much yet i think james lees wife read and re read through tears had taught her more she had discovered no transcendental meaning as a learned browning society might have done in brownings words but she was growing to look at life otherwise than by her own small rushlight of personal experience to know that it was no new thing for a mans fancy to die while his wifes love burned at white heat to realise that there was a wide world lying outside her own narrow embittered lot a world to whose beauty and whose teachings the most self engrossed soul must open itself or perish dinah arbuthnot did not want to perish she could be content she thought although delight was gone out of her days if use survived ready to spin the wool and bake the bread to return to the plain sweet wholesomeness of workaday existence from which the hapless good fortune of marrying a gentleman had divorced her to part from gaston in short for an instant she had a physical longing to breathe the air of the devonshire moorlands a wild hope crossed her that she might go back to her fathers people live their village lives earn her own bread be dinah thurston again then her heart smote her with violence the volume fell to the floor could parting from gaston be a beginning of better things a turning towards the straight path of duty that path along which so many a wife has to walk uncomplaining through the after years of a marriage to which happiness has not been granted her existence at his side was more now than a long slow disappointment it was a growing anguish a combat in which ignorant plain speaking love on one side had no chance against a succession of sympathetic rivals all uttering perfect little flatteries all giving perfect little dinners on the other and she dinah was not two and twenty and her young heart craved insistently for sunshine and such a slender change it seemed in the eternal foreordering of events a child at her knee a husband loving the quiet of his own fireside would have made up the sum of her prosaic ambition yet she must go on enduring she must not part from gaston until the dark final curtain shut his face for ever from her sight what taste could she have for the devonshire moorlands the country joys which contented her when she was a girl no human soul can serve two masters after knowing passionate love passionate jealousy how could she go back to a life of no emotion at all how share the village interests of people like her fathers folk simple souls with whom it was a vital point whether the next cake should be made with carraways or with raisins who could speculate through half a winter as to who would be asked and who wear new bonnets on easter sunday and in whose minds a visit to exeter or the yearly house cleaning ranked among the larger events of mortal destiny the poor girl was reluctantly coming to the conclusion a hard one to realise at her age that she would not be extraordinarily welcome anywhere when geff arbuthnot unannounced as was his habit entered the parlour he took in the position of affairs promptly dinahs colourless face her unoccupied hands the book lying as it had fallen on the floor told him with gist passing that of words that she was in some fresh misery of which gaston was the cause geoffreys own heart was sore his spirit troubled to day a thought distantly akin to that which had newly traversed dinahs mind for a moment overcame him what a little change in the foreordering of things might have re written the story of both lives if dinah thurston had chanced to love him before his cousin gaston crossed her path alone and indoors dinah her christian name for once slipped from his lips it is a day quoted geff when it were a sullenness against nature not to go abroad and see her riches has gaston returned gaston and the thornes have returned the cherbourg boat came in long ago and i have been out i went down to market before breakfast i enjoyed the morning wonderfully there was the kind of discrepancy between voice and statement that you might detect in the speech of a man who should declare he had wonderfully enjoyed a funeral and what are you going to do with yourself this afternoon i scarcely know i am in an idle mood write to one of the good old aunts in devonshire perhaps and gaston gaston will not be seen till to morrow he has in the first place gone out to breakfast i was not on the pier when they landed and gaston ran quickly up here to dress i only spoke to him for a few minutes outside the hotel colonel de gourmet had waylaid him on the road it seems and invited him to breakfast off red mullet the temptation gaston said was irresistible a touch of sarcasm was in mrs arbuthnots voice the guernsey red mullet is not a bad fish retorted geff with appreciation breakfasting of course means spending the day at colonel de gourmets house until the hour comes round for afternoon teas and to night there is a dinner party at the fort gaston is forced to be there to give some of the maltshire subalterns a lesson in poker he will not be back till to morrow quite out of consideration for me gaston thought me looking pale he did not wish me to have another broken night the speech was delivered with a kind of staccato airiness geoffrey arbuthnots face became graver and graver while dinah made it you are reading i see as usual why you will be a confirmed bookworm before long coming closer he picked up the volume from the floor he examined the page at which it opened james lees wife i should say you would soon know mrs lees history by heart i find something new in it always dont you think geff so much writing must have gone far to ease her sorrow or would writing just come natural to an educated born lady in my class said dinah if trouble cut us very keen we should not feel like taking a copy book to write it down the criticism from dinahs point of view was just geff sought not to controvert it the prettiest part of all is beside the drawing board i was thinking before you came in id rather be the little girl with the poor coarse hand than write the best poetry ever printed geoffrey followed the drift of her remark and gaston he asked with point how about his opinion we cannot look at a single small morsel of our lot forgetting the rest if there is one thing gaston admires more than another in a woman it is the whiteness and delicacy of her hand all the same geff i hate to live without work common household work that makes the hands rough and red work is the same to me as your books are to you and you know added dinah there must always be a world full of ladies delicate white skinned fond of idleness whose finger tips gaston could admire the observation gave geff an inconveniently straight glimpse behind the domestic curtain of his friends lives moving to the table he became suddenly interested in dinahs marketing the strawberries were in their wicker basket still the roses hung their heads as though conscious of neglect over the rim of an ugly water jug you may generally prognosticate safely as to the state of a womans heart when she treats her flowers lovelessly they were all for gaston you know how he likes to see fresh fruit and flowers on the breakfast table i know that the strawberries smell uncommonly good they are to be kept of course for gastons return oh no dinahs voice was blankly indifferent i dont care now what becomes of them you would do well to care exclaimed geoffrey looking round on her shortly there are a good many millions of people in the world remember besides gaston arbuthnot geoffrey yes a good many millions the majority of them poor an enormous percentage suffering gaston and you and i are surfeited with good things we are certain every day we live that we shall dine think of that mrs arbuthnot dine with the accompaniment of as many strawberries and roses as we choose to buy the blood mantled hot over dinah arbuthnots weary face you mean to remind me that i am selfish she said very low i know it geoffrey i know that i am sinking fast into everything that is bad in the common meaning of the words you are the least selfish woman living but you are self absorbed no even that is saying too much you are gaston absorbed if you could see how some half starved people manage to get along yes and to be cheerful over their crust you might think less of strawberries and roses for gastons breakfast table the admonition looks rougher set down in black and white than it sounded dinahs face grew animated i know that to be useful in any way would do me good long ago i should have liked district visiting in england only you see hesitating we never stop long enough to explain i mean for the clergyman of the place quite to know about one her tone was tentative she had an uneasy dread that young women who marry men above them in rank are likely if unexplained to be suspect in orthodox eyes in their early married days she recollected a visit paid to them by a seaside curate with a subscription list recollected the seaside curates glance when gaston introduced her with her country speech and manners as my wife and dinahs being the order of mind that generalises for ever after from one experience that glance haunted her still an uncomfortable reminder as to the likely sentiments of the clergy at large regarding herself not long enough to explain i dont catch your meaning what on earth has any clergyman in england to do with you dinah arbuthnot could you not feel for miserable people work for them serve them heartily although you travelled round the country a heathen in a caravan although you had never spoken to a clergyman in your life i want some one to show me the way that is another weakness of my character i want some one to show me the way in everything good geff let me show you the way to day you remember the sailor lad who got his ankle hurt as we were coming back from france that wretched passage in the fog yes dinah remembered every incident of it too well there was worse mischief done than the surgeons feared at first poor jack is at present number in the accident ward of the hospital he will have to remain there for a good many more weeks than he thinks well one may safely assert mrs arbuthnot that though you and i and gaston have roses and strawberries to spare jack has none take them to him of course dinah exclaimed surely geff you might have done that without asking and do you suppose jack would not value such gifts more if they came from a womans hand the delicate white hand whose uses you despise to day is friday on friday afternoon the patients friends are admitted to see them but jacks friends are far away in devonshire you will be his only visitor if you consent to come dinah rose acquiescently rather than with any initiative warmth she had a moments hesitation gaston held such contradictory opinions at times no knowing if gaston would approve of her putting herself forward there was the archdeaconess there were the island clergy then encountering a look that had a command in it from geoffreys eyes she moved lingeringly towards the adjoining room if i dressed to please myself you need not wait two minutes geff but the powers that be the little malice flashed from her unawares are sensitive as to millinery i could not run the terrible risk of meeting mrs thorne and gaston in my morning gown chapter xxxix that little divinity the project roused her at least into physical brightness as she walked at geoffreys side towards the hospital the basket of strawberries hanging from her arm her hands filled with roses a stranger meeting them would have taken dinah arbuthnot for some april cheeked girl ignorant of passion as of disappointment a girl needing no apologist she wore on this fateful afternoon a dove coloured quaker gown a gainsborough hat tied beneath her chin by black velvet strings item a large plain cambric tippet with cambric half sleeves reaching to the elbows it was the latest costume invented by her husband in an idle moment and geoffrey had lost exactly half an hour while she put it on but what man would grudge a lost half hour after one glance at that for which he had waited the road from millers hotel to the hospital led through petersport high street and close to the north entrance of colonel de gourmets garden at the moment when dinah and geff walked along it chanced that the colonel himself reclined under the shaded verandah of his drawing room the colonel smoking his third cheroot and offering unsentimental criticisms on the dress and looks of such feminine passers by as came within range of a pair of languidly held opera glasses of an afternoon colonel de gourmets drawing room was generally full lacking many let us say lacking all the more solid human qualities the old east indian sybarite had one virtue he was universally hospitable nothing pleased him better than that a man he had invited to breakfast should loiter on till dinner nothing pleased him better than that other men whom he had not invited should drop in at any hour they chose make free with his rare cigars rarer wines and entertain each other with ideas or with that best discovered substitute for the trivial masculine mind cards in a garrison town sea on three sides and barely available space on the other for a polo match or a herring run it may be believed that old colonel de gourmet was in no lack of callers six or eight men young enough most of them to be their hosts grandsons were lounging this july afternoon in various attitudes of idleness about his pleasant bachelor drawing room the air was lightly impregnated with tobacco smoke so good of its kind that mingled with the wafted garden sweets it scarcely seemed grosser than some finely distilled odour of musk flower or of tea rose gaston arbuthnot was on the point of finishing a match at cart with little oscar jones two or three of oscars brother officers forming a silent and discriminative gallery cards simply as cards gaston arbuthnot disliked although he had an inborn knack of playing most things successfully the childish intricacies of a game like nap beloved of all the maltshire subalterns were to him a weariness of spirit we can use your english nap as a means he would tell them frankly just as we can use blind hookey or simpler than either chicken hazard if we want to transfer money from one mans pocket to another as a matter of amusement i would sooner play euchre or poker for counters in poker especially all our natural human instincts bluster bluffing intent to deceive etc come agreeably to the fore whist gaston confessed he played well at cart he was moderately good this moderate goodness his antagonist was about to test practically four all cried little oscar eager over a just dealt brilliant hand of trumps the king said gaston quietly laying down his cards some one tell de gourmet it is his turn to cut in the colonel had now risen to his feet he was watching an object evidently of paramount interest through his opera glasses a throat an ankle shoulders tell you what it is sir she is the prettiest woman in the island not one of our society beauties can hold a candle to her and shes not a woman one meets at any of the parties by and by arbuthnot by and by for gaston with a presentiment of the truth sat restlessly shuffling and re shuffling the cards to view the queen of hearts in flesh and blood is better surely than handling her in pasteboard now where did one see that little divinity before at saturdays rose show of course asked linda thorne about her mrs linda true type of her sex affected not to know her name luckily such a paragon does not need a name an archdeaconess if i mistake not threw her little pebble the young person with the yellow hair was nobody one knew every man in the room with the exception of arbuthnot had by this time crowded to the window one of the youngsters hazarded a bold whisper in the hosts ear it was old de gourmets deafer ear he caught the note of warning imperfectly he resumed his parable with warmth french woman do you say cannot believe it sir no french woman had ever such a complexion such hair but the dress with its complex simplicity comes from paris doubtless dove coloured mousseline de laine the colonel made these things as much a study as his brillat savarin a tippet designedly plain such as perfection only dare put on a little black velvet knot beneath the dainty chin directly arbuthnot directly calm your impatience and look at her teeth now she smiles and her dimples the young fellow with her seems disposed to make the best of his opportunities small blame to him throughout the listeners there ran a flash of hideous silence at last some one passed a slip of paper on which a name had been hastily scribbled into colonel de gourmets gouty fingers and then arose general conversation mainly as to the weather prospects after this fog that had been hanging about the channel for days and with the glass running down fast what were the chances we should not have a thunderstorm in the course of the next twenty four hours gaston arbuthnot arranged the cards in two neat packs on the table and waited silently for his host he felt morally certain that the little divinity was his wife also that lord rex basire was her companion and a wholesomely bitter contrition filled his soul a feeling widely differing from the vague disrelish with which he had watched her teaching basire cross stitch five days before probably he never knew how dear dinahs white name was to him never realised how culpably he had left her in the shade until this moments humiliation and still gastons countenance betrayed him not an instant later he was rallying the colonel on his boyish enthusiasm confessing that for his own part he was too staid a benedict to exert himself at the present state of the thermometer merely because a nice looking woman happened to pass along the street and what are our stakes the usual fiver asked de gourmet looking immensely tickled as he hobbled across the room to the card table i am afraid of you though arbuthnot you are just the man to be in luck i dont believe in luck conduct is fate gaston lifted his handsome face he fixed his clear steely glance on the somewhat silenus features over against him champagne i thank you colonel no brain enemy just at present dont you know that we yankees keep our heads cool on purpose to rook the britishers interrupted de gourmet still with a suppressed chuckle in his voice on purpose to rook the britishers now let us attend to business sir said gaston cheerfully the best of three games for a five pound note good the little divinity and her companion had by this time reached the hospital gates i hope i shall use the proper words geff whispered dinah looking flushed and nervous the kind of exhortation you know that clergymens wives would give to sick people impossible geoffrey disencouraged her promptly orthodoxy cannot be learnt at a moments notice you must be content to be yourself and that is much he added watching her beautiful earnest face your sermon may well be a silent one look just as you are looking at this moment and leave the rest to the patients human nature jack may be a miserable sinner needing homilies that is a fact you and i have no certitude about we know that he is a poor lad far from his people laid low in pain and weakness depend upon it the sound of a tender voice the sight of dinah arbuthnots face must prove good medicine both for his soul and body the tears started to dinahs eyes she was just at that tension point of suppressed emotion when a kindly accent a word or two of praise are as hands extended to a drowning man if gaston only esteemed her poor personal gifts as geoffrey did for of whatever she thought to day gaston still was beneath the current of her thinking nay this followed by a descending yet inevitable sequence of ideas if gaston could only hold the opinion of her held dinah remembering events had a little thrill of shame by a man like lord rex basire perhaps the sum total of yoked infelicity might be lessened if careless husbands would reckon with themselves sometimes concerning the number of their deserved rivals such husbands i mean as possess wives of dinah arbuthnots mould for must not the answer be trumpet tongued the whole seeing world does not every man save the purblind range himself by intuition on the side of a young and beautiful and neglected woman but careless husbands may not have imagination enough for such a stretch or there may be sympathisers outside feminine judges mature sirens a clever whisper even now and then and so the wifes heart continues to ache to the last or gives up aching of a sudden deeper tragedy by far dinahs colour went and came as she traversed the corridors of the hospital beside geoffrey the moment they entered ward a the mens accident room she forgot her want of knowledge of orthodoxy explanation was not needed here she saw only the rows of beds each bed with its pallid inmate she felt only that she was dinah thurston among the poor the simple the suffering among her equals the patients in the ward were mostly working men in the springtime of their strength the majority of them victims of the late quarry accident a few like poor jack had been struck down by mishap at sea or in the harbour beside nearly every bed was a visitor here might be seen a country girl talking in whispers to her sweetheart here a pale wife clasped her husbands hand or a mother in silent anguish watched her lads changed face on every pillow was a little posy of sweet smelling cottage flowers reminding the gaunt sufferers who lay there patient and uncomplaining of blue summer sky of the freshness of fields and gardens of home number had neither visitor nor posy poor jack came from a remote hamlet among the devonshire moors his mates on board the princess were afloat again the lad had no friends save the surgeons and nurses of the guernsey hospital and geff arbuthnot speak to him about his own country geoffrey whispered as his companion drew back a little jack will dispense with any formal introduction and on this dinah her face overflowing with sweetest womanly compassion stooped over the low pallet and spoke a commonplace word or two unworthy of raising to the dignity of print a word or two whose homely devonshire lilt called the blood up to jacks temples as though some voice from the old familiar home addressed him since her marriage dinah had learnt to speak english with a foreign pronunciation gaston would tell her yet scarcely strong enough to be disagreeable although a tell tale cadence was traceable ever and again in her speech she had tardily succeeded in putting away the devonshire burr that was strong on her tongue when geoffrey met her first here at jacks bedside no gaston near to be put to shame she fell back instinctively upon the west country accent the soft half strange half familiar os and us of her childhood its so bad to be sick for a young fellow like you and away from home we just thought you might like a talk with some one devonshire born and bred i wonder now do you and i come from the same part i was born at torrhill a village out away beyond chagford a poor place maam on the borders of the moor quite a poor place repeated jack apologetically why that is near to my own town tavistock said dinah we used to pass torrhill going along the vale of widdicombe every autumn when we went out whortleberrying torrhill in the cold country i mind we children used to say when we got snowstorms in winter the widdicombe folk were picking their geese well and as he listened to her simple talk to the soft west country accent it came to pass that geff arbuthnots heart knew a thrill of its old infatuation no man can possibly hold two women dear at the same time and geoffrey was in love the warm flesh and blood love of four and twenty with an actuality not a remembrance but his heart thrilled at dinahs voice something in his temperament forbade him to outlive the past wholly it was a book that could not be clasped a word an accent and the enchantment cast upon him in the long dead summer days at lesser cheriton would be revitalised this was his weakness a conscious one always and now he was in the dangerous state of wounded feeling when a mans tenderness is easily arrested at rebound those devonshire os and us brought back before him in its fiery ardour the fortnight when he worshipped dinah thurstons footsteps the fortnight ending on that evening when gaston and his friends drove past in the twilight on their return from ely standing here in the guernsey hospital ward geoffreys senses recalled the rush of wheels down the village street the lingering daylight in the low fields of cambridgeshire sky he remembered how dinahs head and throat stood out in waxen relief against the dusky arbutus hedge of the cottage garden and he decided there and then yes while she was chatting low voiced smiling to the lad about the moors and the cold country and the autumn huckle berrying to return to england forthwith a french steamer was to touch at petersport on sunday morning that would give him to morrow for winding up his small affairs for taking leave of his patients for visiting tintajeux he would kiss in coldest fancy the hair the lips that should have made up to him for the unattainable heaven of his youths desire he would look once again in marjories eyes and go it was possible here at least might be a gleam of comfort that gaston and dinah would steer clearer through their difficulties if left absolutely alone than they were doing now he told her of his intention when they were on their way back to the hotel and remember you know your way to the hospital he added quickly as dinah was about to speak i hope when i am gone you will pay jack many a kind little visit your hands as full of fruits and flowers as they were to day when you are gone echoed dinah blankly the fear smote her that with geoffreys going such slack hold as she still had upon gaston must be loosened i hoped you would remain here as long at least as i must think of all the sick people who will miss you geff think of miss bartrand i shall find sick people everywhere in the matter of doctors guernsey is full of better men than i and marjorie bartrand ah that is a different side of the question i am conceited enough to think miss bartrands mathemathics will suffer and you dont care you are not one bit sorry at giving her up do you know geoffrey i had begun to hope miss bartrand will be a girton girl before long interrupted geoffrey happily he paused she is not without self reliance has more than a womans share perhaps of ambition when we see each other next it will be as fellow students in cambridge dinah knew the tone of his voice it was not a tone that invited discussion your leaving is an ill stroke of luck for me geff day by day gastons engagements seem to grow upon him my time will be emptier than ever when you are gone you may fill it full as time can hold i thought as i watched you charming poor jack out of knowledge of his pain that you had missed your vocation you should be a nurse yours are the ideal face and voice and tread that we want in the hospitals if you ever harbour thoughts of emancipation or of a mission said geoffrey remember my hint when gaston has used the last line that can be modelled from my face for instance the smile was flickering with which dinah hazarded the surmise when gaston has got his last inspiration from your face unluckily for the hospitals that day will not come quite yet a woman with a mission should have no such vexatious encumbrance as a husband or a lover for once geoffreys tone was cynical he recalled his parting with marjorie bartrand over night chapter xl at the bungalow and all this time an offer of truce lay on the mantelshelf of dinahs parlour an offer directed to himself in the handwriting whose greek es whose girlish assumption of scholarship geoffreys heart knew can we wonder at the pagan notion that the gods must needs hold their sides for laughter when they gaze down on the ever twisted plot of our little lives geoffrey and dinah were within a hundred feet of millers house five minutes more and geff must have been lifted this time into quite other than a fools paradise when abruptly a new actor jauntily floating in cobweb indian silk gleaming under a scarlet sunshade with eight buttoned gloves with airs with graces innumerable made her entrance upon the scene mrs thornes manner was confident to day as of one with whom the world goes well she ran skittishly down the steps leading from the hotel garden she paused tapping a high heeled shoe in pretty impatience on the gravel she looked this way and that expectantly at length it would seem decided with a little merry shake of the head for the chances of town over country then with such ease of tread as high heeled shoes are apt to confer on ladies whose summers are increasing she commenced the steep descent of the hill i hope mrs thorne has not been calling on me i hope if we stop she will make me no pretty speeches said dinah under her breath i could not bear them just now if mrs thorne makes pretty speeches i shall say something true to her geoffrey man like showed signs of instant flight on hearing the ultimatum he was in no vein he said for linda thornes fine spirits was in no vein i fear for the better sex at all in its liveliness or its asperity he had an appointment to keep a case of life and death at the bedside of one of the quarry workers would not be back till late it was time for him to be on his road and in short interrupted dinah you have not courage to meet mrs thorne if you like to say so yes was geffs answer but dont tell mrs thorne the truth he whispered this to dinah at parting or tell her such truth only as affects herself not you dinah however was not in a temper for advice even geoffreys erect of carriage with a flush of the cheeks a sparkle in the eyes dinah walked grandly up the hill determined at every cost that final truth should be spoken between her and mrs thorne did opportunity offer so our philosopher shows valours better part thought linda as geff vanished down a turning to the right mr geoffrey arbuthnot positively declines to face me we have never been rapturously fond of each other now it is to be war to the knife excellent detestable young man i accept the challenge and mrs thorne mentally kissed her pale buff finger tips in the direction taken by geoffrey dinah meanwhile had breasted the hill her head was held aloft her fine arms were folded in one of those attitudes of natural repose that had always been the despair of gastons pencil to the artist who has no wood notes wild the virtuoso with whom craft workmanship style are all in all is not perfect naturalness the most difficult to woo among the graces linda spoke first so very glad to meet you i have this moment called at millers and found you absent we can have our chat out of doors she was serenely void of conscience it was probably a mere physical sensation of antagonism that hindered mrs thorne from offering poor magnificent dinah her hand to begin with i must unburthen my soul by confession so she ran on gaily my visit was really and truly to your husband not a change of colour not a shade of expression passed across the face of gastons wife she possessed the self preserving instincts of many weaker creatures and of her sex in general could conceal feign dissemble except under the eyes and at the voice of him she loved the other night at sea just before the steamer stopped at alderney you must know that he and i made a bet a very foolish one linda had the grace to redden as she remembered what that bet was about and mr arbuthnot won he wins in everything it seems a compliment may have been implied by the tone it fell dead on dinah arbuthnots prejudiced ears and so i thought i would run up this afternoon to discharge my debt i deposited the stakes on a corner of your mantelpiece if you see mr arbuthnot before i do tell him from me that he has won that i am bankrupt you will forgive me for invading your sitting room without leave will you not still dinah did not speak her eyes glowed deepened until their soft english hazel seemed turned to black i have known you long enough we are sufficiently intimate went on linda feeling that she was being forced into the fencing attitude for me to venture on such a liberty you can venture where you choose forth came the reply in dinahs full rounded tones the room is gastons how can i question your right of entering it but i must ask you not to speak of intimacy if i saw you daily until the last day i live i should never be intimate with you her voice was crystal clear by reason of its low pitch every word was weighted by passionate long pent up feeling linda thorne shifted about ill at ease on the feet that a minute ago had danced under her weight so airily we ought positively to see more of each other i think it quite too charming of you to be so sincere quite i always say to my friends mrs arbuthnot has that most refreshing that rarest of gifts sincerity do you say this saying this do you mean to speak well of me dearest mrs arbuthnot can you doubt the honesty of my intentions never say it again be generous enough at least to spare me your praise the rapier points had lost their buttons linda thorne fell into position quickly that dinah good griselda like woman loved her careless husband to the pitch of jealous idolatry had been patent to her long before still viewing the arbuthnot household from her own level lindas judgment was that griselda had consolations mild ones if you will the devotion of lord rex basire impartially offered to every pink and white nonentity he came across the constant society tinged by that glamour which beautiful women confer on all their relationships of the excellent detestable scotch cousin geoffrey arbuthnot but consolations nevertheless and this judgment sharpened her reply if i were to refrain from praising you my dear creature i should lay myself open to the charge of envy the one vice observed linda with pathetic self depreciation which i am free from every man in this island my own good husband included sounds your praise you have absolutely a queue i mean considerately translating a little train of conquests lord rex basire mr geoffrey arbuthnot i ask you to stop in the class of life i come from exclaimed dinah aflame we hold it unworthy for a married woman to make conquests rather severe surely cleopatra may never have known she had conquered until anthonys peace was gone just as we hold it unworthy in any woman married or single to beguile the husband of another a tiny pink hued veil reached to the tip of lindas nose we may assume that the veil concealed lindas usual percentage of well applied rice powder but a gleam of white anger showed through veil and powder alike a nervous quiver worked around her thin lips for a moment it seemed as though mrs thornes vulnerable point were found as though her antagonists last thrust had gone home then she recovered herself without too palpable effort she laughed good humouredly our strain is getting over tragic we live in the day of little things sensation is out of vogue nobody pushes husbands down wells nobody beguiles the husbands of worthier people even if it were otherwise if viviens were as the sands of yonder channel your happiness dear mrs arbuthnot would be secure it must be confessed that linda made her counter stroke with admirable neatness a beautiful woman married to an artist holds him in chains rose decked ones of course but chains chains she forced dinah to touch fingers she covered her retreat under a little roulade of interjections sent back with grimace of friendliness across an expressive shoulder so fortunate we left the princess never could dear robbie have stood the terrors of that night one hears whispers on all sides of heroic courage mrs arbuthnots name foremost then linda thorne tripped down the hill by virtue of superior coolness mistress outwardly of the situation but with her heart thumping uneasily with the queerest hottest sense experience had ever brought her of discomfiture and defeat that dinahs temper had reached the point which chemists call flashing point was certain another encounter like this with sharpened memories on both sides probably with the added element of an audience and either linda thorne or dinah arbuthnot must become ridiculous it was a dilemma thought linda out of which the finest tact the cleverest self effacement could scarcely help one she was like a prime minister the presumptuous simile tickled her a prime minister who having lost the lead of the house would fain transfer his power gracefully to the chief of the opposition dinah was that chief and she linda thorne was genuinely ready to abdicate there was in lindas nature a thin stratum of bohemianism the bulk of the woman was philistine she liked small popularities to air her domestic excellences her devotion to her robbie she liked to talk serious talk she liked to dine with the archdeacon sooner than run the risk of scandal or go through scenes of such dimensions as this scene with dinah she felt that it would be well to take robbie and the infant pack up her portmanteau and fly oh if mrs arbuthnot a bright thought striking her could but be made to pack up hers and go never to return even if poor dinah took the worshipped gaston with her mrs thorne felt that the price would not be too high she would forfeit every sentimental friendship in the world sooner than again encounter the scorn the passion of dinahs girlish face above all with an audience it was really this vision of an audience of public battles royal of ridicule perhaps of acknowledged defeat which fired linda thornes conscience to the height of renunciation arriving at the garden gate of the bungalow she heard no unfamiliar sound the voices of rahnee and of gaston arbuthnot at high play within before discovering herself the mistress of the house peeped for a minute through the ivy covered railings she saw rahnee aloft on arbuthnots tall shoulder one little skinny hand clutching tight round his neck the other beating him stoutly with a switch faster missy butnot dallop dallop shrieked rahnee the childs vigorous kicks were testifying to her delicious sense of power over her slave when the unwelcome gleam of a scarlet sunshade caught her eyes rahnee terrible infant cried linda falling back on the tired indian voice that had been absent during her colloquy with dinah come down naughty girl think how you must be teasing mr arbuthnot no me not tease missy butnot go away the thin arms imperiously motioned lindas dismissal we not want nobody missy butnot and rahnee my visit is to rahnee exclusively observed gaston remember mrs thorne you warned me not to come to the bungalow a mysterious something might happen before five oclock converting us for ever into enemies but i will not have rahnee included in the feud did i talk such nonsense really cried linda with a forced laugh well who knows perhaps it will turn out that i was a prophetess after all rahnee little tyrant come down this instant at a signal from mrs thorne the ayah who had been placidly dozing on her square of carpet in the shade arose with a quick flank movement the black woman bore down on rahnee upon this rahnee clinging closer to gaston raised her shrill voice to its topmost limits rahnee i command oh dear dear what a trial children are at a high temperature well then if you wont be good linda drew from her pocket a little silvery packet tied with cherry coloured ribbon if rahnee wont be a good girl what does she think mamma has brought her from town tandy cried rahnee with a sudden accession of repentant wisdom rahnee not tease poor missy butnot no more and bestowing two or three resonant kisses on gaston the child slid down out of his arms she gave her mother a careless caress then vanished hiding herself and her tandy under the ayahs ample cotton cloak into the bungalow she really is not a bad little monkey said linda who thoroughly believed in her own system of education touch rahnees feelings and you can at once bring her to obedience feeling is the grand requisite in a childs nature who would not be virtuous observed gaston arbuthnot if virtue were always rewarded by providential sugar candy and i so wanted to have a few minutes quiet talk with you do you know mr arbuthnot i am seriously afraid for once linda thornes words came slow and haltingly seriously afraid you will pardon me i hope for saying this that mrs arbuthnot cannot be well dinah why she was fresh as a lily when i parted from her this morning i have indirectly heard of her looking her best since but gastons face was unsmiling the moment when he shuffled and re shuffled the cart packs half a dozen men crowding to the verandah of colonel de gourmets drawing room returned upon him with significant and disagreeable clearness mrs arbuthnot is looking exquisite i thought i had never admired her so much as in her quaker dress her simple country hat still there may be a bloom which exceeds health a white which is too transparent your wife strikes me how shall i describe her state as low spirited hysterical she eats and sleeps well she can walk half round the island difficult to conceive of a young woman with dinahs magnificent constitution as hysterical but she is so i met mrs arbuthnot on my way down from millers hotel i told her about our foolish wager and how i had honestly called to discharge my debt a propos de bottes you will find your gloves on a corner of the mantlepiece and dinah dinah i was afraid looked like weeping under the broad light of day in the open street impossible she is little given to idle tears even when cause exists for shedding them gaston had reddened he made the statement in the quiet tone of a man sure of his facts i felt as though i had committed some horrible crime and of course when peoples nerves are unstrung it is sheer cruelty to attempt to argue with them our soft guernsey air may be at the root of the mischief half the disorders in these channel places are nervous ones my wife does not know the meaning of nerves your kindheartedness dear mrs thorne for once leads you wide of the mark will you let me smoke a cigarette asked gaston consulting his watch in ten minutes time i must be on my way to the fort they walked up and down amicably chatting among the pleasant blue gray shadows of the lawn neither was ignorant of the art by which speech can be used for the concealment of thought and dinahs name was not mentioned until the moment came for gastons departure then linda thorne spoke again and to the point i meant every word i uttered mr arbuthnot and my best advice to you is give your wife change why not try sark it is the lightest air we have in the archipelago or better still run over for ten days to brittany in saying this she glanced at him through her eyelashes you must at least allow that i am unselfish i allow only that you want to get rid of us laughed gaston arbuthnot with imperturbable neutrality also that your way of working the scheme out is charming you pack up wise counsel mrs thorne in silver paper tied with rose coloured ribbon as you do rahnees candy chapter xli one word the french waitress met dinah as she entered the hotel madame thorne had called there was scarce five minutes since the visitor insisted but insisted on entering a thousand amiabilities were to be transmitted by the tongue of louise and something the frenchwoman shrugged her shoulders vaguely had been left in madames salon for monsieur i know all about it cried dinah with readiness mrs thorne and i have just been talking together it is quite right louise she assumed the lightest most cheerful tone of which she was mistress feeling with inward smart that the french shrug was over vague that a glimmer of suspicious knowledge showed on the serving womans face then she walked her step mock elastic a poorly counterfeited smile upon her lips to her sitting room shutting the door with the automatic care human beings bestow on trivial actions in times when their hearts are fullest dinah walked straight to the fireplace the something left for monsieur was evidently before her a letter almost amounting to a packet stood on the mantelpiece it was addressed in large decisive handwriting to mr g arbuthnot millers hotel guernsey cette chre smeet elle sait si bien seffacer a pair of iron gray mens gloves lying modestly on the farther corner of the shelf did not arrest dinah arbuthnots sight mr g arbuthnot millers hotel guernsey well reader if dinah had possessed only a few grains more of worldly experience it must have been clear to her that this letter never issued from the bungalow in the first place by reason of the handwriting when did a woman of lindas culture affect the greek es the up and down characters of an undergraduate in the second by the ignorance of common english etiquette which the use of the title mr betrayed but dinah had no worldly experience at all neither had she the imaginativeness which renders some equally untaught people nimble at guessing in her mind was one engrossing thought gaston in her ears rang the text of mrs thornes message i deposited the stakes on a corner of your mantleshelf tell your husband from me that he has won that i am bankrupt there was no room in her tempest of heart and brain for doubts that could have been favourable to her own peace mr g arbuthnot millers hotel she took the letter at first with unwillingness in her hands she turned it over and over the envelope was too small for all that the sender had forced it to contain it adhered on one side only a touch dinah thought shrinking from her thought and the edges must come asunder her hands trembled so violently that she let the letter fall with some force on the ground as she picked it up she saw that the narrow edge of adhering envelope had become narrower an instant more of dalliance and the temptation strong and imperious to open it altogether had taken hold of her be true to yourself whispered a still small voice the voice of dinahs better nature loyal upright as you have striven to be from the day you married gaston arbuthnot go away from him to night to morrow if you have not wifely courage to live your life out at his side but go with head erect looking neither to the right hand nor the left till the last then rose another voice bolder of tone of strain less heroic poor foolish hot hearted woman is it not possible that you are brewing a thunderstorm in a tea cup why these turns and twistings of conscience linda thorne mr gaston arbuthnot thinking no evil make one of the silly wagers common among idle people who inhabit an idle world the lady is the loser calls at her friends hotel to discharge her debt and meeting the friends wife confesses playfully that she is bankrupt open that quarter inch of yawning envelope as linda thorne no doubt intended you to do in gastons absence you have often opened letters addressed to him by his own desire where is the fancied line between former right and present wrong how could it matter to gaston if you did see the contents of a packet in which there is probably not a syllable of writing and dinahs heart was vanquished by the meanness of opportunity she opened it a length of folded ribbon met her sight a tiny bouquet odorous still with yesterdays sweetness of briar and of heliotrope a sheet of notepaper upon which one word was written bare hints outlines of some unknown story which jealous passion might easily colour fill up with vivid detail endow with pulsating life after the first moments shock dinah stood like a woman petrified her eyes were fixed on the one word never meant for their perusal her face was bloodless she felt cold stupefied with anger it seemed to her that she could not drag herself from the spot where this hateful sure light had dispelled her darkness for ever she waited as though waiting could avail her at last the striking of a clock caused her to start she had got to dress she remembered to face men and women to dine for gastons sake with an effort that almost cost her bodily pain dinah made her way into her bedroom she locked double locked the door then holding the envelope and its contents between her shivering hands she tried to force herself into calmness to resolve on conduct if that were possible which should be just to herself and to her husband he was guilty of no actual wrong doing this thought presented itself in clear pure light amidst all the dusky half shades of her mind gaston was fickle neglectful of herself too easily led captive along the road of pleasure worse things than these she could never think of him to the moment of her death he must remain her best beloved and her lord the one man could the hour of choosing come again whom she would choose out of ten thousand she did not accuse gaston of wrong she sought not to blacken linda for aught she knew these delicately sentimental friendships these intimacies which permitted tender expression the yielding of a ribbon or a flower might in the world above her head be held innocent what she did know was that she dinah belonged not to that world desired no further education in its usages a comedy an amusing drawing room charade perhaps was in course of rehearsal between a tired indian lady needing sensation and her husband she would not passively ignobly stand by a spectator she would drag out her life of paltry distrust no longer gastons formal leave must be asked for before she started money also enough to take her from guernsey to the devonshire moors this would be all briefly if heaven would help her honestly she would tell gaston what wish lay next her heart and gaston was not likely to thwart her by monday oh that it could be earlier she would go back to her own people to a life shone on by no sun watered by no shower a life shut out from keen pleasure as from keen humiliation for evermore dinah sank into a chair and fell to examining the hue and texture of the ribbon curiosity for the moment out balancing cold repugnance it was of foreign make she saw a relic doubtless of those days when two people who might have suited each other used to meet to exchange furtive whispers in a paris salon a memento sufficiently precious to have survived through a decade of divided years and to become the object of a keenly contested wager between them now tell your husband with fresh purport lindas message returned to her that he has won and i am bankrupt she put back the enclosures in their cover not suffering herself to smell the flowers languid odour or look again on the one word whose import her jealousy divined and magnified then just as she had hidden the letter away in a secret drawer of her dressing case the first dinner bell was set ringing and dinah bethought her that if she would carry out gastons parting request she must go into the dining room alone no further shirking of that alone was practicable on former occasions she had quietly contrived to absent herself from the public table when gaston dined abroad pleading headaches for heartaches preferring tea to food ringing the changes by which neglected wives when they have common sense keep their own sad counsel apart from the world the time was past for deceits now either towards herself or others dinner to day like all her future dinners for twenty or thirty years say must perforce be eaten without gaston to drift here in truth seemed that which lay before her to drift at the present moment to speculate on possible effects to vacillate over a tucker a locket the colour of ones dinner dress a despairing human soul perplexed over the rival merits of pink white or blue a soul which when love shone on it had less than its feminine share of toilet vanity as poor dinah hesitated her thoughts travelled back by no road she knew to saturdays rose show her first meeting with rex basire her earliest distinct doubt of gastons truthfulness she decided to put on the black dress she wore that day to pin a white rose gastons flower by predilection in her hair to wear a silver bracelet gastons first present after their marriage on her wrist how fair how marvellously fair she was the fact struck dinah with a sense of newness as she stood waiting for the last dinner bell before her glass surely her looks joined to such lavish love as she had given might have contented the heart the pride of the most exacting husband if she had only had more mind there was the flaw the fatal deficiency to a man with whom mind was all in all like gaston arbuthnot she scrutinised the moulding of her temples the lines of her perfectly cut head in outward proportion she thought there was not much amiss it must be the quality of the brain that was poor there must be an inherited peasant slowness a bluntness of perception or wit something which disabled her from holding her own against the taught graces the pliant inexhaustible lightness of such an one as linda thorne she might if lowlier duties had fallen to her have been clever enough to manage a house to look after her husbands interests to bring up children amongst ladies and gentlemen oh the bitterness with which she uttered the titles of gentility half aloud amongst ladies and gentlemen she had no place no chance and in her nature not thoroughly sounded as yet but of whose depths the last few days had vaguely informed her in her innermost nature were evil things that a constant pressure of temptation might bring to the surface she was not like geoffrey no ministering to others could fill her life at any rate not while she was young while the cry for love had the double keenness of a physical and of a moral want if she continued a hanger on of the world that gaston loved some one who must be asked dont you know occasionally on sufferance she would one day meet with homage differently offered and from a different man to rex basire was she sure that gratitude would not be awakened in her then vanity was she sure she might not decline step by step to the condition of that most pitiable among women a wife true to the cold letter of her fealty who has at once outlived her husbands affection and the stings of her own self contempt dinah started guiltily as the sharp clang of the dinner bell roused her into final action it took a good many minutes before she could recover sufficiently to face the ordeal that lay before her at last arming herself by the reflection that henceforth all lifes common actions must be gone through alone and under a certain cloud of suspicion she made her way to the dining room after a moments trembling heartsickness she pushed back one of the double doors entered a hush an involuntary suspension of knife and fork greeted her the light through a western window fell full upon her golden head the whiteness of her throat and hands was thrown into brilliant relief by the sombre dress she wore a saint of holman hunts early manner thought a high church curate away on his four weeks holiday and who never would know more of dinah than the large sad eyes the lips carnation the nimbus of sunlight coloured hair can the complexion be absolutely real floated through the brain of more than one duly aged and authorised feminine critic miller with his professional little run and smile came forward he ushered dinah arbuthnot to her place mr gaston arbuthnot not expected i believe asked the host as dinah prepared to take her seat no mr arbuthnot is dining at the fort and mr geoffrey will not return till late then i may be allowed to fill this vacant chair thank you madam i should not have ventured to place a stranger next mrs arbuthnot without permission a minute later dinah discovered no stranger but her husbands friend lord rex basire at her side chapter xlii emancipation dinah arbuthnots face asked vividly for explanation made sure arbuthnot would be here that is to say our arbuthnot lord rex stammered he showed embarrassment that sat on him oddly as he apologised for his uninvited presence the comings and goings of the cambridge cousin are naturally beyond my powers of calculation naturally echoed dinah she remembered with a pang of self reproach what manner of errand kept geoffrey absent strolled round here early by accident you know thought id ask myself to dinner with your husband clean forgot till miller or some one put it into my head it was guest night that was half an hour ago ought to have started off instanter to fort william and why pray did you not do so mrs arbuthnot can you ask me rex basires tone adequately supplemented his words and dinahs pulse quickened she was on the threshold she remembered of a new an emancipated life a wife who lives apart from her husband must accept her position grow used to many things to every complexion of whisper among the rest that is the worlds immutable sentence away from gaston divorced from the arm which during four years had cradled her in warm safety she must learn like other unloved women to rely on her own strength her strength and the chivalry of all such knights errant such rex basires as should cross her path about the chivalry more might have to be learnt hereafter dinah realised before the first step of her downward journey was taken that her strength was weakness she felt as though all eyes around the table must watch her with suspicion read her secret rex basires tone of assured admiration brought the blood miserably shamefully to her cheeks he saw and misinterpreted the blush thought you know as there was a rumour of the cousins absence i should have a chance of getting next you you would have been better amused elsewhere my lord with geff i can talk or be silent as i like geff does not mind lord rex on this made some whispered hit at the model cousins excellence as he ate his half cold soup murmured comparisons fell from him as to the men who are made of flesh and blood poor devils and the other men too good for this world who are made of ice yes ice by jove but he was not great at covert allusion the metaphorical ice got mixed with the metaphorical flesh and blood his nominatives were nowhere breaking down rather ignominiously lord rex smothered his failure under a capacious sigh dinah turned to him with cheeks still burning i am afraid i did not understand men of ice men of flesh and blood were you talking of geff or of yourself lord rex despite her blush the true eyes stopped him short as they had so often done before ere rex basire had time to double back towards his starting point there came an interruption one of the trivial things not to be mentioned in heroic story yet which do ofttimes determine the current of a human life a plain little man his large checked suit his open murray proclaiming the tourist had during the past two minutes attentively watched lord rex from the other side the table upon hearing dinahs mention of the name the stranger fidgeted with his knife and fork cleared his throat coughed finally leaning forward with a bow it was obvious that he expected was eager for aristocratic recognition lord rex basire if i mistake not sir you are politeness itself but you have the better of me rex basire accorded his interrogator a blank and frozen stare oh the top of st gothard lord rex you were travelling with the duchess her graces carriage broke down something wrong with the linch pin and as i was in the region botanising i had the honour of offering her grace mine your lordship will recollect her graces carriage is invariably breaking down invariably besides drawled lord rex putting up a ferocious pince nez and resolute to nip renewal of acquaintance in the bud we are not on the top of the st gothard now ah mrs arbuthnot he addressed dinah in as low a tone as a mans voice can sink to without becoming an actual whisper this makes up to one for a great deal i have suffered at your hands by this said dinah whose courage was returning do you mean the cold soup we have eaten or the colder fish to which they are helping us i mean the happiness of sitting beside you of knowing i am so much forgiven that her grace travelled on as far as andermatt in the carriage it was my privilege to lend her from andermatt if my memory serves me right your memory is certain to serve you right sir the incident which i it seems have forgotten was more than unimportant lord rexs manner was brutal no other word would adequately describe it the poor little tourists eyes dropped to his plate his face turned scarlet dinah leaned forward on the instant with the gentle womanliness which was her breeding she addressed him in her pleasant country voice my husband and i met with just the same kind of accident once our carriage broke down and we had to spend six hours in wet and darkness between berne and vevey i should not have forgotten any one who had come to our help that night ah you know switzerland madam then may i ask the tourist gave a piteous glance towards lord rex if you take an interest in the alpine flora i have only time to pursue such things during my holidays it is possible he pronounced the word without its aspirate but botany is my hobby i get plants enough in my five weeks to fill my leisure for the rest of the year now in that very region you speak of i have found two or three specimens that are unique if you will allow me to enumerate the latin names madam and so on and so on the poor man was one of natures choicest bores his information was stale his manner of imparting it prosy his blindness to the suffering he inflicted absolute dinahs face wore a look of kindly interest through everything occasionally lord rex all but groaning aloud over his wasted opportunities she would strike in with some question calculated to start the narrator afresh on new tracks on new prosiness if peradventure he chanced to lag she even bowed courteously to him on leaving the table dhte an example not followed by lord rex a charming dinner on my word so he broke forth the moment he found himself beside dinah in the welcome freshness of the garden may i ask mrs arbuthnot what inhuman whim made you talk to that wretched snob rex basires voice went beyond the limits of petulance why a snob asked dinah meekly you know i can never catch the inner meaning of these names why because he was a snob her graces carriage broke down on the top of the st gothard he had had the privilege of offering his what the dickens did that matter to me her grace travelled as far as andermatt in his carriage what the dickens did that matter to him only this perhaps that her graces misadventure obliged the snob to go on foot mrs arbuthnot i never expect a direct answer from any woman lord rex exclaimed with scarcely suppressed temper still i should like to know why during a mortal three quarters of an hour you allowed that little wretch to talk to you she paused a shade of deepened colour touched her cheek the wretch was intelligent lord rex aye and opportune this was a subtle parenthesis put in by dinahs conscience i dont understand alpine plants but i liked to hear a good deal our tourist said about them the obby he pursues during his olidays observed lord rex humorously dinah turned swiftly round a streak of sunset goldened her hair and the delicate outlines of her face she gave a look of farewell sincerity at lord rex basire do you remember she asked him a conversation you and i had on board the steamer it was just after my husband and the thornes had landed at alderney yes lord rex remembered he was not likely this with a sigh to forget any hour or place in which he had had the good fortune to find himself alone with mrs arbuthnot we spoke about class distinctions i believe you called me a conservative certainly you told me you were the most out and out demagogue in england you were all for fraternity lord rex gardener adam and his wife and that sort of thing labour was the universal purchase money dukes and earls had best go back to the place from whence they came well you meant none of this lord rex winced unfair on a fellow he observed to be thus taken au pied de la lettre and you must speak in english cried dinah i have not french enough to understand your meaning my dear mrs arbuthnot a man may hold theories visions of an impracticable utopia dont you know charming ahem to air in exquisite company impossible to carry out in this rough chaos of a world we live in dinah stopped for a minute or more sedately reflecting before she answered i think i understand socialistic opinions if one is trying to make talk for a rather stupid woman at a picnic may be well enough especially if the rather stupid woman does not belong to ones own station mrs arbuthnot i protest the gardener adam of reality is a snob a wretch bound of course to lend his carriage to her grace in distress so long as he has not the impertinence to talk of duchesses or linch pins during the remainder of his days i have gained a new bit of wisdom lord rex basire it is not likely i shall meet you in england if i do i shall remember what you said to our poor botanist we are not on the st gothard now you might say massacring me through a cruel double eye glass we are not in guernsey now good night my lord she touched his hand she passed away out of his life with a smile her step was light the rose tints of the sky lent a fictitious brilliancy to her face wonderful how that poor young woman mrs arbuthnot kept up her spirits so opined feminine judges looking mercifully down upon events from the drawing room windows of the hotel and under the sad circumstances the husbands indifference to her growing hourly more pointed to be carried away like a girl by this foolish little lords attention but that is the nature of these pink and white yellow haired marionettes the temperament my dear madam is not one that feels or sorrows dinah arbuthnot walked quietly to her room then rang the bell and told the waiting maid that she would require nothing further and that no one need sit up for mr arbuthnot she changed her dress for a loose wrapper rested herself during some minutes and with her face hidden between her hands strove to realise the altered condition of things which lay before her it had been easy an outlet to jealous anger to declare in the moments heat she would no longer live with gaston arbuthnot during dinner though the strain was tense there had been a certain excitement a sense of perilous adventure to keep her up now came blank reality she must look at her position as a stranger would from outside if she purposed in good earnest to seek refuge with her devonshire kinsfolk she had best benefit by geoffreys escort on sunday had best wisely and soberly begin to pack to night well reader to pack however chaotic ones mental condition means to use ones arms see to the folding of ones latest intricate furbelows make sure that ones newest bonnet shall not be crushed dinah got through this part of her work well enough nay inasmuch as packing brought her muscles into play felt the better for it then came the bitter beginning of the end she must sort her trinkets must decide which things it was right to take with her into exile which leave gaston was the most careless man living the key of his dressing case was in his wifes hands everything he owned of value in her keeping it thus became needful in looking over her own possessions that she should take count of his and in doing so their four years of married life returned month by month almost hour by hour before her a legacy of two hundred pounds had come to dinah from a well to do farmer uncle a few days after her wedding too much rather to give to the poor not enough certainly to invest declared gaston they were at the time in paris we will go shares my dear child i will take one of the good uncles hundreds for cigarettes and you shall have the other hundred for chiffons dinah wanted no chiffons at gastons insistence possessing more millinery already than she knew what to do with so her hundred pounds were mainly spent in buying pretty things for her husband gaston was fonder of rings and pins than are most born englishmen he had also an innocent way of directing dinahs admiration to artistic trifles in the jewellers windows of the palais royal and the boulevards trifles which were tolerably sure to find their way to his own dressing table before the next morning ah their good laughs when these innocent ways became too bare faced ah the golden paris days when each hour was sweeter than the last when they used to jest together little knowing at the musty axiom which limits a pair of true lovers happiness to the shining of a single moon all the happiness on one side all the love was gone now thought dinah as trinket after trinket memorials every one of them passed through her fingers she who in the bloom of hope believed all things trusted all things had become harsh unrelenting a woman bent of her own free will though it cost her her hearts blood upon leaving her husbands side and gaston nay of him she would think no further ill to night at least the proofs little needed of his light faith she had locked away witnesses against him until the last hour that both should live but she would think no new evil of him to night she would seek her pillow leave the preparations for her journey as they stood midnight was now drawing near to morrow she thought when sleep should have renewed her strength this beginning of her changed existence this saying of mine and thine instead of ours might come easier to day was still to day they belonged outwardly in the worlds sight to each other yet there on the bedroom mantelshelf was an unfinished model gaston had made of her a sketch which had it reached marble might some day have worked its way inside the walls of the academy among the neat proprieties of her dressing table were two of his modelling tools not altogether innocent of clay there lay a half burnt cigarette a glove that he had worn ah heaven and with this passionate affection at her heart she was unloved of him had no child with tiny tender clasp to make up to her for her husbands coldness and she was still only a girl in years and life but yesterday it seemed was sweet if gaston with clairvoyant power could have seen her at this moment in her extremity of pain doubt not that the couple of hilly miles between fort william and millers hotel had proved an insufficient barrier to keep him from her side common men however have common lights to guide them they reap even as they sow when twelve oclock struck and dinahs aching head sank on its pillow gaston arbuthnot with unburthened conscience was settling himself placidly down to poker the little game of draw in which he had vouchsafed to act as mentor to the youngsters of the maltshire royals chapter xliii geoffrey calls to be paid it was a custom dating farther back than andros bartrands childhood that the seigneurs of tintajeux should hold a stiff and formal leve on the first saturday of every alternate month the ceremony shorn of its former old world stiffness lingered on and to the feminine mind was one of the most popular sarnian entertainments for andros bartrand with his fine manner his handsome face his learning his temper was scarcely less a favourite with the sex at fourscore than he had been in the flower of his age half a century earlier will this generation of progress will the coming democracy ever produce men of eighty like our seigneur the guernsey ladies conservative to a woman would ask and he who had argued that there may be higher ideals of an octogenarian than are comprised by culture originality vigorous health an arrogant profile and a courtly bow would have stood poor chance of escaping without scar from their hands the seigneur grows robuster every year remarked mrs verschoyle to cassandra tighe on the afternoon of july the tintajeux leve had opened the elder ladies were ranged along the row of white and gold arm chairs that surrounded the drawing room time stands still with andros bartrand look at him talking flirting i call it with rosie the child declares if the seigneur would only ask her she is quite prepared to answer yes what would lord rex basire say to that whispered cassandra warming up at the faintest suggestion of a love affair mrs verschoyle looked mournfully perplexed the chronic state of her good maternal overburdened soul lord rex basire one certainly seems said poor mrs verschoyle inappositely to have seen less of him since the picnic but then we have no gentleman to leave a card at the fort that is the worst of an unmarried colonel in a regiment one really can not do the polite thing does any one know i wonder a faint pink blush suffused the whiteness of mrs verschoyles cheek as some misty sequence of ideas ran through her brain does any one know if there is truth in this rumour of the arbuthnot family leaving the island i can give reliable information about one member of the arbuthnot family cried the prettiest least wise of the de carterets this young lady in the absence of better amusement had been listening to the exchange of confidences between her elders mr geoffrey arbuthnot leaves guernsey to morrow i am sure of my facts because papa went to inquire at millers after a room for fred you know mrs verschoyle that we have had a telegram from lloyds fred will be home on monday i hope your poor mother will get no shock when she sees him mrs verschoyle answered sadly not one young man in fifty brings back a constitution from india and miller said the younger mr arbuthnots room would be vacant to morrow i appreciated mr geoffrey arbuthnot highly at the subalterns picnic and should like to have seen more of him only marjorie bartrand would not let me yes miss bartrand ran on ada de carteret guilelessly but putting additional meaning in her tone as marjorie came within earshot and although this is not meant for you to hear i can tell by your face that you are listening that your conscience pricks you listening ay that was marjorie bartrand in truth outwardly listening with strained sense to the even hum of small talk that filled the rooms inwardly awaiting with the keen expectancy that hardly needs the help of bodily hearing for the step the voice whose absence already made the world blank to her i shall certainly not leave guernsey without calling on the seigneur to be paid to the cruel words to such remote and slender hope of reconciliation as they might hold forth marjories heart clung tenaciously she was softer of manner to day than was her wont played her part of hostess with studied dutifulness towards her grandfathers visitors the annual sunday school treat would come on next week said the rectoress of some remote country parish of course one might count on marjorie bartrand to lead the games had the great st laurens scandal reached tintajeux asked another matre girofle and his wife the best church people in the parish gone over to salem because the rector had cut down their pew good solid oak it must be confessed worth so much a foot in making his chancel restorations oh with what weary patience the poor child listened to it all making occasional random answer when answer was needed how utterly had her vivid childs life lost its interest how flat how dissonant was every sound on this planet to marjorie bartrand so long as the footstep for whose approach she yearned was silent why witch your cheeks are as white as your gown remarked the reverend andros happening presently to come across her we must get our cambridge esculapius to prescribe for you what is arbuthnot doing with himself added the seigneur with a hard look at his granddaughter we are short of the inferior sex to day why is arbuthnot not here to make himself useful among the tea cups afternoon parties are not much in my tutors way but i believe yes faltered marjorie with one of her dark blushes i believe at this moment i see a figure like mr arbuthnots crossing the moor we will put a tea cup in each of his hands sir as soon as we feel certain of having caught him she fled into the recess of a window in the smaller drawing room standing there shrouded by the lace draperies she wondered if more than a dozen pair of eyes had noticed her change of colour she clenched her hands until the nails impressed her soft palms painfully she essayed with will to keep her rebel cheeks from flaming her lips from weakness she marvelled by what art she could render her manner passive marjorie bartrand who during her seventeen years of life had at every pass gone aggressively to the fore for good or for evil on her tutors entrance his ring came at the front door bell mr geoffrey arbuthnot was ceremoniously announced by sylvestre the french windows stood open with the occult sixth sense which in lovers supplements the ordinary ones of sight and hearing marjorie divined that geoffrey walked at once to the lawn in search of the seigneur after a time she could hear his voice excellent spirits mr geoffrey arbuthnot seemed to be in as he made his way through the crowded outer room she caught the laughter of ada de carteret the thin gay tones of rosie verschoyle a sharp cross fire of raillery was being levelled against geoffrey on the subject of his abrupt departure marjorie could detect and misconstrue the coolness with which he turned this raillery aside by and by came a new excitement the maltshire dandies were arriving in force and in the general flutter which ensued upon this important crisis no single voice was longer distinguishable marjories pulse went quicker she knew that her time had come three or four seconds passed breathlessly then a hand drew back the curtain behind which she was half concealed geoffrey arbuthnot stood beside her i have kept my word i am here to wish you and the seigneur good bye his composed speech stirred every fibre of marjories repentant passionate heart it is a surprise geff added to find half the guernsey world at tintajeux manoir but i hope miss bartrand you can spare me five minutes quiet talk marjorie on this had no choice but to look up at him tears despite pride despite principle were in her eyes to say good bye she repeated holding out her hand then with cheeks going from rosy red to white shrinking back ere he could grasp it i i never thought you could be so cruel so the girl cared something for him after all thought geoffrey she would brush a tear away to morrow perhaps when those who travel by land or water were courteously alluded to by old andros in the litany would regret him a little as long as this summers roses lasted she would remember him until her heart if heart she possessed should be touched in earnest no more than this it was not her time to love poor marjorie and he must part from her as a strong man ought must say this is not this might have been there should be neither recrimination nor bitterness a touch of the sunburnt chiselled hand a look into the eyes which had wounded him as children wound from ignorance and then a brave and loyal farewell this time a final one a table on which lay books and photographs stood at hand geoffrey took up a photograph of the gouliots sark some glistening boulders a fishing net stretched on the shingle a break of wave how indelibly the bit of sun etching transferred itself to his brains tablets how often in dull future hours would those boulders that break of wave stand out in crisp relief before geffs memory yes he spoke in a key that only marjorie could hear for just five minutes i should like to claim you when i was at tintajeux the day before yesterday i was atrociously churlish to you miss bartrand i have been brought to see it since will you accept my apology geoffrey had been brought to see his churlishness then he held at nought her offer of truce the word it had cost her pride so dear to write he offered her this cutting rejoinder an apology you are hard upon me mr arbuthnot there was a piteous deprecation in her voice when you were my master i used to think you severe but that was the worst i believed you to be human i am afraid i am very human geoffrey took up a fresh photograph he examined it at a curiously shortsighted focus so human he added softening that i have not altogether given up the hope of your some day writing to me a formal set letter do you mean a letter said geff very low in which no thought of the tintajeux acres has place for a moment her face showed one of its old bright flashes in the world of story books it had ever been marjories pleasure to scoff at the frail impediments arising from the necessity of a third volume which keep true lovers apart should paltry reserve the thought came upon her abruptly should schoolgirl cowardice divide her as though three hundred pages of copy depended upon the quarrel from geoffrey i dont know what you would have me say i cant see why you should be off so quick i tried i hoped but while the monosyllables came haltingly from marjories tongue a stir had arisen in the larger drawing room it was plain that a group of people young men and maidens taking counsel together in a corner were bent on some kind of action their project matured quickly rosie verschoyle shot a beseeching glance at old andros as she went through a meaning pantomime of the waltz step little oscar jones with the air of a man upon whom rests an onerous embassy made his way across both rooms to marjorie ten thousand pardons miss bartrand would not intrude for the world on a tte tte fact is you see some of them want to get up a dance on the lawn a dance absurdity cried marjorie bestowing on him an ultra bartrand look then recollecting their position as hostess and guest i mean would not tennis amuse you just as well she observed with show of interest or ask gertrude de carteret to sing or but dear miss bartrand we all of us want to dance persisted the handsome little lieutenant with a smile that he had grounds for believing irresistible miss tighe volunteers to play for us beside an open window powerful backstairs interest is at this moment bearing down on the seigneur we only want an encouraging word from you i never say encouraging words it is too foolish cried marjorie detecting in her misery that geoffrey showed signs of flight to begin with we have so few gentlemen few why there are five at least of ours there is mr geoffrey arbuthnot ah going already then we must reckon without mr geoffrey arbuthnot and it seems some of the clergy dance a mild square dance and yes yes marjorie exclaimed a bevy of young girls coming up and surrounding her like the chorus in an opera it is useless for you to be wise rosie has won the seigneur to say yes miss tighe is ready the piano is on its journey to the window will you be my partner for the first waltz miss bartrand pleaded oscar jones now at any prior moment of her life marjorie bartrand deficient neither in temper nor in courage would thus attacked have held her ground stoutly but the girl saw or fancied she saw that geoffrey was eager to get away her spirit was charged to overflowing the eyes of half the people in the room were fixed upon her expectantly easier she thought before geoffrey before them all to give a coldly assenting bow than trust her voice to speak so she gave it oscar jones looked radiant thank you awfully miss bartrand this is a victory worth scoring i will just go and start the corps de ballet ask the orchestra to strike up some gay old waltz tune and return to you the corps de ballet was already setting towards the lawn cassandra tighe had taken her place at the piano beside an open window geoffrey arbuthnot and marjorie with youth with love with the heaviness of parting at their hearts were alone but their good chance was gone the thread had snapped which bound together poor marjories monosyllables two minutes later she would be treading a waltz measure the arm of mr oscar jones round her waist and geff the conqueror to whom all in whitest girlish faith had been conceded felt his blood rebel he took the reprisals of his nobler sex offered prompt italicised repetition of the crushing word apology you have accepted mine have you not miss bartrand he held his hand out steadily for a last good bye i accept the blame you choose to force on me said marjorie turning aside her face cold fettered was the speech of both still in this interval there was an encounter of pulses their hands had met the farewell pressure was a lingering one propinquity unspiritual god of youthful lovers might even at this supreme moment have set things straight had not old andros bartrand passed by looked at them smiled marjorie moved away with a start she felt as much divided from her sweetheart as though the channel already rolled between them what is this i hear about your leaving us arbuthnot the little witch has been plaguing you i suspect with her false quantities my dear sir not one in a thousand of the sex has an ear music is an art in which they have had more opportunities than we and there has never been even a third rate female composer you are going to england next week to morrow nay if it is to be to morrow we must have business talk together come with me arbuthnot to the library the situation was a crucial one for marjorie bartrand scarcely had geoffrey gone away with the seigneur her heart told her to be paid before a dapper figure tripped alertly across the rooms the well satisfied voice of little oscar jones reminded her that the first waltz was beginning that they were engaged to dance it together her cheeks tingled with the sense of her humiliation and of her helplessness oscar was in high spirits coach gone i suppose dancing not much in mr geoffrey arbuthnots line confess now miss bartrand by this time they had reached the dancers on the lawn mr joness arm encircled the girls lithe slip of a waist confess in your heart that you rate enjoyment higher than you do euclid and plato i do not understand your question i cannot deal in generalities marjorie bartrand held herself as stiffly at bay from her partner as was possible well youll enjoy our dance for instance better than being shut up in a schoolroom over musty books and figures with arbuthnot i shall not enjoy it at all without a seconds hesitation came the answer hostesses do not dance see there is ada de carteret standing out give me my freedom pray and ask her your freedom to go indoors to work a last problem write one latin line with arbuthnot no no miss bartrand you are the best dancer in guernsey and i dont often get the chance of a waltz with you for oscar jones like bigger men had his vanities the thought of cutting out geoffrey arbuthnot was tasteful to him it may be added that although marjories tongue had not lost its sharpness she was at this moment the sweetest looking girl among the little crowd of dancers the fire of strong emotion glittered in her large eyes her cheeks glowed damask her slim white clad figure showed up in exceedingly agreeable relief against the dense background of cedar shaded lawn that there was a certain dramatic interest connected with geoffreys going seemed divined by all the divination rose to a whisper among the non dancers elderly men and women who gathering on the drawing room steps enjoyed the pleasant sensations which bright sunshine a garden of flowers blue sky and the sight of young people moving to dance music can scarce fail of producing the child has a hectic flush that i do not like observed the plaintive voice of mrs verschoyle i wish any one dared ask the seigneur if the mother died of heart complaint all that class of disease is hereditary and poor marjorie is so little cared for not a creature to see whether she wears a thick sole or a thin one the archdeaconess was standing close at hand looking on at the sunshine the flowers the lightly moving figures through her accustomed smoke coloured medium madame corbie turned round with slow severity on mrs verschoyle marjorie bartrand is not a girl to die of heart disease the assertion was made with such suggestive profundity that mild little mrs verschoyle recoiled a step marjorie bartrand wants the refined observance the scrupulous exactness the dignified correctness of manner which can only be obtained at school none of your girtons none of your newnhams a strictly disciplined school such as prevailed in my young days for the formation of character and the affections i do not consider said madame corbie that marjories study of greek and mathematics has been to her advantage and yet mr geoffrey arbuthnot appears so charming so thoroughly reliable seeing her rosie joyously dancing in the distance mrs verschoyles motherly heart was disposed towards optimism on most points has a word been uttered against the reliability of any member of the arbuthnot family the question was an innocent one and still did something in its tone something in the added blankness of mrs corbies smoke coloured gaze seem to reduce the character of each of the arbuthnot trio to a ghostly possibility marjorie and her partner floated past the window at this juncture give us one more round miss tighe cried oscar in breathless staccato never danced to such a splendid tune in my life cassandra was labouring hot with her exertions through strausss first set les hirondelles or some other long buried favourite of her youth capital turf capital music a first rate partner if a dance like this he proceeded could only last for ever miss bartrand thank heaven it draws to an end said marjorie in a voice of steel a hundred yards distant across velvet lawns and beds of flower bloom she could discern the figure of geoffrey arbuthnot he walked away firm of tread erect of head from the acres of tintajeux and from her and her partners arm clasped her waist her steps twirled lightly she was hostess of the party must go through other dances must entertain the seigneurs guests to the end from this time forth marjorie knew that she could never more feel as a girl feels never enjoy with a girls enjoyment she would be a woman with the bitter taste of grown up life in her mouth from this hour onward till she died chapter xliv kismet to a naturally industrious man these islands would be the mischief the characteristic remark came from gaston who was entering his wifes sitting room just about the hour when geoffrey quitted tintajeux yes mrs arbuthnot these bachelor breakfasts these picnics these summer nights given up to card playing might well despatch many an excellent fellow along the road to ruin happily said gaston i have the capacity for large waste of time i am in no sense of the word an excellent fellow his tone was blithe the fact of his calling dinah mrs arbuthnot showed a willingness to meet contingent domestic trouble with good temper stooping down gaston arbuthnot snatched a kiss from his wifes pale lips he pressed her drooping golden head between his hands dinah wavered not in her resolves his caresses were sweet to her as ever but was not the dearness of this mans presence her danger that which should nerve her in righteous sternness towards herself and him no kiss for me my darling and pale cheeks again swollen eyes dinah you are ill something in the place really disagrees with you we will leave it you cannot stand the climate i half believe i want a change of air myself sinking down in an american rocking chair the easiest location the room possessed gaston arbuthnot propelled himself to and fro until he reached a point at which his heels were on a level with his breast he rested the tips of his boots on the corner of an adjacent couch he folded his arms in an attitude of leisurely repose upon his breast then the primary point of comfort exhaustively seen to he looked with closer heed than he had yet bestowed upon her at his wife dinah was dressed in a dark travelling serge her hair was brushed back tightly from her temples her face was bloodless the outline of her delicate features blurred by a night of tears it was impossible for her to be unlovely even with pink eyelids and swollen lips if gaston arbuthnots chisel could have compassed the tragic how exquisite a niobe had lain here to his hand it was impossible i say for dinah to be unlovely she seemed transformed rather a woman of harder colder texture than her old self when at length she raised her head slowly the eyes that looked her husband through and through were fraught with an expression that his soul knew not i want change you tell me gaston and thats true we want change both of us oh i was not in earnest about myself said gaston a little uneasily as far as health goes the place suits me well enough only one positively cannot work here now look how this week has gone he took a note book from his breast pocket he turned over page after page with a marked abandonment of his first sprightly manner this week too when i was to have got on with your bust to have begun i dont know how much besides where are you by the bye dinah i mean where is your model there is a tidy look one doesnt like about the room the model is on the top shelf in your working place although you dont like tidiness i have been putting everything as straight as i could get it to day like the good forgiving girl that you are my dear child i confess i have idled through this week disgracefully not to speak of yesterdays dinner of the old colonels breakfast of the best hours wasted those wretched cards again to day there was the initial mistake of being left behind in alderney you were left behind there i think for your own pleasure i am not so sure of that the scheme any way did not turn out a success max grimsby is the best fellow living but one ideaed you cannot get him to move save in a circle he is tethered to max grimsbys pictures if the sun had shone he would have taken me round among rocks and places to verify his sketches as he says by nature there was a most disgusting fog i could be taken nowhere i bored myself to extinction in alderney i gaston exclaimed dinah fierily dont say things of this kind if you please the time is past for them i know about the wager you had with mrs thorne before you left the steamer then you know about a very foolish matter gaston spoke with prompt self control although he reddened you have certainly been tidying with a vengeance my love he went on looking round him i miss a dozen landmarks what has become of my own priceless portraits wherever they lived poor dinah loved to hang gastons three or four latest photographs upon the walls of her sitting room i do not see your embroidery frame or yes she again interrupted i know about mrs thornes wager about everything it is a relief to speak plain at last i have known for a good long time past that you deceived me down came gaston arbuthnots feet to their normal level away flew all his assumption of serenity a couple of quick strides brought him across the room if you are bent on having one of our wretched scenes dinah look pray to your language as far as i am concerned say what you choose about mrs thorne if it gives you pleasure say what you like of course about yourself dont use disagreeable expressions when you speak of me im the kind of conceited fellow whose love really wont stand rough usage my love for you is the best possession i have i dont want to risk my best possession you understand no she did not that was the worst of it she could not see that her strong direct nature craving and athirst for affection imposed a strain beyond endurance upon a temperament at once ease loving and volatile like gastons i have never deceived you as far as i can remember dinah i have not sufficient energy of character i should imagine to be deceitful no we may have different notions of deceit perhaps one may deviate now and then from veracity said gaston recovering his good humour suppressions of fact in minor matters are forced upon us all the man would be a wretch not fit for civilised society who should for ever blurt out what he considered truth regardless of the feelings he hurt the toes he trod upon for instance to speak of something i understand if you had gone to mrs thornes house after a mess dinner it would be forced on you not to tell me of it next morning to mrs thornes house after a mess dinner such an unimportant thing may have happened once twice perhaps during the weeks we have been here but did i not mention it well then i do so now and ask forgiveness resting his hand upon her shoulder for the heinousness of my crime and your wager was that too unimportant your wager made at a time when my heart was breaking and the feelings with which linda thorne regards your winning it dinahs voice choked gaston arbuthnot was habitually a man of mild speech his most familiar men friends had never heard an english expletive escape him when he was strongly moved his tongue went back instinctively to the language of his youth and he was moved to sudden and keen anger at this moment three or four french expressions fortunately not understanded of his wife rolled from his lips you make me detest the sound of linda thornes name but take care take care in this matter of hating that you do not force me farther than you intend i would rather you hated than tolerated me cried dinah her tear worn eyes looking bravely up into arbuthnots face some new note in her voice startled him it was a note gaston arbuthnot felt that might well prove the prelude to dangerous self assertion was a tu quoque possible you do not wish me to be tolerant the husband of any excessively pretty woman must be so whether he will or not now yesterday suppose the medal reversed dinah that i begin to cross question you how did you spend your afternoon yesterday you forget let me refresh your memory with whom were you walking down the high street towards four oclock in the dove coloured dress i invented for you the gainsborough hat the cambric collar i am not jesting though you are dinah started to her feet her eyes were level with her husbands geoffrey came in after you had gone away i was idle and dull as usual and geff asked me to carry some fruit and flowers to the hospital the walk did me good we visited a devonshire sailor lad like one of my own people he seemed to me and i was able to talk with him the old country talk i love so well and afterwards coming back perhaps with my heart a little lightened i met your friend poor ill fated linda thorne and everything went dark again it was then i heard about your bet how you had won how mrs thorne was bankrupt mrs thorne had made her way into the parlour while i was out your winnings were left for you by her own hand gaston i found them the situation my dear girl grows poignant you found them gaston arbuthnot checked himself the dimensions of this domestic tragedy this storm of wifely passion over a pair of iron gray gloves overcame him with a fatal sense of the ridiculous dinah saw that he repressed a smile her righteous anger waxed hotter and i intend to keep them until i die if i mean when you see mrs thorne you can tell her so i will do nothing of the sort said arbuthnot thoroughly incensed at last this constant inquisition business grows unbearable there will be no living with you dinah if you go on nursing these puerile these childish jealousies i would no more offer an impertinence to mrs thorne than to any other lady of my acquaintance you must learn to be reasonable must i i have tried to learn much the last few days without success it is because i cant learn because i am ignorant her voice had grown hoarse her eyes dilated that i shall go away we can go as soon as you like i have told you so already said gaston coldly we can go the beginning of next week if you choose you would not object very much to my leaving cards on the few people who have been civil to me i would like to go to morrow if if you will give me money enough for the journey geff will be crossing he can see me as far as southampton after that i can easily make my way on to tavistock moor you alone why not in the old days before i married i needed no looking after and i am to follow with the luggage suggested mr arbuthnot you are quite sure there is room on tavistock moor for such luggage as ours but his tone was doubtful less and less could he understand the look yearning yet steadfast that encountered him from his wifes eyes i will take my luggage with me as near as might be i have tried to divide things i have put all belonging to you in order gaston as you will find you want to visit your people without me say it out gaston arbuthnots colour heightened this is rough harder punishment than i deserve and a risky experiment think it over twice ive been in the world thirty years dinah and have seen somewhat of most things i have never seen any good come of man and wife trying their hand at these little imitation divorces i cannot live up to your life answered dinah unshrinkingly i cannot understand you or your friends or the feelings you have for each other if i stayed i might grow myself to be well something i dont care to think of i was meant for the ways of common working people it suits me to be told things plain and straightforward to keep to my duty to find my happiness there my poor dinah have you not always kept to duty for once in his life gaston arbuthnot spoke from impulse up to this time because my heart has been full i have loved you so much there has been no room for any feeling but love this could not last for ever and you always away and others ladies born and educated not ashamed to take you from me i might grow hard i might grow vain worse yes gaston down in my heart i feel all this is possible and so if you please dont hesitate let everything he absolutely clear between us i will go home my fathers sisters i know would be willing to take me in while they live and i can work at my trade as i used of course if you will give me leave gaston arbuthnot stood for a few seconds motionless then without a word he walked to the farthest end of the room he stood gazing upon some local oil painting of an impossible first napoleon mounted on a still more impossible charger as intently as though he gazed upon one of raphaels masterpieces let anger wounded pride ah more dreaded than either let easy acquiescence be on her husbands face dinah could see it not she waited for him to speak with the tension of nerves that is a bodily pain hoping nothing the time for hope was past fearing only lest under the sting of her proposal he should tell her that he no longer loved her the truth itself had in that moment seemed small beside the possibility of his confessing it but gaston arbuthnot was not a man of coarse or cruel words i never looked for such a scene i am not good at these high passions your vehemence forces me into the sort of position i detest i have told you often dinah that in everything he leaned sideways as though seeking a point whence the impossible napoleon might be more advantageously viewed in everything i am a light weight no use asking from me the feats of an athlete in life i walk quietly in art i can produce nothing bigger or intenser than i experience in life i am what you would call poor all round poor in feeling most of all said dinah with irrepressible bitterness in the constant exhibition of feeling you mean in reiterations of i love you gaston turned having got thus far he walked back to her with marked deliberation in the art of quarrelling about nothing in showy expenditure of emotion on trifles emotion of which i take it only a limited quantity is dealt to each of us and which we should store up for large occasions in capacity of this kind i am doubtless poor if i were a moral nonentity dinah no human heart in my breast at all it would seem strange after four years companionship close as ours that you should love me still there was an inflection in gaston arbuthnots voice that overstepped the line of tenderness his face though it was calm wore an unwonted flush to dinah burning with passionate sense of injury the very reasonableness of his speech was an offence to dinah his quiet pleading seemed fine words altogether beside the present grave issue of their lives love ah i love you well as ever to my misfortune i shall love you till my death do we measure love out by the meagre quantity of it we get in return and loving me after this strong fashion you desire that we should spend our lives apart you tempt me to say a cutting thing broke forth gaston with warmth yet i believe it to be a true one a man had better be loved less dinah and that his wife should remain contentedly at his side no doubt of it if you had married an educated woman you might have been happy with her according to your notions of happiness but theres no going back on that now i exist you see yes dinah you exist and i am two and twenty and since we came to this place i scarce know why i have awakened i see my ignorance i know that i want more than i used to want in life gaston i cannot fall asleep again if you let me return among my own people i shall take to their plain country ways in time perhaps shall find a little peace at least i shall have work real work such as i was brought up to i could never plod patiently at cross stitch flowers for days and days together as i have done and i can never rise to being a lady as a week ago i thought i might then the only outlook would seem to be tavistock moor it is not a brilliant one for either of us for myself in particular turning away from her gaston took up his hat he moved aimlessly and with a dull step towards the door if i do not cry kismet with a better grace he added you must remember this sentence of widowerhood has come upon one suddenly as i think without justice but i shall not seek to stay you i wish you to take back your freedom unconditionally and so speaking and while the coldness of death seized dinahs tortured heart he left her chapter xlv labelled and corded no argument can help us geff a woman without a tithe of my poor wifes noble qualities but possessing even a faint sense of the ridiculous might be reached dinah never oh it is the absurdity of the thing which humiliates one a french song sung after a dinner party the winning of a pair of gloves said gaston arbuthnot bitterly and to think out of such materials that the jealousy of the most impracticable woman living could evolve serious tragedy tragedy returned geff of which the fifth act is as yet unconditioned dinner was over a meal at which dinah had not appeared the arbuthnot cousins side by side were pacing a remote walk of the hotel garden and geoffrey little by little had made out the truth in respect of dinahs crowning misery with his heart sore as a brave mans heart could be over keen personal disappointment geoffrey knew that he must arbitrate between the two people who stood nearest to him on earth and with whose lives his own by some fantastic stroke of destiny seemed for good and for evil to be interwoven i dont believe in rash judgments formed when the blood is hot went on gaston arbuthnot when dinah burst upon me with this new proposal i felt as if ten years of my youth had been taken from me my anger was at white heat and if i had spoken as i felt well i did not so speak i accepted my fate with a decent show of self command reviewing the position yes and remembering every word you have been saying geff i believe it may be best for my poor dinah to leave me on probation let her stay for a couple of months with her people in devonshire see how things go on and they will go on vilely they will go from bad to worse geoffrey was in no humour for putting ornamental polish on his words when does good come from a tentative separation between man and wife exactly what i said to dinah these little imitation divorces i told her are risky experiments impossible to make her hear me your eloquence must have been at fault you have had perfect happiness gaston there is the truth you have had such a lot as does not fall to one man in a million and you have grown careless of it geoffreys voice was set in a lower key than usual glancing round at him gaston surprised an expression on the strong features a glow in the dark eyes that he remembered not wholly unlike this did geff look on the late june evening when he came four years ago to his rooms in jesus and congratulated him gaston on his engagement to dinah thurston you have always been dinahs friend i thank god she will have you for her friend in the future towards myself perhaps you are a little less than kind some french proverb explains to us does it not how a mans friendship can never be perfectly equal for a husband and for his wife the french proverb is at fault as far as i am concerned said geoffrey i am your friend i am dinahs at this present hour i reprobate the conduct of both with strict impartiality my conduct is negative i find myself placed by an outburst of the eternal feminine injustice in a ridiculous position i must as men have done before me live a ridiculous position out whatever my wife desires in the way of money arrangements shall be hers on the day when she is tired of tavistock moor i shall be at her feet all this might be aptly said if you were in a stage box a critic looking on at the histrionic break up of other peoples lives with a view to the morning papers i have tried since i was a boy to regard everything concerning myself from an indifferent persons point of view the habit has become second nature and shake yourself free of it to night you are not an indifferent person you are not criticising a scene in a mixed drama you have to decide whether you gaston arbuthnot intend at thirty to be a failure or a success a failure repeated gaston his pride galled instantly in your office of peacemaker geff dont allow your good will to run away with you we have a score of big examples byron if you choose at their head to show how men of shipwrecked lives can give the world the best of their genius when you come to genius said geff grimly truthful we are off our lines we are talking of common men not of giants for a man of your calibre gaston to forfeit his domestic happiness is to forfeit all in losing dinah whatever her folly in proposing the quixotic scheme you would lose your right hand up to this time even with a good and beautiful and long suffering woman at your side your backslidings have been many do you think you are going to work onward and upward without an influence such as dinahs has been to hold you straight you speak hotly geff i feel hotly answered geoffrey without an effort at a fence my own life has been spoilt i i would say he corrected himself the happiness which men like you gaston can throw away or keep as they choose is not likely to come near me mine must be sought for in such commonplace daily work as i have strength to do this gives me a selfish interest in the welfare of the people i love your fireside and dinahs he attempted a lighter tone is the only one to which i can look forward in my old age again gaston watched his face curiously perhaps in the moments keen illumination he read aright the larger nature than his own apprehended with his balanced mixture of worldly depth and moral airiness a page whose intricacies should never in this life be wholly deciphered by poor geff himself you were right as to genius geoffrey there is an ingredient wanting in me if i had had your heart i should not at thirty be a manufacturer of third rate prettinesses for the dealers engrossed in talk the cousins paced to and fro among the falling shadows of the garden for another hour it was an hour a talk which neither of the arbuthnots would be likely to refer to which neither certainly would forget this side the grave by and by when night had come in earnest when the roses and jasmines that clung round the hotel verandahs smelt dewy sweet gaston returned to the house alone he entered through the little court that had been fitted up as his studio here a flicker of starlight overhead showed him his tools his unfinished models his working blouse all the implements of his craft neatly set in order as dinahs hand left them passing on into the parlour he found himself in darkness silence for a moment a nameless fear the possibility that she was gone contracted gaston arbuthnots heart then with soft eager step he made his way to his wifes bedroom laid his hand on the lock and opened the door by an inch a solitary light burned there may i come in dinah can i be of use to you in your packing to this she answered not or answered in so low a voice that gastons ear could not catch the sound he pushed back the door wide and entered making fast the lock behind him dinahs packing to the smallest detail was complete her boxes labelled and corded stood in a row her wraps were put up her travelling bag was strapped dinah herself sat in a low chair beside the curtained half open window the light from a hand lamp on the mantelshelf just enabled gaston to discern the dead whiteness of her tired face your packing done he asked her and have you moved these heavy boxes by yourself the frenchwoman helped me i had no need of her my arms are strong but when she insisted i thought it would look strange to refuse longer i tried to speak to her lightly just saying that i had to go away of a sudden to stay with friends in england that was wise it were a pity that idle tongues should begin to talk of us already no answer came to this gaston saw that her hands trembled as they lay tightly clasped together on her knee and about money dinah crossing the room mr arbuthnot shut down the window then placed himself at the distance of two or three feet from his wife he looked at her long and tenderly looked as though on that white strained face he saw some beauty which the dulness of his senses the selfishness of his heart had never during the past four years let him discover geoffrey and i have just had a long talk i believe as far as southampton you had better let geff be purse holder then we must think of the future we must plan as to a permanent settlement i am a poor man you know dinah or rich only by fits and starts if i can secure to you two hundred pounds a year could you make it enough dinah raised her clasped hands deprecatingly her speech failed her now in the moment when she needed strength self control most they proved traitors she could only sit faint cold sick only hear the details of her own passionate wish put into calm reasonable ay and generous detail by gaston for the first year he repeated until i become a steadier worker could you make an allowance of two hundred pounds suffice i want nothing but a few pounds at first said dinah with a desperate effort after that i will work plain sewing out door work anything they can find for me to do you might get plain sewing and out door work too without going as far as tavistock moor but i am known there i am not the sort of woman i mean as yet to make my way alone among strangers you shall neither go to tavistock moor nor among strangers you shall remain with me gaston said this with slow emphasis the law is on my side poor dinah started up the world seemed to float away from before her a piteous look in which yes amidst all its anguish there was a tremble of hope went across her blanched face my sins have been grievous enough the sins of carelessness and selfishness they have not gone deeper let the future make up for them forgive me dinah arbuthnots arms were opened wide i could not work i could not live without you i love you better than my life with a cry as of a child taken back unexpectedly to the lost shelter of home dinah fell upon his breast chapter xlvi a bye term man but no such good thing as reconciliation fell to marjorie bartrand within a week of geoffreys departure dinah and her husband bride and bridegroom once more started joyously on their way to italy there was a little wonder among the few people who had known them a little hypothetic gossip an unjust suspicion perhaps that linda thorne could clear up more secrets than one as she listed and then guernsey knew the name of arbuthnot no more marjorie bartrand must take up life at its old point before love before disappointment made acquaintance with her must stand chill and alone in the same arcadia where she stood beside geoffrey on the morning of their one days engagement must work under a new teacher in the schoolroom where every book every window pane spoke to her of the past and of the sharp irrevocableness of her loss autumn faded monotonously into the season of soft weather which in the channel archipelago does duty for winter march came again with its outside show of hope all tintajeux busy at farm work the seigneur alert of step taking part in his potato planting and his vraic harvest like a man of five and twenty later on the cuckoo flower blushed anew the rooks vociferated from the tree tops and then a little later the roses reddened marjorie bartrand conning over the entries in her last years pocket book began to know the meaning of the sombre word anniversary to day after this fashion the record ran commenced my reading with geoffrey arbuthnot many faults in my latin exercise geoffrey arbuthnot stern and inhuman have resolved to lecture a certain person on his neglect of his wife and on frivolity this day received my first letter from geoffrey arbuthnot and so through the brief drama until a final entry on sunday july the d to day geoffrey arbuthnot left guernsey for ever after which all was blank in the pocket book as elsewhere there were sombre anniversaries i say for marjorie bartrand for two or three of the young women who have flitted across the background of this story summer brought the sound of jocund bells brought a day which to each must henceforth be the one crowning anniversary dark or sunny of life rosie verschoyle took to herself a mate happily for rosie a worthier man than rex basire ada de carteret became the wife of little oscar jones marjorie enacted bridesmaid until the sight and smell of orange blossoms were a weariness to her she felt glad when weddings and summer were alike over when the scents of blown syringa and heliotrope belonged definitely to the past glad when the equinox had stript the woods and november grave and pale approached like a friend who knew her trouble and had solace in store for her for marjories character had opened out rather than altered she was a bartrand high handed as ever during the past fifteen months had worked with a courage betokening of what tough fibre her spirit was made in november a decisive step towards the alma mater was to be taken mademoiselle pouche the earliest on the tintajeux list of governesses had long besought marjorie to stay with her in cambridge and the seigneur with exceeding bad grace had tardily consented to the visit for cambridge meant girton marjorie of late had been coaching with a girton graduate who held high office in the guernsey college and was promised credentials to the highest feminine magnates of the university women who in achieving renown had lost the fairest ornament of their sex thus spoke old andros stirred by the irreconcilable antipathies of his youth antipathies which sixty subsequent years amidst a world in full progress had failed to modify the best person you could come across would be that tutor of yours arbuthnot the seigneur brought the blood into marjories cheeks by telling her this one day we must conclude that i shall die some time it is given to few men to draw breath in three centuries when i am gone you will need a husband more than the higher education i liked arbuthnot he was a shallowish classic and over full of this modern know all know nothing spirit but he was a man so many honest english stone moral and physical in him a good make weight for a bit of wandering thistle down like you the speech lingered in marjories penitent soul if things had gone differently then old andros would not have said nay to geoffreys suit her own passionate temper the jealousy that could brook no rival present or in the past were alone answerable for love forfeited for a vista of long years out of which the sweet fulness of youth at youths best should be wanting and blood warm and generous ran in marjories veins her object in visiting cambridge was of course to make personal acquaintance with girton her hopes and fears must be centred on the august ladies who in future days would be her dons but the remembrance of her lost sweetheart plucked ever at her heart if by accident geoffrey crossed her path what would be her duty that was the thing to consider duty simply as an old comrade might she not hold out her hand seek a final word of explanation at what nice point should self respect a due sense of wounded bartrand pride draw the line of unforgiveness these were not questions she could propound to her girton coach a lady of fair exterior young in years but who had recently come out well in two triposes cassandra tighe with her lowlier range of thought stood nearer to one marjorie felt her sixty winters notwithstanding in such trivial human perplexities as belong to love and lovers in these poor matters ignorance would seem to possess a spurious wisdom of its own the higher sciences assist one moderately and so on the vigil of her english journey the girl started away between the lights alone and with an overflowing heart to seek her old friends counsel it was a typical autumn evening of this mid channel region a north west wind shivered and sobbed among the poplars that hedged the entrance way of cassandras domain the garden dahlias drooped their heads the chrysanthemums with their thin half bitter odour showed wan and ghostly in the thickening dusk an irresistible sense of decay was conveyed by the fitful rustle of the falling leaves the surrounding fields and copses were shrouded in vague mist loss and uncertainty these seemed the dominant notes in the pallid landscape they suited marjorie bartrands mood were not loss and uncertainty the dominant notes of her own changed life the cottage door stood open no sound stirred within save the ticking of the old dutch clock on the stairs unannounced she made her way into miss tighes home like ground floor drawing room the weather was too mild for more than a pretence at fire the hour not late enough for lamp or candle cassandra sat unoccupied beside the scarce lighted hearth the kindly lady jumped up at the sound of marjories step then almost with an air of shame began to excuse herself for her idleness she had had a busy gardening day little credit though her borders did her and after dinner meant to practise for a couple of hours at her harp but even cassandra tighe she added must be tired sometimes i am an old woman marjorie it is the prerogative of all old people save the reverend andros bartrand to sit when the day draws in with hands folded at such times we live in the past as you young ones love to do in the future the future repeated marjorie in an under breath that is what i want to speak to you about i chose this hour on purpose the best time to talk of difficult things is entre chien et loup as the guernsey folk say she sat down somewhat dejectedly on the opposite side the hearth the young woman and the old one could just discern each others faces by the flicker of the slow burning fire so you start for cambridge to morrow and your grandfather i hear gives you a letter to the master of matthias well marjorie though you should fail to girtonise the spanish nation eventually i must praise you for your present cleverness in girtonising the seigneur of tintajeux the seigneur was never more obdurate if it pleased my granddaughter to roam the country with an organ and a monkey she would do it i could only see that the organ and the monkey were good of their kind this is his charming way of putting things his excuse for giving me an introduction outside of newnham or girton and your coach miss travers is to be your escort she is comelier than one could have expected poor thing i have no prejudices as everybody knows said old cassandra when i heard a girtonite was coming to our college i held my peace if one of these emancipated young women has regular features or a bright complexion i acknowledge the fact still one wonders how such a girl as miss travers could choose the higher life instead of marrying some man like lord rex basire say or mr oscar jones those two are not the only types of man extant observed cassandra to this there succeeded a sufficiently pregnant silence marjorie broke it with effort her voice had become unsteady her sentences were disjointed we are to stay one night in london i dont know whether grandpapa told you about the plans next day we shall see whatever sights are visible through the november fog and late in the afternoon i shall run down to cambridge it is high time i learned to knock about the world alone if i work steadily when we come back to guernsey very likely i may go up to girton as a bye term man in january is this the future you wanted to talk about cassandra tighe bent forward she looked hard at the slim girlish figure the delicately feminine face of marjorie bartrand you must learn to knock about the world alone you will go up in january as a bye term man these prospects may be intoxicating we require i think no assistance from the friendly half light to discuss them in the remark went home marjories ill fated love affair had long been an open secret between her and old cassandra tighe and in a few minutes time half confidences were over reserve had gone to the winds geoffrey arbuthnots name for the first time for months was on the girls trembling lips i am not likely to be over forward again miss tighe but strive as i will the longing overcomes me to see mr arbuthnot before he marries some one else to give him a last chance of explanation the word the one word i wrote that miserable afternoon may never have reached him when i heard mrs arbuthnot was out marjorie made confession my courage went from me i had hoped to leave my packet safe in dinahs hands and i just gave it without a message to the servant who answered my ring then i drove away fast for fear geoffrey should meet me and see my face the arbuthnot people were a singular trio cassandra made the remark with an irrelevant neutrality savouring of the serpents wisdom the best looking of the men not your tutor marjorie is doing good things it seems as an artist colonel de gourmet has a correspondent in florence where the gaston arbuthnots live and the accounts of them are favourable you know of course that there is a miss arbuthnot yes i have heard the news it is good to think that dinah must be a happier woman now we shall not see such a face again on our shores do you remember my mistake about her marjorie the lecture i made you read your tutor on his frivolity you ask me questions instead of answering mine miss tighe if i should meet him if through blind accident i should speak to geoffrey again would it be delicate would it show proper womanly pride for me to attempt one last explanation cassandra did not instantly reply the sobbing of the wind had died among the poplars the leaves fell noiselessly to the damp earth only the ticking of the clock on the stairs broke silence for ever never never for ever and with each second thought marjorie how many human loves must be laid low how many hearts must begin to ache for all time as hers was aching now miss tighe sat calm and placid as when the girl first entered her hands folded on her knee and what earthly inducement had pouche to settle in a university town she observed at length why does the woman live alone her father was matre descrime in cambridge she and her mother live on in the house where he died i rather think mademoiselle gives french lessons still oh mademoiselle gives french lessons still does she cassandras tone was absent she rose moved closer to the hearth her face was level with the miniature portrait of a lad in old fashioned uniform that hung there by and by i am going she said very low to tell you something about which i have been silent for forty years miss tighe dont be afraid of an old womans prosy history or of a sermon you will have neither forty years ago child there lived in the far north of england a girl somewhere about your present age this girl was on the eve of being married her wedding dress was ordered the guests were bidden well at the eleventh hour she chose in a flame of paltry jealousy to resent some fancied want of devotion in her lover he was single minded loyal of finer stuff altogether than herself they might have been reconciled in an hour if she would have let her heart speak have returned to the arms outheld to receive her the girl would make not an inch of concession she came as you do marjorie of people who look upon unforgiveness as a virtue she heard around her the old stock phrases delicacy family pride the righteousness of subordinating feeling to will and so it came to pass that the lover having neither wealth nor title was allowed to go he exchanged into a regiment under orders for india our troops were then in afghanistan engaged in hot fighting and miss tighes voice the brave kind voice that marjorie had always known broke down marjorie felt herself turn chill with a vague terror to hear of this white haired womans love seemed in her overstrained mood like receiving a message from the world of ghosts she awaited the sequel of the story not speaking not lifting her eyes to the narrators face the lad fell a locket his sweetheart had once given him hidden in his breast it came back to her through a brother officer who knew something of the dead mans story and with a stain on it that stain has marked every day of a lonely life throughout forty years you will not speak of this again remember never miss tighe i promise you but keep my words in your memory if you meet geoffrey arbuthnot if a moment comes when happiness beckons one way the bartrand pride another they may perhaps be of use to you so human hearts can remain true to their griefs for forty years marjorie pondered on this fact as she walked back through the november smelling dark country to tintajeux she felt with the certainty of morbid eighteen that her own life would be a counterpart of cassandra tighes she would never love any other man than geoffrey would never marry where she did not love she was not likely to die in the glow of her young health feeling her limbs so lithe the mere act of walking and breathing an ever renewed bodily pleasure death lay over an horizon which she had not yet sighted ah if she could hear geffs step approaching now if she could feel his hand clasp strong friendly as in the days of old the collective pride of the whole bartrand race would not long stand between them but the mirk lanes were forsaken no human step save her own was to be heard the lights were lit in the scattered cottage homesteads the children at play round the fire the elders resting after their days work through the low windows marjorie could see one family group after another as she passed along and felt her own loneliness the greater as she came near tintajeux the cry of the owls than which no more freezing sound exists in nature was all that gave her welcome that stain has marked every day of a lonely life throughout forty years the moral of miss tighes story lingered in marjories heart as she and her grandfather sat for the last time together over dessert old andros took not unkindly notice of her white cheeks and darkened eyes you must get back your good looks before you show yourself in cambridge women are sent into the world to be graceful when they fail in that they fail in everything be a senior wrangler if you will but keep your complexion you have grown much more like your father of late this was the highest form of praise andros bartrand could offer her dont go back to the little skinny spanish witch of former days i wish i could sir cried marjorie a flash of quickly roused mutiny in her eyes the days when i was a little skinny spanish witch were better than any i am likely to know again in this world chapter xlvii beside the cradle i just feel we are too happy it makes me tremble gaston i would rather see the speck of cloud no bigger than a mans hand than for ever live in dread of it you would rather have anything than the actual my dear that is a little weakness of the sex surely your daughter ought to fill every crevice of your dissatisfied heart she fills it fuller than my heart can hold my own sweet baby she is a wonderfully forward child is she not so strong of her age so intelligent so beautiful not beautiful dinah i am no amateur of infants although i can tolerate their presence after the age of two years as regards the particular infant sleeping in the cradle yonder even my knowledge of the subject enables me to say she is unornamental as unornamental a child as could be found in florence she is your living portrait returned the mother unconscious of irony yes even to her shrewd looks to the firm way she clasps her fingers and already in that murmured dinah penitently it may be she favours me already baby has a temper these exceedingly domestic confidences were interchanged in a vast old florentine room fitted up by gaston arbuthnot as a studio and on a november night some forty eight hours later than the gray evening when marjorie paid her farewell visit to cassandra tighe but november in florence is a different season to november in the english channel the dry nipping touch of italian winter had already made itself felt beside the banks of the arno and the blaze from an up piled heap of olive faggots cast a ruddy glow upon the room and its occupants gaston arbuthnot his days work done reclined outstretched in one of his favourite american chairs beside the hearth on the other side the fire was a cradle wickered capacious of the genuine italian build that you may remember in many a sixteenth century picture and beside this cradle stood dinah serious of mien gazing with rapt madonna like devotion at the little english child who slept there at gastons last remark she stooped and drew a muslin curtain tenderly over her daughters face then she came across to her husband she sank on her knees beside him stealing a soft arm round mr arbuthnots neck dinah brought his cheek within reach of her lips honestly and without jesting you can say you think the child ugly i think she will never be as handsome as her mother the better for herself perhaps beauty is a snare who should know that better than dinah arbuthnot if i had been well plainer than i am would you have sought me out i wonder in aunt sarahs little cottage that summer difficult to speculate backwards i had thought some plainish women charming before i heard the name of lesser cheriton that is a matter of course you had been the friend of linda thorne linda smythe as she was at that time i dont know that cette chre smeet could ever be called charming she was lively apt a thorough mistress of situation and inexhaustively talkative to a boy fresh from school that gift of talkativeness goes for much she lacked charm i have heard her mourn over the deficiency in her plaintive little way poor soul with tears how calmly they spoke of lindas qualities this darby and joan of nearly six years standing to whom romance in its earliest sweetest bloom would seem to have returned from what a different standpoint dinah could review the sentimental dilemmas of gastons youth how the renewal of their love had bettered them man and woman alike sometimes when i look back upon our guernsey days the days i mean which followed on that langrune picnic i feel a great remorse things ended happily because you would not let my jealous temper ruin both our lives possibly thought gaston arbuthnot because of geff he remembered their talk when the summer eve was sinking into darkness the eve upon whose morrow dinah would fain have quitted him for ever but i deserved the heaviest punishment that could have fallen upon me jealousy such as mine was then means selfishness not love spoken from a fine moral height all the same dinah i think you did love me slightly i was unjust to linda thorne about your wager when i opened the packet she left for you i was dishonourable the whole thing may have been a jest may have belonged to a time before you knew me at all i recollect telling you i would keep that packet always well gaston i wish now i had never seen it there is a drawer in my dressing case i have not once since had courage to open gaston arbuthnot turned his head studying his wifes face closely some suspicion of possible mistake began to dawn upon him are you certain as to your facts dinah a drawer you say in your dressing case which you never have found courage to open and why not i confess to being out of my depth lindas gloves honestly lost by her honestly paid lay on the parlour mantelshelf of this i am positive from the mantelshelf i naturally transferred them to my pocket gloves what else you do not suppose poor linda and i made bets of twenty pound notes but the word she wrote for you the flower the ribbon ah gaston cried dinah hurriedly let us never have another misunderstanding i was wrong criminal if you choose in opening a cover that was not directed to myself but i suffered for my wrong doing you should know that and you may be frank with me now i am not so weak that you need hide a syllable of the truth i put the gloves in my pocket gaston arbuthnot reasserted and to the best of my remembrance wore them out in about a fortnight they were iron gray a pair of iron gray gloves would last one ten days or a fortnight would they not on this dinah arbuthnot started to her feet she remembered gastons talent of old for calm mystification and her heart fired i have not re opened the subject for amusement gaston to show you that i would make amends in earnest i will fetch the packet this moment i shall feel easier when it is in your keeping to destroy or keep as you choose taking up a hand lamp dinah passed into a neighbouring chamber when she returned in three or four minutes time there was a pallor about her lips a threatening of tears the like of which during the past fifteen months had been happily absent in her voice baby has moved has she not i thought i heard her from my room the infant sneezed answered gaston arbuthnot with gravity much to my terror sneezing might suggest waking and to be alone with a waking baby recalls dr johnson and the tower bring your wonderful packet here she had paused for a moment beside the childs cradle and let us have the scene out we will never have a scene again while we live poor dinah sank into her former kneeling position she rested her cheek against her husbands coat sleeve indeed i think it might be fairer to you more generous to linda thorne to close the matter thus she held the packet in the direction of the flames with a quick movement gaston arbuthnots hand stayed her he drew the contents forth from the envelope he read marjorie bartrands one word then he glanced at the blackened flower stalks at the bit of tarnished spanish ribbon and could you believe in the full possession of your reason wife that this was meant for me dinahs head drooped lower she coloured violently could you believe that linda thorne a woman who has travelled over half the habitable globe alone picking up experience everywhere linda a woman of tact a woman of the world would commit herself to sentiment of doubtful application set down in black and white i never stopped to reason the heart within me was too sore i knew linda thorne had called i saw that the envelope was directed to you or to geoffrey which it is as you see addressed simply mr g arbuthnot but mrs thorne and geff disliked each other do you think even in jest she would my best dinah let a molehill which during fifteen months has been assuming gigantic size return forthwith to molehill proportions this handwriting may be marjorie bartrands one can imagine a classico mathematical girl making that kind of e it is certainly not lindas and the meaning of the solitary word repentance ah you must read your own riddles answered gaston with suavity poor linda and myself made an innocent wager of gloves which i won i know no more dinah rose hastily she turned her face away from the fires light amidst the full happiness of the last year in her wifely rejoicing over gastons progress in his art in the flood of charity towards all men which had come upon her with the new delights of motherhood she had always dreaded the cloud no bigger than a mans hand had always remembered the secret which a jealously locked drawer of her dressing case hid out of sight her moral attitude towards gaston had perforce been a stooping one an attitude of dumb forgiveness believing in the present hoping all things for the future it had not been possible for her wholly to forget the past in this moments sharp enlightenment this unlooked for vindication of gastons loyalty her first sensation was one of relief succeeding it so swiftly that dinah distinguished not where relief ended and pain began there swept across her the keenest shame which in her fair untarnished life her soul had ever known you believe that the letter came from marjorie bartrand the question fell from her lips almost unconsciously one suspects the greek es and see here in this corner is the bartrand crest an eagle with a bad tempered beak and upheld claw take back your own wife your cherished vendetta i will have none of it and you think she cared really for poor geff marjorie was seventeen years old the season of the year was june they bent their heads together over the same schoolroom table even i i who have been so long out of the running saw whither things tended as early as the rose show geff no doubt after a platonic mode admired the budding girton girl a girl said gaston narrow mindedly far too pretty for her calling there came a breeze between them geoffrey hinted as much to me the night before he left guernsey a threatening of storm which if a certain letter had not been kidnapped might have cost him his life i mean his liberty there and then by this time the blood had gone from dinahs cheeks and all this was brought about through me through my small self engrossed jealousy oh gaston how sinful i was how guilty i am still but for me geoffrey might long ago have come to happiness he was our best friend always and i betrayed him i am the veriest wretch on earth tears of repentance rushed to dinahs eyes you do not mention a slight reparation you owe to linda thorne observed gaston with his shrewd smile you forget that something may be due also to me even me a husband i was ill body and mind that miserable day i had scarce had an hours sleep since i came back from langrune without you a flimsy excuse poor dinah faltered and yet the only one i have to offer it is the excuse in vogue the big social scientists put just the same plea forward for the criminal classes crime is an illness a man may run a knife into another simply because his digestion reacting on the nerve centres happened to be out of order probably like you my dear the poor fellow had been suffering from insomnia such excuses added gaston are comforting enough for the man with the knife but scarcely so consolatory to him stabbed dinah touched the flower stalks wistfully she folded the ribbon with care before returning it to the envelope her hands trembled in her excitement you talk about reparation i shall not let an hour be lost i shall write to miss bartrand at once send back her own letter and confess oh gaston the hard word is yours that twas i kidnapped it you mean to perform this act of contrition for geoffreys sake i do poor geff after getting decently out of danger once and his letters dont savour of a broken heart it seems a trifle rough on him to have the thing revived poor geff echoed dinah her eyes glistening through their tears you call a man poor who has a chance of winning marjorie bartrands love does our happiness make you such an egotist the reader will note that dinahs vocabulary was enlarging such an egotist you do not care for other people to marry or are you like the fox in the fable my dear child which dinah rested her clasped hands upon her husbands shoulder and cogitated softly yes i shall write to tintajeux to night if it is not too late if the hearts of both are free miss bartrand will find some way of letting geoffrey know the truth of that you may be assured if two women are to conspire together in league against him i say poor geff with still more marked emphasis and rising gaston moved in the direction of the door in these later days in the confidence of established love dinah had thought it no grievance that her husband should join the florentine artists club or spend a portion of every evening in other society than hers like all true women you are a remorseless match maker he told her unless the flame between these two victims is clean burnt out you will contrive by your letter to re kindle it i wish i were a better scribe that i could put my heart between the lines oh i must begin at once baby shall be left for the first time with old giacintha and i will run round to the piazza and post the letter myself five years hence i hope geoffrey will bless you for having written it there was a flash of temper not to be forgotten in marjorie bartrands handsome eyes and if there was if a woman has a temper even a jealous one is it impossible for her husbands life to be happy dinah had followed gaston to the door she held up her face the loveliest face in florence said the artists who worked therein for his kiss all men are not philosophers gaston arbuthnot made reply i have learnt tolerably dear the lesson cost me not only to exist in a stormy atmosphere but to flourish there and this is what dinah wrote not troubling herself over possible faults of syntax not making a fair copy in the slanting pointed handwriting to which after much labour she had tediously attained this is what dinah wrote straight out from her heart florence november my dear miss bartrand i have just found with shame and remorse that i did you grievous wrong last july twelvemonth you were the kindest friend save geff that ever i met and i repaid you little meaning it with treachery perhaps when you see the enclosed you will guess what bitter confession i have got to make dear miss bartrand i found your envelope on the mantelpiece of our parlour at millers hotel and i committed the meanest action of my life i broke it open and because i was blind with selfish trouble and thought of my own suffering before all things i kept the letter i have had it in my possession till this hour it would be poor excuse to say i mistook the person it was meant for as well as the hand that wrote it it would be cowardice to say my heart was too hot too miserable to reason i sinned and if my sin has stood between my best friends and happiness my punishment will last me my life unless i make too bold may i hope some future time you will let geoffrey read what i now write ask him to think of july the st the day i went with him to guernsey hospital it was on that day a quarter of an hour after geoffrey left me at the sight of some one he will remember that i found your letter dear miss bartrand i am the penitent and humble well wisher of your happiness dinah the letter was directed to tintajeux manoir guernsey and posted by the writers hand on the night of november a sharp italian night with the swollen arno swirling the moonlight lying in ebon and ivory patterns along the florentine streets with only one person so it seemed to dinahs beating heart abroad in the sleeping city at the same hour marjories eager eyes looked forth through rain and fog through the blurred obscurity of a great eastern carriage window upon the lamps of cambridge chapter xlviii happiness madame pouches house the goal of the girls journey belonged to history a thatched lozenge windowed structure of which the pargeted gables the black oak joints and plaster panels abutted with pathetically incongruous air as of some aged spinster at a ball on one of the brisk modern thoroughfares of the town a brass plate engraved pouche was on the front door conferring a semi professional character upon the mouldering household although the fencing master honest man had lain for twenty years in pre la chaise and madame pouche had no more ostensible livelihood than such small sums as mademoiselle gained by the teaching of her language their plate raised them to the plane of citizens the mother and daughter formed units in that curious gathering of poor french people which exists in our university towns decayed families of fencing masters hair dressers or cooks once prosperous who shiver through english fog and cold to the end of their existence because they are dans leurs meubles ratepayers to quit her dark old home to forego the sound of great st marys curfew to submit her furniture to the hammer of the auctioneer would to madame pouche have seemed little short of sacrilege she passed her life with no larger pleasure than knitting no acuter pain than rheumatism she could go to mass on sundays and festivals with more security in cambridge than in france pouches foils and masks were suspended in the raftered entrance hall pouches portrait as a glossy bachelor of twenty with black frock coat turn down collar and gamboge gloves hung in the salon upstairs in one of the low ceiled attics were her crucifix and bnitier just as she brought them from far provence before her first child saw the light such things to an aged woman are more than climate more than nationality madame pouches lot had not been rose coloured during the fencing masters life at the time of his death even monsieur was in paris led thither by some of the unexplained affairs which perennially drew him from his own fireside but his widow clung to the foils and masks and portrait with as much patient fidelity as though he had loved her always the careless husband who lay in pre la chaise belonged to madame pouches middle age the foils the masks the glossy bachelor with gamboge gloves and turn down collar were relics of her youth every corner of the house was burnished to that vanishing point of cleanliness which only french housewives understand on the evening of november ere marjorie had well alighted from her cab an unforgotten figure rushed forth through wet and darkness to meet her a pair of kind solid arms held her fast but you are tall but you are fresh and vermeille mademoiselle pouche hurried the girl across the strip of pavement to the house i see no more the little cendrillon of old days come then mre leave thy kitchen come that i may present thee to our future girton girl madame pouches cheeks were swarthy as the olives of her native country an ample checked apron was tied round her neat black dress she wore the provincial linen head dress of her youth genuine french people do not shake hands on every occasion of human life and fifty english years had left madame pouche a genuine frenchwoman still the old lady came forward not with a hand outstretched but with such natural courtesy such charming welcome written on her southern face as reminded marjorie of spain and caused her somewhat flagging spirit to rally i feel six years old again dear pouche this she said when mademoiselle had led her into the salon a tiny panelled room where a table was cosily spread for a dinner of two before the fire surely we had our lessons this morning surely i was wicked when was i not wicked and you gave me a double row of spelling for my penitence throughout the evening a mysterious sense of having gone back to her childhood fell balmily on marjories heart madame pouche gave them a little dinner as exquisitely cooked i dare to say as was any dinner in trinity or magdalen that night for dessert were tintajeux pears of which a goodly hamper had come over as a present from the seigneur their coffee was served in svres cups dislodged for the occasion from madame pouches inlaid cabinet the costliest ornament of the salon brought with her in bridal days from paris when the nineteenth century was in its teens it is like a tintajeux holiday cried marjorie as she and pouche sat hand clasped in hand beside the fire do you remember every th of may we used to eat our dinner under the big oak in honour you said of le martyr protestant charles the prayer books in the tintajeux family pew were of ancient date pouche honest creature was wont to entangle herself among the various stuart and orange services greatly to the seigneurs edification ah pouche we are wiser now we have learnt history from loftier historians than lady callcott and i for one am not happier whenever i look at tintajeux i see a small marjorie with temper with eyes with a determined spanish face and whom i loved much there are no figures in the picture still whenever i look at tintajeux mademoiselle pouches voluble tongue stopped abruptly no figures in the picture marjorie glanced round the empty walls and what picture are you talking of where is the photograph of the manoir i sent you last christmas as she spoke madame pouche entered bearing a fresh trimmed lamp for this little household boasted of no parlour maid the old frenchwoman lingered a while her quick septuagenarian eyes watching the faces of her daughter and of their guest she had caught marjories last words the photograph of tintajeux manoir why it has been moved upstairs it hangs in the salon of our gentleman notre bon locataire pas vrai ma fille mademoiselle pouche put the interruption quietly aside mre loses her memory we must not always heed her she observed to marjorie presently in bygone days when the good papa was living our family received undergraduates as lodgers mre has the old time in her heart still jesuitry pouche i remember your talents in that line in bygone days when the good papa was living no photograph of tintajeux manoir existed the remark was accompanied by a bartrand look as familiar as smiting to poor pouche as though she and marjorie had done battle over some delicate point of moral faithfulness that very morning there are accidents contingencies nay times being hard there is necessity as well confess the truth we do not take lodgers pouches eyes dwelt fondly on the inlaid cabinet the porcelain the exquisite order of the little salon we are private citizens rentires living on our means and there is no one in the house save yourselves a flourish of pouches fingers hinted negation the old place is in fact two houses as you will see by daylight there are rooms at the back that can be entered by a flight of open air steps steps dating from the fourteenth century ma mie you promised me truth not history mademoiselle and by hazard for the moment we have a locataire not an undergraduate we spare a room or two on occasion to some quiet gentleman some resident ma some student from the art schools no undergraduate sets foot within our doors we are not licensed so keen a sense of distinction was conveyed by the italicised words that marjorie forebore from further questioning an hour later however when they were parting for the night in the fresh chintz draped attic which was the guest chamber of the house she ventured on a last surmise as we passed a certain baize door at the turning of the stairs i smelt the smell of a pipe our bon locataire must live somewhere in that neighbourhood mademoiselle our quiet gentleman who is not an undergraduate and who has the photograph of tintajeux manoir on his walls but pouche was blankly uncommunicative the gentleman went in and out by the other staircase marjorie would neither see nor hear him during her stay in cambridge as to the photograph it would certainly return to its place in the salon to morrow morning if you are afraid of university ghosts added the frenchwoman as she bade her guest a final good night you will do wisely to bolt your door sleep well ma mie and dream that we are making cowslip balls as we used a dozen years ago in the woods of tintajeux the first five days of her cambridge visit were resolutely spent by marjorie in sight seeing it was well for her she said to come under the external influences of the alma mater watch the cheerful flow of undergraduate life look at newnham and girton from without before delivering her letters of introduction it was well for her while she still stood uncommitted to the future to run a last forlorn chance of meeting the man she loved here was the truth unrecognised perhaps as truth even in marjorie bartrands moments of sternest self questioning day after day however slipped vainly by a dozen times in each twenty four hours her heart would leap her pulses throb as men of geoffreys height or build went past her in the crowded streets geoffrey arbuthnot appeared not she fell to quarrelling with herself over her own folly geoffrey might be at the other side of the world married contented in every case must have learnt long ago to live his life to do his work without her happily there were reprisals on the morning of the sixth day she determined to put her sweetheart away from her remembrance for ever i have come to the end of my sight seeing this she told the pouches at breakfast i have heard a university sermon and the services at kings and trinity we have visited trumpington churchyard and the backs i have seen miltons tree and grays fire escape and and the girton girls playing tennis when i have gone over your house madame pouche when i know what kind of rooms reading gentlemen inhabit my experience will be complete the speech fell from her idly small curiosity in the affairs of others was never a sin to be reckoned among the bartrand qualities but mademoiselle pouches manner gave it purpose mademoiselle changed colour fidgeted with her coffee spoon contradicted herself the rooms were the plainest rooms in cambridge no knowing at what time our gentleman went out or might return for herself she seldom entered his part of the house and pouche exclaimed marjorie the old spirit of contradiction taking possession of her there is a mystery about our excellent lodger which i mean to solve you seldom enter his part of the house you say you were in his rooms last evening i saw you enter through the baize door as i have seen you do pretty often already i heard your voice as you talked to him explain these things enfin it would be better if the truth were told said old madame pouche in her own language our gentleman is an enemy of the sex what will you have when he heard a young lady was coming to visit us he offered of free will to go in and out by the other stairs interrupted pouche adroitly he showed the finest most delicate consideration since that first evening when marjorie perceived his pipe our gentleman has not smoked he goes out early he does not return until he is worn out with work such work as his is too at night then it is impossible we can disturb him exclaimed marjorie rising briskly from the table as a matter of architecture i am interested in the fourteenth century stairs the rooms they lead to must be equally curious you need not chaperon me she looked back at pouche across her shoulder i shall push back the mysterious red baize and walk straight into bluebeards chamber without knocking and running up the stairs she was about to put her threat into execution when pouche by a dexterous flank movement cut off her advance there may be a litter of papers grand ciel there may be the bones the skull with her hands upon the lock mademoiselle pouche barred marjories progress by her own solid person then opening two inches of door she peered in cautiously no we are in order we have locked up our skeleton for once you may enter child barbe bleu is not here to eat you marjorie bartrand stopped short upon the threshold something in the meagrely furnished room the piles of books the small fireless grate the absence of any pretence at decoration or cheerfulness affected her strongly she shrank from intruding unbidden on such valiantly borne poverty as was here in evidence before her and you have robbed him of tintajeux manoir she glanced round at the bare damp stained walls tintajeux at least gives one a notion of quick and wholesome air of honest sunshine our gentleman robbed himself when i told him the morning after your arrival that you had asked for it he took the photograph from his wall with his own hand and you can give him no other picture to fill its place he has a magnifique picture here facing the window see pouche adjusted herself into a favourable light with an air of connoisseurship a magnifique portrait just a little mildewed of king william the fourth the fur on his majestys cloak has been the admiration of many artists come in ma mie entrez what are you afraid of and marjorie entered she looked for a few seconds at the time stained mezzotint which with its black frame its cheap glass seemed but to make the wall whereon it hung more sorrowfully ugly then she crossed to the rooms one window a diamond leaded casement through whose small dulled panes the side view of a crowded alley of the corner of a still more crowded churchyard was attainable a ponderous book lay on a chair beside the window marjorie bartrand lifted it marjorie i forbid you to touch a book our gentleman studies for medicine medical works are not for the perusal of young girls the girl of the future peruses everything quains elements of anatomy cried marjorie holding the volume as high out of pouches reach as its weight would allow i wonder whether our gentleman would lend it to us if we asked him prettily we might study our bones together pouche who knows in days to come that i may not go for a natural science tripos and with the book still held aloft her nimble fingers found their way to the title page in the top right hand corner was a name written in characters she knew geoffrey arbuthnot january for an instant marjorie bartrand turned ashen pale then as she recalled her position as she realised that she had forced herself unasked into geoffrey arbuthnots room the poor child crimsoned from throat to brow she felt that the very soul within her had cause to blush over her temerity let us come away this moment i am taken by surprise there has been some cruel mistake the book almost fell out of her grasp swiftly as her limbs would carry her she made her way out of the room and down the stairs then when they were safe again in the little salon she caught pouches hand with passion i look to you mademoiselle for an explanation she cried with impetuous voice with flaming eyes what right had you to conceal from me that geoffrey arbuthnot lived here but pouche had the strength of conscious innocence all further need of mystification was over now regarding their lodger as a shy recluse an enemy of the sex the two poor french ladies had striven with will to keep him and their visitor from meeting this was the secret of their reticence the sum of their offending mademoiselle pouche met marjories lightning glance calmly mre and i had nothing to conceal how could it have interested you to hear a strangers name and you have never spoken of me in his presence if we did it was by hazard why should marjorie bartrand of tintajeux be more than any other young lady to mr geoffrey arbuthnot simply returned marjorie closely watching pouches unmoved face simply because mr geoffrey arbuthnot had the picture of tintajeux hanging on his walls by hazard also he took a fancy to the photograph from the first day he came to lodge with us it had a look of scotland it recalled some place where he had known good times and so to give him pleasure i said that while he lodged here tintajeux should hang above his chimney piece from whence it was unhung by his own hand to please the caprice of an unknown visitor mr arbuthnot is very generous mr arbuthnot cried pouche warming on the instant is the most noble hearted man living yes and i have travelled i have had my experiences widened i know my world that he should work hard at the hospital or over his books i comprehend a high degree is at stake men have their ambition mr arbuthnot goes into courts and alleys vile places left alone by the police and where priests or parsons might get their throats cut he searches out the worst outcasts in barnwell and chesterton only to serve them now at this present time stammered marjorie conscience stricken now while you and i mon enfant have been sight seeing his last protg went on pouche is a miserable bargeman one of the worst characters on the river this man was struck over the head by some falling timber two or three weeks ago he was too nearly gone so his mates thought to be carried to hospital and our gentleman just saved his life he has nursed him day and night since as one of your great london doctors would nurse a prince of the blood if mr arbuthnot were of our religion i could understand it i visit in barnwell myself a very little this was pouches account of her own charities she visited in barnwell a great deal beside fever stricken dying pallets her acquaintance with geoffrey arbuthnot had first begun but we catholics see in the poor our own sick soul we hope in saving them to save ourselves and geoffrey arbuthnot he serves them gives them his time his money what do i know his heart simply because they are castaway men and women sisters and brothers in a queer disguise you should hear him say that with his grave smile it was to talk over some of the sisters and brothers marjorie that i went to our gentlemans rooms last night our gentleman ought to be a happy man said marjorie with a sigh the frenchwomans shoulders were sceptically expressive a hair shirt is never worn for pleasure child it is not in nature that a man of six and twenty should care for other peoples lives more than for his own geoffrey arbuthnot might have made a good servant of the church an ignatius loyola a francis xavier but if one speaks about happiness allez chapter xlix from dinahs hand these things sank heavily on marjories bruised heart she felt that geoffreys indifference to herself was now an ascertained fact nay that his fancy for her at no time worthy of a higher name had turned to repugnance he had asked her to be his wife under the glamour of a picturesque moment a friendship unique in its conditions from the beginning suddenly taking upon itself a surface likeness to passion a true lover would not have availed himself so readily of his chance of freedom would not have magnified his mistresss heat of temper into a crime would not have rejected the fullest amends that woman could offer short of falling upon her knees in the dust before an offended sweetheart mademoiselle pouche was overjoyed when the girl announced herself ready next day to deliver her letters of introduction we shall see what such presentations lead to exclaimed the kindly soul her round face beaming a dinner here a lunch there the highest gentlemen in cambridge to be met at each i predict a succs fou not all the world let me tell you brings such letters to the university by after to morrow you will have every evening of your week engaged the university will keep its head dear pouche a singularly insignificant young person from the channel islands runs no risk of becoming a sensation the highest gentlemen in cambridge will pay marjorie bartrand just attention enough to ask her name and forget it nevertheless on the score of invitations pouches forecast proved a true one before night arrived a friendly invitation bidding marjorie to dine at the house of the master of matthias next day as miss bartrand looked forward to studying in cambridge the note added a lady high in authority at girton had been asked to meet her of that girton lady i speak not observed pouche when the hour came on the morrow for marjorie to dress about newnham and girton i am dumb imagine pouche dumb on any subject earthly or terrestrial i have lived by brain work i have been a teacher over nineteen years see my whitening hairs my lost illusions my disenchantments in that sad trade the womans heart breathes not make yourself charming fillette the most distinguished society of cambridge is to be met with at the table of the master of matthias for a child of eighteen there may be better things in store than coming out high in a tripos yes or standing on a level with the first wrangler of them all marjories presumptive triumphs caused the whole pouche household to expand wax candles rare extravagance stood lit before her mirror flowers were on her toilette table her white dinner dress with its simple adjuncts was lovingly laid ready for her by mademoiselles hands but in marjories restless heart there was no place for pretty dresses for anticipation of social success she drew aside her curtain she gazed down through a chink of blind upon the street hoping against hope as she had so often done before to discover the face of her false sweetheart among the passers by it was the most crowded hour of the short november day athletic men were there returning in flannels and wrappers from the river or the piece sporting men from the hunting field reading men from their trudge along the wranglers walk of pifflers an abundance men with terriers men with button holes men in dog carts the whole many coloured undergraduate world alert self engrossed drawing together the curtain marjorie bartrand moved back to her looking glass she stood confronting the pale serious eyed vision that met her there with a kind of pity she was so young and the years to come were so many disappointed years under whose weight she must stand upright give no sign she winced beneath their burthen wear a brave countenance work she felt that she hated cambridge this ceaseless ebb and flow this turmoil of exultant successful youthful life was not tintajeux with its dying woods its still moorland a fitter drop scene for the little played out drama of her personal happiness as marjorie meditated the sharp sound of the postmans knock made her start no letter of more vital interest than a despatch from the seigneur was likely to reach her and yet her breath quickened her mood throughout the day had been one of feverish unreasoning expectancy change for good or for evil was she felt in the air opening the door of her room she listened with vague impatience hot controversies anent over weight and foreign postage were impending between madame pouche and the postman madame in the matter of extra half pence standing stoutly on the defensive after a time there would seem to be a reluctant payment of coin followed by the brisk shutting of an outer door then the old frenchwomans slippered steps began leisurely to ascend the stair the girls breath came faster she ran out on the landing the letter was not the size or shape of the seigneurs letters and it bore two postmarks florence guernsey five half pence over weight i hope mre it may be worth its postage observed mademoiselle pouche busily tying up violets in the salon for the adornment of marjories dress the child has never spoken about italy still her heart is somewhere mre and i dont believe that somewhere is in newnham or girton ah when i too had eighteen summers when pouche dear good old pouche called out a voice resonant hearty imperious from the attic floor leave the violets come upstairs quick i have had splendid news everything in the world is changed you must send an excuse to the master of matthias at once in a moment the pouches mother and daughter were at the bottom of the stairs marjorie bartrand her opened letter in her hand a flush of wild excitement lighting her face up into its vivid southern beauty stood on the landing above an excuse consider what you talk about exclaimed pouche solemnly have your splendid news with all my heart but have your splendid dinner too the master of matthias keeps the best table in the university at his house you meet the most distinguished society of cambridge oh pouche what should i find to say to distinguished society to any king or emperor in europe hark there is great st marys clock striking the quarter we have not a minute to lose write a note mademoiselle in your best hand with your pretty courteous french grace and give it to the coachman to deliver i must read my letter through once more seven was the appointed time of the masters dinner party at the moment when great st marys clock boomed the hours first stroke marjorie bartrand extinguished her candles she descended with muffled tread to the red baize door at the turning of the stairs here she paused listened until she heard the shrill treble of french voices knew that the pouches were safely talking together downstairs then on tiptoe she stole to geoffreys quarters the door stood ajar a stray reflected flare of gaslight from some shop window in the court beneath enabled her to grope her way across the chill and comfortless room the girl paused irresolute she remembered cassandra tighes story remembered the miniature bartrands the confession made in their presence of geoffrey arbuthnots first love during a few seconds the old bartrand pride swayed her the happiness of her life hung by a thread then she took a packet from her breast she laid it meekly furtively on the students writing table and fled like one who quits the scene of a committed crime to the light and cheerfulness of the little salon below pouche was decking the mantelshelf with the violets marjorie should have worn headstrong as ever child but i forbear to reason she cried until you explain yourself that big italian letter re directed in the seigneurs hand has brought you important news i will answer you to morrow pouche all i know is that i have lost my chance of distinguished society and that my heart is the happiest heart in all cambridge grand ciel then you have a dear friend among the florentines poor pouches face brimmed over with curiosity i accept him without conditions for your sake the italians are ungrateful as rats think of all my country has done for them still if a florentine is your fate but her imaginary concessions were cut short the violets slipped through pouches fingers there came the sudden click of a latchkey at the house door a mans firm step sounded in the passage it is our gentleman save yourself quick child the curtain of the bay window will hide you the words had scarce left pouches mouth when geff arbuthnot entered he took a rapid glance round him walked in the direction of the window marjories heart thrilled as she crouched imprisoned out of sight then stopped short there was something of insecurity about his movements for a moment i was afraid to come in the front door has become strange to one but you are really alone mademoiselle your visitor has started to her party then you will let me have five minutes chat beside your fire i have something good to tell you that is right sir please let me set you a chair in performing this little action pouche artfully chose such a point that marjorie shadowed herself might gain a full view of geff arbuthnots face your fire makes one feel we are in november he stretched his hands forth to the blaze how delightful your salon is to night mademoiselle pouche coming in from the mud and darkness the dreary prose of cambridge thoroughfares he might well think so the room was redolent with the odour of marjories discarded violets morsels of muslin embroidery a thimble never worn by pouches finger lay on a work table near geffs elbow the warmth the grace the nameless sweetness of a young girls presence were everywhere how well that guernsey photograph looks in its old place could it be that geoffrey shrank from pronouncing the name of tintajeux you shall not dismantle your walls again for whim of mine pouche stirred the fire into a keener flame she gave a discreet little cough we will settle about that another day sir i wait impatiently your news something good about yourself i hope something very good his face brightened you know our poor patient down in barnwell our irish bargee ohalloran the dingiest character even barnwell can show but whom when he was at his worst mademoiselle pouche tended like a sister i sat up one or two nights i helped because the good for nothing is of my religion our priest advised an act of contrition i had my motives as i had mine said geoffrey never condescend mademoiselle to become a motive monger do you think no experimental zeal mingles with a medical students attention to his pauper fellows ohalloran rewards you i trust with gratitude that at least observed pouche with a touch of cynicism would be a new experience among ces messieurs of the gutters ohalloran rewards me with gratitude the bandages were off him this afternoon for the first time as you know well he was sitting propped up in bed looking at my face with such poor remnant of sight as remains to him when suddenly doctor im darned he cried in his hollow voice if it beant my varsity man after all modestly spoken his varsity man indeed i should have thought the fever had come back said geff if i had not had my finger on his pulse two minutes before your varsity man mike what are you talking about i asked him what have you to do with the university or its men i had to do he said with a varsity man one accursed november night that you must remember doctor there was a lot of chaps together rough river chaps you know the sort sir and three or four of the varsity gentlemen came across em down petty cury the gentlemen wasnt of the fighting kind so far as i can recollect but anyways they got into a town and gown row a bad one doctor i say the poor fellow put out his big weak hand to me i was the leader of the roughs i struck a foul cowards blow when the gentlemen was fighting honourable and unarmed it was me give you the devils mark youll take with you into the coffin sclrat misrable put in pouche between her closed teeth i tried to joke him out of his fancy went on geff arbuthnot but in vain mike had seen my face before he struck the blow and afterwards he had never forgotten me the scar which you mademoiselle have lamented over as marring my beauty put my identification beyond doubt my varsity man my varsity man he moaned ive thought of him many a time in the black years since and now at last ive found him doctor youve saved my life youve looked after me when i should have died else like a dog on this miserable floor here theres one favour more i durstnt no i durstnt ask of you give me your hand in token of forgiveness and you gave it him cried pouche whose face had turned a queer shade of colour as she listened i gave him my hand and mike who i suspect has cared neither for god nor man in his life caught it to his lips my dear mademoiselle you can guess that it was a good moment to pull ones patient round in body is much ohalloran will have a human heart in that dark breast of his from to day forth and having told his story geff arbuthnot rose with a lingering look he took in the home like suggestiveness of the little salon the violets on the mantelshelf the morsel of embroidery the slender implements of needlework on the table then he bade mademoiselle pouche good night marjorie listened while his remembered step ran up the stairs listened until she knew by the opening and shutting of a distant door that he had gained his study then she crept forth uncertain of mien from her hiding place have i committed a dishonourable action was there anything i should not have heard oh mademoiselle she went on incoherently is not geoffrey arbuthnot the noblest man in the whole world and marjorie clasped the mantelshelf steadying herself thereby she bent down over a cup of violets hiding the face from which she felt all trace of colour must have vanished you look tired ma mie the news from florence has not brought back your roses now what shall i get for you cried pouche stealing a kind arm round the girls shoulder thanks to your italian letter remember you have been cheated out of dinner i should like some tea marjorie answered plausibly tea and a plate of tartines cut after the fashion that only you dear pouche understand if the flattery were a trick of war to effect the frenchwomans absence i hold that in a moment supreme as this it was pardonable off went pouche to the kitchen unsuspecting to the last of the love story in which she had played a part and marjorie her heart on fire awaited her fate for the first two or three minutes all was quiet then she heard the impetuous opening of geoffrey arbuthnots door her limbs well nigh failed her her spirit sank through a few seconds of suspense the past fifteen months seemed to unroll themselves one by one before her sight at last the salon door opened and closed marjorie moved a step forward she held out a hand that trembled violently a moment more and strong arms held her close her blushes were hidden on geff arbuthnots breast there was a long space of silence an interchange of such words such broken attempts at explanation as pen and ink can ill put into form then geoffrey led his sweetheart into the broader light of lamp and fire he looked at her tall figure her altered softened face with wondering eyes you have grown several inches miss bartrand you have become beautiful tell me i am not asleep dreaming as i have done so often that i hold your hand tell me my good luck is real dont talk of good luck yet i have not lost my bartrand temper plenty of bad times may be in store for both of us and when was this sent to me geoffrey touched his breast pocket in token that marjories ribbon and letter lay there the address is an enigma there is a faded look i cannot interpret about the handwriting i left the packet fifteen months ago at your hotel in guernsey the girls face drooped you ought to have had it on the day after after my vile temper drove you away from tintajeux i wrote one word as you wished i sent you the bit of spanish ribbon for a book marker but fortune was against me i forgot that you and your cousin gaston had the same initial if gaston had opened a letter wrongly he would have brought it to me on the spot there was mistake within mistake at that time poor dinahs heart was near to breaking so she writes me now dinah you have heard from mrs arbuthnot let me see her explanation i will read a passage or two aloud marjorie bartrand drew the italian letter from her pocket no you will let me read every word of it for myself and geoffrey arbuthnot took the letter unfolded and read it through dinah was tried beyond her strength said marjorie instinctively deciphering a pained expression on geoffreys face but she has no need to feel so contrite it will make our happiness doubly sweet to know it has come to us in the end from dinahs hand the tone the generous words smote geoffrey to the quick can you give up everything for me he asked her presently your dream for years has been girton do you desire still to become a girton student or i desire that you shall guide me was the prompt answer i need no other life no other wisdom no other ambition than yours a finis commonplace as daylight reader old as the foundation of the gogmagog hills gastons prediction was verified marjorie bartrand had proved herself a very woman
