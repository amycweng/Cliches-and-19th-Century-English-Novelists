round the sofa by the author of mary barton life of charlotte bronte c c two volumes vol ii london sampson low son co ludgate hill london printed by william clowes and sons stamford street contents of vol ii page the accursed race the doom of the griffiths half a lifetime ago the poor clare the halfbrothers round the sofa mr dawson had often come in and out of the room during the time that his sister had been telling us about lady ludlow he would stop and listen a little and smile or sigh as the case might be the monday after the dear old lady had wound up her tale if tale it could be called we felt rather at a loss what to talk about we had grown so accustomed to listen to mrs dawson i remember i was saying oh dear i wish some one would tell us another story when her brother said as if in answer to my speech that he had drawn up a paper all ready for the philosophical society and that perhaps we might care to hear it before it was sent off it was in a great measure compiled from a french book published by one of the academies and rather dry in itself but to which mr dawsons attention had been directed after a tour he had made in england during the past year in which he had noticed small walledup doors in unusual parts of some old parish churches and had been told that they had formerly been appropriated to the use of some halfheathen race who before the days of gipsies held the same outcast pariah position in most of the countries of western europe mr dawson had been recommended to the french book which he named as containing the fullest and most authentic account of this mysterious race the cagots i did not think i should like hearing this paper as much as a story but of course as he meant it kindly we were bound to submit and i found it on the whole more interesting than i anticipated an accursed race we have our prejudices in england or if that assertion offends any of my readers i will modify it we have had our prejudices in england we have tortured jews we have burnt catholics and protestants to say nothing of a few witches and wizards we have satirised puritans and we have dressedup guys but after all i do not think we have been so bad as our continental friends to be sure our insular position has kept us free to a certain degree from the inroads of alien races who driven from one land of refuge steal into another equally unwilling to receive them and where for long centuries their presence is barely endured and no pains is taken to conceal the repugnance which the natives of pure blood experience towards them there yet remains a remnant of the miserable people called cagots in the valleys of the pyrenes in the landes near bourdeaux and stretching up on the west side of france their numbers become larger in lower brittany even now the origin of these families is a word of shame to them among their neighbours although they are protected by the law which confirmed them in the equal rights of citizens about the end of the last century before then they had lived for hundreds of years isolated from all those who boasted of pure blood and they had been all this time oppressed by cruel local edicts they were truly what they were popularly called the accursed race all distinct traces of their origin are lost even at the close of that period which we call the middle ages this was a problem which no one could solve and as the traces which even then were faint and uncertain have vanished away one by one it is a complete mystery at the present day why they were accursed in the first instance why isolated from their kind no one knows from the earliest accounts of their state that are yet remaining to us it seems that the names which they gave each other were ignored by the population they lived amongst who spoke of them as crestiaa or cagots just as we speak of animals by their generic names their houses or huts were always placed at some distance out of the villages of the countryfolk who unwillingly called in the services of the cagots as carpenters or tilers or slaterstrades which seemed appropriated by this unfortunate racewho were forbidden to occupy land or to bear arms the usual occupations of those times they had some small right of pasturage on the common lands and in the forests but the number of their cattle and livestock was strictly limited by the earliest laws relating to the cagots they were forbidden by one act to have more than twenty sheep a pig a ram and six geese the pig was to be fattened and killed for winter food the fleece of the sheep was to clothe them but if the said sheep had lambs they were forbidden to eat them their only privilege arising from this increase was that they might choose out the strongest and finest in preference to keeping the old sheep at martinmas the authorities of the commune came round and counted over the stock of each cagot if he had more than his appointed number they were forfeited half went to the commune and half to the baillie or chief magistrate of the commune the poor beasts were limited as to the amount of common land which they might stray over in search of grass while the cattle of the inhabitants of the commune might wander hither and thither in search of the sweetest herbage the deepest shade or the coolest pool in which to stand on the hot days and lazily switch their dappled sides the cagot sheep and pig had to learn imaginary bounds beyond which if they strayed any one might snap them up and kill them reserving a part of the flesh for his own use but graciously restoring the inferior parts to their original owner any damage done by the sheep was however fairly appraised and the cagot paid no more for it than any other man would have done did a cagot leave his poor cabin and venture into the towns even to render services required of him in the way of his trade he was bidden by all the municipal laws to stand by and remember his rude old state in all the towns and villages in the large districts extending on both sides of the pyrenesin all that part of spainthey were forbidden to buy or sell anything eatable to walk in the middle esteemed the better part of the streets to come within the gates before sunrise or to be found after sunset within the walls of the town but still as the cagots were goodlooking men and although they bore certain natural marks of their caste of which i shall speak byandby were not easily distinguished by casual passersby from other men they were compelled to wear some distinctive peculiarity which should arrest the eye and in the greater number of towns it was decreed that the outward sign of a cagot should be a piece of red cloth sewed conspicuously on the front of his dress in other towns the mark of cagoterie was the foot of a duck or a goose hung over their left shoulder so as to be seen by any one meeting them after a time the more convenient badge of a piece of yellow cloth cut out in the shape of a ducks foot was adopted if any cagot was found in any town or village without his badge he had to pay a fine of five sous and to lose his dress he was expected to shrink away from any passerby for fear that their clothes should touch each other or else to stand still in some corner or byplace if the cagots were thirsty during the days which they passed in those towns where their presence was barely suffered they had no means of quenching their thirst for they were forbidden to enter into the little cabarets or taverns even the water gushing out of the common fountain was prohibited to them far away in their own squalid village there was the cagot fountain and they were not allowed to drink of any other water a cagot woman having to make purchases in the town was liable to be flogged out of it if she went to buy anything except on a mondaya day on which all other people who could kept their houses for fear of coming in contact with the accursed race in the pays basque the prejudicesand for some time the lawsran stronger against them than any which i have hitherto mentioned the basque cagot was not allowed to possess sheep he might keep a pig for provision but his pig had no right of pasturage he might cut and carry grass for the ass which was the only other animal he was permitted to own and this ass was permitted because its existence was rather an advantage to the oppressor who constantly availed himself of the cagots mechanical skill and was glad to have him and his tools easily conveyed from one place to another the race was repulsed by the state under the small local governments they could hold no post whatsoever and they were barely tolerated by the church although they were good catholics and zealous frequenters of the mass they might only enter the churches by a small door set apart for them through which no one of the pure race ever passed this door was low so as to compel them to make an obeisance it was occasionally surrounded by sculpture which invariably represented an oakbranch with a dove above it when they were once in they might not go to the holy water used by others they had a bnitier of their own nor were they allowed to share in the consecrated bread when that was handed round to the believers of the pure race the cagots stood afar off near the door there were certain boundariesimaginary lineson the nave and in the aisles which they might not pass in one or two of the more tolerant of the pyrenean villages the blessed bread was offered to the cagots the priest standing on one side of the boundary and giving the pieces of bread on a long wooden fork to each person successively when the cagot died he was interred apart in a plot of buryingground on the north side of the cemetery under such laws and prescriptions as i have described it is no wonder that he was generally too poor to have much property for his children to inherit but certain descriptions of it were forfeited to the commune the only possession which all who were not of his own race refused to touch was his furniture that was tainted infectious uncleanfit for none but cagots when such were for at least three centuries the prevalent usages and opinions with regard to this oppressed race it is not surprising that we read of occasional outbursts of ferocious violence on their part in the bassespyrenes for instance it is only about a hundred years since that the cagots of rehouilhes rose up against the inhabitants of the neighbouring town of lourdes and got the better of them by their magical powers as it is said the people of lourdes were conquered and slain and their ghastly bloody heads served the triumphant cagots for balls to play at ninepins with the local parliaments had begun by this time to perceive how oppressive was the ban of public opinion under which the cagots lay and were not inclined to enforce too severe a punishment accordingly the decree of the parliament of toulouse condemned only the leading cagots concerned in this affray to be put to death and that henceforward and for ever no cagot was to be permitted to enter the town of lourdes by any gate but that called capdetpourtet they were only to be allowed to walk under the raingutters and neither to sit eat nor drink in the town if they failed in observing any of these rules the parliament decreed in the spirit of shylock that the disobedient cagots should have two strips of flesh weighing never more than two ounces apiece cut out from each side of their spines in the fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it was considered no more a crime to kill a cagot than to destroy obnoxious vermin a nest of cagots as the old accounts phrase it had assembled in a deserted castle of mauvezin about the year sixteen hundred and certainly they made themselves not very agreeable neighbours as they seemed to enjoy their reputation of magicians and by some acoustic secrets which were known to them all sorts of moanings and groanings were heard in the neighbouring forests very much to the alarm of the good people of the pure race who could not cut off a withered branch for firewood but some unearthly sound seemed to fill the air nor drink water which was not poisoned because the cagots would persist in filling their pitchers at the same running stream added to these grievances the various pilferings perpetually going on in the neighbourhood made the inhabitants of the adjacent towns and hamlets believe that they had a very sufficient cause for wishing to murder all the cagots in the chteau de mauvezin but it was surrounded by a moat and only accessible by a drawbridge besides which the cagots were fierce and vigilant some one however proposed to get into their confidence and for this purpose he pretended to fall ill close to their path so that on returning to their stronghold they perceived him and took him in restored him to health and made a friend of him one day when they were all playing at ninepins in the woods their treacherous friend left the party on pretence of being thirsty and went back into the castle drawing up the bridge after he had passed over it and so cutting off their means of escape into safety then going up to the highest part of the castle he blew a horn and the pure race who were lying in wait on the watch for some such signal fell upon the cagots at their games and slew them all for this murder i find no punishment decreed in the parliament of toulouse or elsewhere as any intermarriage with the pure race was strictly forbidden and as there were books kept in every commune in which the names and habitations of the reputed cagots were written these unfortunate people had no hope of ever becoming blended with the rest of the population did a cagot marriage take place the couple were serenaded with satirical songs they also had minstrels and many of their romances are still current in brittany but they did not attempt to make any reprisals of satire or abuse their disposition was amiable and their intelligence great indeed it required both these qualities and their great love of mechanical labour to make their lives tolerable at last they began to petition that they might receive some protection from the laws and towards the end of the seventeenth century the judicial power took their side but they gained little by this law could not prevail against custom and in the ten or twenty years just preceding the first french revolution the prejudice in france against the cagots amounted to fierce and positive abhorrence at the beginning of the sixteenth century the cagots of navarre complained to the pope that they were excluded from the fellowship of men and accursed by the church because their ancestors had given help to a certain count raymond of toulouse in his revolt against the holy see they entreated his holiness not to visit upon them the sins of their fathers the pope issued a bullon the thirteenth of may fifteen hundred and fifteenordering them to be welltreated and to be admitted to the same privileges as other men he charged don juan de santa maria of pampeluna to see to the execution of this bull but don juan was slow to help and the poor spanish cagots grew impatient and resolved to try the secular power they accordingly applied to the cortes of navarre and were opposed on a variety of grounds first it was stated that their ancestors had had nothing to do with raymond count of toulouse or with any such knightly personage that they were in fact descendants of gehazi servant of elisha second book of kings fifth chapter twentyseventh verse who had been accursed by his master for his fraud upon naaman and doomed he and his descendants to be lepers for evermore name cagots or gahets gahets gehazites what can be more clear and if that is not enough and you tell us that the cagots are not lepers now we reply that there are two kinds of leprosy one perceptible and the other imperceptible even to the person suffering from it besides it is the country talk that where the cagot treads the grass withers proving the unnatural heat of his body many credible and trustworthy witnesses will also tell you that if a cagot holds a freshlygathered apple in his hand it will shrivel and wither up in an hours time as much as if it had been kept for a whole winter in a dry room they are born with tails although the parents are cunning enough to pinch them off immediately do you doubt this if it is not true why do the children of the pure race delight in sewing on sheeps tails to the dress of any cagot who is so absorbed in his work as not to perceive them and their bodily smell is so horrible and detestable that it shows that they must be heretics of some vile and pernicious description for do we not read of the incense of good workers and the fragrance of holiness such were literally the arguments by which the cagots were thrown back into a worse position than ever as far as regarded their rights as citizens the pope insisted that they should receive all their ecclesiastical privileges the spanish priests said nothing but tacitly refused to allow the cagots to mingle with the rest of the faithful either dead or alive the accursed race obtained laws in their favour from the emperor charles the fifth which however there was no one to carry into effect as a sort of revenge for their want of submission and for their impertinence in daring to complain their tools were all taken away from them by the local authorities an old man and all his family died of starvation being no longer allowed to fish they could not emigrate even to remove their poor mud habitations from one spot to another excited anger and suspicion to be sure in sixteen hundred and ninetyfive the spanish government ordered the alcaldes to search out all the cagots and to expel them before two months had expired under pain of having fifty ducats to pay for every cagot remaining in spain at the expiration of that time the inhabitants of the villages rose up and flogged out any of the miserable race who might be in their neighbourhood but the french were on their guard against this enforced irruption and refused to permit them to enter france numbers were hunted up into the inhospitable pyrenes and there died of starvation or became a prey to wild beasts they were obliged to wear both gloves and shoes when they were thus put to flight otherwise the stones and herbage they trod upon and the balustrades of the bridges that they handled in crossing would according to popular belief have become poisonous and all this time there was nothing remarkable or disgusting in the outward appearance of this unfortunate people there was nothing about them to countenance the idea of their being lepersthe most natural mode of accounting for the abhorrence in which they were held they were repeatedly examined by learned doctors whose experiments although singular and rude appear to have been made in a spirit of humanity for instance the surgeons of the king of navarre in sixteen hundred bled twentytwo cagots in order to examine and analyse their blood they were young and healthy people of both sexes and the doctors seem to have expected that they should have been able to extract some new kind of salt from their blood which might account for the wonderful heat of their bodies but their blood was just like that of other people some of these medical men have left us a description of the general appearance of this unfortunate race at a time when they were more numerous and less intermixed than they are now the families existing in the south and west of france who are reputed to be of cagot descent at this day are like their ancestors tall largely made and powerful in frame fair and ruddy in complexion with grayblue eyes in which some observers see a pensive heaviness of look their lips are thick but wellformed some of the reports name their sad expression of countenance with surprise and suspicionthey are not gay like other folk the wonder would be if they were dr guyon the medical man of the last century who has left the clearest report on the health of the cagots speaks of the vigorous old age they attain to in one family alone he found a man of seventyfour years of age a woman as old gathering cherries and another woman aged eightythree was lying on the grass having her hair combed by her greatgrandchildren dr guyon and other surgeons examined into the subject of the horribly infectious smell which the cagots were said to leave behind them and upon everything they touched but they could perceive nothing unusual on this head they also examined their ears which according to common belief a belief existing to this day were differently shaped from those of other people being round and gristly without the lobe of flesh into which the earring is inserted they decided that most of the cagots whom they examined had the ears of this round shape but they gravely added that they saw no reason why this should exclude them from the goodwill of men and from the power of holding office in church and state they recorded the fact that the children of the towns ran baaing after any cagot who had been compelled to come into the streets to make purchases in allusion to this peculiarity of the shape of the ear which bore some resemblance to the ears of the sheep as they are cut by the shepherds in this district dr guyon names the case of a beautiful cagot girl who sang most sweetly and prayed to be allowed to sing canticles in the organloft the organist more musician than bigot allowed her to come but the indignant congregation finding out whence proceeded that clear fresh voice rushed up to the organloft and chased the girl out bidding her remember her ears and not commit the sacrilege of singing praises to god along with the pure race but this medical report of dr guyonsbringing facts and arguments to confirm his opinion that there was no physical reason why the cagots should not be received on terms of social equality by the rest of the worlddid no more for his clients than the legal decrees promulgated two centuries before had done the french proved the truth of the saying in hudibras he thats convinced against his will is of the same opinion still and indeed the being convinced by dr guyon that they ought to receive cagots as fellowcreatures only made them more rabid in declaring that they would not one or two little occurrences which are recorded show that the bitterness of the repugnance to the cagots was in full force at the time just preceding the first french revolution there was a m dabedos the curate of lourbes and brother to the seigneur of the neighbouring castle who was living in seventeen hundred and eighty he was welleducated for the time a travelled man and sensible and moderate in all respects but that of his abhorrence of the cagots he would insult them from the very altar calling out to them as they stood afar off oh ye cagots damned for evermore one day a halfblind cagot stumbled and touched the censer borne before this abb de lourbes he was immediately turned out of the church and forbidden ever to reenter it one does not know how to account for the fact that the very brother of this bigoted abb the seigneur of the village went and married a cagot girl but so it was and the abb brought a legal process against him and had his estates taken from him solely on account of his marriage which reduced him to the condition of a cagot against whom the old law was still in force the descendants of this seigneur de lourbes are simple peasants at this very day working on the lands which belonged to their grandfather this prejudice against mixed marriages remained prevalent until very lately the tradition of the cagot descent lingered among the people long after the laws against the accursed race were abolished a breton girl within the last few years having two lovers each of reputed cagot descent employed a notary to examine their pedigrees and see which of the two had least cagot in him and to that one she gave her hand in brittany the prejudice seems to have been more virulent than anywhere else m emile souvestre records proofs of the hatred borne to them in brittany so recently as in eighteen hundred and thirtyfive just lately a baker at hennebon having married a girl of cagot descent lost all his custom the godfather and godmother of a cagot child became cagots themselves by the breton laws unless indeed the poor little baby died before attaining a certain number of days they had to eat the butchers meat condemned as unhealthy but for some unknown reason they were considered to have a right to every cut loaf turned upside down with its cut side towards the door and might enter any house in which they saw a loaf in this position and carry it away with them about thirty years ago there was the skeleton of a hand hanging up as an offering in a breton church near quimperle and the tradition was that it was the hand of a rich cagot who had dared to take holy water out of the usual bnitier some time at the beginning of the reign of louis the sixteenth which an old soldier witnessing he lay in wait and the next time the offender approached the bnitier he cut off his hand and hung it up dripping with blood as an offering to the patron saint of the church the poor cagots in brittany petitioned against their opprobrious name and begged to be distinguished by the appellation of malandrins to english ears one is much the same as the other as neither conveys any meaning but to this day the descendants of the cagots do not like to have this name applied to them preferring that of malandrin the french cagots tried to destroy all the records of their pariah descent in the commotions of seventeen hundred and eightynine but if writings have disappeared the tradition yet remains and points out such and such a family as cagot or malandrin or oiselier according to the old terms of abhorrence there are various ways in which learned men have attempted to account for the universal repugnance in which this wellmade powerful race are held some say that the antipathy to them took its rise in the days when leprosy was a dreadfully prevalent disease and that the cagots are more liable than any other men to a kind of skin disease not precisely leprosy but resembling it in some of its symptoms such as dead whiteness of complexion and swellings of the face and extremities there was also some resemblance to the ancient jewish custom in respect to lepers in the habit of the people who on meeting a cagot called out cagote cagote to which they were bound to reply perlute perlute leprosy is not properly an infectious complaint in spite of the horror in which the cagot furniture and the cloth woven by them are held in some places the disorder is hereditary and hence say this body of wise men who have troubled themselves to account for the origin of cagoterie the reasonableness and the justice of preventing any mixed marriages by which this terrible tendency to leprous complaints might be spread far and wide another authority says that though the cagots are finelooking men hardworking and good mechanics yet they bear in their faces and show in their actions reasons for the detestation in which they are held their glance if you meet it is the jettatura or evileye and they are spiteful and cruel and deceitful above all other men all these qualities they derive from their ancestor gehazi the servant of elisha together with their tendency to leprosy again it is said that they are descended from the arian goths who were permitted to live in certain places in guienne and languedoc after their defeat by king clovis on condition that they abjured their heresy and kept themselves separate from all other men for ever the principal reason alleged in support of this supposition of their gothic descent is the specious one of derivationchiens gots cans gots cagots equivalent to dogs of goths again they were thought to be saracens coming from syria in confirmation of this idea was the belief that all cagots were possessed by a horrible smell the lombards also were an unfragrant race or so reputed among the italians witness pope stephens letter to charlemagne dissuading him from marrying bertha daughter of didier king of lombardy the lombards boasted of eastern descent and were noisome the cagots were noisome and therefore must be of eastern descent what could be clearer in addition there was the proof to be derived from the name cagot which those maintaining the opinion of their saracen descent held to be chiens or chasseurs des gots because the saracens chased the goths out of spain moreover the saracens were originally mahometans and as such obliged to bathe seven times aday whence the badge of the ducks foot a duck was a waterbird mahometans bathed in the water proof upon proof in brittany the common idea was they were of jewish descent their unpleasant smell was again pressed into the service the jews it was well known had this physical infirmity which might be cured either by bathing in a certain fountain in egyptwhich was a long way from brittanyor by anointing themselves with the blood of a christian child blood gushed out of the body of every cagot on good friday no wonder if they were of jewish descent it was the only way of accounting for so portentous a fact again the cagots were capital carpenters which gave the bretons every reason to believe that their ancestors were the very jews who made the cross when first the tide of emigration set from brittany to america the oppressed cagots crowded to the ports seeking to go to some new country where their race might be unknown here was another proof of their descent from abraham and his nomadic people and the forty years wandering in the wilderness and the wandering jew himself were pressed into the service to prove that the cagots derived their restlessness and love of change from their ancestors the jews the jews also practised artsmagic and the cagots sold bags of wind to the breton sailors enchanted maidens to love themmaidens who never would have cared for them unless they had been previously enchantedmade hollow rocks and trees give out strange and unearthly noises and sold the magical herb called bonsuccs it is true enough that in all the early acts of the fourteenth century the same laws apply to jews as to cagots and the appellations seem used indiscriminately but their fair complexions their remarkable devotion to all the ceremonies of the catholic church and many other circumstances conspire to forbid our believing them to be of hebrew descent another very plausible idea is that they are the descendants of unfortunate individuals afflicted with gotres which is even to this day not an uncommon disorder in the gorges and valleys of the pyrenes some have even derived the word gotre from got or goth but their name crestiaa is not unlike cretin and the same symptoms of idiotism were not unusual among the cagots although sometimes if old tradition is to be credited their malady of the brain took rather the form of violent delirium which attacked them at new and full moons then the workmen laid down their tools and rushed off from their labour to play mad pranks up and down the country perpetual motion was required to alleviate the agony of fury that seized upon the cagots at such times in this desire for rapid movement the attack resembled the neapolitan tarantella while in the mad deeds they performed during such attacks they were not unlike the northern berserker in barn especially those suffering from this madness were dreaded by the pure race the barnais going to cut their wooden clogs in the great forests that lay around the base of the pyrenes feared above all things to go too near the periods when the cagoutelle seized on the oppressed and accursed people from whom it was then the oppressors turn to fly a man was living within the memory of some who had married a cagot wife he used to beat her right soundly when he saw the first symptoms of the cagoutelle and having reduced her to a wholesome state of exhaustion and insensibility he locked her up until the moon had altered her shape in the heavens if he had not taken such decided steps say the oldest inhabitants there is no knowing what might have happened from the thirteenth to the end of the nineteenth century there are facts enough to prove the universal abhorrence in which this unfortunate race was held whether called cagots or gahets in pyrenean districts caqueaux in brittany or vaqueros in asturias the great french revolution brought some good out of its fermentation of the people the more intelligent among them tried to overcome the prejudice against the cagots in seventeen hundred and eighteen there was a famous cause tried at biarritz relating to cagot rights and privileges there was a wealthy miller etienne arnauld by name of the race of gotz quagotz bisigotz astragotz or gahetz as his people are described in the legal document he married an heiress a gotte or cagot of biarritz and the newlymarried welltodo couple saw no reason why they should stand near the door in the church nor why he should not hold some civil office in the commune of which he was the principal inhabitant accordingly he petitioned the law that he and his wife might be allowed to sit in the gallery of the church and that he might be relieved from his civil disabilities this wealthy white miller etienne arnauld pursued his rights with some vigour against the baillie of labourd the dignitary of the neighbourhood whereupon the inhabitants of biarritz met in the open air on the eighth of may to the number of one hundred and fifty approved of the conduct of the baillie in rejecting arnauld made a subscription and gave all power to their lawyers to defend the cause of the pure race against etienne arnauldthat stranger who having married a girl of cagot blood ought also to be expelled from the holy places this lawsuit was carried through all the local courts and ended by an appeal to the highest court in paris where a decision was given against basque superstitions and etienne arnauld was thenceforward entitled to enter the gallery of the church of course the inhabitants of biarritz were all the more ferocious for having been conquered and four years later a carpenter miguel legaret suspected of cagot descent having placed himself in church among other people was dragged out by the abb and two of the jurats of the parish legaret defended himself with a sharp knife at the time and went to law afterwards the end of which was that the abb and his two accomplices were condemned to a public confession of penitence to be uttered while on their knees at the church door just after highmass they appealed to the parliament of bourdeaux against this decision but met with no better success than the opponents of the miller arnauld legaret was confirmed in his right of standing where he would in the parish church that a living cagot had equal rights with other men in the town of biarritz seemed now ceded to them but a dead cagot was a different thing the inhabitants of pure blood struggled long and hard to be interred apart from the abhorred race the cagots were equally persistent in claiming to have a common buryingground again the texts of the old testament were referred to and the pure blood quoted triumphantly the precedent of uzziah the leper twentysixth chapter of the second book of chronicles who was buried in the field of the sepulchres of the kings not in the sepulchres themselves the cagots pleaded that they were healthy and ablebodied with no taint of leprosy near them they were met by the strong argument so difficult to be refuted which i have quoted before leprosy was of two kinds perceptible and imperceptible if the cagots were suffering from the latter kind who could tell whether they were free from it or not that decision must be left to the judgment of others one sturdy cagot family alone belone by name kept up a lawsuit claiming the privilege of common sepulture for fortytwo years although the cur of biarritz had to pay one hundred livres for every cagot not interred in the right place the inhabitants indemnified the curate for all these fines m de romagne bishop of tarbes who died in seventeen hundred and sixtyeight was the first to allow a cagot to fill any office in the church to be sure some were so spiritless as to reject office when it was offered to them because by so claiming their equality they had to pay the same taxes as other men instead of the rancale or polltax levied on the cagots the collector of which had also a right to claim a piece of bread of a certain size for his dog at every cagot dwelling even in the present century it has been necessary in some churches for the archdeacon of the district followed by all his clergy to pass out of the small door previously appropriated to the cagots in order to mitigate the superstition which even so lately made the people refuse to mingle with them in the house of god a cagot once played the congregation at larroque a trick suggested by what i have just named he slily locked the great parishdoor of the church while the greater part of the inhabitants were assisting at mass inside put gravel into the lock itself so as to prevent the use of any duplicate keyand had the pleasure of seeing the proud pureblooded people file out with bended head through the small low door used by the abhorred cagots we are naturally shocked at discovering from facts such as these the causeless rancour with which innocent and industrious people were so recently persecuted the moral of the history of the accursed race may perhaps be best conveyed in the words of an epitaph on mrs mary hand who lies buried in the churchyard of stratfordonavon what faults you saw in me pray strive to shun and look at home theres something to be done for some time past i had observed that miss duncan made a good deal of occupation for herself in writing but that she did not like me to notice her employment of course this made me all the more curious and many were my silent conjecturessome of them so near the truth that i was not much surprised when after mr dawson had finished reading his paper to us she hesitated coughed and abruptly introduced a little formal speech to the effect that she had noted down an old welsh story the particulars of which had often been told her in her youth as she lived close to the place where the events occurred everybody pressed her to read the manuscript which she now produced from her reticule but when on the point of beginning her nervousness seemed to overcome her and she made so many apologies for its being the first and only attempt she had ever made at that kind of composition that i began to wonder if we should ever arrive at the story at all at length in a highpitched illassured voice she read out the title the doom of the griffiths the doom of the griffiths chapter i i have always been much interested by the traditions which are scattered up and down north wales relating to owen glendower owain glendwr is the national spelling of the name and i fully enter into the feeling which makes the welsh peasant still look upon him as the hero of his country there was great joy among many of the inhabitants of the principality when the subject of the welsh prize poem at oxford some fifteen or sixteen years ago was announced to be owain glendwr it was the most proudly national subject that had been given for years perhaps some may not be aware that this redoubted chieftain is even in the present days of enlightenment as famous among his illiterate countrymen for his magical powers as for his patriotism he says himselfor shakspeare says it for him which is much the same thing at my nativity the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes of burning cressets i can call spirits from the vasty deep and few among the lower orders in the principality would think of asking hotspurs irreverent question in reply among other traditions preserved relative to this part of the welsh heros character is the old family prophecy which gives a title to this tale when sir david gam as black a traitor as if he had been born in builth sought to murder owen at machynlleth there was one with him whose name glendwr little dreamed of having associated with his enemies rhys ap gryfydd his old familiar friend his relation his more than brother had consented unto his blood sir david gam might be forgiven but one whom he had loved and who had betrayed him could never be forgiven glendwr was too deeply read in the human heart to kill him no he let him live on the loathing and scorn of his compatriots and the victim of bitter remorse the mark of cain was upon him but before he went forthwhile yet he stood a prisoner cowering beneath his conscience before owain glendwrthat chieftain passed a doom upon him and his race i doom thee to live because i know thou wilt pray for death thou shalt live on beyond the natural term of the life of man the scorn of all good men the very children shall point to thee with hissing tongue and say there goes one who would have shed a brothers blood for i loved thee more than a brother oh rhys ap gryfydd thou shalt live on to see all of thy house except the weakling in arms perish by the sword thy race shall be accursed each generation shall see their lands melt away like snow yea their wealth shall vanish though they may labour night and day to heap up gold and when nine generations have passed from the face of the earth thy blood shall no longer flow in the veins of any human being in those days the last male of thy race shall avenge me the son shall slay the father such was the traditionary account of owain glendwrs speech to his oncetrusted friend and it was declared that the doom had been fulfilled in all things that live in as miserly a manner as they would the griffiths never were wealthy and prosperousindeed that their worldly stock diminished without any visible cause but the lapse of many years had almost deadened the wonderinspiring power of the whole curse it was only brought forth from the hoards of memory when some untoward event happened to the griffiths family and in the eighth generation the faith in the prophecy was nearly destroyed by the marriage of the griffiths of that day to a miss owen who unexpectedly by the death of a brother became an heiressto no considerable amount to be sure but enough to make the prophecy appear reversed the heiress and her husband removed from his small patrimonial estate in merionethshire to her heritage in caenarvonshire and for a time the prophecy lay dormant if you go from tremadoc to criccaeth you pass by the parochial church of ynysynhanarn situated in a boggy valley running from the mountains which shoulder up to the rivals down to cardigan bay this tract of land has every appearance of having been redeemed at no distant period of time from the sea and has all the desolate rankness often attendant upon such marshes but the valley beyond similar in character had yet more of gloom at the time of which i write in the higher part there were large plantations of firs set too closely to attain to any size and remaining stunted in height and scrubby in appearance indeed many of the smaller and more weakly had died and the bark had fallen down on the brown soil neglected and unnoticed these trees had a ghastly appearance with their white trunks seen by the dim light which struggled through the thick boughs above nearer to the sea the valley assumed a more open though hardly a more cheerful character it looked dank and overhung by seafog through the greater part of the year and even a farmhouse which usually imparts something of cheerfulness to a landscape failed to do so here this valley formed the greater part of the estate to which owen griffiths became entitled by right of his wife in the higher part of the valley was situated the family mansion or rather dwellinghouse for mansion is too grand a word to apply to the clumsy but substantiallybuilt bodowen it was square and heavylooking with just that much pretension to ornament necessary to distinguish it from the mere farmhouse in this dwelling mrs owen griffiths bore her husband two sonsllewellyn the future squire and robert who was early destined for the church the only difference in their situation up to the time when robert was entered at jesus college was that the elder was invariably indulged by all around him while robert was thwarted and indulged by turns that llewellyn never learned anything from the poor welsh parson who was nominally his private tutor while occasionally squire griffiths made a great point of enforcing roberts diligence telling him that as he had his bread to earn he must pay attention to his learning there is no knowing how far the very irregular education he had received would have carried robert through his college examinations but luckily for him in this respect before such a trial of his learning came round he heard of the death of his elder brother after a short illness brought on by a harddrinking bout of course robert was summoned home and it seemed quite as much of course now that there was no necessity for him to earn his bread by his learning that he should not return to oxford so the halfeducated but not unintelligent young man continued at home during the short remainder of his parents lifetime his was not an uncommon character in general he was mild indolent and easily managed but once thoroughly roused his passions were vehement and fearful he seemed indeed almost afraid of himself and in common hardly dared to give way to justifiable angerso much did he dread losing his selfcontrol had he been judiciously educated he would probably have distinguished himself in those branches of literature which call for taste and imagination rather than any exertion of reflection or judgment as it was his literary taste showed itself in making collections of cambrian antiquities of every description till his stock of welsh mss would have excited the envy of dr pugh himself had he been alive at the time of which i write there is one characteristic of robert griffiths which i have omitted to note and which was peculiar among his class he was no hard drinker whether it was that his head was very easily affected or that his partiallyrefined taste led him to dislike intoxication and its attendant circumstances i cannot say but at fiveandtwenty robert griffiths was habitually sobera thing so rare in llyn that he was almost shunned as a churlish unsocial being and passed much of his time in solitude about this time he had to appear in some case that was tried at the caernarvon assizes and while there was a guest at the house of his agent a shrewd sensible welsh attorney with one daughter who had charms enough to captivate robert griffiths though he remained only a few days at her fathers house they were sufficient to decide his affections and short was the period allowed to elapse before he brought home a mistress to bodowen the new mrs griffiths was a gentle yielding person full of love toward her husband of whom nevertheless she stood something in awe partly arising from the difference in their ages partly from his devoting much time to studies of which she could understand nothing she soon made him the father of a blooming little daughter called augharad after her mother then there came several uneventful years in the household of bodowen and when the old women had one and all declared that the cradle would not rock again mrs griffiths bore the son and heir his birth was soon followed by his mothers death she had been ailing and lowspirited during her pregnancy and she seemed to lack the buoyancy of body and mind requisite to bring her round after her time of trial her husband who loved her all the more from having few other claims on his affections was deeply grieved by her early death and his only comforter was the sweet little boy whom she had left behind that part of the squires character which was so tender and almost feminine seemed called forth by the helpless situation of the little infant who stretched out his arms to his father with the same earnest cooing that happier children make use of to their mother alone augharad was almost neglected while the little owen was king of the house still next to his father none tended him so lovingly as his sister she was so accustomed to give way to him that it was no longer a hardship by night and by day owen was the constant companion of his father and increasing years seemed only to confirm the custom it was an unnatural life for the child seeing no bright little faces peering into his own for augharad was as i said before five or six years older and her face poor motherless girl was often anything but bright hearing no din of clear ringing voices but day after day sharing the otherwise solitary hours of his father whether in the dim room surrounded by wizardlike antiquities or pattering his little feet to keep up with his tada in his mountain rambles or shooting excursions when the pair came to some little foaming brook where the steppingstones were far and wide the father carried his little boy across with the tenderest care when the lad was weary they rested he cradled in his fathers arms or the squire would lift him up and carry him to his home again the boy was indulged for his father felt flattered by the desire in his wish of sharing his meals and keeping the same hours all this indulgence did not render owen unamiable but it made him wilful and not a happy child he had a thoughtful look not common to the face of a young boy he knew no games no merry sports his information was of an imaginative and speculative character his father delighted to interest him in his own studies without considering how far they were healthy for so young a mind of course squire griffiths was not unaware of the prophecy which was to be fulfilled in his generation he would occasionally refer to it when among his friends with sceptical levity but in truth it lay nearer to his heart than he chose to acknowledge his strong imagination rendered him peculiarly impressible on such subjects while his judgment seldom exercised or fortified by severe thought could not prevent his continually recurring to it he used to gaze on the halfsad countenance of the child who sat looking up into his face with his large dark eyes so fondly yet so inquiringly till the old legend swelled around his heart and became too painful for him not to require sympathy besides the overpowering love he bore to the child seemed to demand fuller vent than tender words it made him like yet dread to upbraid its object for the fearful contrast foretold still squire griffiths told the legend in a halfjesting manner to his little son when they were roaming over the wild heaths in the autumn days the saddest of the year or while they sat in the oakwainscoted room surrounded by mysterious relics that gleamed strangely forth by the flickering firelight the legend was wrought into the boys mind and he would crave yet tremble to hear it told over and over again while the words were intermingled with caresses and questions as to his love occasionally his loving words and actions were cut short by his fathers light yet bitter speechget thee away my lad thou knowest what is to come of all this love when augharad was seventeen and owen eleven or twelve the rector of the parish in which bodowen was situated endeavoured to prevail on squire griffiths to send the boy to school now this rector had many congenial tastes with his parishioner and was his only intimate and by repeated arguments he succeeded in convincing the squire that the unnatural life owen was leading was in every way injurious unwillingly was the father wrought to part from his son but he did at length send him to the grammar school at bangor then under the management of an excellent classic here owen showed that he had more talents than the rector had given him credit for when he affirmed that the lad had been completely stupified by the life he led at bodowen he bade fair to do credit to the school in the peculiar branch of learning for which it was famous but he was not popular among his schoolfellows he was wayward though to a certain degree generous and unselfish he was reserved but gentle except when the tremendous bursts of passion similar in character to those of his father forced their way on his return from school one christmas time when he had been a year or so at bangor he was stunned by hearing that the undervalued augharad was about to be married to a gentleman of south wales residing near aberystwith boys seldom appreciate their sisters but owen thought of the many slights with which he had requited the patient augharad and he gave way to bitter regrets which with a selfish want of control over his words he kept expressing to his father until the squire was thoroughly hurt and chagrined at the repeated exclamations of what shall we do when augharad is gone how dull we shall be when augharad is married owens holidays were prolonged a few weeks in order that he might be present at the wedding and when all the festivities were over and the bride and bridegroom had left bodowen the boy and his father really felt how much they missed the quiet loving augharad she had performed so many thoughtful noiseless little offices on which their daily comfort depended and now she was gone the household seemed to miss the spirit that peacefully kept it in order the servants roamed about in search of commands and directions the rooms had no longer the unobtrusive ordering of taste to make them cheerful the very fires burned dim and were always sinking down into dull heaps of gray ashes altogether owen did not regret his return to bangor and this also the mortified parent perceived squire griffiths was a selfish parent letters in those days were a rare occurrence owen usually received one during his halfyearly absences from home and occasionally his father paid him a visit this halfyear the boy had no visit nor even a letter till very near the time of his leaving school and then he was astounded by the intelligence that his father was married again then came one of his paroxysms of rage the more disastrous in its effects upon his character because it could find no vent in action independently of the slight to the memory of the first wife which children are so apt to fancy such an action implies owen had hitherto considered himself and with justice the first object of his fathers life they had been so much to each other and now a shapeless but too real something had come between him and his father there for ever he felt as if his permission should have been asked as if he should have been consulted certainly he ought to have been told of the intended event so the squire felt and hence his constrained letter which had so much increased the bitterness of owens feelings with all this anger when owen saw his stepmother he thought he had never seen so beautiful a woman for her age for she was no longer in the bloom of youth being a widow when his father married her her manners to the welsh lad who had seen little of female grace among the families of the few antiquarians with whom his father visited were so fascinating that he watched her with a sort of breathless admiration her measured grace her faultless movements her tones of voice sweet till the ear was sated with their sweetness made owen less angry at his fathers marriage yet he felt more than ever that the cloud was between him and his father that the hasty letter he had sent in answer to the announcement of his wedding was not forgotten although no allusion was ever made to it he was no longer his fathers confidanthardly ever his fathers companion for the newlymarried wife was all in all to the squire and his son felt himself almost a cipher where he had so long been everything the lady herself had ever the softest consideration for her stepson almost too obtrusive was the attention paid to his wishes but still he fancied that the heart had no part in the winning advances there was a watchful glance of the eye that owen once or twice caught when she had imagined herself unobserved and many other nameless little circumstances that gave him a strong feeling of want of sincerity in his stepmother mrs owen brought with her into the family her little child by her first husband a boy nearly three years old he was one of those elfish observant mocking children over whose feelings you seem to have no control agile and mischievous his little practical jokes at first performed in ignorance of the pain he gave but afterward proceeding to a malicious pleasure in suffering really seemed to afford some ground to the superstitious notion of some of the common people that he was a fairy changeling years passed on and as owen grew older he became more observant he saw even in his occasional visits at home for from school he had passed on to college that a great change had taken place in the outward manifestations of his fathers character and by degrees owen traced this change to the influence of his stepmother so slight so imperceptible to the common observer yet so resistless in its effects squire griffiths caught up his wifes humbly advanced opinions and unawares to himself adopted them as his own defying all argument and opposition it was the same with her wishes they met with their fulfilment from the extreme and delicate art with which she insinuated them into her husbands mind as his own she sacrificed the show of authority for the power at last when owen perceived some oppressive act in his fathers conduct toward his dependants or some unaccountable thwarting of his own wishes he fancied he saw his stepmothers secret influence thus displayed however much she might regret the injustice of his fathers actions in her conversations with him when they were alone his father was fast losing his temperate habits and frequent intoxication soon took its usual effect upon the temper yet even here was the spell of his wife upon him before her he placed a restraint upon his passion yet she was perfectly aware of his irritable disposition and directed it hither and thither with the same apparent ignorance of the tendency of her words meanwhile owens situation became peculiarly mortifying to a youth whose early remembrances afforded such a contrast to his present state as a child he had been elevated to the consequence of a man before his years gave any mental check to the selfishness which such conduct was likely to engender he could remember when his will was law to the servants and dependants and his sympathy necessary to his father now he was as a cipher in his fathers house and the squire estranged in the first instance by a feeling of the injury he had done his son in not sooner acquainting him with his purposed marriage seemed rather to avoid than to seek him as a companion and too frequently showed the most utter indifference to the feelings and wishes which a young man of a high and independent spirit might be supposed to indulge perhaps owen was not fully aware of the force of all these circumstances for an actor in a family drama is seldom unimpassioned enough to be perfectly observant but he became moody and soured brooding over his unloved existence and craving with a human heart after sympathy this feeling took more full possession of his mind when he had left college and returned home to lead an idle and purposeless life as the heir there was no worldly necessity for exertion his father was too much of a welsh squire to dream of the moral necessity and he himself had not sufficient strength of mind to decide at once upon abandoning a place and mode of life which abounded in daily mortifications yet to this course his judgment was slowly tending when some circumstances occurred to detain him at bodowen it was not to be expected that harmony would long be preserved even in appearance between an unguarded and soured young man such as owen and his wary stepmother when he had once left college and come not as a visitor but as the heir to his fathers house some cause of difference occurred where the woman subdued her hidden anger sufficiently to become convinced that owen was not entirely the dupe she had believed him to be henceforward there was no peace between them not in vulgar altercations did this show itself but in moody reserve on owens part and in undisguised and contemptuous pursuance of her own plans by his stepmother bodowen was no longer a place where if owen was not loved or attended to he could at least find peace and care for himself he was thwarted at every step and in every wish by his fathers desire apparently while the wife sat by with a smile of triumph on her beautiful lips so owen went forth at the early day dawn sometimes roaming about on the shore or the upland shooting or fishing as the season might be but oftener stretched in indolent repose on the short sweet grass indulging in gloomy and morbid reveries he would fancy that this mortified state of existence was a dream a horrible dream from which he should awake and find himself again the sole object and darling of his father and then he would start up and strive to shake off the incubus there was the molten sunset of his childish memory the gorgeous crimson piles of glory in the west fading away into the cold calm light of the rising moon while here and there a cloud floated across the western heaven like a seraphs wing in its flaming beauty the earth was the same as in his childhoods days full of gentle evening sounds and the harmonies of twilightthe breeze came sweeping low over the heather and bluebells by his side and the turf was sending up its evening incense of perfume but life and heart and hope were changed for ever since those bygone days or he would seat himself in a favourite niche of the rocks on moel gst hidden by a stunted growth of the whitty or mountainash from general observation with a richtinted cushion of stonecrop for his feet and a straight precipice of rock rising just above here would he sit for hours gazing idly at the bay below with its background of purple hills and the little fishingsail on its bosom showing white in the sunbeam and gliding on in such harmony with the quiet beauty of the glassy sea or he would pull out an old schoolvolume his companion for years and in morbid accordance with the dark legend that still lurked in the recesses of his minda shape of gloom in those innermost haunts awaiting its time to come forth in distinct outlinewould he turn to the old greek dramas which treat of a family foredoomed by an avenging fate the worn page opened of itself at the play of the dipus tyrannus and owen dwelt with the craving of disease upon the prophecy so nearly resembling that which concerned himself with his consciousness of neglect there was a sort of selfflattery in the consequence which the legend gave him he almost wondered how they durst with slights and insults thus provoke the avenger the days drifted onward often he would vehemently pursue some sylvan sport till thought and feeling were lost in the violence of bodily exertion occasionally his evenings were spent at a small publichouse such as stood by the unfrequented wayside where the welcome hearty though bought seemed so strongly to contrast with the gloomy negligence of homeunsympathizing home one evening owen might be four or fiveandtwenty wearied with a days shooting on the clenneny moors he passed by the open door of the goat at penmorfa the light and the cheeriness within tempted him poor selfexhausted man as it has done many a one more wretched in worldly circumstances to step in and take his evening meal where at least his presence was of some consequence it was a busy day in that little hostel a flock of sheep amounting to some hundreds had arrived at penmorfa on their road to england and thronged the space before the house inside was the shrewd kindhearted hostess bustling to and fro with merry greetings for every tired drover who was to pass the night in her house while the sheep were penned in a field close by ever and anon she kept attending to the second crowd of guests who were celebrating a rural wedding in her house it was busy work to martha thomas yet her smile never flagged and when owen griffiths had finished his evening meal she was there ready with a hope that it had done him good and was to his mind and a word of intelligence that the weddingfolk were about to dance in the kitchen and the harper was the famous edward of corwen owen partly from goodnatured compliance with his hostesss implied wish and partly from curiosity lounged to the passage which led to the kitchennot the everyday working cooking kitchen which was beyond but a goodsized room where the mistress sat when her work was done and where the country people were commonly entertained at such merrymakings as the present the lintels of the door formed a frame for the animated picture which owen saw within as he leaned against the wall in the dark passage the red light of the fire with every now and then a falling piece of turf sending forth a fresh blaze shone full upon four young men who were dancing a measure something like a scotch reel keeping admirable time in their rapid movements to the capital tune the harper was playing they had their hats on when owen first took his stand but as they grew more and more animated they flung them away and presently their shoes were kicked off with like disregard to the spot where they might happen to alight shouts of applause followed any remarkable exertion of agility in which each seemed to try to excel his companions at length wearied and exhausted they sat down and the harper gradually changed to one of those wild inspiring national airs for which he was so famous the thronged audience sat earnest and breathless and you might have heard a pin drop except when some maiden passed hurriedly with flaring candle and busy look through to the real kitchen beyond when he had finished playing his beautiful theme on the march of the men of harlech he changed the measure again to tri chant o bunnan three hundred pounds and immediately a most unmusicallooking man began chanting pennillion or a sort of recitative stanzas which were soon taken up by another and this amusement lasted so long that owen grew weary and was thinking of retreating from his post by the door when some little bustle was occasioned on the opposite side of the room by the entrance of a middleaged man and a young girl apparently his daughter the man advanced to the bench occupied by the seniors of the party who welcomed him with the usual pretty welsh greeting pa sut mae dy galon how is thy heart and drinking his health passed on to him the cup of excellent cwrw the girl evidently a village belle was as warmly greeted by the young men while the girls eyed her rather askance with a halfjealous look which owen set down to the score of her extreme prettiness like most welsh women she was of middle size as to height but beautifully made with the most perfect yet delicate roundness in every limb her little mobcap was carefully adjusted to a face which was excessively pretty though it never could be called handsome it also was round with the slightest tendency to the oval shape richly coloured though somewhat olive in complexion with dimples in cheek and chin and the most scarlet lips owen had ever seen that were too short to meet over the small pearly teeth the nose was the most defective feature but the eyes were splendid they were so long so lustrous yet at times so very soft under their thick fringe of eyelash the nutbrown hair was carefully braided beneath the border of delicate lace it was evident the little village beauty knew how to make the most of all her attractions for the gay colours which were displayed in her neckerchief were in complete harmony with the complexion owen was much attracted while yet he was amused by the evident coquetry the girl displayed collecting around her a whole bevy of young fellows for each of whom she seemed to have some gay speech some attractive look or action in a few minutes young griffiths of bodowen was at her side brought thither by a variety of idle motives and as her undivided attention was given to the welsh heir her admirers one by one dropped off to seat themselves by some less fascinating but more attentive fair one the more owen conversed with the girl the more he was taken she had more wit and talent than he had fancied possible a selfabandon and thoughtfulness to boot that seemed full of charms and then her voice was so clear and sweet and her actions so full of grace that owen was fascinated before he was well aware and kept looking into her bright blushing face till her uplifted flashing eye fell beneath his earnest gaze while it thus happened that they were silentshe from confusion at the unexpected warmth of his admiration he from an unconsciousness of anything but the beautiful changes in her flexile countenancethe man whom owen took for her father came up and addressed some observation to his daughter from whence he glided into some commonplace yet respectful remark to owen and at length engaging him in some slight local conversation he led the way to the account of a spot on the peninsula of penthryn where teal abounded and concluded with begging owen to allow him to show him the exact place saying that whenever the young squire felt so inclined if he would honour him by a call at his house he would take him across in his boat while owen listened his attention was not so much absorbed as to be unaware that the little beauty at his side was refusing one or two who endeavoured to draw her from her place by invitations to dance flattered by his own construction of her refusals he again directed all his attention to her till she was called away by her father who was leaving the scene of festivity before he left he reminded owen of his promise and added perhaps sir you do not know me my name is ellis pritchard and i live at ty glas on this side of moel gst any one can point it out to you when the father and daughter had left owen slowly prepared for his ride home but encountering the hostess he could not resist asking a few questions relative to ellis pritchard and his pretty daughter she answered shortly but respectfully and then said rather hesitatingly master griffiths you know the triad tri pheth tebyg y naill ir llall ysgnbwr heb yd mail deg heb ddiawd a merch deg heb ei geirda three things are alike a fine barn without corn a fine cup without drink a fine woman without her reputation she hastily quitted him and owen rode slowly to his unhappy home ellis pritchard half farmer and half fisherman was shrewd and keen and worldly yet he was goodnatured and sufficiently generous to have become rather a popular man among his equals he had been struck with the young squires attention to his pretty daughter and was not insensible to the advantages to be derived from it nest would not be the first peasant girl by any means who had been transplanted to a welsh manorhouse as its mistress and accordingly her father had shrewdly given the admiring young man some pretext for further opportunities of seeing her as for nest herself she had somewhat of her fathers worldliness and was fully alive to the superior station of her new admirer and quite prepared to slight all her old sweethearts on his account but then she had something more of feeling in her reckoning she had not been insensible to the earnest yet comparatively refined homage which owen paid her she had noticed his expressive and occasionally handsome countenance with admiration and was flattered by his so immediately singling her out from her companions as to the hint which martha thomas had thrown out it is enough to say that nest was very giddy and that she was motherless she had high spirits and a great love of admiration or to use a softer term she loved to please men women children all she delighted to gladden with her smile and her voice she coquetted and flirted and went to the extreme lengths of welsh courtship till the seniors of the village shook their heads and cautioned their daughters against her acquaintance if not absolutely guilty she had too frequently been on the verge of guilt even at the time martha thomass hint made but little impression on owen for his senses were otherwise occupied but in a few days the recollection thereof had wholly died away and one warm glorious summers day he bent his steps toward ellis pritchards with a beating heart for except some very slight flirtations at oxford owen had never been touched his thoughts his fancy had been otherwise engaged ty glas was built against one of the lower rocks of moel gst which indeed formed a side to the low lengthy house the materials of the cottage were the shingly stones which had fallen from above plastered rudely together with deep recesses for the small oblong windows altogether the exterior was much ruder than owen had expected but inside there seemed no lack of comforts the house was divided into two apartments one large roomy and dark into which owen entered immediately and before the blushing nest came from the inner chamber for she had seen the young squire coming and hastily gone to make some alteration in her dress he had had time to look around him and note the various little particulars of the room beneath the window which commanded a magnificent view was an oaken dresser replete with drawers and cupboards and brightly polished to a rich dark colour in the farther part of the room owen could at first distinguish little entering as he did from the glaring sunlight but he soon saw that there were two oaken beds closed up after the manner of the welsh in fact the dormitories of ellis pritchard and the man who served under him both on sea and on land there was the large wheel used for spinning wool left standing on the middle of the floor as if in use only a few minutes before and around the ample chimney hung flitches of bacon dried kidsflesh and fish that was in process of smoking for winters store before nest had shyly dared to enter her father who had been mending his nets down below and seen owen winding up to the house came in and gave him a hearty yet respectful welcome and then nest downcast and blushing full of the consciousness which her fathers advice and conversation had not failed to inspire ventured to join them to owens mind this reserve and shyness gave her new charms it was too bright too hot too anything to think of going to shoot teal till later in the day and owen was delighted to accept a hesitating invitation to share the noonday meal some ewemilk cheese very hard and dry oatcake slips of the dried kidsflesh broiled after having been previously soaked in water for a few minutes delicious butter and fresh buttermilk with a liquor called diod griafol made from the berries of the sorbus aucuparia infused in water and then fermented composed the frugal repast but there was something so clean and neat and withal such a true welcome that owen had seldom enjoyed a meal so much indeed at that time of day the welsh squires differed from the farmers more in the plenty and rough abundance of their manner of living than in the refinement of style of their table at the present day down in llyn the welsh gentry are not a whit behind their saxon equals in the expensive elegances of life but then when there was but one pewterservice in all northumberland there was nothing in ellis pritchards mode of living that grated on the young squires sense of refinement little was said by that young pair of wooers during the meal the father had all the conversation to himself apparently heedless of the ardent looks and inattentive mien of his guest as owen became more serious in his feelings he grew more timid in their expression and at night when they returned from their shootingexcursion the caress he gave nest was almost as bashfully offered as received this was but the first of a series of days devoted to nest in reality though at first he thought some little disguise of his object was necessary the past the future was all forgotten in those happy days of love and every worldly plan every womanly wile was put in practice by ellis pritchard and his daughter to render his visits agreeable and alluring indeed the very circumstance of his being welcome was enough to attract the poor young man to whom the feeling so produced was new and full of charms he left a home where the certainty of being thwarted made him chary in expressing his wishes where no tones of love ever fell on his ear save those addressed to others where his presence or absence was a matter of utter indifference and when he entered ty glas all down to the little cur which with clamorous barkings claimed a part of his attention seemed to rejoice his account of his days employment found a willing listener in ellis and when he passed on to nest busy at her wheel or at her churn the deepened colour the conscious eye and the gradual yielding of herself up to his loverlike caress had worlds of charms ellis pritchard was a tenant on the bodowen estate and therefore had reasons in plenty for wishing to keep the young squires visits secret and owen unwilling to disturb the sunny calm of these halcyon days by any storm at home was ready to use all the artifice which ellis suggested as to the mode of his calls at ty glas nor was he unaware of the probable nay the hopedfor termination of these repeated days of happiness he was quite conscious that the father wished for nothing better than the marriage of his daughter to the heir of bodowen and when nest had hidden her face in his neck which was encircled by her clasping arms and murmured into his ear her acknowledgment of love he felt only too desirous of finding some one to love him for ever though not highly principled he would not have tried to obtain nest on other terms save those of marriage he did so pine after enduring love and fancied he should have bound her heart for evermore to his when they had taken the solemn oaths of matrimony there was no great difficulty attending a secret marriage at such a place and at such a time one gusty autumn day ellis ferried them round penthryn to llandutrwyn and there saw his little nest become future lady of bodowen how often do we see giddy coquetting restless girls become sobered by marriage a great object in life is decided one on which their thoughts have been running in all their vagaries and they seem to verify the beautiful fable of undine a new soul beams out in the gentleness and repose of their future lives an indescribable softness and tenderness takes place of the wearying vanity of their former endeavours to attract admiration something of this sort took place in nest pritchard if at first she had been anxious to attract the young squire of bodowen long before her marriage this feeling had merged into a truer love than she had ever felt before and now that he was her own her husband her whole soul was bent toward making him amends as far as in her lay for the misery which with a womans tact she saw that he had to endure at his home her greetings were abounding in delicatelyexpressed love her study of his tastes unwearying in the arrangement of her dress her time her very thoughts no wonder that he looked back on his weddingday with a thankfulness which is seldom the result of unequal marriages no wonder that his heart beat aloud as formerly when he wound up the little path to ty glas and sawkeen though the winters wind might bethat nest was standing out at the door to watch for his dimlyseen approach while the candle flared in the little window as a beacon to guide him aright the angry words and unkind actions of home fell deadened on his heart he thought of the love that was surely his and of the new promise of love that a short time would bring forth and he could almost have smiled at the impotent efforts to disturb his peace a few more months and the young father was greeted by a feeble little cry when he hastily entered ty glas one morning early in consequence of a summons conveyed mysteriously to bodowen and the pale mother smiling and feebly holding up her babe to its fathers kiss seemed to him even more lovely than the bright gay nest who had won his heart at the little inn of penmorfa but the curse was at work the fulfilment of the prophecy was nigh at hand chapter ii it was the autumn after the birth of their boy it had been a glorious summer with bright hot sunny weather and now the year was fading away as seasonably into mellow days with mornings of silver mists and clear frosty nights the blooming look of the time of flowers was past and gone but instead there were even richer tints abroad in the suncoloured leaves the lichens the goldenblossomed furze if it was the time of fading there was a glory in the decay nest in her loving anxiety to surround her dwelling with every charm for her husbands sake had turned gardener and the little corners of the rude court before the house were filled with many a delicate mountainflower transplanted more for its beauty than its rarity the sweetbrier bush may even yet be seen old and gray which she and owen planted a green slipling beneath the window of her little chamber in those moments owen forgot all besides the present all the cares and griefs he had known in the past and all that might await him of woe and death in the future the boy too was as lovely a child as the fondest parent was ever blessed with and crowed with delight and clapped his little hands as his mother held him in her arms at the cottagedoor to watch his fathers ascent up the rough path that led to ty glas one bright autumnal morning and when the three entered the house together it was difficult to say which was the happiest owen carried his boy and tossed and played with him while nest sought out some little article of work and seated herself on the dresser beneath the window where now busily plying the needle and then again looking at her husband she eagerly told him the little pieces of domestic intelligence the winning ways of the child the result of yesterdays fishing and such of the gossip of penmorfa as came to the ears of the now retired nest she noticed that when she mentioned any little circumstance which bore the slightest reference to bodowen her husband appeared chafed and uneasy and at last avoided anything that might in the least remind him of home in truth he had been suffering much of late from the irritability of his father shown in trifles to be sure but not the less galling on that account while they were thus talking and caressing each other and the child a shadow darkened the room and before they could catch a glimpse of the object that had occasioned it it vanished and squire griffiths lifted the doorlatch and stood before them he stood and lookedfirst on his son so different in his buoyant expression of content and enjoyment with his noble child in his arms like a proud and happy father as he was from the depressed moody young man he too often appeared at bodowen then on nestpoor trembling sickened nestwho dropped her work but yet durst not stir from her seat on the dresser while she looked to her husband as if for protection from his father the squire was silent as he glared from one to the other his features white with restrained passion when he spoke his words came most distinct in their forced composure it was to his son he addressed himself that woman who is she owen hesitated one moment and then replied in a steady yet quiet voice father that woman is my wife he would have added some apology for the long concealment of his marriage have appealed to his fathers forgiveness but the foam flew from squire owens lips as he burst forth with invective against nest you have married her it is as they told me married nest pritchard yr buten and you stand there as if you had not disgraced yourself for ever and ever with your accursed wiving and the fair harlot sits there in her mocking modesty practising the mimming airs that will become her state as future lady of bodowen but i will move heaven and earth before that false woman darken the doors of my fathers house as mistress all this was said with such rapidity that owen had no time for the words that thronged to his lips father he burst forth at length father whosoever told you that nest pritchard was a harlot told you a lie as false as hell ay a lie as false as hell he added in a voice of thunder while he advanced a step or two nearer to the squire and then in a lower tone he said she is as pure as your own wife nay god help me as the dear precious mother who brought me forth and then left mewith no refuge in a mothers heartto struggle on through life alone i tell you nest is as pure as that dear dead mother foolpoor fool at this moment the childthe little owenwho had kept gazing from one angry countenance to the other and with earnest look trying to understand what had brought the fierce glare into the face where till now he had read nothing but love in some way attracted the squires attention and increased his wrath yes he continued poor weak fool that you are hugging the child of another as if it were your own offspring owen involuntarily caressed the affrighted child and half smiled at the implication of his fathers words this the squire perceived and raising his voice to a scream of rage he went on i bid you if you call yourself my son to cast away that miserable shameless womans offspring cast it away this instantthis instant in his ungovernable rage seeing that owen was far from complying with his command he snatched the poor infant from the loving arms that held it and throwing it to its mother left the house inarticulate with fury nestwho had been pale and still as marble during this terrible dialogue looking on and listening as if fascinated by the words that smote her heartopened her arms to receive and cherish her precious babe but the boy was not destined to reach the white refuge of her breast the furious action of the squire had been almost without aim and the infant fell against the sharp edge of the dresser down on to the stone floor owen sprang up to take the child but he lay so still so motionless that the awe of death came over the father and he stooped down to gaze more closely at that moment the upturned filmy eyes rolled convulsivelya spasm passed along the bodyand the lips yet warm with kissing quivered into everlasting rest a word from her husband told nest all she slid down from her seat and lay by her little son as corpselike as he unheeding all the agonizing endearments and passionate adjurations of her husband and that poor desolate husband and father scarce one little quarter of an hour and he had been so blessed in his consciousness of love the bright promise of many years on his infants face and the new fresh soul beaming forth in its awakened intelligence and there it was the little clay image that would never more gladden up at the sight of him nor stretch forth to meet his embrace whose inarticulate yet most eloquent cooings might haunt him in his dreams but would never more be heard in waking life again and by the dead babe almost as utterly insensate the poor mother had fallen in a merciful faintthe slandered heartpierced nest owen struggled against the sickness that came over him and busied himself in vain attempts at her restoration it was now near noonday and ellis pritchard came home little dreaming of the sight that awaited him but though stunned he was able to take more effectual measures for his poor daughters recovery than owen had done byandby she showed symptoms of returning sense and was placed in her own little bed in a darkened room where without ever waking to complete consciousness she fell asleep then it was that her husband suffocated by pressure of miserable thought gently drew his hand from her tightened clasp and printing one long soft kiss on her white waxen forehead hastily stole out of the room and out of the house near the base of moel gstit might be a quarter of a mile from ty glaswas a little neglected solitary copse wild and tangled with the trailing branches of the dogrose and the tendrils of the white bryony toward the middle of this thicket lay a deep crystal poola clear mirror for the blue heavens aboveand round the margin floated the broad green leaves of the waterlily and when the regal sun shone down in his noonday glory the flowers arose from their cool depths to welcome and greet him the copse was musical with many sounds the warbling of birds rejoicing in its shades the ceaseless hum of the insects that hovered over the pool the chime of the distant waterfall the occasional bleating of the sheep from the mountaintop were all blended into the delicious harmony of nature it had been one of owens favourite resorts when he had been a lonely wanderera pilgrim in search of love in the years gone by and thither he went as if by instinct when he left ty glas quelling the uprising agony till he should reach that little solitary spot it was the time of day when a change in the aspect of the weather so frequently takes place and the little pool was no longer the reflection of a blue and sunny sky it sent back the dark and slaty clouds above and every now and then a rough gust shook the painted autumn leaves from their branches and all other music was lost in the sound of the wild winds piping down from the moorlands which lay up and beyond the clefts in the mountainside presently the rain came on and beat down in torrents but owen heeded it not he sat on the dank ground his face buried in his hands and his whole strength physical and mental employed in quelling the rush of blood which rose and boiled and gurgled in his brain as if it would madden him the phantom of his dead child rose ever before him and seemed to cry aloud for vengeance and when the poor young man thought upon the victim whom he required in his wild longing for revenge he shuddered for it was his father again and again he tried not to think but still the circle of thought came round eddying through his brain at length he mastered his passions and they were calm then he forced himself to arrange some plan for the future he had not in the passionate hurry of the moment seen that his father had left the cottage before he was aware of the fatal accident that befell the child owen thought he had seen all and once he planned to go to the squire and tell him of the anguish of heart he had wrought and awe him as it were by the dignity of grief but then again he durst nothe distrusted his selfcontrolthe old prophecy rose up in its horrorhe dreaded his doom at last he determined to leave his father for ever to take nest to some distant country where she might forget her firstborn and where he himself might gain a livelihood by his own exertions but when he tried to descend to the various little arrangements which were involved in the execution of this plan he remembered that all his money and in this respect squire griffiths was no niggard was locked up in his escritoire at bodowen in vain he tried to do away with this matteroffact difficulty go to bodowen he must and his only hopenay his determinationwas to avoid his father he rose and took a bypath to bodowen the house looked even more gloomy and desolate than usual in the heavy downpouring rain yet owen gazed on it with something of regretfor sorrowful as his days in it had been he was about to leave it for many many years if not for ever he entered by a sidedoor opening into a passage that led to his own room where he kept his books his guns his fishingtackle his writingmaterials etc here he hurriedly began to select the few articles he intended to take for besides the dread of interruption he was feverishly anxious to travel far that very night if only nest was capable of performing the journey as he was thus employed he tried to conjecture what his fathers feelings would be on finding that his onceloved son was gone away for ever would he then awaken to regret for the conduct which had driven him from home and bitterly think on the loving and caressing boy who haunted his footsteps in former days or alas would he only feel that an obstacle to his daily happinessto his contentment with his wife and his strange doting affection for her childwas taken away would they make merry over the heirs departure then he thought of nestthe young childless mother whose heart had not yet realized her fullness of desolation poor nest so loving as she was so devoted to her childhow should he console her he pictured her away in a strange land pining for her native mountains and refusing to be comforted because her child was not even this thought of the homesickness that might possibly beset nest hardly made him hesitate in his determination so strongly had the idea taken possession of him that only by putting miles and leagues between him and his father could he avert the doom which seemed blending itself with the very purposes of his life as long as he stayed in proximity with the slayer of his child he had now nearly completed his hasty work of preparation and was full of tender thoughts of his wife when the door opened and the elfish robert peered in in search of some of his brothers possessions on seeing owen he hesitated but then came boldly forward and laid his hand on owens arm saying nesta yr buten how is nest yr buten he looked maliciously into owens face to mark the effect of his words but was terrified at the expression he read there he started off and ran to the door while owen tried to check himself saying continually he is but a child he does not understand the meaning of what he says he is but a child still robert now in fancied security kept calling out his insulting words and owens hand was on his gun grasping it as if to restrain his rising fury but when robert passed on daringly to mocking words relating to the poor dead child owen could bear it no longer and before the boy was well aware owen was fiercely holding him in an iron clasp with one hand while he struck him hard with the other in a minute he checked himself he paused relaxed his grasp and to his horror he saw robert sink to the ground in fact the lad was halfstunned halffrightened and thought it best to assume insensibility owenmiserable owenseeing him lie there prostrate was bitterly repentant and would have dragged him to the carved settle and done all he could to restore him to his senses but at this instant the squire came in probably when the household at bodowen rose that morning there was but one among them ignorant of the heirs relation to nest pritchard and her child for secret as he had tried to make his visits to ty glas they had been too frequent not to be noticed and nests altered conductno longer frequenting dances and merrymakingswas a strongly corroborative circumstance but mrs griffiths influence reigned paramount if unacknowledged at bodowen and till she sanctioned the disclosure none would dare to tell the squire now however the time drew near when it suited her to make her husband aware of the connection his son had formed so with many tears and much seeming reluctance she broke the intelligence to himtaking good care at the same time to inform him of the light character nest had borne nor did she confine this evil reputation to her conduct before her marriage but insinuated that even to this day she was a woman of the grove and brakefor centuries the welsh term of opprobrium for the loosest female characters squire griffiths easily tracked owen to ty glas and without any aim but the gratification of his furious anger followed him to upbraid as we have seen but he left the cottage even more enraged against his son than he had entered it and returned home to hear the evil suggestions of the stepmother he had heard a slight scuffle in which he caught the tones of roberts voice as he passed along the hall and an instant afterwards he saw the apparently lifeless body of his little favourite dragged along by the culprit owenthe marks of strong passion yet visible on his face not loud but bitter and deep were the evil words which the father bestowed on the son and as owen stood proudly and sullenly silent disdaining all exculpation of himself in the presence of one who had wrought him so much graverso fatal an injuryroberts mother entered the room at sight of her natural emotion the wrath of the squire was redoubled and his wild suspicions that this violence of owens to robert was a premeditated act appeared like the proven truth through the mists of rage he summoned domestics as if to guard his own and his wifes life from the attempts of his son and the servants stood wondering aroundnow gazing at mrs griffiths alternately scolding and sobbing while she tried to restore the lad from his really bruised and halfunconscious state now at the fierce and angry squire and now at the sad and silent owen and hehe was hardly aware of their looks of wonder and terror his fathers words fell on a deadened ear for before his eyes there rose a pale dead babe and in that ladys violent sounds of grief he heard the wailing of a more sad more hopeless mother for by this time the lad robert had opened his eyes and though evidently suffering a good deal from the effects of owens blows was fully conscious of all that was passing around him had owen been left to his own nature his heart would have worked itself to doubly love the boy whom he had injured but he was stubborn from injustice and hardened by suffering he refused to vindicate himself he made no effort to resist the imprisonment the squire had decreed until a surgeons opinion of the real extent of roberts injuries was made known it was not until the door was locked and barred as if upon some wild and furious beast that the recollection of poor nest without his comforting presence came into his mind oh thought he how she would be wearying pining for his tender sympathy if indeed she had recovered the shock of mind sufficiently to be sensible of consolation what would she think of his absence could she imagine he believed his fathers words and had left her in this her sore trouble and bereavement the thought maddened him and he looked around for some mode of escape he had been confined in a small unfurnished room on the first floor wainscoted and carved all round with a massy door calculated to resist the attempts of a dozen strong men even had he afterward been able to escape from the house unseen unheard the window was placed as is common in old welsh houses over the fireplace with branching chimneys on either hand forming a sort of projection on the outside by this outlet his escape was easy even had he been less determined and desperate than he was and when he had descended with a little care a little winding he might elude all observation and pursue his original intention of going to ty glas the storm had abated and watery sunbeams were gilding the bay as owen descended from the window and stealing along in the broad afternoon shadows made his way to the little plateau of green turf in the garden at the top of a steep precipitous rock down the abrupt face of which he had often dropped by means of a wellsecured rope into the small sailingboat his fathers present alas in days gone by which lay moored in the deep seawater below he had always kept his boat there because it was the nearest available spot to the house but before he could reach the placeunless indeed he crossed a broad sunlighted piece of ground in full view of the windows on that side of the house and without the shadow of a single sheltering tree or shrubhe had to skirt round a rude semicircle of underwood which would have been considered as a shrubbery had any one taken pains with it step by step he stealthily moved alonghearing voices now again seeing his father and stepmother in no distant walk the squire evidently caressing and consoling his wife who seemed to be urging some point with great vehemence again forced to crouch down to avoid being seen by the cook returning from the rude kitchengarden with a handful of herbs this was the way the doomed heir of bodowen left his ancestral house for ever and hoped to leave behind him his doom at length he reached the plateauhe breathed more freely he stooped to discover the hidden coil of rope kept safe and dry in a hole under a great round flat piece of rock his head was bent down he did not see his father approach nor did he hear his footstep for the rush of blood to his head in the stooping effort of lifting the stone the squire had grappled with him before he rose up again before he fully knew whose hands detained him now when his liberty of person and action seemed secure he made a vigorous struggle to free himself he wrestled with his father for a momenthe pushed him hard and drove him on to the great displaced stone all unsteady in its balance down went the squire down into the deep waters belowdown after him went owen half consciously half unconsciously partly compelled by the sudden cessation of any opposing body partly from a vehement irrepressible impulse to rescue his father but he had instinctively chosen a safer place in the deep seawater pool than that into which his push had sent his father the squire had hit his head with much violence against the side of the boat in his fall it is indeed doubtful whether he was not killed before ever he sank into the sea but owen knew nothing save that the awful doom seemed even now present he plunged down he dived below the water in search of the body which had none of the elasticity of life to buoy it up he saw his father in those depths he clutched at him he brought him up and cast him a dead weight into the boat and exhausted by the effort he had begun himself to sink again before he instinctively strove to rise and climb into the rocking boat there lay his father with a deep dent in the side of his head where the skull had been fractured by his fall his face blackened by the arrested course of the blood owen felt his pulse his heartall was still he called him by his name father father he cried come back come back you never knew how i loved you how i could love you stillifoh god and the thought of his little child rose before him yes father he cried afresh you never knew how he fellhow he died oh if i had but had patience to tell you if you would but have borne with me and listened and now it is over oh father father whether she had heard this wild wailing voice or whether it was only that she missed her husband and wanted him for some little everyday question or as was perhaps more likely she had discovered owens escape and come to inform her husband of it i do not know but on the rock right above his head as it seemed owen heard his stepmother calling her husband he was silent and softly pushed the boat right under the rock till the sides grated against the stones and the overhanging branches concealed him and it from all not on a level with the water wet as he was he lay down by his dead father the better to conceal himself and somehow the action recalled those early days of childhoodthe first in the squires widowhoodwhen owen had shared his fathers bed and used to waken him in the morning to hear one of the old welsh legends how long he lay thusbody chilled and brain hardworking through the heavy pressure of a reality as terrible as a nightmarehe never knew but at length he roused himself up to think of nest drawing out a great sail he covered up the body of his father with it where he lay in the bottom of the boat then with his numbed hands he took the oars and pulled out into the more open sea toward criccaeth he skirted along the coast till he found a shadowed cleft in the dark rocks to that point he rowed and anchored his boat close in land then he mounted staggering half longing to fall into the dark waters and be at resthalf instinctively finding out the surest footrests on that precipitous face of rock till he was high up safe landed on the turfy summit he ran off as if pursued toward penmorfa he ran with maddened energy suddenly he paused turned ran again with the same speed and threw himself prone on the summit looking down into his boat with straining eyes to see if there had been any movement of lifeany displacement of a fold of sailcloth it was all quiet deep down below but as he gazed the shifting light gave the appearance of a slight movement owen ran to a lower part of the rock stripped plunged into the water and swam to the boat when there all was stillawfully still for a minute or two he dared not lift up the cloth then reflecting that the same terror might beset him againof leaving his father unaided while yet a spark of life lingeredhe removed the shrouding cover the eyes looked into his with a dead stare he closed the lids and bound up the jaw again he looked this time he raised himself out of the water and kissed the brow it was my doom father it would have been better if i had died at my birth daylight was fading away precious daylight he swam back dressed and set off afresh for penmorfa when he opened the door of ty glas ellis pritchard looked at him reproachfully from his seat in the darklyshadowed chimney corner youre come at last said he one of our kind i e station would not have left his wife to mourn by herself over her dead child nor would one of our kind have let his father kill his own true son ive a good mind to take her from you for ever i did not tell him cried nest looking piteously at her husband he made me tell him part and guessed the rest she was nursing her babe on her knee as if it was alive owen stood before ellis pritchard be silent said he quietly neither words nor deeds but what are decreed can come to pass i was set to do my work this hundred years and more the time waited for me and the man waited for me i have done what was foretold of me for generations ellis pritchard knew the old tale of the prophecy and believed in it in a dull dead kind of way but somehow never thought it would come to pass in his time now however he understood it all in a moment though he mistook owens nature so much as to believe that the deed was intentionally done out of revenge for the death of his boy and viewing it in this light ellis thought it little more than a just punishment for the cause of all the wild despairing sorrow he had seen his only child suffer during the hours of this long afternoon but he knew the law would not so regard it even the lax welsh law of those days could not fail to examine into the death of a man of squire griffiths standing so the acute ellis thought how he could conceal the culprit for a time come said he dont look so scared it was your doom not your fault and he laid a hand on owens shoulder youre wet said he suddenly where have you been nest your husband is dripping drookit wet thats what makes him look so blue and wan nest softly laid her baby in its cradle she was half stupified with crying and had not understood to what owen alluded when he spoke of his doom being fulfilled if indeed she had heard the words her touch thawed owens miserable heart oh nest said he clasping her in his arms do you love me stillcan you love me my own darling why not asked she her eyes filling with tears i only love you more than ever for you were my poor babys father but nestoh tell her ellis you know no need no need said ellis shes had enough to think on bustle my girl and get out my sunday clothes i dont understand said nest putting her hand up to her head what is to tell and why are you so wet god help me for a poor crazed thing for i cannot guess at the meaning of your words and your strange looks i only know my baby is dead and she burst into tears come nest go and fetch him a change quick and as she meekly obeyed too languid to strive further to understand ellis said rapidly to owen in a low hurried voice are you meaning that the squire is dead speak low lest she hear well well no need to talk about how he died it was sudden i see and we must all of us die and hell have to be buried its well the night is near and i should not wonder now if youd like to travel for a bit it would do nest a power of good and thentheres many a one goes out of his own house and never comes back again andi trust hes not lying in his own houseand theres a stir for a bit and a search and a wonderand byandby the heir just steps in as quiet as can be and thats what youll do and bring nest to bodowen after all nay child better stockings nor those find the blue woollens i bought at llanrwst fair only dont lose heart its done now and cant be helped it was the piece of work set you to do from the days of the tudors they say and he deserved it look in yon cradle so tell us where he is and ill take heart of grace and see what can be done for him but owen sat wet and haggard looking into the peat fire as if for visions of the past and never heeding a word ellis said nor did he move when nest brought the armful of dry clothes come rouse up man said ellis growing impatient but he neither spoke nor moved what is the matter father asked nest bewildered ellis kept on watching owen for a minute or two till on his daughters repetition of the question he said ask him yourself nest oh husband what is it said she kneeling down and bringing her face to a level with his dont you know said he heavily you wont love me when you do know and yet it was not my doing it was my doom what does he mean father asked nest looking up but she caught a gesture from ellis urging her to go on questioning her husband i will love you husband whatever has happened only let me know the worst a pause during which nest and ellis hung breathless my father is dead nest nest caught her breath with a sharp gasp god forgive him said she thinking on her babe god forgive me said owen you did not nest stopped yes i did now you know it it was my doom how could i help it the devil helped mehe placed the stone so that my father fell i jumped into the water to save him i did indeed nest i was nearly drowned myself but he was deaddeadkilled by the fall then he is safe at the bottom of the sea said ellis with hungry eagerness no he is not he lies in my boat said owen shivering a little more at the thought of his last glimpse at his fathers face than from cold oh husband change your wet clothes pleaded nest to whom the death of the old man was simply a horror with which she had nothing to do while her husbands discomfort was a present trouble while she helped him to take off the wet garments which he would never have had energy enough to remove of himself ellis was busy preparing food and mixing a great tumbler of spirits and hot water he stood over the unfortunate young man and compelled him to eat and drink and made nest too taste some mouthfulsall the while planning in his own mind how best to conceal what had been done and who had done it not altogether without a certain feeling of vulgar triumph in the reflection that nest as she stood there carelessly dressed dishevelled in her grief was in reality the mistress of bodowen than which ellis pritchard had never seen a grander house though he believed such might exist by dint of a few dexterous questions he found out all he wanted to know from owen as he ate and drank in fact it was almost a relief to owen to dilute the horror by talking about it before the meal was done if meal it could be called ellis knew all he cared to know now nest on with your cloak and haps pack up what needs to go with you for you and your husband must be half way to liverpool by tomorrows morn ill take you past rhyl sands in my fishingboat with yours in tow and once over the dangerous part ill return with my cargo of fish and learn how much stir there is at bodowen once safe hidden in liverpool no one will know where you are and you may stay quiet till your time comes for returning i will never come home again said owen doggedly the place is accursed hoot be guided by me man why it was but an accident after all and well land at the holy island at the point of llyn there is an old cousin of mine the parson therefor the pritchards have known better days squireand well bury him there it was but an accident man hold up your head you and nest will come home yet and fill bodowen with children and ill live to see it never said owen i am the last male of my race and the son has murdered his father nest came in laden and cloaked ellis was for hurrying them off the fire was extinguished the door was locked here nest my darling let me take your bundle while i guide you down the steps but her husband bent his head and spoke never a word nest gave her father the bundle already loaded with such things as he himself had seen fit to take but clasped another softly and tightly no one shall help me with this said she in a low voice her father did not understand her her husband did and placed his strong helping arm round her waist and blessed her we will all go together nest said he but where and he looked up at the stormtossed clouds coming up from windward it is a dirty night said ellis turning his head round to speak to his companions at last but never fear well weather it and he made for the place where his vessel was moored then he stopped and thought a moment stay here said he addressing his companions i may meet folk and i shall maybe have to hear and to speak you wait here till i come back for you so they sat down close together in a corner of the path let me look at him nest said owen she took her little dead son out from under her shawl they looked at his waxen face long and tenderly kissed it and covered it up reverently and softly nest said owen at last i feel as though my fathers spirit had been near us and as if it had bent over our poor little one a strange chilly air met me as i stooped over him i could fancy the spirit of our pure blameless child guiding my fathers safe over the paths of the sky to the gates of heaven and escaping those accursed dogs of hell that were darting up from the north in pursuit of souls not five minutes since dont talk so owen said nest curling up to him in the darkness of the copse who knows what may be listening the pair were silent in a kind of nameless terror till they heard ellis pritchards loud whisper where are ye come along soft and steady there were folk about even now and the squire is missed and madam in a fright they went swiftly down to the little harbour and embarked on board elliss boat the sea heaved and rocked even there the torn clouds went hurrying overhead in a wild tumultuous manner they put out into the bay still in silence except when some word of command was spoken by ellis who took the management of the vessel they made for the rocky shore where owens boat had been moored it was not there it had broken loose and disappeared owen sat down and covered his face this last event so simple and natural in itself struck on his excited and superstitious mind in an extraordinary manner he had hoped for a certain reconciliation so to say by laying his father and his child both in one grave but now it appeared to him as if there was to be no forgiveness as if his father revolted even in death against any such peaceful union ellis took a practical view of the case if the squires body was found drifting about in a boat known to belong to his son it would create terrible suspicion as to the manner of his death at one time in the evening ellis had thought of persuading owen to let him bury the squire in a sailors grave or in other words to sew him up in a spare sail and weighting it well sink it for ever he had not broached the subject from a certain fear of owens passionate repugnance to the plan otherwise if he had consented they might have returned to penmorfa and passively awaited the course of events secure of owens succession to bodowen sooner or later or if owen was too much overwhelmed by what had happened ellis would have advised him to go away for a short time and return when the buzz and the talk was over now it was different it was absolutely necessary that they should leave the country for a time through those stormy waters they must plough their way that very night ellis had no fearwould have had no fear at any rate with owen as he had been a week a day ago but with owen wild despairing helpless fatepursued what could he do they sailed into the tossing darkness and were never more seen of men the house of bodowen has sunk into damp dark ruins and a saxon stranger holds the lands of the griffiths you cannot think how kindly mrs dawson thanked miss duncan for writing and reading this story she shook my poor pale governess so tenderly by the hand that the tears came into her eyes and the colour into her cheeks i thought you had been so kind i liked hearing about lady ludlow i fancied perhaps i could do something to give a little pleasure were the halffinished sentences miss duncan stammered out i am sure it was the wish to earn similar kind words from mrs dawson that made mrs preston try and rummage through her memory to see if she could not recollect some fact or event or history which might interest mrs dawson and the little party that gathered round her sofa mrs preston it was who told us the following tale half a lifetime ago half a lifetime ago chapter i half a lifetime ago there lived in one of the westmoreland dales a single woman of the name of susan dixon she was owner of the small farmhouse where she resided and of some thirty or forty acres of land by which it was surrounded she had also an hereditary right to a sheepwalk extending to the wild fells that overhang blea tarn in the language of the country she was a stateswoman her house is yet to be seen on the oxenfell road between skelwith and coniston you go along a moorland track made by the carts that occasionally came for turf from the oxenfell a brook babbles and brattles by the wayside giving you a sense of companionship which relieves the deep solitude in which this way is usually traversed some miles on this side of coniston there is a farmsteada gray stone house and a square of farmbuildings surrounding a green space of rough turf in the midst of which stands a mighty funereal umbrageous yew making a solemn shadow as of death in the very heart and centre of the light and heat of the brightest summer day on the side away from the house this yard slopes down to a darkbrown pool which is supplied with fresh water from the overflowings of a stone cistern into which some rivulet of the brook before mentioned continually and melodiously falls bubbling the cattle drink out of this cistern the household bring their pitchers and fill them with drinkingwater by a dilatory yet pretty process the watercarrier brings with her a leaf of the houndstongue fern and inserting it in the crevice of the gray rock makes a cool green spout for the sparkling stream the house is no specimen at the present day of what it was in the lifetime of susan dixon then every small diamondpane in the windows glittered with cleanliness you might have eaten off the floor you could see yourself in the pewter plates and the polished oaken awmry or dresser of the state kitchen into which you entered few strangers penetrated further than this room once or twice wandering tourists attracted by the lonely picturesqueness of the situation and the exquisite cleanliness of the house itself made their way into this houseplace and offered money enough as they thought to tempt the hostess to receive them as lodgers they would give no trouble they said they would be out rambling or sketching all day long would be perfectly content with a share of the food which she provided for herself or would procure what they required from the waterhead inn at coniston but no liberal sumno fair wordsmoved her from her stony manner or her monotonous tone of indifferent refusal no persuasion could induce her to show any more of the house than that first room no appearance of fatigue procured for the weary an invitation to sit down and rest and if one more bold and less delicate did so without being asked susan stood by cold and apparently deaf or only replying by the briefest monosyllables till the unwelcome visitor had departed yet those with whom she had dealings in the way of selling her cattle or her farm produce spoke of her as keen after a bargaina hard one to have to do with and she never spared herself exertion or fatigue at market or in the field to make the most of her produce she led the haymakers with her swift steady rake and her noiseless evenness of motion she was about among the earliest in the market examining samples of oats pricing them and then turning with grim satisfaction to her own cleaner corn she was served faithfully and long by those who were rather her fellowlabourers than her servants she was even and just in her dealings with them if she was peculiar and silent they knew her and knew that she might be relied on some of them had known her from her childhood and deep in their hearts was an unspokenalmost unconsciouspity for her for they knew her story though they never spoke of it yes the time had been when that tall gaunt hardfeatured angular womanwho never smiled and hardly ever spoke an unnecessary wordhad been a finelooking girl brightspirited and rosy and when the hearth at the yew nook had been as bright as she with family love and youthful hope and mirth fifty or fiftyone years ago william dixon and his wife margaret were alive and susan their daughter was about eighteen years oldten years older than the only other child a boy named after his father william and margaret dixon were rather superior people of a character belongingas far as i have seenexclusively to the class of westmoreland and cumberland statesmenjust independent upright not given to much speaking kindhearted but not demonstrative disliking change and new ways and new people sensible and shrewd each household selfcontained and its members having little curiosity as to their neighbours with whom they rarely met for any social intercourse save at the stated times of sheepshearing and christmas having a certain kind of sober pleasure in amassing money which occasionally made them miserable as they call miserly people up in the north in their old age reading no light or ephemeral literature but the grave solid books brought round by the pedlars such as the paradise lost and regained the death of abel the spiritual quixote and the pilgrims progress were to be found in nearly every house the men occasionally going off laking ie playing ie drinking for days together and having to be hunted up by anxious wives who dared not leave their husbands to the chances of the wild precipitous roads but walked miles and miles lantern in hand in the dead of night to discover and guide the solemnlydrunken husband home who had a dreadful headache the next day and the day after that came forth as grave and sober and virtuouslooking as if there were no such things as malt and spirituous liquors in the world and who were seldom reminded of their misdoings by their wives to whom such occasional outbreaks were as things of course when once the immediate anxiety produced by them was over such weresuch arethe characteristics of a class now passing away from the face of the land as their compeers the yeomen have done before them of such was william dixon he was a shrewd clever farmer in his day and generation when shrewdness was rather shown in the breeding and rearing of sheep and cattle than in the cultivation of land owing to this character of his statesmen from a distance from beyond kendal or from borrowdale of greater wealth than he would send their sons to be farmservants for a year or two with him in order to learn some of his methods before setting up on land of their own when susan his daughter was about seventeen one michael hurst was farmservant at yew nook he worked with the master and lived with the family and was in all respects treated as an equal except in the field his father was a wealthy statesman at wythburne up beyond grasmere and through michaels servitude the families had become acquainted and the dixons went over to the high beck sheepshearing and the hursts came down by red bank and loughrig tarn and across the oxenfell when there was the christmastide feasting at yew nook the fathers strolled round the fields together examined cattle and sheep and looked knowing over each others horses the mothers inspected the dairies and household arrangements each openly admiring the plans of the other but secretly preferring their own both fathers and mothers cast a glance from time to time at michael and susan who were thinking of nothing less than farm or dairy but whose unspoken attachment was in all ways so suitable and natural a thing that each parent rejoiced over it although with characteristic reserve it was never spoken aboutnot even between husband and wife susan had been a strong independent healthy girl a clever help to her mother and a spirited companion to her father more of a man in her as he often said than her delicate little brother ever would have he was his mothers darling although she loved susan well there was no positive engagement between michael and susani doubt whether even plain words of love had been spoken when one wintertime margaret dixon was seized with inflammation consequent upon a neglected cold she had always been strong and notable and had been too busy to attend to the earliest symptoms of illness it would go off she said to the woman who helped in the kitchen or if she did not feel better when they had got the hams and bacon out of hand she would take some herbtea and nurse up a bit but death could not wait till the hams and bacon were cured he came on with rapid strides and shooting arrows of portentous agony susan had never seen illnessnever knew how much she loved her mother till now when she felt a dreadful instinctive certainty that she was losing her her mind was thronged with recollections of the many times she had slighted her mothers wishes her heart was full of the echoes of careless and angry replies that she had spoken what would she not now give to have opportunities of service and obedience and trials of her patience and love for that dear mother who lay gasping in torture and yet susan had been a good girl and an affectionate daughter the sharp pain went off and delicious ease came on yet still her mother sunk in the midst of this languid peace she was dying she motioned susan to her bedside for she could only whisper and then while the father was out of the room she spoke as much to the eager hungering eyes of her daughter by the motion of her lips as by the slow feeble sounds of her voice susan lass thou must not fret it is gods will and thou wilt have a deal to do keep father straight if thou canst and if he goes out ulverstone ways see that thou meet him before he gets to the old quarry its a dree bit for a man who has had a drop as for lile willhere the poor womans face began to work and her fingers to move nervously as they lay on the bedquiltlile will will miss me most of all fathers often vexed with him because hes not a quick strong lad he is not my poor lile chap and father thinks hes saucy because he cannot always stomach oatcake and porridge theres better than three pound in th old black teapot on the top shelf of the cupboard just keep a piece of loafbread by you susan dear for will to come to when hes not taken his breakfast i have may be spoilt him but therell be no one to spoil him now she began to cry a low feeble cry and covered up her face that susan might not see her that dear face those precious moments while yet the eyes could look out with love and intelligence susan laid her head down close by her mothers ear mother ill take tent of will mother do you hear he shall not want ought i can give or get for him least of all the kind words which you had ever ready for us both bless you bless you my own mother thoult promise me that susan wilt thou i can die easy if thoult take charge of him but hes hardly like other folk he tries father at times though i think fatherll be tender of him when im gone for my sake and susan theres one thing more i never spoke on it for fear of the bairn being called a telltale but i just comforted him up he vexes michael at times and michael has struck him before now i did not want to make a stir but hes not strong and a word from thee susan will go a long way with michael susan was as red now as she had been pale before it was the first time that her influence over michael had been openly acknowledged by a third person and a flash of joy came athwart the solemn sadness of the moment her mother had spoken too much and now came on the miserable faintness she never spoke again coherently but when her children and her husband stood by her bedside she took lile wills hand and put it into susans and looked at her with imploring eyes susan clasped her arms round will and leaned her head upon his curly little one and vowed within herself to be as a mother to him henceforward she was all in all to her brother she was a more spirited and amusing companion to him than his mother had been from her greater activity and perhaps also from her originality of character which often prompted her to perform her habitual actions in some new and racy manner she was tender to lile will when she was prompt and sharp with everybody elsewith michael most of all for somehow the girl felt that unprotected by her mother she must keep up her own dignity and not allow her lover to see how strong a hold he had upon her heart he called her hard and cruel and left her so and she smiled softly to herself when his back was turned to think how little he guessed how deeply he was loved for susan was merely comely and finelooking michael was strikingly handsome admired by all the girls for miles round and quite enough of a country coxcomb to know it and plume himself accordingly he was the second son of his father the eldest would have high beck farm of course but there was a good penny in the kendal bank in store for michael when harvest was over he went to chapel langdale to learn to dance and at night in his merry moods he would do his steps on the flagfloor of the yew nook kitchen to the secret admiration of susan who had never learned dancing but who flouted him perpetually even while she admired in accordance with the rule she seemed to have made for herself about keeping him at a distance so long as he lived under the same roof with her one evening he sulked at some saucy remark of hers he sitting in the chimneycorner with his arms on his knees and his head bent forwards lazily gazing into the woodfire on the hearth and luxuriating in rest after a hard days labour she sitting among the geraniums on the long low windowseat trying to catch the last slanting rays of the autumnal light to enable her to finish stitching a shirtcollar for will who lounged full length on the flags at the other side of the hearth to michael poking the burning wood from time to time with a long hazelstick to bring out the leap of glittering sparks and if you can dance a threesome reel what good does it do ye asked susan looking askance at michael who had just been vaunting his proficiency does it help you plough or reap or even climb the rocks to take a ravens nest if i were a man id be ashamed to give in to such softness if you were a man youd be glad to do anything which made the pretty girls stand round and admire as they do to you eh ho michael that would not be my way o being a man what would then asked he after a pause during which he had expected in vain that she would go on with her sentence no answer i should not like you as a man susy youd be too hard and headstrong am i hard and headstrong asked she with as indifferent a tone as she could assume but which yet had a touch of pique in it his quick ear detected the inflexion no susy youre wilful at times and thats right enough i dont like a girl without spirit theres a mighty pretty girl comes to the dancingclass but she is all milk and water her eyes never flash like yours when youre put out why i can see them flame across the kitchen like a cats in the dark now if you were a man i should feel queer before those looks of yours as it is i rather like them because because what asked she looking up and perceiving that he had stolen close up to her because i can make all right in this way said he kissing her suddenly can you said she wrenching herself out of his grasp and panting half with rage take that by way of proof that making right is none so easy and she boxed his ears pretty sharply he went back to his seat discomfited and out of temper she could no longer see to look even if her face had not burnt and her eyes dazzled but she did not choose to move her seat so she still preserved her stooping attitude and pretended to go on sewing eleanor hebthwaite may be milkandwater muttered he butconfound thee lad what art doing exclaimed michael as a great piece of burning wood was cast into his face by an unlucky poke of wills thou great lounging clumsy chap ill teach thee better and with one or two good round kicks he sent the lad whimpering away into the backkitchen when he had a little recovered himself from his passion he saw susan standing before him her face looking strange and almost ghastly by the reversed position of the shadows arising from the firelight shining upwards right under it i tell thee what michael said she that lads motherless but not friendless his own father leathers him and why should not i when hes given me such a burn on my face said michael putting up his hand to his cheek as if in pain his fathers his father and there is nought more to be said but if he did burn thee it was by accident and not o purpose as thou kicked him its a mercy if his ribs are not broken he howls loud enough im sure i might ha kicked many a lad twice as hard and theyd neer ha said ought but damn ye but yon lad must needs cry out like a stuck pig if one touches him replied michael sullenly susan went back to the windowseat and looked absently out of the window at the drifting clouds for a minute or two while her eyes filled with tears then she got up and made for the outer door which led into the backkitchen before she reached it however she heard a low voice whose music made her thrill say susan susan her heart melted within her but it seemed like treachery to her poor boy like faithlessness to her dead mother to turn to her lover while the tears which he had caused to flow were yet unwiped on wills cheeks so she seemed to take no heed but passed into the darkness and guided by the sobs she found her way to where willie sat crouched among disused tubs and churns come out wi me lad and they went into the orchard where the fruittrees were bare of leaves but ghastly in their tattered covering of gray moss and the soughing november wind came with long sweeps over the fells till it rattled among the crackling boughs underneath which the brother and sister sat in the dark he in her lap and she hushing his head against her shoulder thou shouldst na play wi fire its a naughty trick thoult suffer for it in worse ways nor this before thoust done im afeared i should ha hit thee twice as lungeous kicks as mike if id been in his place he did na hurt thee i am sure she assumed half as a question yes but he did he turned me quite sick and lie let his head fall languidly down on his sisters breast come lad come lad said she anxiously be a man it was not much that i saw why when first the red cow came she kicked me far harder for offering to milk her before her legs were tied see thee heres a peppermintdrop and ill make thee a pasty tonight only dont give way so for it hurts me sore to think that michael has done thee any harm my pretty willie roused himself up and put back the wet and ruffled hair from his heated face and he and susan rose up and handinhand went towards the house walking slowly and quietly except for a kind of sob which willie could not repress susan took him to the pump and washed his tearstained face till she thought she had obliterated all traces of the recent disturbance arranging his curls for him and then she kissed him tenderly and led him in hoping to find michael in the kitchen and make all straight between them but the blaze had dropped down into darkness the wood was a heap of gray ashes in which the sparks ran hither and thither but even in the groping darkness susan knew by the sinking at her heart that michael was not there she threw another brand on the hearth and lighted the candle and sat down to her work in silence willie cowered on his stool by the side of the fire eyeing his sister from time to time and sorry and oppressed he knew not why by the sight of her grave almost stern face no one came they two were in the house alone the old woman who helped susan with the household work had gone out for the night to some friends dwelling william dixon the father was up on the fells seeing after his sheep susan had no heart to prepare the evening meal susy darling are you angry with me said willie in his little piping gentle voice he had stolen up to his sisters side i wont never play with fire again and ill not cry if michael does kick me only dont look so like dead motherdontdontplease dont he exclaimed hiding his face on her shoulder im not angry willie said she dont be feared on me you want your supper and you shall have it and dont you be feared on michael he shall give reason for every hair of your head that he toucheshe shall when william dixon came home he found susan and willie sitting together handinhand and apparently pretty cheerful he bade them go to bed for that he would sit up for michael and the next morning when susan came down she found that michael had started an hour before with the cart for lime it was a long days work susan knew it would be late perhaps later than on the preceding night before he returnedat any rate past her usual bedtime and on no account would she stop up a minute beyond that hour in the kitchen whatever she might do in her bedroom here she sat and watched till past midnight and when she saw him coming up the brow with the carts she knew full well even in that faint moonlight that his gait was the gait of a man in liquor but though she was annoyed and mortified to find in what way he had chosen to forget her the fact did not disgust or shock her as it would have done many a girl even at that day who had not been brought up as susan had among a class who considered it no crime but rather a mark of spirit in a man to get drunk occasionally nevertheless she chose to hold herself very high all the next day when michael was perforce obliged to give up any attempt to do heavy work and hung about the outbuildings and farm in a very disconsolate and sickly state willie had far more pity on him than susan before evening willie and he were fast and on his side ostentatious friends willie rode the horses down to water willie helped him to chop wood susan sat gloomily at her work hearing an indistinct but cheerful conversation going on in the shippon while the cows were being milked she almost felt irritated with her little brother as if he were a traitor and had gone over to the enemy in the very battle that she was fighting in his cause she was alone with no one to speak to while they prattled on regardless if she were glad or sorry soon willie burst in susan susan come with me ive something so pretty to show you round the corner of the barnrun run he was dragging her along half reluctant half desirous of some change in that weary day round the corner of the barn and caught hold of by michael who stood there awaiting her o willie cried she you naughty boy there is nothing prettywhat have you brought me here for let me go i wont be held only one word nay if you wish it so much you may go said michael suddenly loosing his hold as she struggled but now she was free she only drew off a step or two murmuring something about willie you are going then said michael with seeming sadness you wont hear me say a word of what is in my heart how can i tell whether it is what i should like to hear replied she still drawing back that is just what i want you to tell me i want you to hear it and then to tell me whether you like it or not well you may speak replied she turning her back and beginning to plait the hem of her apron he came close to her ear im sorry i hurt willie the other night he has forgiven me can you you hurt him very badly she replied but you are right to be sorry i forgive you stop stop said he laying his hand upon her arm there is something more ive got to say i want you to be my what is it they call it susan i dont know said she halflaughing but trying to get away with all her might now and she was a strong girl but she could not manage it you do my what is it i want you to be i tell you i dont know and you had best be quiet and just let me go in or i shall think youre as bad now as you were last night and how did you know what i was last night it was past twelve when i came home were you watching ah susan be my wife and you shall never have to watch for a drunken husband if i were your husband i would come straight home and count every minute an hour till i saw your bonny face now you know what i want you to be i ask you to be my wife will you my own dear susan she did not speak for some time then she only said ask father and now she was really off like a lapwing round the corner of the barn and up in her own little room crying with all her might before the triumphant smile had left michaels face where he stood the ask father was a mere form to be gone through old daniel hurst and william dixon had talked over what they could respectively give their children long before this and that was the parental way of arranging such matters when the probable amount of worldly gear that he could give his child had been named by each father the young folk as they said might take their own time in coming to the point which the old men with the prescience of experience saw that they were drifting to no need to hurry them for they were both young and michael though active enough was too thoughtless old daniel said to be trusted with the entire management of a farm meanwhile his father would look about him and see after all the farms that were to be let michael had a shrewd notion of this preliminary understanding between the fathers and so felt less daunted than he might otherwise have done at making the application for susans hand it was all right there was not an obstacle only a deal of good advice which the lover thought might have as well been spared and which it must be confessed he did not much attend to although he assented to every part of it then susan was called down stairs and slowly came dropping into view down the steps which led from the two family apartments into the houseplace she tried to look composed and quiet but it could not be done she stood side by side with her lover with her head drooping her cheeks burning not daring to look up or move while her father made the newlybetrothed a somewhat formal address in which he gave his consent and many a piece of worldly wisdom beside susan listened as well as she could for the beating of her heart but when her father solemnly and sadly referred to his own lost wife she could keep from sobbing no longer but throwing her apron over her face she sat down on the bench by the dresser and fairly gave way to pentup tears oh how strangely sweet to be comforted as she was comforted by tender caress and many a lowwhispered promise of love her father sat by the fire thinking of the days that were gone willie was still out of doors but susan and michael felt no ones presence or absencethey only knew they were together as betrothed husband and wife in a week or two they were formally told of the arrangements to be made in their favour a small farm in the neighbourhood happened to fall vacant and michaels father offered to take it for him and be responsible for the rent for the first year while william dixon was to contribute a certain amount of stock and both fathers were to help towards the furnishing of the house susan received all this information in a quiet indifferent way she did not care much for any of these preparations which were to hurry her through the happy hours she cared least of all for the money amount of dowry and of substance it jarred on her to be made the confidant of occasional slight repinings of michaels as one by one his future fatherinlaw set aside a beast or a pig for susans portion which were not always the best animals of their kind upon the farm but he also complained of his own fathers stinginess which somewhat though not much alleviated susans dislike to being awakened out of her pure dream of love to the consideration of worldly wealth but in the midst of all this bustle willie moped and pined he had the same chord of delicacy running through his mind that made his body feeble and weak he kept out of the way and was apparently occupied in whittling and carving uncouth heads on hazelsticks in an outhouse but he positively avoided michael and shrunk away even from susan she was too much occupied to notice this at first michael pointed it out to her saying with a laugh look at willie he might be a castoff lover and jealous of me he looks so dark and downcast at me michael spoke this jest out loud and willie burst into tears and ran out of the house let me go let me go said susan for her lovers arm was round her waist i must go to him if hes fretting i promised mother i would she pulled herself away and went in search of the boy she sought in byre and barn through the orchard where indeed in this leafless wintertime there was no great concealment up into the room where the wool was usually stored in the later summer and at last she found him sitting at bay like some hunted creature up behind the woodstack what are ye gone for lad and me seeking you everywhere asked she breathless i did not know you would seek me ive been away many a time and no one has cared to seek me said he crying afresh nonsense replied susan dont be so foolish ye little goodfornought but she crept up to him in the hole he had made underneath the great brown sheafs of wood and squeezed herself down by him what for should folk seek after you when you get away from them whenever you can asked she they dont want me to stay nobody wants me if i go with father he says i hinder more than i help you used to like to have me with you but now youve taken up with michael and youd rather i was away and i can just bide away but i cannot stand michael jeering at me hes got you to love him and that might serve him but i love you too dearly lad said she putting her arm round his neck which on us do you like best said he wistfully after a little pause putting her arm away so that he might look in her face and see if she spoke truth she went very red you should not ask such questions they are not fit for you to ask nor for me to answer but mother bade you love me said he plaintively and so i do and so i ever will do lover nor husband shall come betwixt thee and me ladneer a one of them that i promise thee as i promised mother before in the sight of god and with her hearkening now if ever she can hearken to earthly word again only i cannot abide to have thee fretting just because my heart is large enough for two and thoult love me always always and ever and the morethe more thoult love michael said she dropping her voice ill try said the boy sighing for he remembered many a harsh word and blow of which his sister knew nothing she would have risen up to go away but he held her tight for here and now she was all his own and he did not know when such a time might come again so the two sat crouched up and silent till they heard the horn blowing at the fieldgate which was the summons home to any wanderers belonging to the farm and at this hour of the evening signified that supper was ready then the two went in chapter ii susan and michael were to be married in april he had already gone to take possession of his new farm three or four miles away from yew nookbut that is neighbouring according to the acceptation of the word in that thinlypopulated districtwhen william dixon fell ill he came home one evening complaining of headache and pains in his limbs but seemed to loathe the posset which susan prepared for him the treacleposset which was the homely country remedy against an incipient cold he took to his bed with a sensation of exceeding weariness and an odd unusual lookingback to the days of his youth when he was a lad living with his parents in this very house the next morning he had forgotten all his life since then and did not know his own children crying like a newlyweaned baby for his mother to come and soothe away his terrible pain the doctor from coniston said it was the typhusfever and warned susan of its infectious character and shook his head over his patient there were no friends near to come and share her anxiety only good kind old peggy who was faithfulness itself and one or two labourers wives who would fain have helped her had not their hands been tied by their responsibility to their own families but somehow susan neither feared nor flagged as for fear indeed she had no time to give way to it for every energy of both body and mind was required besides the young have had too little experience of the danger of infection to dread it much she did indeed wish from time to time that michael had been at home to have taken willie over to his fathers at high beck but then again the lad was docile and useful to her and his fecklessness in many things might make him be harshly treated by strangers so perhaps it was as well that michael was away at appleby fair or even beyond thatgone into yorkshire after horses her father grew worse and the doctor insisted on sending over a nurse from coniston not a professed nurseconiston could not have supported such a one but a widow who was ready to go where the doctor sent her for the sake of the payment when she came susan suddenly gave way she was felled by the fever herself and lay unconscious for long weeks her consciousness returned to her one spring afternoon early spring aprilher weddingmonth there was a little fire burning in the small cornergrate and the flickering of the blaze was enough for her to notice in her weak state she felt that there was some one sitting on the windowside of her bed behind the curtain but she did not care to know who it was it was even too great a trouble for her languid mind to consider who it was likely to be she would rather shut her eyes and melt off again into the gentle luxury of sleep the next time she wakened the coniston nurse perceived her movement and made her a cup of tea which she drank with eager relish but still they did not speak and once more susan lay motionlessnot asleep but strangely pleasantly conscious of all the small chamber and household sounds the fall of a cinder on the hearth the fitful singing of the halfempty kettle the cattle tramping out to field again after they had been milked the aged step on the creaking stairold peggys as she knew it came to her door it stopped the person outside listened for a moment and then lifted the wooden latch and looked in the watcher by the bedside arose and went to her susan would have been glad to see peggys face once more but was far too weak to turn so she lay and listened how is she whispered one trembling aged voice better replied the other shes been awake and had a cup of tea shell do now has she asked after him hush no she has not spoken a word poor lass poor lass the door was shut a weak feeling of sorrow and selfpity came over susan what was wrong whom had she loved and dawning dawning slowly rose the sun of her former life and all particulars were made distinct to her she felt that some sorrow was coming to her and cried over it before she knew what it was or had strength enough to ask in the dead of nightand she had never slept againshe softly called to the watcher and asked who who what replied the woman with a conscious affright illveiled by a poor assumption of ease lie still theres a darling and go to sleep sleeps better for you than all the doctors stuff who repeated susan something is wrong who oh dear said the woman theres nothing wrong willie has taken the turn and is doing nicely father well hes all right now she answered looking another way as if seeking for something then its michael oh me oh me she set up a succession of weak plaintive hysterical cries before the nurse could pacify her by declaring that michael had been at the house not three hours before to ask after her and looked as well and as hearty as ever man did and you heard of no harm to him since inquired susan bless the lass no for sure ive neer heard his name named since i saw him go out of the yard as stout a man as ever trod shoeleather it was well as the nurse said afterwards to peggy that susan had been so easily pacified by the equivocating answer in respect to her father if she had pressed the questions home in his case as she did in michaels she would have learnt that he was dead and buried more than a month before it was well too that in her weak state of convalescence which lasted long after this first day of consciousness her perceptions were not sharp enough to observe the sad change that had taken place in willie his bodily strength returned his appetite was something enormous but his eyes wandered continually his regard could not be arrested his speech became slow impeded and incoherent people began to say that the fever had taken away the little wit willie dixon had ever possessed and that they feared that he would end in being a natural as they call an idiot in the dales the habitual affection and obedience to susan lasted longer than any other feeling that the boy had had previous to his illness and perhaps this made her be the last to perceive what every one else had long anticipated she felt the awakening rude when it did come it was in this wise one june evening she sat out of doors under the yewtree knitting she was pale still from her recent illness and her languor joined to the fact of her black dress made her look more than usually interesting she was no longer the buoyant selfsufficient susan equal to every occasion the men were bringing in the cows to be milked and michael was about in the yard giving orders and directions with somewhat the air of a master for the farm belonged of right to willie and susan had succeeded to the guardianship of her brother michael and she were to be married as soon as she was strong enoughso perhaps his authoritative manner was justified but the labourers did not like it although they said little they remembered him a stripling on the farm knowing far less than they did and often glad to shelter his ignorance of all agricultural matters behind their superior knowledge they would have taken orders from susan with far more willingness nay willie himself might have commanded them and from the old hereditary feeling toward the owners of land they would have obeyed him with far greater cordiality then they now showed to michael but susan was tired with even three rounds of knitting and seemed not to notice or to care how things went on around her and williepoor williethere he stood lounging against the doorsill enormously grown and developed to be sure but with restless eyes and everopen mouth and every now and then setting up a strange kind of howling cry and then smiling vacantly to himself at the sound he had made as the two old labourers passed him they looked at each other ominously and shook their heads willie darling said susan dont make that noiseit makes my head ache she spoke feebly and willie did not seem to hear at any rate he continued his howl from time to time hold thy noise wilt a said michael roughly as he passed near him and threatening him with his fist susans back was turned to the pair the expression of willies face changed from vacancy to fear and he came shambling up to susan and put her arm round him and as if protected by that shelter he began making faces at michael susan saw what was going on and as if now first struck by the strangeness of her brothers manner she looked anxiously at michael for an explanation michael was irritated at willies defiance of him and did not mince the matter its just that the fever has left him sillyhe never was as wise as other folk and now i doubt if he will ever get right susan did not speak but she went very pale and her lip quivered she looked long and wistfully at willies face as he watched the motion of the ducks in the great stablepool he laughed softly to himself every now and then willie likes to see the ducks go overhead said susan instinctively adopting the form of speech she would have used to a young child willie boo willie boo he replied clapping his hands and avoiding her eye speak properly willie said susan making a strong effort at selfcontrol and trying to arrest his attention you know who i amtell me my name she grasped his arm almost painfully tight to make him attend now he looked at her and for an instant a gleam of recognition quivered over his face but the exertion was evidently painful and he began to cry at the vainness of the effort to recall her name he hid his face upon her shoulder with the old affectionate trick of manner she put him gently away and went into the house into her own little bedroom she locked the door and did not reply at all to michaels calls for her hardly spoke to old peggy who tried to tempt her out to receive some homely sympathy and through the open casement there still came the idiotic sound of willie boo willie boo chapter iii after the stun of the blow came the realisation of the consequences susan would sit for hours trying patiently to recall and piece together fragments of recollection and consciousness in her brothers mind she would let him go and pursue some senseless bit of play and wait until she could catch his eye or his attention again when she would resume her selfimposed task michael complained that she never had a word for him or a minute of time to spend with him now but she only said she must try while there was yet a chance to bring back her brothers lost wits as for marriage in this state of uncertainty she had no heart to think of it then michael stormed and absented himself for two or three days but it was of no use when he came back he saw that she had been crying till her eyes were all swollen up and he gathered from peggys scoldings which she did not spare him that susan had eaten nothing since he went away but she was as inflexible as ever not just yet only not just yet and dont say again that i do not love you said she suddenly hiding herself in his arms and so matters went on through august the crop of oats was gathered in the wheatfield was not ready as yet when one fine day michael drove up in a borrowed shandry and offered to take willie a ride his manner when susan asked him where he was going to was rather confused but the answer was straight and clear enough he had business in ambleside he would never lose sight of the lad and have him back safe and sound before dark so susan let him go before night they were at home again willie in high delight at a little rattling paper windmill that michael had bought for him in the street and striving to imitate this new sound with perpetual buzzings michael too looked pleased susan knew the look although afterwards she remembered that he had tried to veil it from her and had assumed a grave appearance of sorrow whenever he caught her eye he put up his horse for although he had three miles further to go the moon was upthe bonny harvestmoonand he did not care how late he had to drive on such a road by such a light after the supper which susan had prepared for the travellers was over peggy went upstairs to see willie safe in bed for he had to have the same care taken of him that a little child of four years old requires michael drew near to susan susan said he i took will to see dr preston at kendal hes the first doctor in the county i thought it were better for usfor youto know at once what chance there were for him well said susan looking eagerly up she saw the same strange glance of satisfaction the same instant change to apparent regret and pain what did he say said she speak cant you he said he would never get better of his weakness never no never its a long word and hard to bear and theres worse to come dearest the doctor thinks he will get badder from year to year and he said if he was usyouhe would send him off in time to lancaster asylum theyve ways there both of keeping such people in order and making them happy i only tell you what he said continued he seeing the gathering storm in her face there was no harm in his saying it she replied with great selfconstraint forcing herself to speak coldly instead of angrily folk is welcome to their opinions they sat silent for a minute or two her breast heaving with suppressed feeling hes counted a very clever man said michael at length he may be hes none of my clever men nor am i going to be guided by him whatever he may think and i dont thank them that went and took my poor lad to have such harsh notions formed about him if id been there i could have called out the sense that is in him well ill not say more tonight susan youre not taking it rightly and id best be gone and leave you to think it over ill not deny they are hard words to hear but theres sense in them as i take it and i reckon youll have to come to em anyhow its a bad way of thanking me for my pains and i dont take it well in you susan said he getting up as if offended michael im beside myself with sorrow dont blame me if i speak sharp he and me is the only ones you see and mother did so charge me to have a care of him and this is what hes come to poor lile chap she began to cry and michael to comfort her with caresses dont said she its no use trying to make me forget poor willie is a natural i could hate myself for being happy with you even for just a little minute go away and leave me to face it out and youll think it over susan and remember what the doctor says i cant forget it said she she meant she could not forget what the doctor had said about the hopelessness of her brothers case michael had referred to the plan of sending willie away to an asylum or madhouse as they were called in that day and place the idea had been gathering force in michaels mind for some time he had talked it over with his father and secretly rejoiced over the possession of the farm and land which would then be his in fact if not in law by right of his wife he had always considered the good penny her father could give her in his catalogue of susans charms and attractions but of late he had grown to esteem her as the heiress of yew nook he too should have land like his brotherland to possess to cultivate to make profit from to bequeath for some time he had wondered that susan had been so much absorbed in willies present that she had never seemed to look forward to his future state michael had long felt the boy to be a trouble but of late he had absolutely loathed him his gibbering his uncouth gestures his loose shambling gait all irritated michael inexpressibly he did not come near the yew nook for a couple of days he thought that he would leave her time to become anxious to see him and reconciled to his plan they were strange lonely days to susan they were the first she had spent face to face with the sorrows that had turned her from a girl into a woman for hitherto michael had never let twentyfour hours pass by without coming to see her since she had had the fever now that he was absent it seemed as though some cause of irritation was removed from will who was much more gentle and tractable than he had been for many weeks susan thought that she observed him making efforts at her bidding and there was something piteous in the way in which he crept up to her and looked wistfully in her face as if asking her to restore him the faculties that he felt to be wanting i never will let thee go lad never theres no knowing where they would take thee to or what they would do with thee as it says in the bible nought but death shall part thee and me the countryside was full in those days of stories of the brutal treatment offered to the insane stories that were in fact but too well founded and the truth of one of which only would have been a sufficient reason for the strong prejudice existing against all such places each succeeding hour that susan passed alone or with the poor affectionate lad for her sole companion served to deepen her solemn resolution never to part with him so when michael came he was annoyed and surprised by the calm way in which she spoke as if following dr prestons advice was utterly and entirely out of the question he had expected nothing less than a consent reluctant it might be but still a consent and he was extremely irritated he could have repressed his anger but he chose rather to give way to it thinking that he could thus best work upon susans affection so as to gain his point but somehow he overreached himself and now he was astonished in his turn at the passion of indignation that she burst into thou wilt not bide in the same house with him sayst thou theres no need for thy biding as far as i can tell theres solemn reason why i should bide with my own flesh and blood and keep to the word i pledged my mother on her deathbed but as for thee theres no tie that i know on to keep thee fro going to america or botany bay this very night if that were thy inclination i will have no more of your threats to make me send my bairn away if thou marry me thoult help me to take charge of willie if thou doesnt choose to marry me on those termswhy i can snap my fingers at thee never fear im not so far gone in love as that but i will not have thee if thou sayst in such a hectoring way that willie must go out of the houseand the house his own toobefore thoult set foot in it willie bides here and i bide with him thou hast maybe spoken a word too much said michael pale with rage if i am free as thou sayst to go to canada or botany bay i reckon im free to live where i like and that will not be with a natural who may turn into a madman some day for aught i know choose between him and me susy for i swear to thee thou shant have both i have chosen said susan now perfectly composed and still whatever comes of it i bide with willie very well replied michael trying to assume an equal composure of manner then ill wish you a very good night he went out of the housedoor halfexpecting to be called back again but instead he heard a hasty step inside and a bolt drawn whew said he to himself i think i must leave my lady alone for a week or two and give her time to come to her senses shell not find it so easy as she thinks to let me go so he went past the kitchenwindow in nonchalant style and was not seen again at yew nook for some weeks how did he pass the time for the first day or two he was unusually cross with all things and people that came athwart him then wheatharvest began and he was busy and exultant about his heavy crop then a man came from a distance to bid for the lease of his farm which by his fathers advice had been offered for sale as he himself was so soon likely to remove to the yew nook he had so little idea that susan really would remain firm to her determination that he at once began to haggle with the man who came after his farm showed him the crop just got in and managed skilfully enough to make a good bargain for himself of course the bargain had to be sealed at the publichouse and the companions he met with there soon became friends enough to tempt him into langdale where again he met with eleanor hebthwaite how did susan pass the time for the first day or so she was too angry and offended to cry she went about her household duties in a quick sharp jerking yet absent way shrinking one moment from will overwhelming him with remorseful caresses the next the third day of michaels absence she had the relief of a good fit of crying and after that she grew softer and more tender she felt how harshly she had spoken to him and remembered how angry she had been she made excuses for him it was no wonder she said to herself that he had been vexed with her and no wonder he would not give in when she had never tried to speak gently or to reason with him she was to blame and she would tell him so and tell him once again all that her mother had bade her be to willie and all the horrible stories she had heard about madhouses and he would be on her side at once and so she watched for his coming intending to apologise as soon as ever she saw him she hurried over her household work in order to sit quietly at her sewing and hear the first distant sound of his wellknown step or whistle but even the sound of her flying needle seemed too loudperhaps she was losing an exquisite instant of anticipation so she stopped sewing and looked longingly out through the geranium leaves in order that her eye might catch the first stir of the branches in the woodpath by which he generally came now and then a bird might spring out of the covert otherwise the leaves were heavily still in the sultry weather of early autumn then she would take up her sewing and with a spasm of resolution she would determine that a certain task should be fulfilled before she would again allow herself the poignant luxury of expectation sick at heart was she when the evening closed in and the chances of that day diminished yet she stayed up longer than usual thinking that if he were comingif he were only passing along the distant roadthe sight of a light in the window might encourage him to make his appearance even at that late hour while seeing the house all darkened and shut up might quench any such intention very sick and weary at heart she went to bed too desolate and despairing to cry or make any moan but in the morning hope came afresh another dayanother chance and so it went on for weeks peggy understood her young mistresss sorrow full well and respected it by her silence on the subject willie seemed happier now that the irritation of michaels presence was removed for the poor idiot had a sort of antipathy to michael which was a kind of hearts echo to the repugnance in which the latter held him altogether just at this time willie was the happiest of the three as susan went into coniston to sell her butter one saturday some inconsiderate person told her that she had seen michael hurst the night before i said inconsiderate but i might rather have said unobservant for any one who had spent halfanhour in susan dixons company might have seen that she disliked having any reference made to the subjects nearest her heart were they joyous or grievous now she went a little paler than usual and she had never recovered her colour since she had had the fever and tried to keep silence but an irrepressible pang forced out the question where at thomas applethwaites in langdale they had a kind of harvesthome and he were there among the young folk and very thick wi nelly hebthwaite old thomass niece thoult have to look after him a bit susan she neither smiled nor sighed the neighbour who had been speaking to her was struck with the gray stillness of her face susan herself felt how well her selfcommand was obeyed by every little muscle and said to herself in her spartan manner i can bear it without either wincing or blenching she went home early at a tearing passionate pace trampling and breaking through all obstacles of briar or bush willie was moping in her absencehanging listlessly on the farmyard gate to watch for her when he saw her he set up one of his strange inarticulate cries of which she was now learning the meaning and came towards her with his loose galloping run head and limbs all shaking and wagging with pleasant excitement suddenly she turned from him and burst into tears she sat down on a stone by the wayside not a hundred yards from home and buried her face in her hands and gave way to a passion of pentup sorrow so terrible and full of agony were her low cries that the idiot stood by her aghast and silent all his joy gone for the time but not like her joy turned into ashes some thought struck him yes the sight of her woe made him think great as the exertion was he ran and stumbled and shambled home buzzing with his lips all the time she never missed him he came back in a trice bringing with him his cherished paper windmill bought on that fatal day when michael had taken him into kendal to have his doom of perpetual idiotcy pronounced he thrust it into susans face her hands her lap regardless of the injury his frail plaything thereby received he leapt before her to think how he had cured all heartsorrow buzzing louder than ever susan looked up at him and that glance of her sad eyes sobered him he began to whimper he knew not why and she now comforter in her turn tried to soothe him by twirling his windmill but it was broken it made no noise it would not go round this seemed to afflict susan more than him she tried to make it right although she saw the task was hopeless and while she did so the tears rained down unheeded from her bent head on the paper toy it wont do said she at last it will never do again and somehow she took the accident and her words as omens of the love that was broken and that she feared could never be pieced together more she rose up and took willies hand and the two went slowly in to the house to her surprise michael hurst sat in the houseplace houseplace is a sort of better kitchen where no cookery is done but which is reserved for state occasions michael had gone in there because he was accompanied by his only sister a woman older than himself who was well married beyond keswick and who now came for the first time to make acquaintance with susan michael had primed his sister with his wishes regarding will and the position in which he stood with susan and arriving at yew nook in the absence of the latter he had not scrupled to conduct his sister into the guestroom as he held mrs gales worldly position in respect and admiration and therefore wished her to be favourably impressed with all the signs of property which he was beginning to consider as susans greatest charms he had secretly said to himself that if eleanor hebthwaite and susan dixon were equal in point of riches he would sooner have eleanor by far he had begun to consider susan as a termagant and when he thought of his intercourse with her recollections of her somewhat warm and hasty temper came far more readily to his mind than any remembrance of her generous loving nature and now she stood face to face with him her eyes tearswollen her garments dusty and here and there torn in consequence of her rapid progress through the bushy bypaths she did not make a favourable impression on the wellclad mrs gale dressed in her best silk gown and therefore unusually susceptible to the appearance of another nor were susans manners gracious or cordial how could they be when she remembered what had passed between michael and herself the last time they met for her penitence had faded away under the daily disappointment of these last weary weeks but she was hospitable in substance she bade peggy hurry on the kettle and busied herself among the teacups thankful that the presence of mrs gale as a stranger would prevent the immediate recurrence to the one subject which she felt must be present in michaels mind as well as in her own but mrs gale was withheld by no such feelings of delicacy she had come readyprimed with the case and had undertaken to bring the girl to reason there was no time to be lost it had been prearranged between the brother and sister that he was to stroll out into the farmyard before his sister introduced the subject but she was so confident in the success of her arguments that she must needs have the triumph of a victory as soon as possible and accordingly she brought a hailstorm of good reasons to bear upon susan susan did not reply for a long time she was so indignant at this intermeddling of a stranger in the deep family sorrow and shame mrs gale thought she was gaining the day and urged her arguments more pitilessly even michael winced for susan and wondered at her silence he shrunk out of sight and into the shadow hoping that his sister might prevail but annoyed at the hard way in which she kept putting the case suddenly susan turned round from the occupation she had pretended to be engaged in and said to him in a low voice which yet not only vibrated itself but made its hearers thrill through all their obtuseness michael hurst does your sister speak truth think you both women looked at him for his answer mrs gale without anxiety for had she not said the very words they had spoken together before had she not used the very arguments that he himself had suggested susan on the contrary looked to his answer as settling her doom for life and in the gloom of her eyes you might have read more despair than hope he shuffled his position he shuffled in his words what is it you ask my sister has said many things i ask you said susan trying to give a crystal clearness both to her expressions and her pronunciation if knowing as you do how will is afflicted you will help me to take that charge of him which i promised my mother on her deathbed that i would do and which means that i shall keep him always with me and do all in my power to make his life happy if you will do this i will be your wife if not i remain unwed but he may get dangerous he can be but a trouble his being here is a pain to you susan not a pleasure i ask you for either yes or no said she a little contempt at his evading her question mingling with her tone he perceived it and it nettled him and i have told you i answered your question the last time i was here i said i would neer keep house with an idiot no more i will so now youve gotten your answer i have said susan and she sighed deeply come now said mrs gale encouraged by the sigh one would think you dont love michael susan to be so stubborn in yielding to what im sure would be best for the lad oh she does not care for me said michael i dont believe she ever did dont i havent i asked susan her eyes blazing out fire she left the room directly and sent peggy in to make the tea and catching at will who was lounging about in the kitchen she went upstairs with him and bolted herself in straining the boy to her heart and keeping almost breathless lest any noise she made might cause him to break out into the howls and sounds which she could not bear that those below should hear a knock at the door it was peggy he wants for to see you to wish you goodbye i cannot come oh peggy send them away it was her only cry for sympathy and the old servant understood it she sent them away somehow not politely as i have been given to understand good go with them said peggy as she grimly watched their retreating figures were rid of bad rubbish anyhow and she turned into the house with the intention of making ready some refreshment for susan after her hard day at the market and her harder evening but in the kitchen to which she passed through the empty houseplace making a face of contemptuous dislike at the used teacups and fragments of a meal yet standing there she found susan with her sleeves tucked up and her working apron on busied in preparing to make clapbread one of the hardest and hottest domestic tasks of a daleswoman she looked up and first met and then avoided peggys eye it was too full of sympathy her own cheeks were flushed and her own eyes were dry and burning wheres the board peggy we need clapbread and i reckon ive time to get through with it tonight her voice had a sharp dry tone in it and her motions a jerking angularity about them peggy said nothing but fetched her all that she needed susan beat her cakes thin with vehement force as she stooped over them regardless even of the task in which she seemed so much occupied she was surprised by a touch on her mouth of somethingwhat she did not see at first it was a cup of tea delicately sweetened and cooled and held to her lips when exactly ready by the faithful old woman susan held it off a hands breath and looked into peggys eyes while her own filled with the strange relief of tears lass said peggy solemnly thou hast done well it is not long to bide and then the end will come but you are very old peggy said susan quivering it is but a day sin i were young replied peggy but she stopped the conversation by again pushing the cup with gentle force to susans dry and thirsty lips when she had drunken she fell again to her labour peggy heating the hearth and doing all that she knew would be required but never speaking another word willie basked close to the fire enjoying the animal luxury of warmth for the autumn evenings were beginning to be chilly it was one oclock before they thought of going to bed on that memorable night chapter iv the vehemence with which susan dixon threw herself into occupation could not last for ever times of languor and remembrance would cometimes when she recurred with a passionate yearning to bygone days the recollection of which was so vivid and delicious that it seemed as though it were the reality and the present bleak bareness the dream she smiled anew at the magical sweetness of some touch or tone which in memory she felt and heard and drank the delicious cup of poison although at the very time she knew what the consequences of racking pain would be this time last year thought she we went nutting togetherthis very day last year just such a day as today purple and gold were the lights on the hills the leaves were just turning brown here and there on the sunny slopes the stubblefields looked tawny down in a cleft of yon purple slaterock the beck fell like a silver glancing thread all just as it is today and he climbed the slender swaying nuttrees and bent the branches for me to gather or made a passage through the hazel copses from time to time claiming a toll who could have thought he loved me so littlewhowho or as the evening closed in she would allow herself to imagine that she heard his coming step just that she might recall the feeling of exquisite delight which had passed by without the due and passionate relish at the time then she would wonder how she could have had strength the cruel selfpiercing strength to say what she had done to stab herself with that stern resolution of which the scar would remain till her dying day it might have been right but as she sickened she wished she had not instinctively chosen the right how luxurious a life haunted by no stern sense of duty must be and many led this kind of life why could not she o for one hour again of his sweet company if he came now she would agree to whatever he proposed it was a fever of the mind she passed through it and came out healthy if weak she was capable once more of taking pleasure in following an unseen guide through briar and brake she returned with tenfold affection to her protecting care of willie she acknowledged to herself that he was to be her allinall in life she made him her constant companion for his sake as the real owner of yew nook and she as his steward and guardian she began that course of careful saving and that love of acquisition which afterwards gained for her the reputation of being miserly she still thought that he might regain a scanty portion of senseenough to require some simple pleasures and excitement which would cost money and money should not be wanting peggy rather assisted her in the formation of her parsimonious habits than otherwise economy was the order of the district and a certain degree of respectable avarice the characteristic of her age only willie was never stinted nor hindered of anything that the two women thought could give him pleasure for want of money there was one gratification which susan felt was needed for the restoration of her mind to its more healthy state after she had passed through the whirling fever when duty was as nothing and anarchy reigned a gratificationthat somehow was to be her last burst of unreasonableness of which she knew and recognised pain as the sure consequence she must see him once moreherself unseen the week before the christmas of this memorable year she went out in the dusk of the early winter evening wrapped close in shawl and cloak she wore her dark shawl under her cloak putting it over her head in lieu of a bonnet for she knew that she might have to wait long in concealment then she tramped over the wet fellpath shut in by misty rain for miles and miles till she came to the place where he was lodging a farmhouse in langdale with a steep stony lane leading up to it this lane was entered by a gate out of the main road and by the gate were a few bushesthorns but of them the leaves had fallen and they offered no concealment an old wreck of a yewtree grew among them however and underneath that susan cowered down shrouding her face of which the colour might betray her with a corner of her shawl long did she wait cold and cramped she became too damp and stiff to change her posture readily and after all he might never come but she would wait till daylight if need were and she pulled out a crust with which she had providently supplied herself the rain had ceaseda dull still brooding weather had succeeded it was a night to hear distant sounds she heard horses hoofs striking and plashing in the stones and in the pools of the road at her back two horses not wellridden or evenly guided as she could tell michael hurst and a companion drew near not tipsy but not sober they stopped at the gate to bid each other a maudlin farewell michael stooped forward to catch the latch with the hook of the stick which he carried he dropped the stick and it fell with one end close to susanindeed with the slightest change of posture she could have opened the gate for him he swore a great oath and struck his horse with his closed fist as if that animal had been to blame then he dismounted opened the gate and fumbled about for his stick when he had found it susan had touched the other end his first use of it was to flog his horse well and she had much ado to avoid its kicks and plunges then still swearing he staggered up the lane for it was evident he was not sober enough to remount by daylight susan was back and at her daily labours at yew nook when the spring came michael hurst was married to eleanor hebthwaite others too were married and christenings made their firesides merry and glad or they travelled and came back after long years with many wondrous tales more rarely perhaps a dalesman changed his dwelling but to all households more change came than to yew nook there the seasons came round with monotonous sameness or if they brought mutation it was of a slow and decaying and depressing kind old peggy died her silent sympathy concealed under much roughness was a loss to susan dixon susan was not yet thirty when this happened but she looked a middleaged not to say an elderly woman people affirmed that she had never recovered her complexion since that fever a dozen years ago which killed her father and left will dixon an idiot but besides her gray sallowness the lines in her face were strong and deep and hard the movements of her eyeballs were slow and heavy the wrinkles at the corners of her mouth and eyes were planted firm and sure not an ounce of unnecessary flesh was there on her bonesevery muscle started strong and ready for use she needed all this bodily strength to a degree that no human creature now peggy was dead knew of for willie had grown up large and strong in body and in general docile enough in mind but every now and then he became first moody and then violent these paroxysms lasted but a day or two and it was susans anxious care to keep their very existence hidden and unknown it is true that occasional passersby on that lonely road heard sounds at night of knocking about of furniture blows and cries as of some tearing demon within the solitary farmhouse but these fits of violence usually occurred in the night and whatever had been their consequence susan had tidied and redded up all signs of aught unusual before the morning for above all she dreaded lest some one might find out in what danger and peril she occasionally was and might assume a right to take away her brother from her care the one idea of taking charge of him had deepened and deepened with years it was graven into her mind as the object for which she lived the sacrifice she had made for this object only made it more precious to her besides she separated the idea of the docile affectionate loutish indolent will and kept it distinct from the terror which the demon that occasionally possessed him inspired her with the one was her flesh and her bloodthe child of her dead mother the other was some fiend who came to torture and convulse the creature she so loved she believed that she fought her brothers battle in holding down those tearing hands in binding whenever she could those uplifted restless arms prompt and prone to do mischief all the time she subdued him with her cunning or her strength she spoke to him in pitying murmurs or abused the third person the fiendish enemy in no unmeasured tones towards morning the paroxysm was exhausted and he would fall asleep perhaps only to waken with evil and renewed vigour but when he was laid down she would sally out to taste the fresh air and to work off her wild sorrow in cries and mutterings to herself the early labourers saw her gestures at a distance and thought her as crazed as the idiotbrother who made the neighbourhood a haunted place but did any chance person call at yew nook later on in the day he would find susan dixon cold calm collected her manner curt her wits keen once this fit of violence lasted longer than usual susans strength both of mind and body was nearly worn out she wrestled in prayer that somehow it might end before she too was driven mad or worse might be obliged to give up lifes aim and consign willie to a madhouse from that moment of prayer as she afterwards superstitiously thought willie calmedand then he droopedand then he sankand last of all he died in reality from physical exhaustion but he was so gentle and tender as he lay on his dying bed such strange childlike gleams of returning intelligence came over his face long after the power to make his dull inarticulate sounds had departed that susan was attracted to him by a stronger tie than she had ever felt before it was something to have even an idiot loving her with dumb wistful animal affection something to have any creature looking at her with such beseeching eyes imploring protection from the insidious enemy stealing on and yet she knew that to him death was no enemy but a true friend restoring light and health to his poor clouded mind it was to her that death was an enemy to her the survivor when willie died there was no one to love her worse doom still there was no one left on earth for her to love you now know why no wandering tourist could persuade her to receive him as a lodger why no tired traveller could melt her heart to afford him rest and refreshment why long habits of seclusion had given her a moroseness of manner and how care for the interests of another had rendered her keen and miserly but there was a third act in the drama of her life chapter v in spite of peggys prophecy that susans life should not seem long it did seem wearisome and endless as the years slowly uncoiled their monotonous circles to be sure she might have made change for herself but she did not care to do it it was indeed more than not caring which merely implies a certain degree of vis inerti to be subdued before an object can be attained and that the object itself does not seem to be of sufficient importance to call out the requisite energy on the contrary susan exerted herself to avoid change and variety she had a morbid dread of new faces which originated in her desire to keep poor dead willies state a profound secret she had a contempt for new customs and indeed her old ways prospered so well under her active hand and vigilant eye that it was difficult to know how they could be improved upon she was regularly present in coniston market with the best butter and the earliest chickens of the season those were the common farm produce that every farmers wife about had to sell but susan after she had disposed of the more feminine articles turned to on the mans side a better judge of a horse or cow there was not in all the country round yorkshire itself might have attempted to jockey her and would have failed her corn was sound and clean her potatoes well preserved to the latest spring people began to talk of the hoards of money susan dixon must have laid up somewhere and one young neerdoweel of a farmers son undertook to make love to the woman of forty who looked fiftyfive if a day he made up to her by opening a gate on the roadpath home as she was riding on a barebacked horse her purchase not an hour ago she was off before him refusing his civility but the remounting was not so easy and rather than fail she did not choose to attempt it she walked and he walked alongside improving his opportunity which as he vainly thought had been consciously granted to him as they drew near yew nook he ventured on some expression of a wish to keep company with her his words were vague and clumsily arranged susan turned round and coolly asked him to explain himself he took courage as he thought of her reputed wealth and expressed his wishes this second time pretty plainly to his surprise the reply she made was in a series of smart strokes across his shoulders administered through the medium of a supple hazelswitch take that said she almost breathless to teach thee how thou darest make a fool of an honest woman old enough to be thy mother if thou comst a step nearer the house theres a good horsepool and theres two stout fellows wholl like no better fun than ducking thee be off wi thee and she strode into her own premises never looking round to see whether he obeyed her injunction or not sometimes three or four years would pass over without her hearing michael hursts name mentioned she used to wonder at such times whether he were dead or alive she would sit for hours by the dying embers of her fire on a winters evening trying to recall the scenes of her youth trying to bring up living pictures of the faces she had then knownmichaels most especially she thought it was possible so long had been the lapse of years that she might now pass by him in the street unknowing and unknown his outward form she might not recognise but himself she should feel in the thrill of her whole being he could not pass her unawares what little she did hear about him all testified a downward tendency he dranknot at stated times when there was no other work to be done but continually whether it was seedtime or harvest his children were all ill at the same time then one died while the others recovered but were poor sickly things no one dared to give susan any direct intelligence of her former lover many avoided all mention of his name in her presence but a few spoke out either in indifference to or ignorance of those bygone days susan heard every word every whisper every sound that related to him but her eye never changed nor did a muscle of her face move late one november night she sat over her fire not a human being besides herself in the house none but she had ever slept there since willies death the farmlabourers had foddered the cattle and gone home hours before there were crickets chirping all round the warm hearthstones there was the clock ticking with the peculiar beat susan had known from her childhood and which then and ever since she had oddly associated with the idea of a mother and child talking together one loud tick and quicka feeble sharp one following the day had been keen and piercingly cold the whole lift of heaven seemed a dome of iron black and frostbound was the earth under the cruel east wind now the wind had dropped and as the darkness had gathered in the weatherwise old labourers prophesied snow the sounds in the air arose again as susan sat still and silent they were of a different character to what they had been during the prevalence of the east wind then they had been shrill and piping now they were like low distant growling not unmusical but strangely threatening susan went to the window and drew aside the little curtain the whole world was whitethe air was blinded with the swift and heavy fall of snow at present it came down straight but susan knew those distant sounds in the hollows and gulleys of the hills portended a driving wind and a more cruel storm she thought of her sheep were they all folded the newborn calf was it bedded well before the drifts were formed too deep for her to pass in and outand by the morning she judged that they would be six or seven feet deepshe would go out and see after the comfort of her beasts she took a lantern and tied a shawl over her head and went out into the open air she had tenderly provided for all her animals and was returning when borne on the blast as if some spiritcryfor it seemed to come rather down from the skies than from any creature standing on earths levelshe heard a voice of agony she could not distinguish words it seemed rather as if some bird of prey was being caught in the whirl of the icy wind and torn and tortured by its violence again up high above susan put down her lantern and shouted loud in return it was an instinct for if the creature were not human which she had doubted but a moment before what good could her responding cry do and her cry was seized on by the tyrannous wind and borne farther away in the opposite direction to that from which the call of agony had proceeded again she listened no sound then again it rang through space and this time she was sure it was human she turned into the house and heaped turf and wood on the fire which careless of her own sensations she had allowed to fade and almost die out she put a new candle in her lantern she changed her shawl for a maud and leaving the door on latch she sallied out just at the moment when her ear first encountered the weird noises of the storm on issuing forth into the open air she thought she heard the words o god o help they were a guide to her if words they were for they came straight from a rock not a quarter of a mile from yew nook but only to be reached on account of its precipitous character by a roundabout path thither she steered defying wind and snow guided by here a thorntree there an old doddered oak which had not quite lost their identity under the whelming mask of snow now and then she stopped to listen but never a word or sound heard she till right from where the copsewood grew thick and tangled at the base of the rock round which she was winding she heard a moan into the brakeall snow in appearancealmost a plain of snow looked on from the little eminence where she stoodshe plunged breaking down the bush stumbling bruising herself fighting her way her lantern held between her teeth and she herself using head as well as hands to butt away a passage at whatever cost of bodily injury as she climbed or staggered owing to the unevenness of the snowcovered ground where the briars and weeds of years were tangled and matted together her foot felt something strangely soft and yielding she lowered her lantern there lay a man prone on his face nearly covered by the fastfalling flakes he must have fallen from the rock above as not knowing of the circuitous path he had tried to descend its steep slippery face who could tell it was no time for thinking susan lifted him up with her wiry strength he gave no helpno sign of life but for all that he might be alive he was still warm she tied her maud round him she fastened the lantern to her apronstring she held him tight halfcarrying halfdraggingwhat did a few bruises signify to him compared to dear life to precious life she got him through the brake and down the path there for an instant she stopped to take breath but as if stung by the furies she pushed on again with almost superhuman strength clasping him round the waist and leaning his dead weight against the lintel of the door she tried to undo the latch but now just at this moment a trembling faintness came over her and a fearful dread took possession of herthat here on the very threshold of her home she might be found dead and buried under the snow when the farmservants came in the morning this terror stirred her up to one more effort then she and her companion were in the warmth of the quiet haven of that kitchen she laid him on the settle and sank on the floor by his side how long she remained in this swoon she could not tell not very long she judged by the fire which was still red and sullenly glowing when she came to herself she lighted the candle and bent over her late burden to ascertain if indeed he were dead she stood long gazing the man lay dead there could be no doubt about it his filmy eyes glared at her unshut but susan was not one to be affrighted by the stony aspect of death it was not that it was the bitter woeful recognition of michael hurst she was convinced he was dead but after a while she refused to believe in her conviction she stripped off his wet outergarments with trembling hurried hands she brought a blanket down from her own bed she made up the fire she swathed him in fresh warm wrappings and laid him on the flags before the fire sitting herself at his head and holding it in her lap while she tenderly wiped his loose wet hair curly still although its colour had changed from nutbrown to irongray since she had seen it last from time to time she bent over the face afresh sick and fain to believe that the flicker of the firelight was some slight convulsive motion but the dim staring eyes struck chill to her heart at last she ceased her delicate busy cares but she still held the head softly as if caressing it she thought over all the possibilities and chances in the mingled yarn of their lives that might by so slight a turn have ended far otherwise if her mothers cold had been early tended so that the responsibility as to her brothers weal or woe had not fallen upon her if the fever had not taken such rough cruel hold on will nay if mrs gale that hard worldly sister had not accompanied him on his last visit to yew nookhis very last before this fatal stormy night if she had heard his crycry uttered by those pale dead lips with such wild despairing agony not yet three hours agoo if she had but heard it sooner he might have been saved before that blind false step had precipitated him down the rock in going over this weary chain of unrealised possibilities susan learnt the force of peggys words life was short looking back upon it it seemed but yesterday since all the love of her being had been poured out and run to waste the intervening yearsthe long monotonous years that had turned her into an old woman before her timewere but a dream the labourers coming in the dawn of the winters day were surprised to see the firelight through the low kitchenwindow they knocked and hearing a moaning answer they entered fearing that something had befallen their mistress for all explanation they got these words it is michael hurst he was belated and fell down the ravens crag where does eleanor his wife live how michael hurst got to yew nook no one but susan ever knew they thought he had dragged himself there with some sore internal bruise sapping away his minuted life they could not have believed the superhuman exertion which had first sought him out and then dragged him hither only susan knew of that she gave him into the charge of her servants and went out and saddled her horse where the wind had drifted the snow on one side and the road was clear and bare she rode and rode fast where the soft deceitful heaps were massed up she dismounted and led her steed plunging in deep with fierce energy the pain at her heart urging her onwards with a sharp digging spur the gray solemn winters noon was more nightlike than the depth of summers night dimpurple brooded the low skies over the white earth as susan rode up to what had been michael hursts abode while living it was a small farmhouse carelessly kept outside slatternly tended within the pretty nelly hebthwaite was pretty still her delicate face had never suffered from any longenduring feeling if anything its expression was that of plaintive sorrow but the soft light hair had scarcely a tinge of gray the woodrose tint of complexion yet remained if not so brilliant as in youth the straight nose the small mouth were untouched by time susan felt the contrast even at that moment she knew that her own skin was weatherbeaten furrowed brownthat her teeth were gone and her hair gray and ragged and yet she was not two years older than nellyshe had not been in youth when she took account of these things nelly stood wondering at the strangeenough horsewoman who stopped and panted at the door holding her horses bridle and refusing to enter where is michael hurst asked susan at last well i cant rightly say he should have been at home last night but he was off seeing after a publichouse to be let at ulverstone for our farm does not answer and we were thinking he did not come home last night said susan cutting short the story and halfaffirming halfquestioning by way of letting in a ray of the awful light before she let it full in in its consuming wrath no hell be stopping somewhere out ulverstone ways im sure weve need of him at home for ive no one but lile tommy to help me tend the beasts things have not gone well with us and we dont keep a servant now but youre trembling all over maam youd better come in and take something warm while your horse rests thats the stabledoor to your left susan took her horse there loosened his girths and rubbed him down with a wisp of straw then she looked about her for hay but the place was bare of food and smelt damp and unused she went to the house thankful for the respite and got some clapbread which she mashed up in a pailful of lukewarm water every moment was a respite and yet every moment made her dread the more the task that lay before her it would be longer than she thought at first she took the saddle off and hung about her horse which seemed somehow more like a friend than anything else in the world she laid her cheek against its neck and rested there before returning to the house for the last time eleanor had brought down one of her own gowns which hung on a chair against the fire and had made her unknown visitor a cup of hot tea susan could hardly bear all these little attentions they choked her and yet she was so wet so weak with fatigue and excitement that she could neither resist by voice or by action two children stood awkwardly about puzzled at the scene and even eleanor began to wish for some explanation of who her strange visitor was youve maybe heard him speaking of me im called susan dixon nelly coloured and avoided meeting susans eye ive heard other folk speak of you he never named your name this respect of silence came like balm to susan balm not felt or heeded at the time it was applied but very grateful in its effects for all that he is at my house continued susan determined not to stop or quaver in the operationthe pain which must be inflicted at your house yew nook questioned eleanor surprised how came he therehalf jealously did he take shelter from the coming storm tell methere is somethingtell me woman he took no shelter would to god he had o would to god would to god shrieked out eleanor learning all from the woful import of those dreary eyes her cries thrilled through the house the childrens piping wailings and passionate cries on daddy daddy pierced into susans very marrow but she remained as still and tearless as the great round face upon the clock at last in a lull of crying she saidnot exactly questioningbut as if partly to herself you loved him then loved him he was my husband he was the father of three bonny bairns that lie dead in grasmere churchyard i wish youd go susan dixon and let me weep without your watching me i wish youd never come near the place alas alas it would not have brought him to life i would have laid down my own to save his my life has been so very sad no one would have cared if i had died alas alas the tone in which she said this was so utterly mournful and despairing that it awed nelly into quiet for a time but byandby she said i would not turn a dog out to do it harm but the night is clear and tommy shall guide you to the red cow but o i want to be alone if youll come back tomorrow ill be better and ill hear all and thank you for every kindness you have shown himand i do believe youve showed him kindnessthough i dont know why susan moved heavily and strangely she said somethingher words came thick and unintelligible she had had a paralytic stroke since she had last spoken she could not go even if she would nor did eleanor when she became aware of the state of the case wish her to leave she had her laid on her own bed and weeping silently all the while for her lost husband she nursed susan like a sister she did not know what her guests worldly position might be and she might never be repaid but she sold many a little trifle to purchase such small comforts as susan needed susan lying still and motionless learnt much it was not a severe stroke it might be the forerunner of others yet to come but at some distance of time but for the present she recovered and regained much of her former health on her sickbed she matured her plans when she returned to yew nook she took michael hursts widow and children with her to live there and fill up the haunted hearth with living forms that should banish the ghosts and so it fell out that the latter days of susan dixons life were better than the former when this narrative was finished mrs dawson called on our two gentlemen signor sperano and mr preston and told them that they had hitherto been amused or interested but that it was now their turn to amuse or interest they looked at each other as if this application of hers took them by surprise and seemed altogether as much abashed as wellgrown men can ever be signor sperano was the first to recover himself after thinking a little he said your will dear lady is law next monday evening i will bring you an old old story which i found among the papers of the good old priest who first welcomed me to england it was but a poor return for his generous kindness but i had the opportunity of nursing him through the cholera of which he died he left me all that he hadno moneybut his scanty furniture his book of prayers his crucifix and rosary and his papers how some of those papers came into his hands i know not they had evidently been written many years before the venerable man was born and i doubt whether he had ever examined the bundles which had come down to him from some old ancestor or in some strange bequest his life was too busy to leave any time for the gratification of mere curiosity i alas have only had too much leisure next monday signor sperano read to us the story which i will call the poor clare the poor clare chapter i december th my life has been strangely bound up with extraordinary incidents some of which occurred before i had any connection with the principal actors in them or indeed before i even knew of their existence i suppose most old men are like me more given to looking back upon their own career with a kind of fond interest and affectionate remembrance than to watching the eventsthough these may have far more interest for the multitudeimmediately passing before their eyes if this should be the case with the generality of old people how much more so with me if i am to enter upon that strange story connected with poor lucy i must begin a long way back i myself only came to the knowledge of her family history after i knew her but to make the tale clear to any one else i must arrange events in the order in which they occurrednot that in which i became acquainted with them there is a great old hall in the northeast of lancashire in a part they call the trough of bolland adjoining that other district named craven starkey manorhouse is rather like a number of rooms clustered round a gray massive old keep than a regularlybuilt hall indeed i suppose that the house only consisted of the great tower in the centre in the days when the scots made their raids terrible as far south as this and that after the stuarts came in and there was a little more security of property in those parts the starkeys of that time added the lower building which runs two stories high all round the base of the keep there has been a grand garden laid out in my days on the southern slope near the house but when i first knew the place the kitchengarden at the farm was the only piece of cultivated ground belonging to it the deer used to come within sight of the drawingroom windows and might have browsed quite close up to the house if they had not been too wild and shy starkey manorhouse itself stood on a projection or peninsula of high land jutting out from the abrupt hills that form the sides of the trough of bolland these hills were rocky and bleak enough towards their summit lower down they were clothed with tangled copsewood and green depths of fern out of which a gray giant of an ancient foresttree would tower here and there throwing up its ghastly white branches as if in imprecation to the sky these trees they told me were the remnants of that forest which existed in the days of the heptarchy and were even then noted as landmarks no wonder that their upper and more exposed branches were leafless and that the dead bark had peeled away from sapless old age not far from the house there were a few cottages apparently of the same date as the keep probably built for some retainers of the family who sought shelterthey and their families and their small flocks and herdsat the hands of their feudal lord some of them had pretty much fallen to decay they were built in a strange fashion strong beams had been sunk firm in the ground at the requisite distance and their other ends had been fastened together two and two so as to form the shape of one of those rounded waggonheaded gipsytents only very much larger the spaces between were filled with mud stones osiers rubbish mortaranything to keep out the weather the fires were made in the centre of these rude dwellings a hole in the roof forming the only chimney no highland hut or irish cabin could be of rougher construction the owner of this property at the beginning of the present century was a mr patrick byrne starkey his family had kept to the old faith and were staunch roman catholics esteeming it even a sin to marry any one of protestant descent however willing he or she might have been to embrace the romish religion mr patrick starkeys father had been a follower of james the second and during the disastrous irish campaign of that monarch he had fallen in love with an irish beauty a miss byrne as zealous for her religion and for the stuarts as himself he had returned to ireland after his escape to france and married her bearing her back to the court at st germains but some licence on the part of the disorderly gentlemen who surrounded king james in his exile had insulted his beautiful wife and disgusted him so he removed from st germains to antwerp whence in a few years time he quietly returned to starkey manorhousesome of his lancashire neighbours having lent their good offices to reconcile him to the powers that were he was as firm a roman catholic as ever and as staunch an advocate for the stuarts and the divine right of kings but his religion almost amounted to asceticism and the conduct of those with whom he had been brought in such close contact at st germains would little bear the inspection of a stern moralist so he gave his allegiance where he could not give his esteem and learned to respect sincerely the upright and moral character of one whom he yet regarded as an usurper king williams government had little need to fear such a one so he returned as i have said with a sobered heart and impoverished fortunes to his ancestral house which had fallen sadly to ruin while the owner had been a courtier a soldier and an exile the roads into the trough of bolland were little more than cartruts indeed the way up to the house lay along a ploughed field before you came to the deerpark madam as the countryfolk used to call mrs starkey rode on a pillion behind her husband holding on to him with a light hand by his leather ridingbelt little master he that was afterwards squire patrick byrne starkey was held on to his pony by a servingman a woman past middle age walked with a firm and strong step by the cart that held much of the baggage and high up on the mails and boxes sat a girl of dazzling beauty perched lightly on the topmost trunk and swaying herself fearlessly to and fro as the cart rocked and shook in the heavy roads of late autumn the girl wore the antwerp faille or black spanish mantle over her head and altogether her appearance was such that the old cottager who described the procession to me many years after said that all the countryfolk took her for a foreigner some dogs and the boy who held them in charge made up the company they rode silently along looking with grave serious eyes at the people who came out of the scattered cottages to bow or curtsy to the real squire come back at last and gazed after the little procession with gaping wonder not deadened by the sound of the foreign language in which the few necessary words that passed among them were spoken one lad called from his staring by the squire to come and help about the cart accompanied them to the manorhouse he said that when the lady had descended from her pillion the middleaged woman whom i have described as walking while the others rode stepped quickly forward and taking madam starkey who was of a slight and delicate figure in her arms she lifted her over the threshold and set her down in her husbands house at the same time uttering a passionate and outlandish blessing the squire stood by smiling gravely at first but when the words of blessing were pronounced he took off his fine feathered hat and bent his head the girl with the black mantle stepped onward into the shadow of the dark hall and kissed the ladys hand and that was all the lad could tell to the group that gathered round him on his return eager to hear everything and to know how much the squire had given him for his services from all i could gather the manorhouse at the time of the squires return was in the most dilapidated state the stout gray walls remained firm and entire but the inner chambers had been used for all kinds of purposes the great withdrawingroom had been a barn the state tapestrychamber had held wool and so on but byandby they were cleared out and if the squire had no money to spend on new furniture he and his wife had the knack of making the best of the old he was no despicable joiner she had a kind of grace in whatever she did and imparted an air of elegant picturesqueness to whatever she touched besides they had brought many rare things from the continent perhaps i should rather say things that were rare in that part of englandcarvings and crosses and beautiful pictures and then again wood was plentiful in the trough of bolland and great logfires danced and glittered in all the dark old rooms and gave a look of home and comfort to everything why do i tell you all this i have little to do with the squire and madam starkey and yet i dwell upon them as if i were unwilling to come to the real people with whom my life was so strangely mixed up madam had been nursed in ireland by the very woman who lifted her in her arms and welcomed her to her husbands home in lancashire excepting for the short period of her own married life bridget fitzgerald had never left her nursling her marriageto one above her in rankhad been unhappy her husband had died and left her in even greater poverty than that in which she was when he had first met with her she had one child the beautiful daughter who came riding on the waggonload of furniture that was brought to the manorhouse madam starkey had taken her again into her service when she became a widow she and her daughter had followed the mistress in all her fortunes they had lived at st germains and at antwerp and were now come to her home in lancashire as soon as bridget had arrived there the squire gave her a cottage of her own and took more pains in furnishing it for her than he did in anything else out of his own house it was only nominally her residence she was constantly up at the great house indeed it was but a short cut across the woods from her own home to the home of her nursling her daughter mary in like manner moved from one house to the other at her own will madam loved both mother and child dearly they had great influence over her and through her over her husband whatever bridget or mary willed was sure to come to pass they were not disliked for though wild and passionate they were also generous by nature but the other servants were afraid of them as being in secret the ruling spirits of the household the squire had lost his interest in all secular things madam was gentle affectionate and yielding both husband and wife were tenderly attached to each other and to their boy but they grew more and more to shun the trouble of decision on any point and hence it was that bridget could exert such despotic power but if every one else yielded to her magic of a superior mind her daughter not unfrequently rebelled she and her mother were too much alike to agree there were wild quarrels between them and wilder reconciliations there were times when in the heat of passion they could have stabbed each other at all other times they bothbridget especiallywould have willingly laid down their lives for one another bridgets love for her child lay very deepdeeper than that daughter ever knew or i should think she would never have wearied of home as she did and prayed her mistress to obtain for her some situationas waitingmaidbeyond the seas in that more cheerful continental life among the scenes of which so many of her happiest years had been spent she thought as youth thinks that life would last for ever and that two or three years were but a small portion of it to pass away from her mother whose only child she was bridget thought differently but was too proud ever to show what she felt if her child wished to leave her whyshe should go but people said bridget became ten years older in the course of two months at this time she took it that mary wanted to leave her the truth was that mary wanted for a time to leave the place and to seek some change and would thankfully have taken her mother with her indeed when madam starkey had gotten her a situation with some grand lady abroad and the time drew near for her to go it was mary who clung to her mother with passionate embrace and with floods of tears declared that she would never leave her and it was bridget who at last loosened her arms and grave and tearless herself bade her keep her word and go forth into the wide world sobbing aloud and looking back continually mary went away bridget was still as death scarcely drawing her breath or closing her stony eyes till at last she turned back into her cottage and heaved a ponderous old settle against the door there she sat motionless over the gray ashes of her extinguished fire deaf to madams sweet voice as she begged leave to enter and comfort her nurse deaf stony and motionless she sat for more than twenty hours till for the third time madam came across the snowy path from the great house carrying with her a young spaniel which had been marys pet up at the hall and which had not ceased all night long to seek for its absent mistress and to whine and moan after her with tears madam told this story through the closed doortears excited by the terrible look of anguish so steady so immovableso the same today as it was yesterdayon her nurses face the little creature in her arms began to utter its piteous cry as it shivered with the cold bridget stirred she movedshe listened again that long whine she thought it was for her daughter and what she had denied to her nursling and mistress she granted to the dumb creature that mary had cherished she opened the door and took the dog from madams arms then madam came in and kissed and comforted the old woman who took but little notice of her or anything and sending up master patrick to the hall for fire and food the sweet young lady never left her nurse all that night next day the squire himself came down carrying a beautiful foreign picture our lady of the holy heart the papists call it it is a picture of the virgin her heart pierced with arrows each arrow representing one of her great woes that picture hung in bridgets cottage when i first saw her i have that picture now years went on mary was still abroad bridget was still and stern instead of active and passionate the little dog mignon was indeed her darling i have heard that she talked to it continually although to most people she was so silent the squire and madam treated her with the greatest consideration and well they might for to them she was as devoted and faithful as ever mary wrote pretty often and seemed satisfied with her life but at length the letters ceasedi hardly know whether before or after a great and terrible sorrow came upon the house of the starkeys the squire sickened of a putrid fever and madam caught it in nursing him and died you may be sure bridget let no other woman tend her but herself and in the very arms that had received her at her birth that sweet young woman laid her head down and gave up her breath the squire recovered in a fashion he was never stronghe had never the heart to smile again he fasted and prayed more than ever and people did say that he tried to cut off the entail and leave all the property away to found a monastery abroad of which he prayed that some day little squire patrick might be the reverend father but he could not do this for the strictness of the entail and the laws against the papists so he could only appoint gentlemen of his own faith as guardians to his son with many charges about the lads soul and a few about the land and the way it was to be held while he was a minor of course bridget was not forgotten he sent for her as he lay on his deathbed and asked her if she would rather have a sum down or have a small annuity settled upon her she said at once she would have a sum down for she thought of her daughter and how she could bequeath the money to her whereas an annuity would have died with her so the squire left her her cottage for life and a fair sum of money and then he died with as ready and willing a heart as i suppose ever any gentleman took out of this world with him the young squire was carried off by his guardians and bridget was left alone i have said that she had not heard from mary for some time in her last letter she had told of travelling about with her mistress who was the english wife of some great foreign officer and had spoken of her chances of making a good marriage without naming the gentlemans name keeping it rather back as a pleasant surprise to her mother his station and fortune being as i had afterwards reason to know far superior to anything she had a right to expect then came a long silence and madam was dead and the squire was dead and bridgets heart was gnawed by anxiety and she knew not whom to ask for news of her child she could not write and the squire had managed her communication with her daughter she walked off to hurst and got a good priest thereone whom she had known at antwerpto write for her but no answer came it was like crying into the awful stillness of night one day bridget was missed by those neighbours who had been accustomed to mark her goingsout and comingsin she had never been sociable with any of them but the sight of her had become a part of their daily lives and slow wonder arose in their minds as morning after morning came and her housedoor remained closed her window dead from any glitter or light of fire within at length some one tried the door it was locked two or three laid their heads together before daring to look in through the blank unshuttered window but at last they summoned up courage and then saw that bridgets absence from their little world was not the result of accident or death but of premeditation such small articles of furniture as could be secured from the effects of time and damp by being packed up were stowed away in boxes the picture of the madonna was taken down and gone in a word bridget had stolen away from her home and left no trace whither she was departed i knew afterwards that she and her little dog had wandered off on the long search for her lost daughter she was too illiterate to have faith in letters even had she had the means of writing and sending many but she had faith in her own strong love and believed that her passionate instinct would guide her to her child besides foreign travel was no new thing to her and she could speak enough of french to explain the object of her journey and had moreover the advantage of being from her faith a welcome object of charitable hospitality at many a distant convent but the country people round starkey manorhouse knew nothing of all this they wondered what had become of her in a torpid lazy fashion and then left off thinking of her altogether several years passed both manorhouse and cottage were deserted the young squire lived far away under the direction of his guardians there were inroads of wool and corn into the sittingrooms of the hall and there was some low talk from time to time among the hinds and country people whether it would not be as well to break into old bridgets cottage and save such of her goods as were left from the moth and rust which must be making sad havoc but this idea was always quenched by the recollection of her strong character and passionate anger and tales of her masterful spirit and vehement force of will were whispered about till the very thought of offending her by touching any article of hers became invested with a kind of horror it was believed that dead or alive she would not fail to avenge it suddenly she came home with as little noise or note of preparation as she had departed one day some one noticed a thin blue curl of smoke ascending from her chimney her door stood open to the noonday sun and ere many hours had elapsed some one had seen an old travelandsorrowstained woman dipping her pitcher in the well and said that the dark solemn eyes that looked up at him were more like bridget fitzgeralds than any one elses in this world and yet if it were she she looked as if she had been scorched in the flames of hell so brown and scared and fierce a creature did she seem byandby many saw her and those who met her eye once cared not to be caught looking at her again she had got into the habit of perpetually talking to herself nay more answering herself and varying her tones according to the side she took at the moment it was no wonder that those who dared to listen outside her door at night believed that she held converse with some spirit in short she was unconsciously earning for herself the dreadful reputation of a witch her little dog which had wandered half over the continent with her was her only companion a dumb remembrancer of happier days once he was ill and she carried him more than three miles to ask about his management from one who had been groom to the last squire and had then been noted for his skill in all diseases of animals whatever this man did the dog recovered and they who heard her thanks intermingled with blessings that were rather promises of good fortune than prayers looked grave at his good luck when next year his ewes twinned and his meadowgrass was heavy and thick now it so happened that about the year seventeen hundred and eleven one of the guardians of the young squire a certain sir philip tempest bethought him of the good shooting there must be on his wards property and in consequence he brought down four or five gentlemen of his friends to stay for a week or two at the hall from all accounts they roystered and spent pretty freely i never heard any of their names but one and that was squire gisbornes he was hardly a middleaged man then he had been much abroad and there i believe he had known sir philip tempest and done him some service he was a daring and dissolute fellow in those days careless and fearless and one who would rather be in a quarrel than out of it he had his fits of illtemper beside when he would spare neither man nor beast otherwise those who knew him well used to say he had a good heart when he was neither drunk nor angry nor in any way vexed he had altered much when i came to know him one day the gentlemen had all been out shooting and with but little success i believe anyhow mr gisborne had had none and was in a black humour accordingly he was coming home having his gun loaded sportsmanlike when little mignon crossed his path just as he turned out of the wood by bridgets cottage partly for wantonness partly to vent his spleen upon some living creature mr gisborne took his gun and firedhe had better have never fired gun again than aimed that unlucky shot he hit mignon and at the creatures sudden cry bridget came out and saw at a glance what had been done she took mignon up in her arms and looked hard at the wound the poor dog looked at her with his glazing eyes and tried to wag his tail and lick her hand all covered with blood mr gisborne spoke in a kind of sullen penitence you should have kept the dog out of my waya little poaching varmint at this very moment mignon stretched out his legs and stiffened in her armsher lost marys dog who had wandered and sorrowed with her for years she walked right into mr gisbornes path and fixed his unwilling sullen look with her dark and terrible eye those never throve that did me harm said she im alone in the world and helpless the more do the saints in heaven hear my prayers hear me ye blessed ones hear me while i ask for sorrow on this bad cruel man he has killed the only creature that loved methe dumb beast that i loved bring down heavy sorrow on his head for it o ye saints he thought that i was helpless because he saw me lonely and poor but are not the armies of heaven for the like of me come come said he halfremorseful but not one whit afraid heres a crown to buy thee another dog take it and leave off cursing i care none for thy threats dont you said she coming a step closer and changing her imprecatory cry for a whisper which made the gamekeepers lad following mr gisborne creep all over you shall live to see the creature you love best and who alone loves youay a human creature but as innocent and fond as my poor dead darlingyou shall see this creature for whom death would be too happy become a terror and a loathing to all for this bloods sake hear me o holy saints who never fail them that have no other help she threw up her right hand filled with poor mignons lifedrops they spirted one or two of them on his shootingdressan ominous sight to the follower but the master only laughed a little forced scornful laugh and went on to the hall before he got there however he took out a gold piece and bade the boy carry it to the old woman on his return to the village the lad was afeared as he told me in after years he came to the cottage and hovered about not daring to enter he peeped through the window at last and by the flickering woodflame he saw bridget kneeling before the picture of our lady of the holy heart with dead mignon lying between her and the madonna she was praying wildly as her outstretched arms betokened the lad shrank away in redoubled terror and contented himself with slipping the goldpiece under the illfitting door the next day it was thrown out upon the midden and there it lay no one daring to touch it meanwhile mr gisborne half curious half uneasy thought to lessen his uncomfortable feelings by asking sir philip who bridget was he could only describe herhe did not know her name sir philip was equally at a loss but an old servant of the starkeys who had resumed his livery at the hall on this occasiona scoundrel whom bridget had saved from dismissal more than once during her palmy dayssaid it will be the old witch that his worship means she needs a ducking if ever woman did does that bridget fitzgerald fitzgerald said both the gentlemen at once but sir philip was the first to continue i must have no talk of ducking her dickon why she must be the very woman poor starkey bade me have a care of but when i came here last she was gone no one knew where ill go and see her tomorrow but mind you sirrah if any harm comes to her or any more talk of her being a witchive a pack of hounds at home who can follow the scent of a lying knave as well as ever they followed a dogfox so take care how you talk about ducking a faithful old servant of your dead masters had she ever a daughter asked mr gisborne after a while i dont knowyes ive a notion she had a kind of waitingwoman to madam starkey please your worship said humbled dickon mistress bridget had a daughterone mistress marywho went abroad and has never been heard on since and folk do say that has crazed her mother mr gisborne shaded his eyes with his hand i could wish she had not cursed me he muttered she may have powerno one else could after a while he said aloud no one understanding rightly what he meant tush its impossibleand called for claret and he and the other gentlemen setto to a drinkingbout chapter ii i now come to the time in which i myself was mixed up with the people that i have been writing about and to make you understand how i became connected with them i must give you some little account of myself my father was the younger son of a devonshire gentleman of moderate property my eldest uncle succeeded to the estate of his forefathers my second became an eminent attorney in london and my father took orders like most poor clergymen he had a large family and i have no doubt was glad enough when my london uncle who was a bachelor offered to take charge of me and bring me up to be his successor in business in this way i came to live in london in my uncles house not far from grays inn and to be treated and esteemed as his son and to labour with him in his office i was very fond of the old gentleman he was the confidential agent of many country squires and had attained to his present position as much by knowledge of human nature as by knowledge of law though he was learned enough in the latter he used to say his business was law his pleasure heraldry from his intimate acquaintance with family history and all the tragic courses of life therein involved to hear him talk at leisure times about any coat of arms that came across his path was as good as a play or a romance many cases of disputed property dependent on a love of genealogy were brought to him as to a great authority on such points if the lawyer who came to consult him was young he would take no fee only give him a long lecture on the importance of attending to heraldry if the lawyer was of mature age and good standing he would mulct him pretty well and abuse him to me afterwards as negligent of one great branch of the profession his house was in a stately new street called ormond street and in it he had a handsome library but all the books treated of things that were past none of them planned or looked forward into the future i worked awaypartly for the sake of my family at home partly because my uncle had really taught me to enjoy the kind of practice in which he himself took such delight i suspect i worked too hard at any rate in seventeen hundred and eighteen i was far from well and my good uncle was disturbed by my ill looks one day he rang the bell twice into the clerks room at the dingy office in grays inn lane it was the summons for me and i went into his private room just as a gentlemanwhom i knew well enough by sight as an irish lawyer of more reputation than he deservedwas leaving my uncle was slowly rubbing his hands together and considering i was there two or three minutes before he spoke then he told me that i must pack up my portmanteau that very afternoon and start that night by posthorse for west chester i should get there if all went well at the end of five days time and must then wait for a packet to cross over to dublin from thence i must proceed to a certain town named kildoon and in that neighbourhood i was to remain making certain inquiries as to the existence of any descendants of the younger branch of a family to whom some valuable estates had descended in the female line the irish lawyer whom i had seen was weary of the case and would willingly have given up the property without further ado to a man who appeared to claim them but on laying his tables and trees before my uncle the latter had foreseen so many possible prior claimants that the lawyer had begged him to undertake the management of the whole business in his youth my uncle would have liked nothing better than going over to ireland himself and ferreting out every scrap of paper or parchment and every word of tradition respecting the family as it was old and gouty he deputed me accordingly i went to kildoon i suspect i had something of my uncles delight in following up a genealogical scent for i very soon found out when on the spot that mr rooney the irish lawyer would have got both himself and the first claimant into a terrible scrape if he had pronounced his opinion that the estates ought to be given up to him there were three poor irish fellows each nearer of kin to the last possessor but a generation before there was a still nearer relation who had never been accounted for nor his existence ever discovered by the lawyers i venture to think till i routed him out from the memory of some of the old dependants of the family what had become of him i travelled backwards and forwards i crossed over to france and came back again with a slight clue which ended in my discovering that wild and dissipated himself he had left one child a son of yet worse character than his father that this same hugh fitzgerald had married a very beautiful servingwoman of the byrnesa person below him in hereditary rank but above him in character that he had died soon after his marriage leaving one child whether a boy or a girl i could not learn and that the mother had returned to live in the family of the byrnes now the chief of this latter family was serving in the duke of berwicks regiment and it was long before i could hear from him it was more than a year before i got a short haughty letteri fancy he had a soldiers contempt for a civilian an irishmans hatred for an englishman an exiled jacobites jealousy of one who prospered and lived tranquilly under the government he looked upon as an usurpation bridget fitzgerald he said had been faithful to the fortunes of his sisterhad followed her abroad and to england when mrs starkey had thought fit to return both her sister and her husband were dead he knew nothing of bridget fitzgerald at the present time probably sir philip tempest his nephews guardian might be able to give me some information i have not given the little contemptuous terms the way in which faithful service was meant to imply more than it saidall that has nothing to do with my story sir philip when applied to told me that he paid an annuity regularly to an old woman named fitzgerald living at coldholme the village near starkey manorhouse whether she had any descendants he could not say one bleak march evening i came in sight of the places described at the beginning of my story i could hardly understand the rude dialect in which the direction to old bridgets house was given yo see yon furleets all run together gave me no idea that i was to guide myself by the distant lights that shone in the windows of the hall occupied for the time by a farmer who held the post of steward while the squire now four or five and twenty was making the grand tour however at last i reached bridgets cottagea low mossgrown place the palings that had once surrounded it were broken and gone and the underwood of the forest came up to the walls and must have darkened the windows it was about seven oclocknot late to my london notionsbut after knocking for some time at the door and receiving no reply i was driven to conjecture that the occupant of the house was gone to bed so i betook myself to the nearest church i had seen three miles back on the road i had come sure that close to that i should find an inn of some kind and early the next morning i set off back to coldholme by a fieldpath which my host assured me i should find a shorter cut than the road i had taken the night before it was a cold sharp morning my feet left prints in the sprinkling of hoarfrost that covered the ground nevertheless i saw an old woman whom i instinctively suspected to be the object of my search in a sheltered covert on one side of my path i lingered and watched her she must have been considerably above the middle size in her prime for when she raised herself from the stooping position in which i first saw her there was something fine and commanding in the erectness of her figure she drooped again in a minute or two and seemed looking for something on the ground as with bent head she turned off from the spot where i gazed upon her and was lost to my sight i fancy i missed my way and made a round in spite of the landlords directions for by the time i had reached bridgets cottage she was there with no semblance of hurried walk or discomposure of any kind the door was slightly ajar i knocked and the majestic figure stood before me silently awaiting the explanation of my errand her teeth were all gone so the nose and chin were brought near together the gray eyebrows were straight and almost hung over her deep cavernous eyes and the thick white hair lay in silvery masses over the low wide wrinkled forehead for a moment i stood uncertain how to shape my answer to the solemn questioning of her silence your name is bridget fitzgerald i believe she bowed her head in assent i have something to say to you may i come in i am unwilling to keep you standing you cannot tire me she said and at first she seemed inclined to deny me the shelter of her roof but the next momentshe had searched the very soul in me with her eyes during that instantshe led me in and dropped the shadowing hood of her gray draping cloak which had previously hid part of the character of her countenance the cottage was rude and bare enough but before that picture of the virgin of which i have made mention there stood a little cup filled with fresh primroses while she paid her reverence to the madonna i understood why she had been out seeking through the clumps of green in the sheltered copse then she turned round and bade me be seated the expression of her face which all this time i was studying was not bad as the stories of my last nights landlord had led me to expect it was a wild stern fierce indomitable countenance seamed and scarred by agonies of solitary weeping but it was neither cunning nor malignant my name is bridget fitzgerald said she by way of opening our conversation and your husband was hugh fitzgerald of knockmahon near kildoon in ireland a faint light came into the dark gloom of her eyes he was may i ask if you had any children by him the light in her eyes grew quick and red she tried to speak i could see but something rose in her throat and choked her and until she could speak calmly she would fain not speak at all before a stranger in a minute or so she said i had a daughterone mary fitzgeraldthen her strong nature mastered her strong will and she cried out with a trembling wailing cry oh man what of herwhat of her she rose from her seat and came and clutched at my arm and looked in my eyes there she read as i suppose my utter ignorance of what had become of her child for she went blindly back to her chair and sat rocking herself and softly moaning as if i were not there i not daring to speak to the lone and awful woman after a little pause she knelt down before the picture of our lady of the holy heart and spoke to her by all the fanciful and poetic names of the litany o rose of sharon o tower of david o star of the sea have you no comfort for my sore heart am i for ever to hope grant me at least despairand so on she went heedless of my presence her prayers grew wilder and wilder till they seemed to me to touch on the borders of madness and blasphemy almost involuntarily i spoke as if to stop her have you any reason to think that your daughter is dead she rose from her knees and came and stood before me mary fitzgerald is dead said she i shall never see her again in the flesh no tongue ever told me but i know she is dead i have yearned so to see her and my hearts will is fearful and strong it would have drawn her to me before now if she had been a wanderer on the other side of the world i wonder often it has not drawn her out of the grave to come and stand before me and hear me tell her how i loved her for sir we parted unfriends i knew nothing but the dry particulars needed for my lawyers quest but i could not help feeling for the desolate woman and she must have read the unusual sympathy with her wistful eyes yes sir we did she never knew how i loved her and we parted unfriends and i fear me that i wished her voyage might not turn out well only meaningo blessed virgin you know i only meant that she should come home to her mothers arms as to the happiest place on earth but my wishes are terribletheir power goes beyond my thoughtand there is no hope for me if my words brought mary harm but i said you do not know that she is dead even now you hoped she might be alive listen to me and i told her the tale i have already told you giving it all in the driest manner for i wanted to recall the clear sense that i felt almost sure she had possessed in her younger days and by keeping up her attention to details restrain the vague wildness of her grief she listened with deep attention putting from time to time such questions as convinced me i had to do with no common intelligence however dimmed and shorn by solitude and mysterious sorrow then she took up her tale and in few brief words told me of her wanderings abroad in vain search after her daughter sometimes in the wake of armies sometimes in camp sometimes in city the lady whose waitingwoman mary had gone to be had died soon after the date of her last letter home her husband the foreign officer had been serving in hungary whither bridget had followed him but too late to find him vague rumours reached her that mary had made a great marriage and this sting of doubt was addedwhether the mother might not be close to her child under her new name and even hearing of her every day and yet never recognising the lost one under the appellation she then bore at length the thought took possession of her that it was possible that all this time mary might be at home at coldholme in the trough of bolland in lancashire in england and home came bridget in that vain hope to her desolate hearth and empty cottage here she had thought it safest to remain if mary was in life it was here she would seek for her mother i noted down one or two particulars out of bridgets narrative that i thought might be of use to me for i was stimulated to further search in a strange and extraordinary manner it seemed as if it were impressed upon me that i must take up the quest where bridget had laid it down and this for no reason that had previously influenced me such as my uncles anxiety on the subject my own reputation as a lawyer and so on but from some strange power which had taken possession of my will only that very morning and which forced it in the direction it chose i will go said i i will spare nothing in the search trust to me i will learn all that can be learnt you shall know all that money or pains or wit can discover it is true she may be long dead but she may have left a child a child she cried as if for the first time this idea had struck her mind hear him blessed virgin he says she may have left a child and you have never told me though i have prayed so for a sign waking or sleeping nay said i i know nothing but what you tell me you say you heard of her marriage but she caught nothing of what i said she was praying to the virgin in a kind of ecstacy which seemed to render her unconscious of my very presence from coldholme i went to sir philip tempests the wife of the foreign officer had been a cousin of his fathers and from him i thought i might gain some particulars as to the existence of the count de la tour dauvergne and where i could find him for i knew questions de vive voix aid the flagging recollection and i was determined to lose no chance for want of trouble but sir philip had gone abroad and it would be some time before i could receive an answer so i followed my uncles advice to whom i had mentioned how wearied i felt both in body and mind by my willothewisp search he immediately told me to go to harrogate there to await sir philips reply i should be near to one of the places connected with my search coldholme not far from sir philip tempest in case he returned and i wished to ask him any further questions and in conclusion my uncle bade me try to forget all about my business for a time this was far easier said than done i have seen a child on a common blown along by a high wind without power of standing still and resisting the tempestuous force i was somewhat in the same predicament as regarded my mental state something resistless seemed to urge my thoughts on through every possible course by which there was a chance of attaining to my object i did not see the sweeping moors when i walked out when i held a book in my hand and read the words their sense did not penetrate to my brain if i slept i went on with the same ideas always flowing in the same direction this could not last long without having a bad effect on the body i had an illness which although i was racked with pain was a positive relief to me as it compelled me to live in the present suffering and not in the visionary researches i had been continually making before my kind uncle came to nurse me and after the immediate danger was over my life seemed to slip away in delicious languor for two or three months i did not askso much did i dread falling into the old channel of thoughtwhether any reply had been received to my letter to sir philip i turned my whole imagination right away from all that subject my uncle remained with me until nigh summer and then returned to his business in london leaving me perfectly well although not completely strong i was to follow him in a fortnight when as he said we would look over letters and talk about several things i knew what this little speech alluded to and shrank from the train of thought it suggested which was so intimately connected with my first feelings of illness however i had a fortnight more to roam on those invigorating yorkshire moors in those days there was one large rambling inn at harrogate close to the medicinal spring but it was already becoming too small for the accommodation of the influx of visitors and many lodged round about in the farmhouses of the district it was so early in the season that i had the inn pretty much to myself and indeed felt rather like a visitor in a private house so intimate had the landlord and landlady become with me during my long illness she would chide me for being out so late on the moors or for having been too long without food quite in a motherly way while he consulted me about vintages and wines and taught me many a yorkshire wrinkle about horses in my walks i met other strangers from time to time even before my uncle had left me i had noticed with halftorpid curiosity a young lady of very striking appearance who went about always accompanied by an elderly companionhardly a gentlewoman but with something in her look that prepossessed me in her favour the younger lady always put her veil down when any one approached so it had been only once or twice when i had come upon her at a sudden turn in the path that i had even had a glimpse of her face i am not sure if it was beautiful though in afterlife i grew to think it so but it was at this time overshadowed by a sadness that never varied a pale quiet resigned look of intense suffering that irresistibly attracted menot with love but with a sense of infinite compassion for one so young yet so hopelessly unhappy the companion wore something of the same look quiet melancholy hopeless yet resigned i asked my landlord who they were he said they were called clarke and wished to be considered as mother and daughter but that for his part he did not believe that to be their right name or that there was any such relationship between them they had been in the neighbourhood of harrogate for some time lodging in a remote farmhouse the people there would tell nothing about them saying that they paid handsomely and never did any harm so why should they be speaking of any strange things that might happen that as the landlord shrewdly observed showed there was something out of the common way he had heard that the elderly woman was a cousin of the farmers where they lodged and so the regard existing between relations might help to keep them quiet what did he think then was the reason for their extreme seclusion asked i nay he could not tell not he he had heard that the young lady for all as quiet as she seemed played strange pranks at times he shook his head when i asked him for more particulars and refused to give them which made me doubt if he knew any for he was in general a talkative and communicative man in default of other interests after my uncle left i set myself to watch these two people i hovered about their walks drawn towards them with a strange fascination which was not diminished by their evident annoyance at so frequently meeting me one day i had the sudden good fortune to be at hand when they were alarmed by the attack of a bull which in those unenclosed grazing districts was a particularly dangerous occurrence i have other and more important things to relate than to tell of the accident which gave me an opportunity of rescuing them it is enough to say that this event was the beginning of an acquaintance reluctantly acquiesced in by them but eagerly prosecuted by me i can hardly tell when intense curiosity became merged in love but in less than ten days after my uncles departure i was passionately enamoured of mrs lucy as her attendant called her carefullyfor this i noted wellavoiding any address which appeared as if there was an equality of station between them i noticed also that mrs clarke the elderly woman after her first reluctance to allow me to pay them any attentions had been overcome was cheered by my evident attachment to the young girl it seemed to lighten her heavy burden of care and she evidently favoured my visits to the farmhouse where they lodged it was not so with lucy a more attractive person i never saw in spite of her depression of manner and shrinking avoidance of me i felt sure at once that whatever was the source of her grief it rose from no fault of her own it was difficult to draw her into conversation but when at times for a moment or two i beguiled her into talk i could see a rare intelligence in her face and a grave trusting look in the soft gray eyes that were raised for a minute to mine i made every excuse i possibly could for going there i sought wild flowers for lucys sake i planned walks for lucys sake i watched the heavens by night in hopes that some unusual beauty of sky would justify me in tempting mrs clarke and lucy forth upon the moors to gaze at the great purple dome above it seemed to me that lucy was aware of my love but that for some motive which i could not guess she would fain have repelled me but then again i saw or fancied i saw that her heart spoke in my favour and that there was a struggle going on in her mind which at times i loved so dearly i could have begged her to spare herself even though the happiness of my whole life should have been the sacrifice for her complexion grew paler her aspect of sorrow more hopeless her delicate frame yet slighter during this period i had written i should say to my uncle to beg to be allowed to prolong my stay at harrogate not giving any reason but such was his tenderness towards me that in a few days i heard from him giving me a willing permission and only charging me to take care of myself and not use too much exertion during the hot weather one sultry evening i drew near the farm the windows of their parlour were open and i heard voices when i turned the corner of the house as i passed the first window there were two windows in their little groundfloor room i saw lucy distinctly but when i had knocked at their doorthe housedoor stood always ajarshe was gone and i saw only mrs clarke turning over the workthings lying on the table in a nervous and purposeless manner i felt by instinct that a conversation of some importance was coming on in which i should be expected to say what was my object in paying these frequent visits i was glad of the opportunity my uncle had several times alluded to the pleasant possibility of my bringing home a young wife to cheer and adorn the old house in ormond street he was rich and i was to succeed him and had as i knew a fair reputation for so young a lawyer so on my side i saw no obstacle it was true that lucy was shrouded in mystery her name i was convinced it was not clarke birth parentage and previous life were unknown to me but i was sure of her goodness and sweet innocence and although i knew that there must be something painful to be told to account for her mournful sadness yet i was willing to bear my share in her grief whatever it might be mrs clarke began as if it was a relief to her to plunge into the subject we have thought sirat least i have thoughtthat you know very little of us nor we of you indeed not enough to warrant the intimate acquaintance we have fallen into i beg your pardon sir she went on nervously i am but a plain kind of woman and i mean to use no rudeness but i must say straight out that iwethink it would be better for you not to come so often to see us she is very unprotected and why should i not come to see you dear madam asked i eagerly glad of the opportunity of explaining myself i come i own because i have learnt to love mistress lucy and wish to teach her to love me mistress clarke shook her head and sighed dont sirneither love her nor for the sake of all you hold sacred teach her to love you if i am too late and you love her already forget herforget these last few weeks o i should never have allowed you to come she went on passionately but what am i to do we are forsaken by all except the great god and even he permits a strange and evil power to afflict uswhat am i to do where is it to end she wrung her hands in her distress then she turned to me go away sir go away before you learn to care any more for her i ask it for your own sakei implore you have been good and kind to us and we shall always recollect you with gratitude but go away now and never come back to cross our fatal path indeed madam said i i shall do no such thing you urge it for my own sake i have no fear so urgednor wish except to hear moreall i cannot have seen mistress lucy in all the intimacy of this last fortnight without acknowledging her goodness and innocence and without seeingpardon me madamthat for some reason you are two very lonely women in some mysterious sorrow and distress now though i am not powerful myself yet i have friends who are so wise and kind that they may be said to possess power tell me some particulars why are you in griefwhat is your secretwhy are you here i declare solemnly that nothing you have said has daunted me in my wish to become lucys husband nor will i shrink from any difficulty that as such an aspirant i may have to encounter you say you are friendlesswhy cast away an honest friend i will tell you of people to whom you may write and who will answer any questions as to my character and prospects i do not shun inquiry she shook her head again you had better go away sir you know nothing about us i know your names said i and i have heard you allude to the part of the country from which you came which i happen to know as a wild and lonely place there are so few people living in it that if i chose to go there i could easily ascertain all about you but i would rather hear it from yourself you see i wanted to pique her into telling me something definite you do not know our true names sir said she hastily well i may have conjectured as much but tell me then i conjure you give me your reasons for distrusting my willingness to stand by what i have said with regard to mistress lucy oh what can i do exclaimed she if i am turning away a true friend as he saysstay coming to a sudden decisioni will tell you somethingi cannot tell you allyou would not believe it but perhaps i can tell you enough to prevent your going on in your hopeless attachment i am not lucys mother so i conjectured i said go on i do not even know whether she is the legitimate or illegitimate child of her father but he is cruelly turned against her and her mother is long dead and for a terrible reason she has no other creature to keep constant to her but me sheonly two years agosuch a darling and such a pride in her fathers house why sir there is a mystery that might happen in connection with her any moment and then you would go away like all the rest and when you next heard her name you would loathe her others who have loved her longer have done so before now my poor child whom neither god nor man has mercy uponor surely she would die the good woman was stopped by her crying i confess i was a little stunned by her last words but only for a moment at any rate till i knew definitely what was this mysterious stain upon one so simple and pure as lucy seemed i would not desert her and so i said and she made answer if you are daring in your heart to think harm of my child sir after knowing her as you have done you are no good man yourself but i am so foolish and helpless in my great sorrow that i would fain hope to find a friend in you i cannot help trusting that although you may no longer feel towards her as a lover you will have pity upon us and perhaps by your learning you can tell us where to go for aid i implore you to tell me what this mystery is i cried almost maddened by this suspense i cannot said she solemnly i am under a deep vow of secrecy if you are to be told it must be by her she left the room and i remained to ponder over this strange interview i mechanically turned over the few books and with eyes that saw nothing at the time examined the tokens of lucys frequent presence in that room when i got home at night i remembered how all these trifles spoke of a pure and tender heart and innocent life mistress clarke returned she had been crying sadly yes said she it is as i feared she loves you so much that she is willing to run the fearful risk of telling you all herselfshe acknowledges it is but a poor chance but your sympathy will be a balm if you give it tomorrow come here at ten in the morning and as you hope for pity in your hour of agony repress all show of fear or repugnance you may feel towards one so grievously afflicted i half smiled have no fear i said it seemed too absurd to imagine my feeling dislike to lucy her father loved her well said she gravely yet he drove her out like some monstrous thing just at this moment came a peal of ringing laughter from the garden it was lucys voice it sounded as if she were standing just on one side of the open casementand as though she were suddenly stirred to merrimentmerriment verging on boisterousness by the doings or sayings of some other person i can scarcely say why but the sound jarred on me inexpressibly she knew the subject of our conversation and must have been at least aware of the state of agitation her friend was in she herself usually so gentle and quiet i half rose to go to the window and satisfy my instinctive curiosity as to what had provoked this burst of illtimed laughter but mrs clarke threw her whole weight and power upon the hand with which she pressed and kept me down for gods sake she said white and trembling all over sit still be quiet oh be patient tomorrow you will know all leave us for we are all sorely afflicted do not seek to know more about us again that laughso musical in sound yet so discordant to my heart she held me tighttighter without positive violence i could not have risen i was sitting with my back to the window but i felt a shadow pass between the suns warmth and me and a strange shudder ran through my frame in a minute or two she released me go repeated she be warned i ask you once more i do not think you can stand this knowledge that you seek if i had had my own way lucy should never have yielded and promised to tell you all who knows what may come of it i am firm in my wish to know all i return at ten tomorrow morning and then expect to see mistress lucy herself i turned away having my own suspicions i confess as to mistress clarkes sanity conjectures as to the meaning of her hints and uncomfortable thoughts connected with that strange laughter filled my mind i could hardly sleep i rose early and long before the hour i had appointed i was on the path over the common that led to the old farmhouse where they lodged i suppose that lucy had passed no better a night than i for there she was also slowly pacing with her even step her eyes bent down her whole look most saintly and pure she started when i came close to her and grew paler as i reminded her of my appointment and spoke with something of the impatience of obstacles that seeing her once more had called up afresh in my mind all strange and terrible hints and giddy merriment were forgotten my heart gave forth words of fire and my tongue uttered them her colour went and came as she listened but when i had ended my passionate speeches she lifted her soft eyes to me and said but you know that you have something to learn about me yet i only want to say this i shall not think less of youless well of you i meanif you too fall away from me when you know all stop said she as if fearing another burst of mad words listen to me my father is a man of great wealth i never knew my mother she must have died when i was very young when first i remember anything i was living in a great lonely house with my dear and faithful mistress clarke my father even was not there he washe isa soldier and his duties lie abroad but he came from time to time and every time i think he loved me more and more he brought me rarities from foreign lands which prove to me now how much he must have thought of me during his absences i can sit down and measure the depth of his lost love now by such standards as these i never thought whether he loved me or not then it was so natural that it was like the air i breathed yet he was an angry man at times even then but never with me he was very reckless too and once or twice i heard a whisper among the servants that a doom was over him and that he knew it and tried to drown his knowledge in wild activity and even sometimes sir in wine so i grew up in this grand mansion in that lonely place everything around me seemed at my disposal and i think every one loved me i am sure i loved them till about two years agoi remember it wellmy father had come to england to us and he seemed so proud and so pleased with me and all i had done and one day his tongue seemed loosened with wine and he told me much that i had not known till thenhow dearly he had loved my mother yet how his wilful usage had caused her death and then he went on to say how he loved me better than any creature on earth and how some day he hoped to take me to foreign places for that he could hardly bear these long abscences from his only child then he seemed to change suddenly and said in a strange wild way that i was not to believe what he said that there was many a thing he loved betterhis horsehis dogi know not what and twas only the next morning that when i came into his room to ask his blessing as was my wont he received me with fierce and angry words why had i so he asked been delighting myself in such wanton mischiefdancing over the tender plants in the flowerbeds all set with the famous dutch bulbs he had brought from holland i had never been out of doors that morning sir and i could not conceive what he meant and so i said and then he swore at me for a liar and said i was of no true blood for he had seen me doing all that mischief himselfwith his own eyes what could i say he would not listen to me and even my tears seemed only to irritate him that day was the beginning of my great sorrows not long after he reproached me for my undue familiarityall unbecoming a gentlewomanwith his grooms i had been in the stableyard laughing and talking he said now sir i am something of a coward by nature and i had always dreaded horses besides that my fathers servantsthose whom he brought with him from foreign partswere wild fellows whom i had always avoided and to whom i had never spoken except as a lady must needs from time to time speak to her fathers people yet my father called me by names of which i hardly know the meaning but my heart told me they were such as shame any modest woman and from that day he turned quite against menay sir not many weeks after that he came in with a ridingwhip in his hand and accusing me harshly of evil doings of which i knew no more than you sir he was about to strike me and i all in bewildering tears was ready to take his stripes as great kindness compared to his harder words when suddenly he stopped his arm midway gasped and staggered crying out the cursethe curse i looked up in terror in the great mirror opposite i saw myself and right behind another wicked fearful self so like me that my soul seemed to quiver within me as though not knowing to which similitude of body it belonged my father saw my double at the same moment either in its dreadful reality whatever that might be or in the scarcely less terrible reflection in the mirror but what came of it at that moment i cannot say for i suddenly swooned away and when i came to myself i was lying in my bed and my faithful clarke sitting by me i was in my bed for days and even while i lay there my double was seen by all flitting about the house and gardens always about some mischievous or detestable work what wonder that every one shrank from me in dreadthat my father drove me forth at length when the disgrace of which i was the cause was past his patience to bear mistress clarke came with me and here we try to live such a life of piety and prayer as may in time set me free from the curse all the time she had been speaking i had been weighing her story in my mind i had hitherto put cases of witchcraft on one side as mere superstitions and my uncle and i had had many an argument he supporting himself by the opinion of his good friend sir matthew hale yet this sounded like the tale of one bewitched or was it merely the effect of a life of extreme seclusion telling on the nerves of a sensitive girl my scepticism inclined me to the latter belief and when she paused i said i fancy that some physician could have disabused your father of his belief in visions just at that instant standing as i was opposite to her in the full and perfect morning light i saw behind her another figurea ghastly resemblance complete in likeness so far as form and feature and minutest touch of dress could go but with a loathsome demon soul looking out of the gray eyes that were in turns mocking and voluptuous my heart stood still within me every hair rose up erect my flesh crept with horror i could not see the grave and tender lucymy eyes were fascinated by the creature beyond i know not why but i put out my hand to clutch it i grasped nothing but empty air and my whole blood curdled to ice for a moment i could not see then my sight came back and i saw lucy standing before me alone deathly pale and i could have fancied almost shrunk in size it has been near me she said as if asking a question the sound seemed taken out of her voice it was husky as the notes on an old harpsichord when the strings have ceased to vibrate she read her answer in my face i suppose for i could not speak her look was one of intense fear but that died away into an aspect of most humble patience at length she seemed to force herself to face behind and around her she saw the purple moors the blue distant hills quivering in the sunlight but nothing else will you take me home she said meekly i took her by the hand and led her silently through the budding heatherwe dared not speak for we could not tell but that the dread creature was listening although unseenbut that it might appear and push us asunder i never loved her more fondly than now whenand that was the unspeakable miserythe idea of her was becoming so inextricably blended with the shuddering thought of it she seemed to understand what i must be feeling she let go my hand which she had kept clasped until then when we reached the garden gate and went forwards to meet her anxious friend who was standing by the window looking for her i could not enter the house i needed silence society leisure changei knew not whatto shake off the sensation of that creatures presence yet i lingered about the gardeni hardly know why i partly suppose because i feared to encounter the resemblance again on the solitary common where it had vanished and partly from a feeling of inexpressible compassion for lucy in a few minutes mistress clarke came forth and joined me we walked some paces in silence you know all now said she solemnly i saw it said i below my breath and you shrink from us now she said with a hopelessness which stirred up all that was brave or good in me not a whit said i human flesh shrinks from encounter with the powers of darkness and for some reason unknown to me the pure and holy lucy is their victim the sins of the fathers shall be visited upon the children she said who is her father asked i knowing as much as i do i may surely know moreknow all tell me i entreat you madam all that you can conjecture respecting this demoniac persecution of one so good i will but not now i must go to lucy now come this afternoon i will see you alone and oh sir i will trust that you may yet find some way to help us in our sore trouble i was miserably exhausted by the swooning affright which had taken possession of me when i reached the inn i staggered in like one overcome by wine i went to my own private room it was some time before i saw that the weekly post had come in and brought me my letters there was one from my uncle one from my home in devonshire and one redirected over the first address sealed with a great coat of arms it was from sir philip tempest my letter of inquiry respecting mary fitzgerald had reached him at lige where it so happened that the count de la tour dauvergne was quartered at the very time he remembered his wifes beautiful attendant she had had high words with the deceased countess respecting her intercourse with an english gentleman of good standing who was also in the foreign service the countess augured evil of his intentions while mary proud and vehement asserted that he would soon marry her and resented her mistresss warnings as an insult the consequence was that she had left madame de la tour dauvergnes service and as the count believed had gone to live with the englishman whether he had married her or not he could not say but added sir philip tempest you may easily hear what particulars you wish to know respecting mary fitzgerald from the englishman himself if as i suspect he is no other than my neighbour and former acquaintance mr gisborne of skipford hall in the west riding i am led to the belief that he is no other by several small particulars none of which are in themselves conclusive but which taken together make a mass of presumptive evidence as far as i could make out from the counts foreign pronunciation gisborne was the name of the englishman i know that gisborne of skipford was abroad and in the foreign service at that timehe was a likely fellow enough for such an exploit and above all certain expressions recur to my mind which he used in reference to old bridget fitzgerald of coldholme whom he once encountered while staying with me at starkey manorhouse i remember that the meeting seemed to have produced some extraordinary effect upon his mind as though he had suddenly discovered some connection which she might have had with his previous life i beg you to let me know if i can be of any further service to you your uncle once rendered me a good turn and i will gladly repay it so far as in me lies to his nephew i was now apparently close on the discovery which i had striven so many months to attain but success had lost its zest i put my letters down and seemed to forget them all in thinking of the morning i had passed that very day nothing was real but the unreal presence which had come like an evil blast across my bodily eyes and burnt itself down upon my brain dinner came and went away untouched early in the afternoon i walked to the farmhouse i found mistress clarke alone and i was glad and relieved she was evidently prepared to tell me all i might wish to hear you asked me for mistress lucys true name it is gisborne she began not gisborne of skipford i exclaimed breathless with anticipation the same said she quietly not regarding my manner her father is a man of note although being a roman catholic he cannot take that rank in this country to which his station entitles him the consequence is that he lives much abroadhas been a soldier i am told and lucys mother i asked she shook her head i never knew her said she lucy was about three years old when i was engaged to take charge of her her mother was dead but you know her nameyou can tell if it was mary fitzgerald she looked astonished that was her name but sir how came you to be so well acquainted with it it was a mystery to the whole household at skipford court she was some beautiful young woman whom he lured away from her protectors while he was abroad i have heard said he practised some terrible deceit upon her and when she came to know it she was neither to have nor to hold but rushed off from his very arms and threw herself into a rapid stream and was drowned it stung him deep with remorse but i used to think the remembrance of the mothers cruel death made him love the child yet dearer i told her as briefly as might be of my researches after the descendant and heir of the fitzgeralds of kildoon and addedsomething of my old lawyer spirit returning into me for the momentthat i had no doubt but that we should prove lucy to be by right possessed of large estates in ireland no flush came over her gray face no light into her eyes and what is all the wealth in the whole world to that poor girl she said it will not free her from the ghastly bewitchment which persecutes her as for money what a pitiful thing it is it cannot touch her no more can the evil creature harm her i said her holy nature dwells apart and cannot be defiled or stained by all the devilish arts in the whole world true but it is a cruel fate to know that all shrink from her sooner or later as from one possessedaccursed how came it to pass i asked nay i know not old rumours there are that were bruited through the household at skipford tell me i demanded they came from servants who would fain account for everything they say that many years ago mr gisborne killed a dog belonging to an old witch at coldholme that she cursed with a dreadful and mysterious curse the creature whatever it might be that he should love best and that it struck so deeply into his heart that for years he kept himself aloof from any temptation to love aught but who could help loving lucy you never heard the witchs name i gasped yesthey called her bridget they said he would never go near the spot again for terror of her yet he was a brave man listen said i taking hold of her arm the better to arrest her full attention if what i suspect holds true that man stole bridgets only childthe very mary fitzgerald who was lucys mother if so bridget cursed him in ignorance of the deeper wrong he had done her to this hour she yearns after her lost child and questions the saints whether she be living or not the roots of that curse lie deeper than she knows she unwittingly banned him for a deeper guilt than that of killing a dumb beast the sins of the fathers are indeed visited upon the children but said mistress clarke eagerly she would never let evil rest on her own grandchild surely sir if what you say be true there are hopes for lucy let us gogo at once and tell this fearful woman all that you suspect and beseech her to take off the spell she has put upon her innocent grandchild it seemed to me indeed that something like this was the best course we could pursue but first it was necessary to ascertain more than what mere rumour or careless hearsay could tell my thoughts turned to my unclehe could advise me wiselyhe ought to know all i resolved to go to him without delay but i did not choose to tell mistress clarke of all the visionary plans that flitted through my mind i simply declared my intention of proceeding straight to london on lucys affairs i bade her believe that my interest on the young ladys behalf was greater than ever and that my whole time should be given up to her cause i saw that mistress clarke distrusted me because my mind was too full of thoughts for my words to flow freely she sighed and shook her head and said well it is all right in such a tone that it was an implied reproach but i was firm and constant in my heart and i took confidence from that i rode to london i rode long days drawn out into the lovely summer nights i could not rest i reached london i told my uncle all though in the stir of the great city the horror had faded away and i could hardly imagine that he would believe the account i gave him of the fearful double of lucy which i had seen on the lonely moorside but my uncle had lived many years and learnt many things and in the deep secrets of family history that had been confided to him he had heard of cases of innocent people bewitched and taken possession of by evil spirits yet more fearful than lucys for as he said to judge from all i told him that resemblance had no power over hershe was too pure and good to be tainted by its evil haunting presence it had in all probability so my uncle conceived tried to suggest wicked thoughts and to tempt to wicked actions but she in her saintly maidenhood had passed on undefiled by evil thought or deed it could not touch her soul but true it set her apart from all sweet love or common human intercourse my uncle threw himself with an energy more like sixandtwenty than sixty into the consideration of the whole case he undertook the proving lucys descent and volunteered to go and find out mr gisborne and obtain firstly the legal proofs of her descent from the fitzgeralds of kildoon and secondly to try and hear all that he could respecting the working of the curse and whether any and what means had been taken to exorcise that terrible appearance for he told me of instances where by prayers and long fasting the evil possessor had been driven forth with howling and many cries from the body which it had come to inhabit he spoke of those strange new england cases which had happened not so long before of mr defoe who had written a book wherein he had named many modes of subduing apparitions and sending them back whence they came and lastly he spoke low of dreadful ways of compelling witches to undo their witchcraft but i could not endure to hear of those tortures and burnings i said that bridget was rather a wild and savage woman than a malignant witch and above all that lucy was of her kith and kin and that in putting her to the trial by water or by fire we should be torturingit might be to the deaththe ancestress of her we sought to redeem my uncle thought awhile and then said that in this last matter i was rightat any rate it should not be tried with his consent till all other modes of remedy had failed and he assented to my proposal that i should go myself and see bridget and tell her all in accordance with this i went down once more to the wayside inn near coldholme it was late at night when i arrived there and while i supped i inquired of the landlord more particulars as to bridgets ways solitary and savage had been her life for many years wild and despotic were her words and manner to those few people who came across her path the countryfolk did her imperious bidding because they feared to disobey if they pleased her they prospered if on the contrary they neglected or traversed her behests misfortune small or great fell on them and theirs it was not detestation so much as an indefinable terror that she excited in the morning i went to see her she was standing on the green outside her cottage and received me with the sullen grandeur of a throneless queen i read in her face that she recognised me and that i was not unwelcome but she stood silent till i had opened my errand i have news of your daughter said i resolved to speak straight to all that i knew she felt of love and not to spare her she is dead the stern figure scarcely trembled but her hand sought the support of the doorpost i knew that she was dead said she deep and low and then was silent for an instant my tears that should have flowed for her were burnt up long years ago young man tell me about her not yet said i having a strange power given me of confronting one whom nevertheless in my secret soul i dreaded you had once a little dog i continued the words called out in her more show of emotion than the intelligence of her daughters death she broke in upon my speech i had it was hersthe last thing i had of hersand it was shot for wantonness it died in my arms the man who killed that dog rues it to this day for that dumb beasts blood his bestbeloved stands accursed her eyes distended as if she were in a trance and saw the working of her curse again i spoke o woman i said that bestbeloved standing accursed before men is your dead daughters child the life the energy the passion came back to the eyes with which she pierced through me to see if i spoke truth then without another question or word she threw herself on the ground with fearful vehemence and clutched at the innocent daisies with convulsed hands bone of my bone flesh of my flesh have i cursed theeand art thou accursed so she moaned as she lay prostrate in her great agony i stood aghast at my own work she did not hear my broken sentences she asked no more but the dumb confirmation which my sad looks had given that one fact that her curse rested on her own daughters child the fear grew on me lest she should die in her strife of body and soul and then might not lucy remain under the spell as long as she lived even at this moment i saw lucy coming through the woodland path that led to bridgets cottage mistress clarke was with her i felt at my heart that it was she by the balmy peace which the look of her sent over me as she slowly advanced a glad surprise shining out of her soft quiet eyes that was as her gaze met mine as her looks fell on the woman lying stiff convulsed on the earth they became full of tender pity and she came forward to try and lift her up seating herself on the turf she took bridgets head into her lap and with gentle touches she arranged the dishevelled gray hair streaming thick and wild from beneath her mutch god help her murmured lucy how she suffers at her desire we sought for water but when we returned bridget had recovered her wandering senses and was kneeling with clasped hands before lucy gazing at that sweet sad face as though her troubled nature drank in health and peace from every moments contemplation a faint tinge on lucys pale cheeks showed me that she was aware of our return otherwise it appeared as if she was conscious of her influence for good over the passionate and troubled woman kneeling before her and would not willingly avert her grave and loving eyes from that wrinkled and careworn countenance suddenlyin the twinkling of an eyethe creature appeared there behind lucy fearfully the same as to outward semblance but kneeling exactly as bridget knelt and clasping her hands in jesting mimicry as bridget clasped hers in her ecstasy that was deepening into a prayer mistress clarke cried outbridget arose slowly her gaze fixed on the creature beyond drawing her breath with a hissing sound never moving her terrible eyes that were steady as stone she made a dart at the phantom and caught as i had done a mere handful of empty air we saw no more of the creatureit vanished as suddenly as it came but bridget looked slowly on as if watching some receding form lucy sat still white trembling droopingi think she would have swooned if i had not been there to uphold her while i was attending to her bridget passed us without a word to any one and entering her cottage she barred herself in and left us without all our endeavours were now directed to get lucy back to the house where she had tarried the night before mistress clarke told me that not hearing from me some letter must have miscarried she had grown impatient and despairing and had urged lucy to the enterprise of coming to seek her grandmother not telling her indeed of the dread reputation she possessed or how we suspected her of having so fearfully blighted that innocent girl but at the same time hoping much from the mysterious stirring of blood which mistress clarke trusted in for the removal of the curse they had come by a different route from that which i had taken to a village inn not far from coldholme only the night before this was the first interview between ancestress and descendant all through the sultry noon i wandered along the tangled woodpaths of the old neglected forest thinking where to turn for remedy in a matter so complicated and mysterious meeting a countryman i asked my way to the nearest clergyman and went hoping to obtain some counsel from him but he proved to be a coarse and commonminded man giving no time or attention to the intricacies of a case but dashing out a strong opinion involving immediate action for instance as soon as i named bridget fitzgerald he exclaimed the coldholme witch the irish papist id have had her ducked long since but for that other papist sir philip tempest he has had to threaten honest folk about here over and over again or theyd have had her up before the justices for her black doings and its the law of the land that witches should be burnt ay and of scripture too sir yet you see a papist if hes a rich squire can overrule both law and scripture id carry a faggot myself to rid the country of her such a one could give me no help i rather drew back what i had already said and tried to make the parson forget it by treating him to several pots of beer in the village inn to which we had adjourned for our conference at his suggestion i left him as soon as i could and returned to coldholme shaping my way past deserted starkey manorhouse and coming upon it by the back at that side were the oblong remains of the old moat the waters of which lay placid and motionless under the crimson rays of the setting sun with the foresttrees lying straight along each side and their deepgreen foliage mirrored to blackness in the burnished surface of the moat belowand the broken sundial at the end nearest the halland the heron standing on one leg at the waters edge lazily looking down for fishthe lonely and desolate house scarce needed the broken windows the weeds on the doorsill the broken shutter softly flapping to and fro in the twilight breeze to fill up the picture of desertion and decay i lingered about the place until the growing darkness warned me on and then i passed along the path cut by the orders of the last lady of starkey manorhouse that led me to bridgets cottage i resolved at once to see her and in spite of closed doorsit might be of resolved willshe should see me so i knocked at her door gently loudly fiercely i shook it so vehemently that at length the old hinges gave way and with a crash it fell inwards leaving me suddenly face to face with bridgeti red heated agitated with my so longbaffled effortsshe stiff as any stone standing right facing me her eyes dilated with terror her ashen lips trembling but her body motionless in her hands she held her crucifix as if by that holy symbol she sought to oppose my entrance at sight of me her whole frame relaxed and she sank back upon a chair some mighty tension had given way still her eyes looked fearfully into the gloom of the outer air made more opaque by the glimmer of the lamp inside which she had placed before the picture of the virgin is she there asked bridget hoarsely no who i am alone you remember me yes replied she still terrorstricken but shethat creaturehas been looking in upon me through that window all day long i closed it up with my shawl and then i saw her feet below the door as long as it was light and i knew she heard my very breathingnay worse my very prayers and i could not pray for her listening choked the words ere they rose to my lips tell me who is shewhat means that double girl i saw this morning one had a look of my dead mary but the other curdled my blood and yet it was the same she had taken hold of my arm as if to secure herself some human companionship she shook all over with the slight neverceasing tremor of intense terror i told her my tale as i have told it you sparing none of the details how mistress clarke had informed me that the resemblance had driven lucy forth from her fathers househow i had disbelieved until with mine own eyes i had seen another lucy standing behind my lucy the same in form and feature but with the demonsoul looking out of the eyes i told her all i say believing that shewhose curse was working so upon the life of her innocent grandchildwas the only person who could find the remedy and the redemption when i had done she sat silent for many minutes you love marys child she asked i do in spite of the fearful working of the cursei love her yet i shrink from her ever since that day on the moorside and men must shrink from one so accompanied friends and lovers must stand afar off oh bridget fitzgerald loosen the curse set her free where is she i eagerly caught at the idea that her presence was needed in order that by some strange prayer or exorcism the spell might be reversed i will go and bring her to you i exclaimed but bridget tightened her hold upon my arm not so said she in a low hoarse voice it would kill me to see her again as i saw her this morning and i must live till i have worked my work leave me said she suddenly and again taking up the cross i defy the demon i have called up leave me to wrestle with it she stood up as if in an ecstasy of inspiration from which all fear was banished i lingeredwhy i can hardly telluntil once more she bade me begone as i went along the forest way i looked back and saw her planting the cross in the empty threshold where the door had been the next morning lucy and i went to seek her to bid her join her prayers with ours the cottage stood open and wide to our gaze no human being was there the cross remained on the threshold but bridget was gone chapter iii what was to be done next was the question that i asked myself as for lucy she would fain have submitted to the doom that lay upon her her gentleness and piety under the pressure of so horrible a life seemed overpassive to me she never complained mrs clarke complained more than ever as for me i was more in love with the real lucy than ever but i shrunk from the false similitude with an intensity proportioned to my love i found out by instinct that mrs clarke had occasional temptations to leave lucy the good ladys nerves were shaken and from what she said i could almost have concluded that the object of the double was to drive away from lucy this last and almost earliest friend at times i could scarcely bear to own it but i myself felt inclined to turn recreant and i would accuse lucy of being too patienttoo resigned one after another she won the little children of coldholme mrs clarke and she had resolved to stay there for was it not as good a place as any other to such as they and did not all our faint hopes rest on bridgetnever seen or heard of now but still we trusted to come back or give some token so as i say one after another the little children came about my lucy won by her soft tones and her gentle smiles and kind actions alas one after another they fell away and shrunk from her path with blanching terror and we too surely guessed the reason why it was the last drop i could bear it no longer i resolved no more to linger around the spot but to go back to my uncle and among the learned divines of the city of london seek for some power whereby to annul the curse my uncle meanwhile had obtained all the requisite testimonials relating to lucys descent and birth from the irish lawyers and from mr gisborne the latter gentleman had written from abroad he was again serving in the austrian army a letter alternately passionately selfreproachful and stoically repellent it was evident that when he thought of maryher short lifehow he had wronged her and of her violent death he could hardly find words severe enough for his own conduct and from this point of view the curse that bridget had laid upon him and his was regarded by him as a prophetic doom to the utterance of which she was moved by a higher power working for the fulfilment of a deeper vengeance than for the death of the poor dog but then again when he came to speak of his daughter the repugnance which the conduct of the demoniac creature had produced in his mind was but ill disguised under a show of profound indifference as to lucys fate one almost felt as if he would have been as content to put her out of existence as he would have been to destroy some disgusting reptile that had invaded his chamber or his couch the great fitzgerald property was lucys and that was allwas nothing my uncle and i sat in the gloom of a london november evening in our house in ormond street i was out of health and felt as if i were in an inextricable coil of misery lucy and i wrote to each other but that was little and we dared not see each other for dread of the fearful third who had more than once taken her place at our meetings my uncle had on the day i speak of bidden prayers to be put up on the ensuing sabbath in many a church and meetinghouse in london for one grievously tormented by an evil spirit he had faith in prayersi had none i was fast losing faith in all things so we sathe trying to interest me in the old talk of other days i oppressed by one thoughtwhen our old servant anthony opened the door and without speaking showed in a very gentlemanly and prepossessing man who had something remarkable about his dress betraying his profession to be that of the roman catholic priesthood he glanced at my uncle first then at me it was to me he bowed i did not give my name said he because you would hardly have recognised it unless sir when in the north you heard of father bernard the chaplain at stoney hurst i remembered afterwards that i had heard of him but at the time i had utterly forgotten it so i professed myself a complete stranger to him while my everhospitable uncle although hating a papist as much as it was in his nature to hate anything placed a chair for the visitor and bade anthony bring glasses and a fresh jug of claret father bernard received this courtesy with the graceful ease and pleasant acknowledgment which belongs to the man of the world then he turned to scan me with his keen glance after some slight conversation entered into on his part i am certain with an intention of discovering on what terms of confidence i stood with my uncle he paused and said gravely i am sent here with a message to you sir from a woman to whom you have shown kindness and who is one of my penitents in antwerpone bridget fitzgerald bridget fitzgerald exclaimed i in antwerp tell me sir all that you can about her there is much to be said he replied but may i inquire if this gentlemanif your uncle is acquainted with the particulars of which you and i stand informed all that i know he knows said i eagerly laying my hand on my uncles arm as he made a motion as if to quit the room then i have to speak before two gentlemen who however they may differ from me in faith are yet fully impressed with the fact that there are evil powers going about continually to take cognizance of our evil thoughts and if their master gives them power to bring them into overt action such is my theory of the nature of that sin of which i dare not disbelieveas some sceptics would have us dothe sin of witchcraft of this deadly sin you and i are aware bridget fitzgerald has been guilty since you saw her last many prayers have been offered in our churches many masses sung many penances undergone in order that if god and the holy saints so willed it her sin might be blotted out but it has not been so willed explain to me said i who you are and how you come connected with bridget why is she at antwerp i pray you sir tell me more if i am impatient excuse me i am ill and feverish and in consequence bewildered there was something to me inexpressibly soothing in the tone of voice with which he began to narrate as it were from the beginning his acquaintance with bridget i had known mr and mrs starkey during their residence abroad and so it fell out naturally that when i came as chaplain to the sherburnes at stoney hurst our acquaintance was renewed and thus i became the confessor of the whole family isolated as they were from the offices of the church sherburne being their nearest neighbour who professed the true faith of course you are aware that facts revealed in confession are sealed as in the grave but i learnt enough of bridgets character to be convinced that i had to do with no common woman one powerful for good as for evil i believe that i was able to give her spiritual assistance from time to time and that she looked upon me as a servant of that holy church which has such wonderful power of moving mens hearts and relieving them of the burden of their sins i have known her cross the moors on the wildest nights of storm to confess and be absolved and then she would return calmed and subdued to her daily work about her mistress no one witting where she had been during the hours that most passed in sleep upon their beds after her daughters departureafter marys mysterious disappearancei had to impose many a long penance in order to wash away the sin of impatient repining that was fast leading her into the deeper guilt of blasphemy she set out on that long journey of which you have possibly heardthat fruitless journey in search of maryand during her absence my superiors ordered my return to my former duties at antwerp and for many years i heard no more of bridget not many months ago as i was passing homewards in the evening along one of the streets near st jacques leading into the meer straet i saw a woman sitting crouched up under the shrine of the holy mother of sorrows her hood was drawn over her head so that the shadow caused by the light of the lamp above fell deep over her face her hands were clasped round her knees it was evident that she was some one in hopeless trouble and as such it was my duty to stop and speak i naturally addressed her first in flemish believing her to be one of the lower class of inhabitants she shook her head but did not look up then i tried french and she replied in that language but speaking it so indifferently that i was sure she was either english or irish and consequently spoke to her in my own native tongue she recognised my voice and starting up caught at my robes dragging me before the blessed shrine and throwing herself down and forcing me as much by her evident desire as by her action to kneel beside her she exclaimed o holy virgin you will never hearken to me again but hear him for you know him of old that he does your bidding and strives to heal broken hearts hear him she turned to me she will hear you if you will only pray she never hears me she and all the saints in heaven cannot hear my prayers for the evil one carries them off as he carried that first away o father bernard pray for me i prayed for one in sore distress of what nature i could not say but the holy virgin would know bridget held me fast gasping with eagerness at the sound of my words when i had ended i rose and making the sign of the cross over her i was going to bless her in the name of the holy church when she shrank away like some terrified creature and said i am guilty of deadly sin and am not shriven arise my daughter said i and come with me and i led the way into one of the confessionals of st jacques she knelt i listened no words came the evil powers had stricken her dumb as i heard afterwards they had many a time before when she approached confession she was too poor to pay for the necessary forms of exorcism and hitherto those priests to whom she had addressed herself were either so ignorant of the meaning of her broken french or her irishenglish or else esteemed her to be one crazedas indeed her wild and excited manner might easily have led any one to thinkthat they had neglected the sole means of loosening her tongue so that she might confess her deadly sin and after due penance obtain absolution but i knew bridget of old and felt that she was a penitent sent to me i went through those holy offices appointed by our church for the relief of such a case i was the more bound to do this as i found that she had come to antwerp for the sole purpose of discovering me and making confession to me of the nature of that fearful confession i am forbidden to speak much of it you know possibly all it now remains for her to free herself from mortal guilt and to set others free from the consequences thereof no prayers no masses will ever do it although they may strengthen her with that strength by which alone acts of deepest love and purest selfdevotion may be performed her words of passion and cries for revengeher unholy prayers could never reach the ears of the holy saints other powers intercepted them and wrought so that the curses thrown up to heaven have fallen on her own flesh and blood and so through her very strength of love have bruised and crushed her heart henceforward her former self must be buriedyea buried quick if need bebut never more to make sign or utter cry on earth she has become a poor clare in order that by perpetual penance and constant service of others she may at length so act as to obtain final absolution and rest for her soul until then the innocent must suffer it is to plead for the innocent that i come to you not in the name of the witch bridget fitzgerald but of the penitent and servant of all men the poor clare sister magdalen sir said i i listen to your request with respect only i may tell you it is not needed to urge me to do all that i can on behalf of one love for whom is part of my very life if for a time i have absented myself from her it is to think and work for her redemption i a member of the english churchmy uncle a puritanpray morning and night for her by name the congregations of london on the next sabbath will pray for one unknown that she may be set free from the powers of darkness moreover i must tell you sir that those evil ones touch not the great calm of her soul she lives her own pure and loving life unharmed and untainted though all men fall off from her i would i could have her faith my uncle now spoke nephew said he it seems to me that this gentleman although professing what i consider an erroneous creed has touched upon the right point in exhorting bridget to acts of love and mercy whereby to wipe out her sin of hate and vengeance let us strive after our fashion by almsgiving and visiting of the needy and fatherless to make our prayers acceptable meanwhile i myself will go down into the north and take charge of the maiden i am too old to be daunted by man or demon i will bring her to this house as to a home and let the double come if it will a company of godly divines shall give it the meeting and we will try issue the kindly brave old man but father bernard sat on musing all hate said he cannot be quenched in her heart all christian forgiveness cannot have entered into her soul or the demon would have lost its power you said i think that her grandchild was still tormented still tormented i replied sadly thinking of mistress clarkes last letter he rose to go we afterwards heard that the occasion of his coming to london was a secret political mission on behalf of the jacobites nevertheless he was a good and a wise man months and months passed away without any change lucy entreated my uncle to leave her where she wasdreading as i learnt lest if she came with her fearful companion to dwell in the same house with me that my love could not stand the repeated shocks to which i should be doomed and this she thought from no distrust of the strength of my affection but from a kind of pitying sympathy for the terror to the nerves which she observed that the demoniac visitation caused in all i was restless and miserable i devoted myself to good works but i performed them from no spirit of love but solely from the hope of reward and payment and so the reward was never granted at length i asked my uncles leave to travel and i went forth a wanderer with no distincter end than that of many another wandererto get away from myself a strange impulse led me to antwerp in spite of the wars and commotions then raging in the low countriesor rather perhaps the very craving to become interested in something external led me into the thick of the struggle then going on with the austrians the cities of flanders were all full at that time of civil disturbances and rebellions only kept down by force and the presence of an austrian garrison in every place i arrived in antwerp and made inquiry for father bernard he was away in the country for a day or two then i asked my way to the convent of poor clares but being healthy and prosperous i could only see the dim pentup gray walls shut closely in by narrow streets in the lowest part of the town my landlord told me that had i been stricken by some loathsome disease or in desperate case of any kind the poor clares would have taken me and tended me he spoke of them as an order of mercy of the strictest kind dressing scantily in the coarsest materials going barefoot living on what the inhabitants of antwerp chose to bestow and sharing even those fragments and crumbs with the poor and helpless that swarmed all around receiving no letters or communication with the outer world utterly dead to everything but the alleviation of suffering he smiled at my inquiring whether i could get speech of one of them and told me that they were even forbidden to speak for the purposes of begging their daily food while yet they lived and fed others upon what was given in charity but exclaimed i supposing all men forgot them would they quietly lie down and die without making sign of their extremity if such were their rule the poor clares would willingly do it but their founder appointed a remedy for such extreme case as you suggest they have a belltis but a small one as i have heard and has yet never been rung in the memory of man when the poor clares have been without food for twentyfour hours they may ring this bell and then trust to our good people of antwerp for rushing to the rescue of the poor clares who have taken such blessed care of us in all our straits it seemed to me that such rescue would be late in the day but i did not say what i thought i rather turned the conversation by asking my landlord if he knew or had ever heard anything of a certain sister magdalen yes said he rather under his breath news will creep out even from a convent of poor clares sister magdalen is either a great sinner or a great saint she does more as i have heard than all the other nuns put together yet when last month they would fain have made her mothersuperior she begged rather that they would place her below all the rest and make her the meanest servant of all you never saw her asked i never he replied i was weary of waiting for father bernard and yet i lingered in antwerp the political state of things became worse than ever increased to its height by the scarcity of food consequent on many deficient harvests i saw groups of fierce squalid men at every corner of the street glaring out with wolfish eyes at my sleek skin and handsome clothes at last father bernard returned we had a long conversation in which he told me that curiously enough mr gisborne lucys father was serving in one of the austrian regiments then in garrison at antwerp i asked father bernard if he would make us acquainted which he consented to do but a day or two afterwards he told me that on hearing my name mr gisborne had declined responding to any advances on my part saying he had abjured his country and hated his countrymen probably he recollected my name in connection with that of his daughter lucy anyhow it was clear enough that i had no chance of making his acquaintance father bernard confirmed me in my suspicions of the hidden fermentation for some coming evil working among the blouses of antwerp and he would fain have had me depart from out the city but i rather craved the excitement of danger and stubbornly refused to leave one day when i was walking with him in the place verte he bowed to an austrian officer who was crossing towards the cathedral that is mr gisborne said he as soon as the gentleman was past i turned to look at the tall slight figure of the officer he carried himself in a stately manner although he was past middle age and from his years might have had some excuse for a slight stoop as i looked at the man he turned round his eyes met mine and i saw his face deeply lined sallow and scathed was that countenance scarred by passion as well as by the fortunes of war twas but a moment our eyes met we each turned round and went on our separate way but his whole appearance was not one to be easily forgotten the thorough appointment of the dress and evident thought bestowed on it made but an incongruous whole with the dark gloomy expression of his countenance because he was lucys father i sought instinctively to meet him everywhere at last he must have become aware of my pertinacity for he gave me a haughty scowl whenever i passed him in one of these encounters however i chanced to be of some service to him he was turning the corner of a street and came suddenly on one of the groups of discontented flemings of whom i have spoken some words were exchanged when my gentleman out with his sword and with a slight but skilful cut drew blood from one of those who had insulted him as he fancied though i was too far off to hear the words they would all have fallen upon him had i not rushed forwards and raised the cry then well known in antwerp of rally to the austrian soldiers who were perpetually patrolling the streets and who came in numbers to the rescue i think that neither mr gisborne nor the mutinous group of plebeians owed me much gratitude for my interference he had planted himself against a wall in a skilful attitude of fence ready with his bright glancing rapier to do battle with all the heavy fierce unarmed men some six or seven in number but when his own soldiers came up he sheathed his sword and giving some careless word of command sent them away again and continued his saunter all alone down the street the workmen snarling in his rear and more than halfinclined to fall on me for my cry for rescue i cared not if they did my life seemed so dreary a burden just then and perhaps it was this daring loitering among them that prevented their attacking me instead they suffered me to fall into conversation with them and i heard some of their grievances sore and heavy to be borne were they and no wonder the sufferers were savage and desperate the man whom gisborne had wounded across his face would fain have got out of me the name of his aggressor but i refused to tell it another of the group heard his inquiry and made answer i know the man he is one gisborne aidedecamp to the generalcommandant i know him well he began to tell some story in connection with gisborne in a low and muttering voice and while he was relating a tale which i saw excited their evil blood and which they evidently wished me not to hear i sauntered away and back to my lodgings that night antwerp was in open revolt the inhabitants rose in rebellion against their austrian masters the austrians holding the gates of the city remained at first pretty quiet in the citadel only from time to time the boom of a great cannon swept sullenly over the town but if they expected the disturbance to die away and spend itself in a few hours fury they were mistaken in a day or two the rioters held possession of the principal municipal buildings then the austrians poured forth in bright flaming array calm and smiling as they marched to the posts assigned as if the fierce mob were no more to them than the swarms of buzzing summer flies their practised manuvres their wellaimed shot told with terrible effect but in the place of one slain rioter three sprang up of his blood to avenge his loss but a deadly foe a ghastly ally of the austrians was at work food scarce and dear for months was now hardly to be obtained at any price desperate efforts were being made to bring provisions into the city for the rioters had friends without close to the city port nearest to the scheldt a great struggle took place i was there helping the rioters whose cause i had adopted we had a savage encounter with the austrians numbers fell on both sides i saw them lie bleeding for a moment then a volley of smoke obscured them and when it cleared away they were deadtrampled upon or smothered pressed down and hidden by the freshlywounded whom those last guns had brought low and then a grayrobed and grayveiled figure came right across the flashing guns and stooped over some one whose lifeblood was ebbing away sometimes it was to give him drink from cans which they carried slung at their sides sometimes i saw the cross held above a dying man and rapid prayers were being uttered unheard by men in that hellish din and clangour but listened to by one above i saw all this as in a dream the reality of that stern time was battle and carnage but i knew that these gray figures their bare feet all wet with blood and their faces hidden by their veils were the poor claressent forth now because dire agony was abroad and imminent danger at hand therefore they left their cloistered shelter and came into that thick and evil mle close to medriven past me by the struggle of many fighterscame the antwerp burgess with the scarcehealed scar upon his face and in an instant more he was thrown by the press upon the austrian officer gisborne and ere either had recovered the shock the burgess had recognised his opponent ha the englishman gisborne he cried and threw himself upon him with redoubled fury he had struck him hardthe englishman was down when out of the smoke came a darkgray figure and threw herself right under the uplifted flashing sword the burgesss arm stood arrested neither austrians nor anversois willingly harmed the poor clares leave him to me said a low stern voice he is mine enemymine for many years those words were the last i heard i myself was struck down by a bullet i remember nothing more for days when i came to myself i was at the extremity of weakness and was craving for food to recruit my strength my landlord sat watching me he too looked pinched and shrunken he had heard of my wounded state and sought me out yes the struggle still continued but the famine was sore and some he had heard had died for lack of food the tears stood in his eyes as he spoke but soon he shook off his weakness and his natural cheerfulness returned father bernard had been to see meno one else who should indeed father bernard would come back that afternoonhe had promised but father bernard never came although i was up and dressed and looking eagerly for him my landlord brought me a meal which he had cooked himself of what it was composed he would not say but it was most excellent and with every mouthful i seemed to gain strength the good man sat looking at my evident enjoyment with a happy smile of sympathy but as my appetite became satisfied i began to detect a certain wistfulness in his eyes as if craving for the food i had so nearly devouredfor indeed at that time i was hardly aware of the extent of the famine suddenly there was a sound of many rushing feet past our window my landlord opened one of the sides of it the better to learn what was going on then we heard a faint cracked tinkling bell coming shrill upon the air clear and distinct from all other sounds holy mother exclaimed my landlord the poor clares he snatched up the fragments of my meal and crammed them into my hands bidding me follow downstairs he ran clutching at more food as the women of his house eagerly held it out to him and in a moment we were in the street moving along with the great current all tending towards the convent of the poor clares and still as if piercing our ears with its inarticulate cry came the shrill tinkle of the bell in that strange crowd were old men trembling and sobbing as they carried their little pittance of food women with the tears running down their cheeks who had snatched up what provisions they had in the vessels in which they stood so that the burden of these was in many cases much greater than that which they contained children with flushed faces grasping tight the morsel of bitten cake or bread in their eagerness to carry it safe to the help of the poor clares strong menyea both anversois and austrianspressing onwards with set teeth and no word spoken and over all and through all came that sharp tinklethat cry for help in extremity we met the first torrent of people returning with blanched and piteous faces they were issuing out of the convent to make way for the offerings of others haste haste said they a poor clare is dying a poor clare is dead for hunger god forgive us and our city we pressed on the stream bore us along where it would we were carried through refectories bare and crumbless into cells over whose doors the conventual name of the occupant was written thus it was that i with others was forced into sister magdalens cell on her couch lay gisborne pale unto death but not dead by his side was a cup of water and a small morsel of mouldy bread which he had pushed out of his reach and could not move to obtain over against his bed were these words copied in the english version therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink some of us gave him of our food and left him eating greedily like some famished wild animal for now it was no longer the sharp tinkle but that one solemn toll which in all christian countries tells of the passing of the spirit out of earthly life into eternity and again a murmur gathered and grew as of many people speaking with awed breath a poor clare is dying a poor clare is dead borne along once more by the motion of the crowd we were carried into the chapel belonging to the poor clares on a bier before the high altar lay a womanlay sister magdalenlay bridget fitzgerald by her side stood father bernard in his robes of office and holding the crucifix on high while he pronounced the solemn absolution of the church as to one who had newly confessed herself of deadly sin i pushed on with passionate force till i stood close to the dying woman as she received extreme unction amid the breathless and awed hush of the multitude around her eyes were glazing her limbs were stiffening but when the rite was over and finished she raised her gaunt figure slowly up and her eyes brightened to a strange intensity of joy as with the gesture of her finger and the trancelike gleam of her eye she seemed like one who watched the disappearance of some loathed and fearful creature she is freed from the curse said she as she fell back dead now of all our party who had first listened to my lady ludlow mr preston was the only one who had not told us something either of information tradition history or legend we naturally turned to him but we did not like asking him directly for his contribution for he was a grave reserved and silent man he understood us however and rousing himself as it were he said i know you wish me to tell you in my turn of something which i have learnt or heard during my life i could tell you something of my own life and of a life dearer still to my memory but i have shrunk from narrating anything so purely personal yet shrink as i will no other but those sad recollections will present themselves to my mind i call them sad when i think of the end of it all however i am not going to moralize if my dear brothers life and death does not speak for itself no words of mine will teach you what may be learnt from it the halfbrothers my mother was twice married she never spoke of her first husband and it is only from other people that i have learnt what little i know about him i believe she was scarcely seventeen when she was married to him and he was barely oneandtwenty he rented a small farm up in cumberland somewhere towards the seacoast but he was perhaps too young and inexperienced to have the charge of land and cattle anyhow his affairs did not prosper and he fell into ill health and died of consumption before they had been three years man and wife leaving my mother a young widow of twenty with a little child only just able to walk and the farm on her hands for four years more by the lease with half the stock on it dead or sold off one by one to pay the more pressing debts and with no money to purchase more or even to buy the provisions needed for the small consumption of every day there was another child coming too and sad and sorry i believe she was to think of it a dreary winter she must have had in her lonesome dwelling with never another near it for miles around her sister came to bear her company and they two planned and plotted how to make every penny they could raise go as far as possible i cant tell you how it happened that my little sister whom i never saw came to sicken and die but as if my poor mothers cup was not full enough only a fortnight before gregory was born the little girl took ill of scarlet fever and in a week she lay dead my mother was i believe just stunned with this last blow my aunt has told me that she did not cry aunt fanny would have been thankful if she had but she sat holding the poor wee lassies hand and looking in her pretty pale dead face without so much as shedding a tear and it was all the same when they had to take her away to be buried she just kissed the child and sat her down in the windowseat to watch the little black train of people neighboursmy aunt and one faroff cousin who were all the friends they could muster go winding away amongst the snow which had fallen thinly over the country the night before when my aunt came back from the funeral she found my mother in the same place and as dryeyed as ever so she continued until after gregory was born and somehow his coming seemed to loosen the tears and she cried day and night day and night till my aunt and the other watcher looked at each other in dismay and would fain have stopped her if they had but known how but she bade them let her alone and not be overanxious for every drop she shed eased her brain which had been in a terrible state before for want of the power to cry she seemed after that to think of nothing but her new little baby she hardly appeared to remember either her husband or her little daughter that lay dead in brigham churchyardat least so aunt fanny said but she was a great talker and my mother was very silent by nature and i think aunt fanny may have been mistaken in believing that my mother never thought of her husband and child just because she never spoke about them aunt fanny was older than my mother and had a way of treating her like a child but for all that she was a kind warmhearted creature who thought more of her sisters welfare than she did of her own and it was on her bit of money that they principally lived and on what the two could earn by working for the great glasgow sewingmerchants but byandby my mothers eyesight began to fail it was not that she was exactly blind for she could see well enough to guide herself about the house and to do a good deal of domestic work but she could no longer do fine sewing and earn money it must have been with the heavy crying she had had in her day for she was but a young creature at this time and as pretty a young woman i have heard people say as any on the country side she took it sadly to heart that she could no longer gain anything towards the keep of herself and her child my aunt fanny would fain have persuaded her that she had enough to do in managing their cottage and minding gregory but my mother knew that they were pinched and that aunt fanny herself had not as much to eat even of the commonest kind of food as she could have done with and as for gregory he was not a strong lad and needed not more foodfor he always had enough whoever went shortbut better nourishment and more fleshmeat one dayit was aunt fanny who told me all this about my poor mother long after her deathas the sisters were sitting together aunt fanny working and my mother hushing gregory to sleep william preston who was afterwards my father came in he was reckoned an old bachelor i suppose he was long past forty and he was one of the wealthiest farmers thereabouts and had known my grandfather well and my mother and my aunt in their more prosperous days he sat down and began to twirl his hat by way of being agreeable my aunt fanny talked and he listened and looked at my mother but he said very little either on that visit or on many another that he paid before he spoke out what had been the real purpose of his calling so often all along and from the very first time he came to their house one sunday however my aunt fanny stayed away from church and took care of the child and my mother went alone when she came back she ran straight upstairs without going into the kitchen to look at gregory or speak any word to her sister and aunt fanny heard her cry as if her heart was breaking so she went up and scolded her right well through the bolted door till at last she got her to open it and then she threw herself on my aunts neck and told her that william preston had asked her to marry him and had promised to take good charge of her boy and to let him want for nothing neither in the way of keep nor of education and that she had consented aunt fanny was a good deal shocked at this for as i have said she had often thought that my mother had forgotten her first husband very quickly and now here was proof positive of it if she could so soon think of marrying again besides as aunt fanny used to say she herself would have been a far more suitable match for a man of william prestons age than helen who though she was a widow had not seen her fourandtwentieth summer however as aunt fanny said they had not asked her advice and there was much to be said on the other side of the question helens eyesight would never be good for much again and as william prestons wife she would never need to do anything if she chose to sit with her hands before her and a boy was a great charge to a widowed mother and now there would be a decent steady man to see after him so byandby aunt fanny seemed to take a brighter view of the marriage than did my mother herself who hardly ever looked up and never smiled after the day when she promised william preston to be his wife but much as she had loved gregory before she seemed to love him more now she was continually talking to him when they were alone though he was far too young to understand her moaning words or give her any comfort except by his caresses at last william preston and she were wed and she went to be mistress of a wellstocked house not above halfanhours walk from where aunt fanny lived i believe she did all that she could to please my father and a more dutiful wife i have heard him himself say could never have been but she did not love him and he soon found it out she loved gregory and she did not love him perhaps love would have come in time if he had been patient enough to wait but it just turned him sour to see how her eye brightened and her colour came at the sight of that little child while for him who had given her so much she had only gentle words as cold as ice he got to taunt her with the difference in her manner as if that would bring love and he took a positive dislike to gregoryhe was so jealous of the ready love that always gushed out like a spring of fresh water when he came near he wanted her to love him more and perhaps that was all well and good but he wanted her to love her child less and that was an evil wish one day he gave way to his temper and cursed and swore at gregory who had got into some mischief as children will my mother made some excuse for him my father said it was hard enough to have to keep another mans child without having it perpetually held up in its naughtiness by his wife who ought to be always in the same mind that he was and so from little they got to more and the end of it was that my mother took to her bed before her time and i was born that very day my father was glad and proud and sorry all in a breath glad and proud that a son was born to him and sorry for his poor wifes state and to think how his angry words had brought it on but he was a man who liked better to be angry than sorry so he soon found out that it was all gregorys fault and owed him an additional grudge for having hastened my birth he had another grudge against him before long my mother began to sink the day after i was born my father sent to carlisle for doctors and would have coined his hearts blood into gold to save her if that could have been but it could not my aunt fanny used to say sometimes that she thought that helen did not wish to live and so just let herself die away without trying to take hold on life but when i questioned her she owned that my mother did all the doctors bade her do with the same sort of uncomplaining patience with which she had acted through life one of her last requests was to have gregory laid in her bed by my side and then she made him take hold of my little hand her husband came in while she was looking at us so and when he bent tenderly over her to ask her how she felt now and seemed to gaze on us two little halfbrothers with a grave sort of kindliness she looked up in his face and smiled almost her first smile at him and such a sweet smile as more besides aunt fanny have said in an hour she was dead aunt fanny came to live with us it was the best thing that could be done my father would have been glad to return to his old mode of bachelor life but what could he do with two little children he needed a woman to take care of him and who so fitting as his wifes elder sister so she had the charge of me from my birth and for a time i was weakly as was but natural and she was always beside me night and day watching over me and my father nearly as anxious as she for his land had come down from father to son for more than three hundred years and he would have cared for me merely as his flesh and blood that was to inherit the land after him but he needed something to love for all that to most people he was a stern hard man and he took to me as i fancy he had taken to no human being beforeas he might have taken to my mother if she had had no former life for him to be jealous of i loved him back again right heartily i loved all around me i believe for everybody was kind to me after a time i overcame my original weakliness of constitution and was just a bonny stronglooking lad whom every passerby noticed when my father took me with him to the nearest town at home i was the darling of my aunt the tenderlybeloved of my father the pet and plaything of the old domestic the young master of the farmlabourers before whom i played many a lordly antic assuming a sort of authority which sat oddly enough i doubt not on such a baby as i was gregory was three years older than i aunt fanny was always kind to him in deed and in action but she did not often think about him she had fallen so completely into the habit of being engrossed by me from the fact of my having come into her charge as a delicate baby my father never got over his grudging dislike to his stepson who had so innocently wrestled with him for the possession of my mothers heart i mistrust me too that my father always considered him as the cause of my mothers death and my early delicacy and utterly unreasonable as this may seem i believe my father rather cherished his feeling of alienation to my brother as a duty than strove to repress it yet not for the world would my father have grudged him anything that money could purchase that was as it were in the bond when he had wedded my mother gregory was lumpish and loutish awkward and ungainly marring whatever he meddled in and many a hard word and sharp scolding did he get from the people about the farm who hardly waited till my fathers back was turned before they rated the stepson i am ashamedmy heart is sore to think how i fell into the fashion of the family and slighted my poor orphan stepbrother i dont think i ever scouted him or was wilfully illnatured to him but the habit of being considered in all things and being treated as something uncommon and superior made me insolent in my prosperity and i exacted more than gregory was always willing to grant and then irritated i sometimes repeated the disparaging words i had heard others use with regard to him without fully understanding their meaning whether he did or not i cannot tell i am afraid he did he used to turn silent and quietsullen and sulky my father thought it stupid aunt fanny used to call it but every one said he was stupid and dull and this stupidity and dullness grew upon him he would sit without speaking a word sometimes for hours then my father would bid him rise and do some piece of work maybe about the farm and he would take three or four tellings before he would go when we were sent to school it was all the same he could never be made to remember his lessons the schoolmaster grew weary of scolding and flogging and at last advised my father just to take him away and set him to some farmwork that might not be above his comprehension i think he was more gloomy and stupid than ever after this yet he was not a cross lad he was patient and goodnatured and would try to do a kind turn for any one even if they had been scolding or cuffing him not a minute before but very often his attempts at kindness ended in some mischief to the very people he was trying to serve owing to his awkward ungainly ways i suppose i was a clever lad at any rate i always got plenty of praise and was as we called it the cock of the school the schoolmaster said i could learn anything i chose but my father who had no great learning himself saw little use in much for me and took me away betimes and kept me with him about the farm gregory was made into a kind of shepherd receiving his training under old adam who was nearly past his work i think old adam was almost the first person who had a good opinion of gregory he stood to it that my brother had good parts though he did not rightly know how to bring them out and for knowing the bearings of the fells he said he had never seen a lad like him my father would try to bring adam round to speak of gregorys faults and shortcomings but instead of that he would praise him twice as much as soon as he found out what my fathers object was one wintertime when i was about sixteen and gregory nineteen i was sent by my father on an errand to a place about seven miles distant by the road but only about four by the fells he bade me return by the road whichever way i took in going for the evenings closed in early and were often thick and misty besides which old adam now paralytic and bedridden foretold a downfall of snow before long i soon got to my journeys end and soon had done my business earlier by an hour i thought than my father had expected so i took the decision of the way by which i would return into my own hands and set off back again over the fells just as the first shades of evening began to fall it looked dark and gloomy enough but everything was so still that i thought i should have plenty of time to get home before the snow came down off i set at a pretty quick pace but night came on quicker the right path was clear enough in the daytime although at several points two or three exactly similar diverged from the same place but when there was a good light the traveller was guided by the sight of distant objectsa piece of rocka fall in the groundwhich were quite invisible to me now i plucked up a brave heart however and took what seemed to me the right road it was wrong however and led me whither i knew not but to some wild boggy moor where the solitude seemed painful intense as if never footfall of man had come thither to break the silence i tried to shoutwith the dimmest possible hope of being heardrather to reassure myself by the sound of my own voice but my voice came husky and short and yet it dismayed me it seemed so weird and strange in that noiseless expanse of black darkness suddenly the air was filled thick with dusky flakes my face and hands were wet with snow it cut me off from the slightest knowledge of where i was for i lost every idea of the direction from which i had come so that i could not even retrace my steps it hemmed me in thicker thicker with a darkness that might be felt the boggy soil on which i stood quaked under me if i remained long in one place and yet i dared not move far all my youthful hardiness seemed to leave me at once i was on the point of crying and only very shame seemed to keep it down to save myself from shedding tears i shoutedterrible wild shouts for bare life they were i turned sick as i paused to listen no answering sound came but the unfeeling echoes only the noiseless pitiless snow kept falling thicker thickerfaster faster i was growing numb and sleepy i tried to move about but i dared not go far for fear of the precipices which i knew abounded in certain places on the fells now and then i stood still and shouted again but my voice was getting choked with tears as i thought of the desolate helpless death i was to die and how little they at home sitting round the warm red bright fire wotted what was become of meand how my poor father would grieve for meit would surely kill himit would break his heart poor old man aunt fanny toowas this to be the end of all her cares for me i began to review my life in a strange kind of vivid dream in which the various scenes of my few boyish years passed before me like visions in a pang of agony caused by such remembrance of my short life i gathered up my strength and called out once more a long despairing wailing cry to which i had no hope of obtaining any answer save from the echoes around dulled as the sound might be by the thickened air to my surprise i heard a cryalmost as long as wild as mineso wild that it seemed unearthly and i almost thought it must be the voice of some of the mocking spirits of the fells about whom i had heard so many tales my heart suddenly began to beat fast and loud i could not reply for a minute or two i nearly fancied i had lost the power of utterance just at this moment a dog barked was it lassies barkmy brothers colliean ugly enough brute with a white illlooking face that my father always kicked whenever he saw it partly for its own demerits partly because it belonged to my brother on such occasions gregory would whistle lassie away and go off and sit with her in some outhouse my father had once or twice been ashamed of himself when the poor collie had yowled out with the suddenness of the pain and had relieved himself of his selfreproach by blaming my brother who he said had no notion of training a dog and was enough to ruin any collie in christendom with his stupid way of allowing them to lie by the kitchen fire to all which gregory would answer nothing nor even seem to hear but go on looking absent and moody yes there again it was lassies bark now or never i lifted up my voice and shouted lassie lassie for gods sake lassie another moment and the great whitefaced lassie was curving and gambolling with delight round my feet and legs looking however up in my face with her intelligent apprehensive eyes as if fearing lest i might greet her with a blow as i had done oftentimes before but i cried with gladness as i stooped down and patted her my mind was sharing in my bodys weakness and i could not reason but i knew that help was at hand a gray figure came more and more distinctly out of the thick closepressing darkness it was gregory wrapped in his maud oh gregory said i and i fell upon his neck unable to speak another word he never spoke much and made me no answer for some little time then he told me we must move we must walk for the dear lifewe must find our road home if possible but we must move or we should be frozen to death dont you know the way home asked i i thought i did when i set out but i am doubtful now the snow blinds me and i am feared that in moving about just now i have lost the right gait homewards he had his shepherds staff with him and by dint of plunging it before us at every step we tookclinging close to each other we went on safely enough as far as not falling down any of the steep rocks but it was slow dreary work my brother i saw was more guided by lassie and the way she took than anything else trusting to her instinct it was too dark to see far before us but he called her back continually and noted from what quarter she returned and shaped our slow steps accordingly but the tedious motion scarcely kept my very blood from freezing every bone every fibre in my body seemed first to ache and then to swell and then to turn numb with the intense cold my brother bore it better than i from having been more out upon the hills he did not speak except to call lassie i strove to be brave and not complain but now i felt the deadly fatal sleep stealing over me i can go no farther i said in a drowsy tone i remember i suddenly became dogged and resolved sleep i would were it only for five minutes if death were to be the consequence sleep i would gregory stood still i suppose he recognised the peculiar phase of suffering to which i had been brought by the cold it is of no use said he as if to himself we are no nearer home than we were when we started as far as i can tell our only chance is in lassie here roll thee in my maud lad and lay thee down on this sheltered side of this bit of rock creep close under it lad and ill lie by thee and strive to keep the warmth in us stay hast gotten aught about thee theyll know at home i felt him unkind thus to keep me from slumber but on his repeating the question i pulled out my pockethandkerchief of some showy pattern which aunt fanny had hemmed for megregory took it and tied it round lassies neck hie thee lassie hie thee home and the whitefaced illfavoured brute was off like a shot in the darkness now i might lie downnow i might sleep in my drowsy stupor i felt that i was being tenderly covered up by my brother but what with i neither knew nor caredi was too dull too selfish too numb to think and reason or i might have known that in that bleak bare place there was nought to wrap me in save what was taken off another i was glad enough when he ceased his cares and lay down by me i took his hand thou canst not remember lad how we lay together thus by our dying mother she put thy small wee hand in minei reckon she sees us now and belike we shall soon be with her anyhow gods will be done dear gregory i muttered and crept nearer to him for warmth he was talking still and again about our mother when i fell asleep in an instantor so it seemedthere were many voices about memany faces hovering round methe sweet luxury of warmth was stealing into every part of me i was in my own little bed at home i am thankful to say my first word was gregory a look passed from one to anothermy fathers stern old face strove in vain to keep its sternness his mouth quivered his eyes filled slowly with unwonted tears i would have given him half my landi would have blessed him as my sonoh god i would have knelt at his feet and asked him to forgive my hardness of heart i heard no more a whirl came through my brain catching me back to death i came slowly to my consciousness weeks afterwards my fathers hair was white when i recovered and his hands shook as he looked into my face we spoke no more of gregory we could not speak of him but he was strangely in our thoughts lassie came and went with never a word of blame nay my father would try to stroke her but she shrank away and he as if reproved by the poor dumb beast would sigh and be silent and abstracted for a time aunt fannyalways a talkertold me all how on that fatal night my father irritated by my prolonged absence and probably more anxious than he cared to show had been fierce and imperious even beyond his wont to gregory had upbraided him with his fathers poverty his own stupidity which made his services good for nothingfor so in spite of the old shepherd my father always chose to consider them at last gregory had risen up and whistled lassie out with himpoor lassie crouching underneath his chair for fear of a kick or a blow some time before there had been some talk between my father and my aunt respecting my return and when aunt fanny told me all this she said she fancied that gregory might have noticed the coming storm and gone out silently to meet me three hours afterwards when all were running about in wild alarm not knowing whither to go in search of menot even missing gregory or heeding his absence poor fellowpoor poor fellowlassie came home with my handkerchief tied round her neck they knew and understood and the whole strength of the farm was turned out to follow her with wraps and blankets and brandy and everything that could be thought of i lay in chilly sleep but still alive beneath the rock that lassie guided them to i was covered over with my brothers plaid and his thick shepherds coat was carefully wrapped round my feet he was in his shirtsleeveshis arm thrown over mea quiet smile he had hardly ever smiled in life upon his still cold face my fathers last words were god forgive me my hardness of heart towards the fatherless child and what marked the depth of his feeling of repentance perhaps more than all considering the passionate love he bore my mother was this we found a paper of directions after his death in which he desired that he might lie at the foot of the grave in which by his desire poor gregory had been laid with our mother the end london printed by william clowes and sons stamford street and charing cross list of books published by sampson low son and co ludgate hill london march new illustrated
