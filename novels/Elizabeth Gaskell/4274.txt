country there was a shire and in that shire there was a town and in that town there was a house and in that house there was a room and in that room there was a bed and in that bed there lay a little girl wide awake and longing to get up but not daring to do so for fear of the unseen power in the next rooma certain betty whose slumbers must not be disturbed until six oclock struck when she wakened of herself as sure as clockwork and left the household very little peace afterwards it was a june morning and early as it was the room was full of sunny warmth and light on the drawers opposite to the little white dimity bed in which molly gibson lay was a primitive kind of bonnetstand on which was hung a bonnet carefully covered over from any chance of dust with a large cotton handkerchief of so heavy and serviceable a texture that if the thing underneath it had been a flimsy fabric of gauze and lace and flowers it would have been altogether scomfished again to quote from bettys vocabulary but the bonnet was made of solid straw and its only trimming was a plain white ribbon put over the crown and forming the strings still there was a neat little quilling inside every plait of which molly knew for had she not made it herself the evening before with infinite pains and was there not a little blue bow in this quilling the very first bit of such finery molly had ever had the prospect of wearing six oclock now the pleasant brisk ringing of the church bells told that calling every one to their daily work as they had done for hundreds of years up jumped molly and ran with her bare little feet across the room and lifted off the handkerchief and saw once again the bonnet the pledge of the gay bright day to come then to the window and after some tugging she opened the casement and let in the sweet morning air the dew was already off the flowers in the garden below but still rising from the long haygrass in the meadows directly beyond at one side lay the little town of hollingford into a street of which mr gibsons front door opened and delicate columns and little puffs of smoke were already beginning to rise from many a cottage chimney where some housewife was already up and preparing breakfast for the breadwinner of the family molly gibson saw all this but all she thought about it was oh it will be a fine day i was afraid it never never would come or that if it ever came it would be a rainy day fiveandforty years ago childrens pleasures in a country town were very simple and molly had lived for twelve long years without the occurrence of any event so great as that which was now impending poor child it is true that she had lost her mother which was a jar to the whole tenour of her life but that was hardly an event in the sense referred to and besides she had been too young to be conscious of it at the time the pleasure she was looking forward to today was her first share in a kind of annual festival in hollingford the little straggling town faded away into country on one side close to the entrancelodge of a great park where lived my lord and lady cumnor the earl and the countess as they were always called by the inhabitants of the town where a very pretty amount of feudal feeling still lingered and showed itself in a number of simple ways droll enough to look back upon but serious matters of importance at the time it was before the passing of the reform bill but a good deal of liberal talk took place occasionally between two or three of the more enlightened freeholders living in hollingford and there was a great tory family in the county who from time to time came forward and contested the election with the rival whig family of cumnor one would have thought that the abovementioned liberaltalking inhabitants would have at least admitted the possibility of their voting for the helyharrison and thus trying to vindicate their independence but no such thing the earl was lord of the manor and owner of much of the land on which hollingford was built he and his household were fed and doctored and to a certain measure clothed by the good people of the town their fathers grandfathers had always voted for the eldest son of cumnor towers and following in the ancestral track every manjack in the place gave his vote to the liege lord totally irrespective of such chimeras as political opinion this was no unusual instance of the influence of the great landowners over humbler neighbours in those days before railways and it was well for a place where the powerful family who thus overshadowed it were of so respectable a character as the cumnors they expected to be submitted to and obeyed the simple worship of the townspeople was accepted by the earl and countess as a right and they would have stood still in amazement and with a horrid memory of the french sansculottes who were the bugbears of their youth had any inhabitant of hollingford ventured to set his will or opinions in opposition to those of the earl but yielded all that obeisance they did a good deal for the town and were generally condescending and often thoughtful and kind in their treatment of their vassals lord cumnor was a forbearing landlord putting his steward a little on one side sometimes and taking the reins into his own hands now and then much to the annoyance of the agent who was in fact too rich and independent to care greatly for preserving a post where his decisions might any day be overturned by my lords taking a fancy to go pottering as the agent irreverently expressed it in the sanctuary of his own home which being interpreted meant that occasionally the earl asked his own questions of his own tenants and used his own eyes and ears in the management of the smaller details of his property but his tenants liked my lord all the better for this habit of his lord cumnor had certainly a little time for gossip which he contrived to combine with the failing of personal intervention between the old landsteward and the tenantry but then the countess made up by her unapproachable dignity for this weakness of the earls once a year she was condescending she and the ladies her daughters had set up a school not a school after the manner of schools nowadays where far better intellectual teaching is given to the boys and girls of labourers and workpeople than often falls to the lot of their betters in worldly estate but a school of the kind we should call industrial where girls are taught to sew beautifully to be capital housemaids and pretty fair cooks and above all to dress neatly in a kind of charity uniform devised by the ladies of cumnor towerswhite caps white tippets check aprons blue gowns and ready curtseys and please maams being de rigueur now as the countess was absent from the towers for a considerable part of the year she was glad to enlist the sympathy of the hollingford ladies in this school with a view to obtaining their aid as visitors during the many months that she and her daughters were away and the various unoccupied gentlewomen of the town responded to the call of their liege lady and gave her their service as required and along with it a great deal of whispered and fussy admiration how good of the countess so like the dear countessalways thinking of others and so on while it was always supposed that no strangers had seen hollingford properly unless they had been taken to the countesss school and been duly impressed by the neat little pupils and the still neater needlework there to be inspected in return there was a day of honour set apart every summer when with much gracious and stately hospitality lady cumnor and her daughters received all the school visitors at the towers the great family mansion standing in aristocratic seclusion in the centre of the large park of which one of the lodges was close to the little town the order of this annual festivity was this about ten oclock one of the towers carriages rolled through the lodge and drove to different houses wherein dwelt a woman to be honoured picking them up by ones or twos till the loaded carriage drove back again through the ready portals bowled along the smooth treeshaded road and deposited its covey of smartlydressed ladies on the great flight of steps leading to the ponderous doors of cumnor towers back again to the town another picking up of womankind in their best clothes and another return and so on till the whole party were assembled either in the house or in the really beautiful gardens after the proper amount of exhibition on the one part and admiration on the other had been done there was a collation for the visitors and some more display and admiration of the treasures inside the house towards four oclock coffee was brought round and this was a signal of the approaching carriage that was to take them back to their own homes whither they returned with the happy consciousness of a wellspent day but with some fatigue at the longcontinued exertion of behaving their best and talking on stilts for so many hours nor were lady cumnor and her daughters free from something of the same selfapprobation and something too of the same fatigue the fatigue that always follows on conscious efforts to behave as will best please the society you are in for the first time in her life molly gibson was to be included among the guests at the towers she was much too young to be a visitor at the school so it was not on that account that she was to go but it had so happened that one day when lord cumnor was on a pottering expedition he had met mr gibson the doctor of the neighbourhood coming out of the farmhouse my lord was entering and having some small question to ask the surgeon lord cumnor seldom passed any one of his acquaintance without asking a question of some sortnot always attending to the answer it was his mode of conversation he accompanied mr gibson to the outbuilding to a ring in the wall of which the surgeons horse was fastened molly was there too sitting square and quiet on her rough little pony waiting for her father her grave eyes opened large and wide at the close neighbourhood and evident advance of the earl for to her little imagination the greyhaired redfaced somewhat clumsy man was a cross between an archangel and a king your daughter eh gibsonnice little girl how old pony wants grooming though patting it as he talked whats your name my dear hes sadly behindhand with his rent as i was saying but if hes really ill i must see after sheepshanks who is a hardish man of business whats his complaint youll come to our schoolscrimmage on thursday little girlwhatsyourname mind you send her or bring her gibson and just give a word to your groom for im sure that pony wasnt singed last year now was he dont forget thursday little girlwhatsyournameits a promise between us is it not and off the earl trotted attracted by the sight of the farmers eldest son on the other side of the yard mr gibson mounted and he and molly rode off they did not speak for some time then she said may i go papa in rather an anxious little tone of voice where my dear said he wakening up out of his own professional thoughts to the towerson thursday you know that gentleman she was shy of calling him by his title asked me would you like it my dear it has always seemed to me rather a tiresome piece of gaietyrather a tiring day i meanbeginning so earlyand the heat and all that oh papa said molly reproachfully youd like to go then would you yes if i mayhe asked me you know dont you think i mayhe asked me twice over well well seeyes i think we can manage it if you wish it so much molly then they were silent again byandby molly said please papai do wish to gobut i dont care about it thats rather a puzzling speech but i suppose you mean you dont care to go if it will be any trouble to get you there i can easily manage it however so you may consider it settled youll want a white frock remember youd better tell betty youre going and shell see after making you tidy now there were two or three things to be done by mr gibson before he could feel quite comfortable about mollys going to the festival at the towers and each of them involved a little trouble on his part but he was very willing to gratify his little girl so the next day he rode over to the towers ostensibly to visit some sick housemaid but in reality to throw himself in my ladys way and get her to ratify lord cumnors invitation to molly he chose his time with a little natural diplomacy which indeed he had often to exercise in his intercourse with the great family he rode into the stableyard about twelve oclock a little before luncheontime and yet after the worry of opening the postbag and discussing its contents was over after he had put up his horse he went in by the backway to the house the house on this side the towers at the front he saw his patient gave his directions to the housekeeper and then went out with a rare wildflower in his hand to find one of the ladies tranmere in the garden where according to his hope and calculation he came upon lady cumnor toonow talking to her daughter about the contents of an open letter which she held in her hand now directing a gardener about certain beddingout plants i was calling to see nanny and i took the opportunity of bringing lady agnes the plant i was telling her about as growing on cumnor moss thank you so much mr gibson mamma look this is the drosera rotundifolia i have been wanting so long ah yes very pretty i daresay only i am no botanist nanny is better i hope we cant have any one laid up next week for the house will be quite full of peopleand here are the danbys waiting to offer themselves as well one comes down for a fortnight of quiet at whitsuntide and leaves half ones establishment in town and as soon as people know of our being here we get letters without end longing for a breath of country air or saying how lovely the towers must look in spring and i must own lord cumnor is a great deal to blame for it all for as soon as ever we are down here he rides about to all the neighbours and invites them to come over and spend a few days we shall go back to town on friday the th said lady agnes in a consolatory tone ah yes as soon as we have got over the school visitors affair but it is a week to that happy day by the way said mr gibson availing himself of the good opening thus presented i met my lord at the crosstrees farm yesterday and he was kind enough to ask my little daughter who was with me to be one of the party here on thursday it would give the lassie great pleasure i believe he paused for lady cumnor to speak oh well if my lord asked her i suppose she must come but i wish he was not so amazingly hospitable not but what the little girl will be quite welcome only you see he met a younger miss browning the other day of whose existence i had never heard she visits at the school mamma said lady agnes well perhaps she does i never said she did not i knew there was one visitor of the name of browning i never knew there were two but of course as soon as lord cumnor heard there was another he must needs ask her so the carriage will have to go backwards and forwards four times now to fetch them all so your daughter can come quite easily mr gibson and i shall be very glad to see her for your sake she can sit bodkin with the brownings i suppose youll arrange it all with them and mind you get nanny well up to her work next week just as mr gibson was going away lady cumnor called after him oh bytheby clare is here you remember clare dont you she was a patient of yours long ago clare he repeated in a bewildered tone dont you recollect her miss clare our old governess said lady agnes about twelve or fourteen years ago before lady cuxhaven was married oh yes said he miss clare who had the scarlet fever here a very pretty delicate girl but i thought she was married yes said lady cumnor she was a silly little thing and did not know when she was well off we were all very fond of her im sure she went and married a poor curate and became a stupid mrs kirkpatrick but we always kept on calling her clare and now hes dead and left her a widow and she is staying here and we are racking our brains to find out some way of helping her to a livelihood without parting her from her child shes somewhere about the grounds if you like to renew your acquaintance with her thank you my lady im afraid i cannot stop today i have a long round to go ive stayed here too long as it is im afraid long as his ride had been that day he called on the miss brownings in the evening to arrange about mollys accompanying them to the towers they were tall handsome women past their first youth and inclined to be extremely complaisant to the widowed doctor eh dear mr gibson but we shall be delighted to have her with us you should never have thought of asking us such a thing said miss browning the elder im sure im hardly sleeping at nights for thinking of it said miss phoebe you know ive never been there before sister has many a time but somehow though my name has been down on the visitors list these three years the countess has never named me in her note and you know i could not push myself into notice and go to such a grand place without being asked how could i i told phoebe last year said her sister that i was sure it was only inadvertence as one may call it on the part of the countess and that her ladyship would be as hurt as any one when she didnt see phoebe among the school visitors but phoebe has got a delicate mind you see mr gibson and all i could say she wouldnt go but stopped here at home and it spoilt all my pleasure all that day i do assure you to think of phoebes face as i saw it over the windowblinds as i rode away her eyes were full of tears if youll believe me i had a good cry after you was gone dorothy said miss phoebe but for all that i think i was right in stopping away from where i was not asked dont you mr gibson certainly said he and you see you are going this year and last year it rained yes i remember i set myself to tidy my drawers to string myself up as it were and i was so taken up with what i was about that i was quite startled when i heard the rain beating against the windowpanes goodness me said i to myself whatever will become of sisters white satin shoes if she has to walk about on soppy grass after such rain as this for you see i thought a deal about her having a pair of smart shoes and this year she has gone and got me a white satin pair just as smart as hers for a surprise molly will know shes to put on her best clothes said miss browning we could perhaps lend her a few beads or artificials if she wants them molly must go in a clean white frock said mr gibson rather hastily for he did not admire the miss brownings taste in dress and was unwilling to have his child decked up according to their fancy he esteemed his old servant bettys as the more correct because the more simple miss browning had just a shade of annoyance in her tone as she drew herself up and said oh very well its quite right im sure but miss phoebe said molly will look very nice in whatever she puts on thats certain chapter ii a novice amongst the great folk at ten oclock on the eventful thursday the towers carriage began its work molly was ready long before it made its first appearance although it had been settled that she and the miss brownings were not to go until the last or fourth time of its coming her face had been soaped scrubbed and shone brilliantly clean her frills her frock her ribbons were all snowwhite she had on a black mode cloak that had been her mothers it was trimmed round with rich lace and looked quaint and oldfashioned on the child for the first time in her life she wore kid gloves hitherto she had only had cotton ones her gloves were far too large for the little dimpled fingers but as betty had told her they were to last her for years it was all very well she trembled many a time and almost turned faint once with the long expectation of the morning betty might say what she liked about a watched pot never boiling molly never ceased to watch the approach through the winding street and after two hours the carriage came for her at last she had to sit very forward to avoid crushing the miss brownings new dresses and yet not too forward for fear of incommoding fat mrs goodenough and her niece who occupied the front seat of the carriage so that altogether the fact of sitting down at all was rather doubtful and to add to her discomfort molly felt herself to be very conspicuously placed in the centre of the carriage a mark for all the observation of hollingford it was far too much of a gala day for the work of the little town to go forward with its usual regularity maidservants gazed out of upper windows shopkeepers wives stood on the doorsteps cottagers ran out with babies in their arms and little children too young to know how to behave respectfully at the sight of an earls carriage huzzaed merrily as it bowled along the woman at the lodge held the gate open and dropped a low curtsey to the liveries and now they were in the park and now they were in sight of the towers and silence fell upon the carriagefull of ladies only broken by one faint remark from mrs goodenoughs niece a stranger to the town as they drew up before the double semicircle flight of steps which led to the door of the mansion they call that a perron i believe dont they she asked but the only answer she obtained was a simultaneous hush it was very awful as molly thought and she half wished herself at home again but she lost all consciousness of herself byandby when the party strolled out into the beautiful grounds the like of which she had never even imagined green velvet lawns bathed in sunshine stretched away on every side into the finely wooded park if there were divisions and hahas between the soft sunny sweeps of grass and the dark gloom of the foresttrees beyond molly did not see them and the melting away of exquisite cultivation into the wilderness had an inexplicable charm to her near the house there were walls and fences but they were covered with climbing roses and rare honeysuckles and other creepers just bursting into bloom there were flowerbeds too scarlet crimson blue orange masses of blossom lying on the greensward molly held miss brownings hand very tight as they loitered about in company with several other ladies and marshalled by a daughter of the towers who seemed half amused at the voluble admiration showered down upon every possible thing and place molly said nothing as became her age and position but every now and then she relieved her full heart by drawing a deep breath almost like a sigh presently they came to the long glittering range of greenhouses and hothouses and an attendant gardener was there to admit the party molly did not care for this half so much as for the flowers in the open air but lady agnes had a more scientific taste she expatiated on the rarity of this plant and the mode of cultivation required by that till molly began to feel very tired and then very faint she was too shy to speak for some time but at length afraid of making a greater sensation if she began to cry or if she fell against the stands of precious flowers she caught at miss brownings hand and gasped out may i go back out into the garden i cant breathe here oh yes to be sure love i daresay its hard understanding for you love but its very fine and instructive and a deal of latin in it too she turned hastily round not to lose another word of lady agnes lecture on orchids and molly turned back and passed out of the heated atmosphere she felt better in the fresh air and unobserved and at liberty went from one lovely spot to another now in the open park now in some shutin flowergarden where the song of the birds and the drip of the central fountain were the only sounds and the treetops made an enclosing circle in the blue june sky she went along without more thought as to her whereabouts than a butterfly has as it skims from flower to flower till at length she grew very weary and wished to return to the house but did not know how and felt afraid of encountering all the strangers who would be there unprotected by either of the miss brownings the hot sun told upon her head and it began to ache she saw a great widespreading cedartree upon a burst of lawn towards which she was advancing and the black repose beneath its branches lured her thither there was a rustic seat in the shadow and weary molly sate down there and presently fell asleep she was startled from her slumbers after a time and jumped to her feet two ladies were standing by her talking about her they were perfect strangers to her and with a vague conviction that she had done something wrong and also because she was wornout with hunger fatigue and the mornings excitement she began to cry poor little woman she has lost herself she belongs to some of the people from hollingford i have no doubt said the oldestlooking of the two ladies she who appeared to be about forty though she did not really number more than thirty years she was plainfeatured and had rather a severe expression on her face her dress was as rich as any morning dress could be her voice deep and unmodulatedwhat in a lower rank of life would have been called gruff but that was not a word to apply to lady cuxhaven the eldest daughter of the earl and countess the other lady looked much younger but she was in fact some years the elder at first sight molly thought she was the most beautiful person she had ever seen and she was certainly a very lovely woman her voice too was soft and plaintive as she replied to lady cuxhaven poor little darling she is overcome by the heat i have no doubtsuch a heavy straw bonnet too let me untie it for you my dear molly now found voice to sayi am molly gibson please i came here with miss brownings for her great fear was that she should be taken for an unauthorized intruder miss brownings said lady cuxhaven to her companion as if inquiringly i think they were the two tall large young women that lady agnes was talking about oh i daresay i saw she had a number of people in tow then looking again at molly she said have you had anything to eat child since you came you look a very white little thing or is it the heat i have had nothing to eat said molly rather piteously for indeed before she fell asleep she had been very hungry the two ladies spoke to each other in a low voice then the elder said in a voice of authority which indeed she had always used in speaking to the other sit still here my dear we are going to the house and clare shall bring you something to eat before you try to walk back it must be a quarter of a mile at least so they went away and molly sat upright waiting for the promised messenger she did not know who clare might be and she did not care much for food now but she felt as if she could not walk without some help at length she saw the pretty lady coming back followed by a footman with a small tray look how kind lady cuxhaven is said she who was called clare she chose you out this little lunch herself and now you must try and eat it and youll be quite right when youve had some food darlingyou need not stop edwards i will bring the tray back with me there was some bread and some cold chicken and some jelly and a glass of wine and a bottle of sparkling water and a bunch of grapes molly put out her trembling little hand for the water but she was too faint to hold it clare put it to her mouth and she took a long draught and was refreshed but she could not eat she tried but she could not her headache was too bad clare looked bewildered take some grapes they will be the best for you you must try and eat something or i dont know how i shall get you to the house my head aches so said molly lifting her heavy eyes wistfully oh dear how tiresome said clare still in her sweet gentle voice not at all as if she was angry only expressing an obvious truth molly felt very guilty and very unhappy clare went on with a shade of asperity in her tone you see i dont know what to do with you here if you dont eat enough to enable you to walk home and ive been out for these three hours trapesing about the grounds till im as tired as can be and missed my lunch and all then as if a new idea had struck her she saidyou lie back in that seat for a few minutes and try to eat the bunch of grapes and ill wait for you and just be eating a mouthful meanwhile you are sure you dont want this chicken molly did as she was bid and leant back picking languidly at the grapes and watching the good appetite with which the lady ate up the chicken and jelly and drank the glass of wine she was so pretty and so graceful in her deep mourning that even her hurry in eating as if she was afraid of some one coming to surprise her in the act did not keep her little observer from admiring her in all she did and now darling are you ready to go said she when she had eaten up everything on the tray oh come you have nearly finished your grapes thats a good girl now if you will come with me to the side entrance i will take you up to my own room and you shall lie down on the bed for an hour or two and if you have a good nap your headache will be quite gone so they set off clare carrying the empty tray rather to mollys shame but the child had enough work to drag herself along and was afraid of offering to do anything more the side entrance was a flight of steps leading up from a private flowergarden into a private matted hall or anteroom out of which many doors opened and in which were deposited the light gardentools and the bows and arrows of the young ladies of the house lady cuxhaven must have seen their approach for she met them in this hall as soon as they came in how is she now she asked then glancing at the plates and glasses she added come i think there cant be much amiss youre a good old clare but you should have let one of the men fetch that tray in life in such weather as this is trouble enough of itself molly could not help wishing that her pretty companion would have told lady cuxhaven that she herself had helped to finish up the ample luncheon but no such idea seemed to come into her mind she only saidpoor dear she is not quite the thing yet has got a headache she says i am going to put her down on my bed to see if she can get a little sleep molly saw lady cuxhaven say something in a halflaughing manner to clare as she passed her and the child could not keep from tormenting herself by fancying that the words spoken sounded wonderfully like overeaten herself i suspect however she felt too poorly to worry herself long the little white bed in the cool and pretty room had too many attractions for her aching head the muslin curtains flapped softly from time to time in the scented air that came through the open windows clare covered her up with a light shawl and darkened the room as she was going away molly roused herself to say please maam dont let them go away without me please ask somebody to waken me if i go to sleep i am to go back with miss brownings dont trouble yourself about it dear ill take care said clare turning round at the door and kissing her hand to little anxious molly and then she went away and thought no more about it the carriages came round at halfpast four hurried a little by lady cumnor who had suddenly become tired of the business of entertaining and annoyed at the repetition of indiscriminating admiration why not have both carriages out mamma and get rid of them all at once said lady cuxhaven this going by instalments is the most tiresome thing that could be imagined so at last there had been a great hurry and an unmethodical way of packing off every one at once miss browning had gone in the chariot or chawyot as lady cumnor called itit rhymed to her daughter lady hawyotor harriet as the name was spelt in the peerage and miss phoebe had been speeded along with several other guests away in a great roomy family conveyance of the kind which we should now call an omnibus each thought that molly gibson was with the other and the truth was that she lay fast asleep on mrs kirkpatricks bedmrs kirkpatrick ne clare the housemaids came in to arrange the room their talking aroused molly who sat up on the bed and tried to push back the hair from her hot forehead and to remember where she was she dropped down on her feet by the side of the bed to the astonishment of the women and saidplease how soon are we going away bless us and save us whod ha thought of any one being in the bed are you one of the hollingford ladies my dear they are all gone this hour or more oh dear what shall i do that lady they call clare promised to waken me in time papa will so wonder where i am and i dont know what betty will say the child began to cry and the housemaids looked at each other in some dismay and much sympathy just then they heard mrs kirkpatricks step along the passages approaching she was singing some little italian air in a low musical voice coming to her bedroom to dress for dinner one housemaid said to the other with a knowing look best leave it to her and they passed on to their work in the other rooms mrs kirkpatrick opened the door and stood aghast at the sight of molly why i quite forgot you she said at length nay dont cry youll make yourself not fit to be seen of course i must take the consequences of your oversleeping yourself and if i cant manage to get you back to hollingford tonight you shall sleep with me and well do our best to send you home tomorrow morning but papa sobbed out molly he always wants me to make tea for him and i have no nightthings well dont go and make a piece of work about what cant be helped now ill lend you nightthings and your papa must do without your making tea for him tonight and another time dont oversleep yourself in a strange house you may not always find yourself among such hospitable people as they are here why now if you dont cry and make a figure of yourself ill ask if you may come in to dessert with master smythe and the little ladies you shall go into the nursery and have some tea with them and then you must come back here and brush your hair and make yourself tidy i think it is a very fine thing for you to be stopping in such a grand house as this many a little girl would like nothing better during this speech she was arranging her toilette for dinnertaking off her black morning gown putting on her dressinggown shaking her long soft auburn hair over her shoulders and glancing about the room in search of various articles of her dressa running flow of easy talk came babbling out all the time i have a little girl of my own dear i dont know what she would not give to be staying here at lord cumnors with me but instead of that she has to spend her holidays at school and yet you are looking as miserable as can be at the thought of stopping for just one night i really have been as busy as can be with those tiresomethose good ladies i mean from hollingfordand one cant think of everything at a time mollyonly child as she washad stopped her tears at the mention of that little girl of mrs kirkpatricks and now she ventured to say are you married maam i thought she called you clare in high goodhumour mrs kirkpatrick made replyi dont look as if i was married do i every one is surprised and yet i have been a widow for seven months now and not a grey hair on my head though lady cuxhaven who is younger than i has ever so many why do they call you clare continued molly finding her so affable and communicative because i lived with them when i was miss clare it is a pretty name isnt it i married a mr kirkpatrick he was only a curate poor fellow but he was of a very good family and if three of his relations had died without children i should have been a baronets wife but providence did not see fit to permit it and we must always resign ourselves to what is decreed two of his cousins married and had large families and poor dear kirkpatrick died leaving me a widow you have a little girl asked molly yes darling cynthia i wish you could see her she is my only comfort now if i have time i will show you her picture when we come up to bed but i must go now it does not do to keep lady cumnor waiting a moment and she asked me to be down early to help with some of the people in the house now i shall ring this bell and when the housemaid comes ask her to take you into the nursery and to tell lady cuxhavens nurse who you are and then youll have tea with the little ladies and come in with them to dessert there im sorry youve overslept yourself and are left here but give me a kiss and dont cryyou really are rather a pretty child though youve not got cynthias colouring oh nanny would you be so very kind as to take this young ladywhats your name my dear gibsonmiss gibson to mrs dyson in the nursery and ask her to allow her to drink tea with the young ladies there and to send her in with them to dessert ill explain it all to my lady nannys face brightened out of its gloom when she heard the name gibson and having ascertained from molly that she was the doctors child she showed more willingness to comply with mrs kirkpatricks request than was usual with her molly was an obliging girl and fond of children so as long as she was in the nursery she got on pretty well being obedient to the wishes of the supreme power and even very useful to mrs dyson by playing at tricks and thus keeping a little one quiet while its brothers and sisters were being arrayed in gay attirelace and muslin and velvet and brilliant broad ribbons now miss said mrs dyson when her own especial charge were all ready what can i do for you you have not got another frock here have you no indeed she had not nor if she had had one could it have been of a smarter nature than her present thick white dimity so she could only wash her face and hands and submit to the nurses brushing and perfuming her hair she thought she would rather have stayed in the park all night long and slept under the beautiful quiet cedar than have to undergo the unknown ordeal of going down to dessert which was evidently regarded both by children and nurses as the event of the day at length there was a summons from a footman and mrs dyson in a rustling silk gown marshalled her convoy and set sail for the diningroom door there was a large party of gentlemen and ladies sitting round the decked table in the brilliantly lighted room each dainty little child ran up to its mother or aunt or particular friend but molly had no one to go to who is that tall girl in the thick white frock not one of the children of the house i think the lady addressed put up her glass gazed at molly and dropped it in an instant a french girl i should imagine i know lady cuxhaven was inquiring for one to bring up with her little girls that they might get a good accent early poor little woman she looks wild and strange and the speaker who sate next to lord cumnor made a little sign to molly to come to her molly crept up to her as to the first shelter but when the lady began talking to her in french she blushed violently and said in a very low voice i dont understand french im only molly gibson maam molly gibson said the lady out loud as if that was not much of an explanation lord cumnor caught the words and the tone oh ho said he are you the little girl who has been sleeping in my bed he imitated the deep voice of the fabulous bear who asks this question of the little child in the story but molly had never read the three bears and fancied that his anger was real she trembled a little and drew nearer to the kind lady who had beckoned her as to a refuge lord cumnor was very fond of getting hold of what he fancied was a joke and working his idea threadbare so all the time the ladies were in the room he kept on his running fire at molly alluding to the sleeping beauty the seven sleepers and any other famous sleeper that came into his head he had no idea of the misery his jokes were to the sensitive girl who already thought herself a miserable sinner for having slept on when she ought to have been awake if molly had been in the habit of putting two and two together she might have found an excuse for herself by remembering that mrs kirkpatrick had promised faithfully to awaken her in time but all the girl thought of was how little they wanted her in this grand house how she must seem like a careless intruder who had no business there once or twice she wondered where her father was and whether he was missing her but the thought of the familiar happiness of home brought such a choking in her throat that she felt she must not give way to it for fear of bursting out crying and she had instinct enough to feel that as she was left at the towers the less trouble she gave the more she kept herself out of observation the better she followed the ladies out of the diningroom almost hoping that no one would see her but that was impossible and she immediately became the subject of conversation between the awful lady cumnor and her kind neighbour at dinner do you know i thought this young lady was french when i first saw her she has got the black hair and eyelashes and grey eyes and colourless complexion which one meets with in some parts of france and i know lady cuxhaven was trying to find a welleducated girl who would be a pleasant companion to her children no said lady cumnor looking very stern as molly thought she is the daughter of our medical man at hollingford she came with the school visitors this morning and she was overcome by the heat and fell asleep in clares room and somehow managed to oversleep herself and did not waken up till all the carriages were gone we will send her home tomorrow morning but for tonight she must stay here and clare is kind enough to say she may sleep with her there was an implied blame running through this speech that molly felt like needlepoints all over her lady cuxhaven came up at this moment her tone was as deep her manner of speaking as abrupt and authoritative as her mothers but molly felt the kinder nature underneath how are you now my dear you look better than you did under the cedartree so youre to stop here tonight clare dont you think we could find some of those books of engravings that would interest miss gibson mrs kirkpatrick came gliding up to the place where molly stood and began petting her with pretty words and actions while lady cuxhaven turned over heavy volumes in search of one that might interest the girl poor darling i saw you come into the diningroom looking so shy and i wanted you to come near me but i could not make a sign to you because lord cuxhaven was speaking to me at the time telling me about his travels ah here is a nice booklodges portraits now ill sit by you and tell you who they all are and all about them dont trouble yourself any more dear lady cuxhaven ill take charge of her pray leave her to me molly grew hotter and hotter as these last words met her ear if they would only leave her alone and not labour at being kind to her would not trouble themselves about her these words of mrs kirkpatricks seemed to quench the gratitude she was feeling to lady cuxhaven for looking for something to amuse her but of course it was a trouble and she ought never to have been there byandby mrs kirkpatrick was called away to accompany lady agnes song and then molly really had a few minutes enjoyment she could look round the room unobserved and sure never was any place out of a kings house so grand and magnificent large mirrors velvet curtains pictures in their gilded frames a multitude of dazzling lights decorated the vast saloon and the floor was studded with groups of ladies and gentlemen all dressed in gorgeous attire suddenly molly bethought her of the children whom she had accompanied into the diningroom and to whose ranks she had appeared to belongwhere were they gone to bed an hour before at some quiet signal from their mother molly wondered if she might go tooif she could ever find her way back to the haven of mrs kirkpatricks bedroom but she was at some distance from the door a long way from mrs kirkpatrick to whom she felt herself to belong more than to any one else far too from lady cuxhaven and the terrible lady cumnor and her jocose and goodnatured lord so molly sate on turning over pictures which she did not see her heart growing heavier and heavier in the desolation of all this grandeur presently a footman entered the room and after a moments looking about him he went up to mrs kirkpatrick where she sate at the piano the centre of the musical portion of the company ready to accompany any singer and smiling pleasantly as she willingly acceded to all requests she came now towards molly in her corner and said to her do you know darling your papa has come for you and brought your pony for you to ride home so i shall lose my little bedfellow for i suppose you must go go was there a question of it in mollys mind as she stood up quivering sparkling almost crying out loud she was brought to her senses though by mrs kirkpatricks next words you must go and wish lady cumnor goodnight you know my dear and thank her ladyship for her kindness to you she is there near that statue talking to mr courtenay yes she was thereforty feet awaya hundred miles away all that blank space had to be crossed and then a speech to be made must i go asked molly in the most pitiful and pleading voice possible yes make haste about it there is nothing so formidable in it is there replied mrs kirkpatrick in a sharper voice than before aware that they were wanting her at the piano and anxious to get the business in hand done as soon as possible molly stood still for a minute then looking up she said softly would you mind coming with me please no not i said mrs kirkpatrick seeing that her compliance was likely to be the most speedy way of getting through the affair so she took mollys hand and on the way in passing the group at the piano she said smiling in her pretty genteel manner our little friend here is shy and modest and wants me to accompany her to lady cumnor to wish goodnight her father has come for her and she is going away molly did not know how it was afterwards but she pulled her hand out of mrs kirkpatricks on hearing these words and going a step or two in advance came up to lady cumnor grand in purple velvet and dropping a curtsey almost after the fashion of the schoolchildren she said my lady papa is come and i am going away and my lady i wish you goodnight and thank you for your kindness your ladyships kindness i mean she said correcting herself as she remembered miss brownings particular instructions as to the etiquette to be observed to earls and countesses and their honourable progeny as they were given that morning on the road to the towers she got out of the saloon somehow she believed afterwards on thinking about it that she had never bidden goodby to lady cuxhaven or mrs kirkpatrick or all the rest of them as she irreverently styled them in her thoughts mr gibson was in the housekeepers room when molly ran in rather to the stately mrs browns discomfiture she threw her arms round her fathers neck oh papa papa papa i am so glad you have come and then she burst out crying stroking his face almost hysterically as if to make sure he was there why what a noodle you are molly did you think i was going to give up my little girl to live at the towers all the rest of her life you make as much work about my coming for you as if you thought i had make haste now and get on your bonnet mrs brown may i ask you for a shawl or a plaid or a wrap of some kind to pin about her for a petticoat he did not mention that he had come home from a long round not half an hour before a round from which he had returned dinnerless and hungry but on finding that molly had not come back from the towers he had ridden his tired horse round by miss brownings and found them in selfreproachful helpless dismay he would not wait to listen to their tearful apologies he galloped home had a fresh horse and mollys pony saddled and though betty called after him with a ridingskirt for the child when he was not ten yards from his own stabledoor he refused to turn back for it but went off as dick the stableman said muttering to himself awful mrs brown had her bottle of wine out and her plate of cake before molly came back from her long expedition to mrs kirkpatricks room pretty nigh on to a quarter of a mile off as the housekeeper informed the impatient father as he waited for his child to come down arrayed in her mornings finery with the gloss of newness worn off mr gibson was a favourite in all the towers household as family doctors generally are bringing hopes of relief at times of anxiety and distress and mrs brown who was subject to gout especially delighted in petting him whenever he would allow her she even went out into the stableyard to pin molly up in the shawl as she sate upon the roughcoated pony and hazarded the somewhat safe conjecture i daresay shell be happier at home mr gibson as they rode away once out into the park molly struck her pony and urged him on as hard as he would go mr gibson called out at last molly were coming to the rabbitholes its not safe to go at such a pace stop and as she drew rein he rode up alongside of her were getting into the shadow of the trees and its not safe riding fast here oh papa i never was so glad in all my life i felt like a lighted candle when theyre putting the extinguisher on it did you how dye know what the candle feels oh i dont know but i did and again after a pause she saidoh i am so glad to be here it is so pleasant riding here in the open free fresh air crushing out such a good smell from the dewy grass papa are you there i cant see you he rode close up alongside of her he was not sure but what she might be afraid of riding in the dark shadows so he laid his hand upon hers oh i am so glad to feel you squeezing his hand hard papa i should like to get a chain like pontos just as long as your longest round and then i could fasten us two to each end of it and when i wanted you i could pull and if you didnt want to come you could pull back again but i should know you knew i wanted you and we could never lose each other im rather lost in that plan of yours the details as you state them are a little puzzling but if i make them out rightly i am to go about the country like the donkeys on the common with a clog fastened to my hind leg i dont mind your calling me a clog if only we were fastened together but i do mind you calling me a donkey he replied i never did at least i didnt mean to but it is such a comfort to know that i may be as rude as i like is that what youve learnt from the grand company youve been keeping today i expected to find you so polite and ceremonious that i read a few chapters of sir charles grandison in order to bring myself up to concert pitch oh i do hope i shall never be a lord or a lady well to comfort you ill tell you this im sure youll never be a lord and i think the chances are a thousand to one against your ever being the other in the sense in which you mean i should lose myself every time i had to fetch my bonnet or else get tired of long passages and great staircases long before i could go out walking but youd have your ladysmaid you know do you know papa i think ladysmaids are worse than ladies i should not mind being a housekeeper so much no the jamcupboards and dessert would lie very conveniently to ones hand replied her father meditatively but mrs brown tells me that the thought of the dinners often keeps her from sleeping theres that anxiety to be taken into consideration still in every condition of life there are heavy cares and responsibilities well i suppose so said molly gravely i know betty says i wear her life out with the green stains i get in my frocks from sitting in the cherrytree and miss browning said she had fretted herself into a headache with thinking how they had left you behind im afraid youll be as bad as a bill of fare to them tonight how did it all happen goosey oh i went by myself to see the gardens they are so beautiful and i lost myself and sat down to rest under a great tree and lady cuxhaven and that mrs kirkpatrick came and mrs kirkpatrick brought me some lunch and then put me to sleep on her bedand i thought she would waken me in time and she didnt and so theyd all gone away and when they planned for me to stop till tomorrow i didnt like saying how very very much i wanted to go homebut i kept thinking how you would wonder where i was then it was rather a dismal day of pleasure goosey eh not in the morning i shall never forget the morning in that garden but i was never so unhappy in all my life as i have been all this long afternoon mr gibson thought it his duty to ride round by the towers and pay a visit of apology and thanks to the family before they left for london he found them all on the wing and no one was sufficiently at liberty to listen to his grateful civilities but mrs kirkpatrick who although she was to accompany lady cuxhaven and pay a visit to her former pupil made leisure enough to receive mr gibson on behalf of the family and assured him of her faithful remembrance of his great professional attention to her in former days in the most winning manner chapter iii molly gibsons childhood sixteen years before this time all hollingford had been disturbed to its foundations by the intelligence that mr hall the skilful doctor who had attended them all their days was going to take a partner it was no use reasoning to them on the subject so mr browning the vicar mr sheepshanks lord cumnors agent and mr hall himself the masculine reasoners of the little society left off the attempt feeling that the che sar sar would prove more silencing to the murmurs than many arguments mr hall had told his faithful patients that even with the strongest spectacles his sight was not to be depended upon and they might have found out for themselves that his hearing was very defective although on this point he obstinately adhered to his own opinion and was frequently heard to regret the carelessness of peoples communication nowadays like writing on blottingpaper all the words running into each other he would say and more than once mr hall had had attacks of a suspicious naturerheumatism he used to call them but he prescribed for himself as if they had been goutwhich had prevented his immediate attention to imperative summonses but blind and deaf and rheumatic as he might be he was still mr hall the doctor who could heal all their ailmentsunless they died meanwhileand he had no right to speak of growing old and taking a partner he went very steadily to work all the same advertising in medical journals reading testimonials sifting character and qualifications and just when the elderly maiden ladies of hollingford thought that they had convinced their contemporary that he was as young as ever he startled them by bringing his new partner mr gibson to call upon them and began slyly as these ladies said to introduce him into practice and who was this mr gibson they asked and echo might answer the question if she liked for no one else did no one ever in all his life knew anything more of his antecedents than the hollingford people might have found out the first day they saw him that he was tall grave rather handsome than otherwise thin enough to be called a very genteel figure in those days before muscular christianity had come into vogue speaking with a slight scotch accent and as one good lady observed so very trite in his conversation by which she meant sarcastic as to his birth parentage and educationthe favourite conjecture of hollingford society was that he was the illegitimate son of a scotch duke by a frenchwoman and the grounds for this conjecture were thesehe spoke with a scotch accent therefore he must be scotch he had a very genteel appearance an elegant figure and was aptso his illwishers saidto give himself airs therefore his father must have been some person of quality and that granted nothing was easier than to run this supposition up all the notes of the scale of the peeragebaronet baron viscount earl marquis duke higher they dared not go though one old lady acquainted with english history hazarded the remark that she believed that one or two of the stuartshemhad not always beenahemquite correct in theirconduct and she fancied suchahemthings ran in families but in popular opinion mr gibsons father always remained a duke nothing more then his mother must have been a frenchwoman because his hair was so black and he was so sallow and because he had been in paris all this might be true or might not nobody ever knew or found out anything more about him than what mr hall told them namely that his professional qualifications were as high as his moral character and that both were far above the average as mr hall had taken pains to ascertain before introducing him to his patients the popularity of this world is as transient as its glory as mr hall found out before the first year of his partnership was over he had plenty of leisure left to him now to nurse his gout and cherish his eyesight the younger doctor had carried the day nearly every one sent for mr gibson even at the great houseseven at the towers that greatest of all where mr hall had introduced his new partner with fear and trembling with untold anxiety as to his behaviour and the impression he might make on my lord the earl and my lady the countess mr gibson was received at the end of a twelvemonth with as much welcome respect for his professional skill as mr hall himself had ever been nayand this was a little too much for even the kind old doctors good tempermr gibson had even been invited once to dinner at the towers to dine with the great sir astley the head of the profession to be sure mr hall had been asked as well but he was laid up just then with his gout since he had had a partner the rheumatism had been allowed to develope itself and he had not been able to go poor mr hall never quite got over this mortification after it he allowed himself to become dim of sight and hard of hearing and kept pretty closely to the house during the two winters that remained of his life he sent for an orphan grandniece to keep him company in his old age he the womancontemning old bachelor became thankful for the cheerful presence of the pretty bonny mary pearson who was good and sensible and nothing more she formed a close friendship with the daughters of the vicar mr browning and mr gibson found time to become very intimate with all three hollingford speculated much on which young lady would become mrs gibson and was rather sorry when the talk about possibilities and the gossip about probabilities with regard to the handsome young surgeons marriage ended in the most natural manner in the world by his marrying his predecessors niece the two miss brownings showed no signs of going into a consumption on the occasion although their looks and manners were carefully watched on the contrary they were rather boisterously merry at the wedding and poor mrs gibson it was that died of consumption four or five years after her marriagethree years after the death of her greatuncle and when her only child molly was just three years old mr gibson did not speak much about the grief at the loss of his wife which it was supposed that he felt indeed he avoided all demonstrations of sympathy and got up hastily and left the room when miss phoebe browning first saw him after his loss and burst into an uncontrollable flood of tears which threatened to end in hysterics miss browning declared she never could forgive him for his hardheartedness on that occasion but a fortnight afterwards she came to very high words with old mrs goodenough for gasping out her doubts whether mr gibson was a man of deep feeling judging by the narrowness of his crape hatband which ought to have covered his hat whereas there was at least three inches of beaver to be seen and in spite of it all miss browning and miss phoebe considered themselves as mr gibsons most intimate friends in right of their regard for his dead wife and would fain have taken a quasimotherly interest in his little girl had she not been guarded by a watchful dragon in the shape of betty her nurse who was jealous of any interference between her and her charge and especially resentful and disagreeable towards all those ladies who by suitable age rank or propinquity she thought capable of casting sheeps eyes at master several years before the opening of this story mr gibsons position seemed settled for life both socially and professionally he was a widower and likely to remain so his domestic affections were centred on little molly but even to her in their most private moments he did not give way to much expression of his feelings his most caressing appellation for her was goosey and he took a pleasure in bewildering her infant mind with his badinage he had rather a contempt for demonstrative people arising from his medical insight into the consequences to health of uncontrolled feeling he deceived himself into believing that still his reason was lord of all because he had never fallen into the habit of expression on any other than purely intellectual subjects molly however had her own intuitions to guide her though her papa laughed at her quizzed her joked at her in a way which the miss brownings called really cruel to each other when they were quite alone molly took her little griefs and pleasures and poured them into her papas ears sooner even than into bettys that kindhearted termagant the child grew to understand her father well and the two had the most delightful intercourse togetherhalf banter half seriousness but altogether confidential friendship mr gibson kept three servants betty a cook and a girl who was supposed to be housemaid but who was under both the elder two and had a pretty life of it in consequence three servants would not have been required if it had not been mr gibsons habit as it had been mr halls before him to take two pupils as they were called in the genteel language of hollingford apprentices as they were in factbeing bound by indentures and paying a handsome premium to learn their business they lived in the house and occupied an uncomfortable ambiguous or as miss browning called it with some truth amphibious position they had their meals with mr gibson and molly and were felt to be terribly in the way mr gibson not being a man who could make conversation and hating the duty of talking under restraint yet something within him made him wince as if his duties were not rightly performed when as the cloth was drawn the two awkward lads rose up with joyful alacrity gave him a nod which was to be interpreted as a bow knocked against each other in their endeavours to get out of the diningroom quickly and then might be heard dashing along a passage which led to the surgery choking with halfsuppressed laughter yet the annoyance he felt at this dull sense of imperfectly fulfilled duties only made his sarcasms on their inefficiency or stupidity or ill manners more bitter than before beyond direct professional instruction he did not know what to do with the succession of pairs of young men whose mission seemed to be to be plagued by their master consciously and to plague him unconsciously once or twice mr gibson had declined taking a fresh pupil in the hopes of shaking himself free from the incubus but his reputation as a clever surgeon had spread so rapidly that his fees which he had thought prohibitory were willingly paid in order that the young man might make a start in life with the prestige of having been a pupil of gibson of hollingford but as molly grew to be a little girl instead of a child when she was about eight years old her father perceived the awkwardness of her having her breakfasts and dinners so often alone with the pupils without his uncertain presence to do away with this evil more than for the actual instruction she could give he engaged a respectable woman the daughter of a shopkeeper in the town who had left a destitute family to come every morning before breakfast and to stay with molly till he came home at night or if he was detained until the childs bedtime now miss eyre said he summing up his instructions the day before she entered upon her office remember this you are to make good tea for the young men and see that they have their meals comfortably andyou are fiveandthirty i think you saidtry and make them talkrationally i am afraid is beyond your or anybodys power but make them talk without stammering or giggling dont teach molly too much she must sew and read and write and do her sums but i want to keep her a child and if i find more learning desirable for her ill see about giving it to her myself after all im not sure that reading or writing is necessary many a good woman gets married with only a cross instead of her name its rather a diluting of motherwit to my fancy but however we must yield to the prejudices of society miss eyre and so you may teach the child to read miss eyre listened in silence perplexed but determined to be obedient to the directions of the doctor whose kindness she and her family had good cause to know she made strong tea she helped the young men liberally in mr gibsons absence as well as in his presence and she found the way to unloosen their tongues whenever their master was away by talking to them on trivial subjects in her pleasant homely way she taught molly to read and write but tried honestly to keep her back in every other branch of education it was only by fighting and struggling hard that bit by bit molly persuaded her father to let her have french and drawing lessons he was always afraid of her becoming too much educated though he need not have been alarmed the masters who visited such small country towns as hollingford forty years ago were no such great proficients in their arts once a week she joined a dancing class in the assemblyroom at the principal inn in the town the george and being daunted by her father in every intellectual attempt she read every book that came in her way almost with as much delight as if it had been forbidden for his station in life mr gibson had an unusually good library the medical portion of it was inaccessible to molly being kept in the surgery but every other book she had either read or tried to read her summer place of study was that seat in the cherrytree where she got the green stains on her frock that have already been mentioned as likely to wear bettys life out in spite of this hidden worm i th bud betty was to all appearance strong alert and flourishing she was the one crook in miss eyres lot who was otherwise so happy in having met with a suitable wellpaid employment just when she needed it most but betty though agreeing in theory with her master when he told her of the necessity of having a governess for his little daughter was vehemently opposed to any division of her authority and influence over the child who had been her charge her plague and her delight ever since mrs gibsons death she took up her position as censor of all miss eyres sayings and doings from the very first and did not for a moment condescend to conceal her disapprobation in her heart she could not help respecting the patience and painstaking of the good ladyfor a lady miss eyre was in the best sense of the word though in hollingford she only took rank as a shopkeepers daughter yet betty buzzed about her with the teasing pertinacity of a gnat always ready to find fault if not to bite miss eyres only defence came from the quarter whence it might least have been expectedfrom her pupil on whose fancied behalf as an oppressed little personage betty always based her attacks but very early in the day molly perceived their injustice and soon afterwards she began to respect miss eyre for her silent endurance of what evidently gave her far more pain than betty imagined mr gibson had been a friend in need to her family so miss eyre restrained her complaints sooner than annoy him and she had her reward betty would offer molly all sorts of small temptations to neglect miss eyres wishes molly steadily resisted and plodded away at her task of sewing or her difficult sum betty made cumbrous jokes at miss eyres expense molly looked up with the utmost gravity as if requesting the explanation of an unintelligible speech and there is nothing so quenching to a wag as to be asked to translate his jest into plain matteroffact english and to show wherein the point lies occasionally betty lost her temper entirely and spoke impertinently to miss eyre but when this had been done in mollys presence the girl flew out into such a violent passion of words in defence of her silent trembling governess that even betty herself was daunted though she chose to take the childs anger as a good joke and tried to persuade miss eyre herself to join in her amusement bless the child one ud think i was a hungry pussycat and she a hensparrow with her wings all fluttering and her little eyes aflame and her beak ready to peck me just because i happened to look near her nest nay child if thou likst to be stifled in a nasty close room learning things as is of no earthly good when they is learnt instead o riding on job donkins haycart its thy lookout not mine shes a little vixen isnt she smiling at miss eyre as she finished her speech but the poor governess saw no humour in the affair the comparison of molly to a hensparrow was lost upon her she was sensitive and conscientious and knew from home experience the evils of an ungovernable temper so she began to reprove molly for giving way to her passion and the child thought it hard to be blamed for what she considered her just anger against betty but after all these were the small grievances of a very happy childhood chapter iv mr gibsons neighbours illustration untitled molly grew up among these quiet people in calm monotony of life without any greater event than that which has been recordedthe being left behind at the towersuntil she was nearly seventeen she had become a visitor at the school but she had never gone again to the annual festival at the great house it was easy to find some excuse for keeping away and the recollection of that day was not a pleasant one on the whole though she often thought how much she should like to see the gardens again lady agnes was married there was only lady harriet remaining at home lord hollingford the eldest son had lost his wife and was a good deal more at the towers since he had become a widower he was a tall ungainly man considered to be as proud as his mother the countess but in fact he was only shy and slow at making commonplace speeches he did not know what to say to people whose daily habits and interests were not the same as his he would have been very thankful for a handbook of smalltalk and would have learnt off his sentences with goodhumoured diligence he often envied the fluency of his garrulous father who delighted in talking to everybody and was perfectly unconscious of the incoherence of his conversation but owing to his constitutional reserve and shyness lord hollingford was not a popular man although his kindness of heart was very great his simplicity of character extreme and his scientific acquirements considerable enough to entitle him to much reputation in the european republic of learned men in this respect hollingford was proud of him the inhabitants knew that the great grave clumsy heir to its fealty was highly esteemed for his wisdom and that he had made one or two discoveries though in what direction they were not quite sure but it was safe to point him out to strangers visiting the little town as thats lord hollingfordthe famous lord hollingford you know you must have heard of him he is so scientific if the strangers knew his name they also knew his claims to fame if they did not ten to one but they would make as if they did and so conceal not only their own ignorance but that of their companions as to the exact nature of the sources of his reputation he was left a widower with two or three boys they were at a public school so that their companionship could make the house in which he had passed his married life but little of a home to him and he consequently spent much of his time at the towers where his mother was proud of him and his father very fond but ever so little afraid of him his friends were always welcomed by lord and lady cumnor the former indeed was in the habit of welcoming everybody everywhere but it was a proof of lady cumnors real affection for her distinguished son that she allowed him to ask what she called all sorts of people to the towers all sorts of people meant really those who were distinguished for science and learning without regard to rank and it must be confessed without much regard to polished manners likewise mr hall mr gibsons predecessor had always been received with friendly condescension by my lady who had found him established as the family medical man when first she came to the towers on her marriage but she never thought of interfering with his custom of taking his meals if he needed refreshment in the housekeepers room not with the housekeeper bien entendu the comfortable clever stout and redfaced doctor would very much have preferred this even if he had had the choice given him which he never had of taking his snack as he called it with my lord and my lady in the grand diningroom of course if some great surgical gun like sir astley was brought down from london to bear on the familys health it was due to him as well as to the local medical attendant to ask mr hall to dinner in a formal and ceremonious manner on which occasions mr hall buried his chin in voluminous folds of white muslin put on his black kneebreeches with bunches of ribbon at the sides his silk stockings and buckled shoes and otherwise made himself excessively uncomfortable in his attire and went forth in state in a postchaise from the george consoling himself in the private corner of his heart for the discomfort he was enduring with the idea of how well it would sound the next day in the ears of the squires whom he was in the habit of attending yesterday at dinner the earl said or the countess remarked or i was surprised to hear when i was dining at the towers yesterday but somehow things had changed since mr gibson had become the doctor par excellence at hollingford miss brownings thought that it was because he had such an elegant figure and such a distinguished manner mrs goodenough because of his aristocratic connectionsthe son of a scotch duke my dear never mind on which side of the blanket but the fact was certain although he might frequently ask mrs brown to give him something to eat in the housekeepers roomhe had no time for all the fuss and ceremony of luncheon with my ladyhe was always welcome to the grandest circle of visitors in the house he might lunch with a duke any day that he chose given that a duke was forthcoming at the towers his accent was scotch not provincial he had not an ounce of superfluous flesh on his bones and leanness goes a great way to gentility his complexion was sallow and his hair black in those days the decade after the conclusion of the great continental war to be sallow and blackavised was of itself a distinction he was not jovial as my lord remarked with a sigh but it was my lady who endorsed the invitations sparing of his words intelligent and slightly sarcastic therefore he was perfectly presentable his scotch blood for that he was of scottish descent there could be no manner of doubt gave him just the kind of thistly dignity which made every one feel that they must treat him with respect so on that head he was assured the grandeur of being an invited guest to dinner at the towers from time to time gave him but little pleasure for many years but it was a form to be gone through in the way of his profession without any idea of social gratification but when lord hollingford returned to make the towers his home affairs were altered mr gibson really heard and learnt things that interested him seriously and that gave fresh flavour to his reading from time to time he met the leaders of the scientific world oddlooking simplehearted men very much in earnest about their own particular subjects and not having much to say on any other mr gibson found himself capable of appreciating such persons and also perceived that they valued his appreciation as it was honestly and intelligently given indeed byandby he began to send contributions of his own to the more scientific of the medical journals and thus partly in receiving partly in giving out information and accurate thought a new zest was added to his life there was not much intercourse between lord hollingford and himself the one was too silent and shy the other too busy to seek each others society with the perseverance required to do away with the social distinction of rank that prevented their frequent meetings but each was thoroughly pleased to come into contact with the other each could rely on the others respect and sympathy with a security unknown to many who call themselves friends and this was a source of happiness to both to mr gibson the most so of course for his range of intelligent and cultivated society was the smaller indeed there was no one equal to himself among the men with whom he associated and this he had felt as a depressing influence although he never recognized the cause of his depression there was mr ashton the vicar who had succeeded mr browning a thoroughly good and kindhearted man but one without an original thought in him whose habitual courtesy and indolent mind led him to agree to every opinion not palpably heterodox and to utter platitudes in the most gentlemanly manner mr gibson had once or twice amused himself by leading the vicar on in his agreeable admissions of arguments as perfectly convincing and of statements as curious but undoubted till he had planted the poor clergyman in a bog of heretical bewilderment but then mr ashtons pain and suffering at suddenly finding out into what a theological predicament he had been brought his real selfreproach at his previous admissions were so great that mr gibson lost all sense of fun and hastened back to the thirtynine articles with all the goodwill in life as the only means of soothing the vicars conscience on any other subject except that of orthodoxy mr gibson could lead him any lengths but then his ignorance on most of them prevented bland acquiescence from arriving at any results which could startle him he had some private fortune and was not married and lived the life of an indolent and refined bachelor but though he himself was no very active visitor among his poorer parishioners he was always willing to relieve their wants in the most liberal and considering his habits occasionally in the most selfdenying manner whenever mr gibson or any one else made them clearly known to him use my purse as freely as if it was your own gibson he was wont to say im such a bad one at going about and making talk to poor folki daresay i dont do enough in that waybut i am most willing to give you anything for any one you may consider in want thank you i come upon you pretty often i believe and make very little scruple about it but if youll allow me to suggest it is that you shouldnt try to make talk when you go into the cottages but just talk i dont see the difference said the vicar a little querulously but i daresay there is a difference and i have no doubt what you say is quite true i shouldnt make talk but talk and as both are equally difficult to me you must let me purchase the privilege of silence by this tenpound note thank you its not so satisfactory to me and i should think not to yourself but probably the joneses and greens will prefer it mr ashton would look with plaintive inquiry into mr gibsons face after some such speech as if asking if a sarcasm was intended on the whole they went on in the most amicable way only beyond the gregarious feeling common to most men they had very little actual pleasure in each others society perhaps the man of all others to whom mr gibson took the most kindlyat least until lord hollingford came into the neighbourhoodwas a certain squire hamley he and his ancestors had been called squire as long back as local tradition extended but there was many a greater landowner in the county for squire hamleys estate was not more than eight hundred acres or so but his family had been in possession of it long before the earls of cumnor had been heard of before the helyharrisons had bought coldstone park no one in hollingford knew the time when the hamleys had not lived at hamley ever since the heptarchy said the vicar nay said miss browning i have heard that there were hamleys of hamley before the romans the vicar was preparing a polite assent when mrs goodenough came in with a still more startling assertion i have always heerd said she with all the slow authority of an oldest inhabitant that there was hamleys of hamley afore the time of the pagans mr ashton could only bow and say possibly very possibly madam but he said it in so courteous a manner that mrs goodenough looked round in a gratified way as much as to say the church confirms my words who now will dare dispute them at any rate the hamleys were a very old family if not aborigines they had not increased their estate for centuries they had held their own if even with an effort and had not sold a rood of it for the last hundred years or so but they were not an adventurous race they never traded or speculated or tried agricultural improvements of any kind they had no capital in any bank nor what perhaps would have been more in character hoards of gold in any stocking their mode of life was simple and more like that of yeomen than squires indeed squire hamley by continuing the primitive manners and customs of his forefathers the squires of the eighteenth century did live more as a yeoman when such a class existed than as a squire of this generation there was a dignity in this quiet conservatism that gained him an immense amount of respect both from high and low and he might have visited at every house in the county had he so chosen but he was very indifferent to the charms of society and perhaps this was owing to the fact that the squire roger hamley who at present lived and reigned at hamley had not received so good an education as he ought to have done his father squire stephen had been plucked at oxford and with stubborn pride he had refused to go up again nay more he had sworn a great oath as men did in those days that none of his children to come should ever know either university by becoming a member of it he had only one child the present squire and he was brought up according to his fathers word he was sent to a petty provincial school where he saw much that he hated and then turned loose upon the estate as its heir such a bringing up did not do him all the harm that might have been anticipated he was imperfectly educated and ignorant on many points but he was aware of his deficiency and regretted it in theory he was awkward and ungainly in society and so kept out of it as much as possible and he was obstinate violenttempered and dictatorial in his own immediate circle on the other side he was generous and true as steel the very soul of honour in fact he had so much natural shrewdness that his conversation was always worth listening to although he was apt to start by assuming entirely false premises which he considered as incontrovertible as if they had been mathematically proved but given the correctness of his premises nobody could bring more natural wit and sense to bear upon the arguments based upon them he had married a delicate fine london lady it was one of those perplexing marriages of which one cannot understand the reasons yet they were very happy though possibly mrs hamley would not have sunk into the condition of a chronic invalid if her husband had cared a little more for her various tastes or allowed her the companionship of those who did after his marriage he was wont to say he had got all that was worth having out of the crowd of houses they called london it was a compliment to his wife which he repeated until the year of her death it charmed her at first it pleased her up to the last time of her hearing it but for all that she used sometimes to wish that he would recognize the fact that there might still be something worth hearing and seeing in the great city but he never went there again and though he did not prohibit her going yet he showed so little sympathy with her when she came back full of what she had done on her visit that she ceased caring to go not but what he was kind and willing in giving his consent and in furnishing her amply with money there there my little woman take that dress yourself up as fine as any on em and buy what you like for the credit of hamley of hamley and go to the park and the play and show off with the best on em i shall be glad to see thee back again i know but have thy fling while thourt about it then when she came back it was well well it has pleased thee i suppose so thats all right but the very talking about it tires me i know and i cant think how you have stood it all come out and see how pretty the flowers are looking in the south garden ive made them sow all the seeds you like and i went over to hollingford nursery to buy the cuttings of the plants you admired last year a breath of fresh air will clear my brain after listening to all this talk about the whirl of london which is like to have turned me giddy mrs hamley was a great reader and had considerable literary taste she was gentle and sentimental tender and good she gave up her visits to london she gave up her sociable pleasure in the company of her fellows in education and position her husband owing to the deficiencies of his early years disliked associating with those to whom he ought to have been an equal he was too proud to mingle with his inferiors he loved his wife all the more dearly for her sacrifices for him but deprived of all her strong interests she sank into illhealth nothing definite only she never was well perhaps if she had had a daughter it would have been better for her but her two children were boys and their father anxious to give them the advantages of which he himself had suffered the deprivation sent the lads very early to a preparatory school they were to go on to rugby and cambridge the idea of oxford was hereditarily distasteful in the hamley family osborne the eldestso called after his mothers maiden namewas full of taste and had some talent his appearance had all the grace and refinement of his mothers he was sweettempered and affectionate almost as demonstrative as a girl he did well at school carrying away many prizes and was in a word the pride and delight of both father and mother the confidential friend of the latter in default of any other roger was two years younger than osborne clumsy and heavily built like his father his face was square and the expression grave and rather immobile he was good but dull his schoolmasters said he won no prizes but brought home a favourable report of his conduct when he caressed his mother she used laughingly to allude to the fable of the lapdog and the donkey so thereafter he left off all personal demonstration of affection it was a great question as to whether he was to follow his brother to college after he left rugby mrs hamley thought it would be rather a throwing away of money as he was so little likely to distinguish himself in intellectual pursuits anything practicalsuch as a civil engineerwould be more the kind of life for him she thought that it would be too mortifying for him to go to the same college and university as his brother who was sure to distinguish himselfand to be repeatedly plucked to come away woodenspoon at last but his father persevered doggedly as was his wont in his intention of giving both his sons the same education they should both have the advantages of which he had been deprived if roger did not do well at cambridge it would be his own fault if his father did not send him thither some day or other he might be regretting the omission as the squire had done himself for many a year so roger followed his brother osborne to trinity and mrs hamley was again left alone after the year of indecision as to rogers destination which had been brought on by her urgency she had not been able for many years to walk beyond her garden the greater part of her life was spent on a sofa wheeled to the window in summer to the fireside in winter the room which she inhabited was large and pleasant four tall windows looked out upon a lawn dotted over with flowerbeds and melting away into a small wood in the centre of which there was a pond filled with waterlilies about this unseen pond in the deep shade mrs hamley had written many a pretty fourversed poem since she lay on her sofa alternately reading and composing verse she had a small table by her side on which there were the newest works of poetry and fiction a pencil and blottingbook with loose sheets of blank paper a vase of flowers always of her husbands gathering winter and summer she had a sweet fresh nosegay every day her maid brought her a draught of medicine every three hours with a glass of clear water and a biscuit her husband came to her as often as his love for the open air and his labours outofdoors permitted but the event of her day when her boys were absent was mr gibsons frequent professional visits he knew there was real secret harm going on all this time that people spoke of her as a merely fanciful invalid and that one or two accused him of humouring her fancies but he only smiled at such accusations he felt that his visits were a real pleasure and lightening of her growing and indescribable discomfort he knew that squire hamley would have been only too glad if he had come every day and he was conscious that by careful watching of her symptoms he might mitigate her bodily pain besides all these reasons he took great pleasure in the squires society mr gibson enjoyed the others unreasonableness his quaintness his strong conservatism in religion politics and morals mrs hamley tried sometimes to apologize for or to soften away opinions which she fancied were offensive to the doctor or contradictions which she thought too abrupt but at such times her husband would lay his great hand almost caressingly on mr gibsons shoulder and soothe his wifes anxiety by saying let us alone little woman we understand each other dont we doctor why bless your life he gives me better than he gets many a time only you see he sugars it over and says a sharp thing and pretends its all civility and humility but i can tell when hes giving me a pill one of mrs hamleys oftenexpressed wishes had been that molly might come and pay her a visit mr gibson always refused this request of hers though he could hardly have given his reasons for these refusals he did not want to lose the companionship of his child in fact but he put it to himself in quite a different way he thought her lessons and her regular course of employment would be interrupted the life in mrs hamleys heated and scented room would not be good for the girl osborne and roger hamley would be at home and he did not wish molly to be thrown too exclusively upon them for young society or they would not be at home and it would be rather dull and depressing for his girl to be all the day long with a nervous invalid but at length the day came when mr gibson rode over and volunteered a visit from molly an offer which mrs hamley received with the open arms of her heart as she expressed it and of which the duration was unspecified the cause for the change in mr gibsons wishes just referred to was as followsit has been mentioned that he took pupils rather against his inclination it is true but there they were a mr wynne and mr coxe the young gentlemen as they were called in the household mr gibsons young gentlemen as they were termed in the town mr wynne was the elder the more experienced one who could occasionally take his masters place and who gained experience by visiting the poor and the chronic cases mr gibson used to talk over his practice with mr wynne and try and elicit his opinions in the vain hope that some day or another mr wynne might start an original thought the young man was cautious and slow he would never do any harm by his rashness but at the same time he would always be a little behind his day still mr gibson remembered that he had had far worse young gentlemen to deal with and was content with if not thankful for such an elder pupil as mr wynne mr coxe was a boy of nineteen or so with brilliant red hair and a tolerably red face of both of which he was very conscious and much ashamed he was the son of an indian officer an old acquaintance of mr gibsons major coxe was at some unpronounceable station in the punjaub at the present time but the year before he had been in england and had repeatedly expressed his great satisfaction at having placed his only child as a pupil to his old friend and had in fact almost charged mr gibson with the guardianship as well as the instruction of his boy giving him many injunctions which he thought were special in this case but which mr gibson with a touch of annoyance assured the major were always attended to in every case with every pupil but when the poor major ventured to beg that his boy might be considered as one of the family and that he might spend his evenings in the drawingroom instead of the surgery mr gibson turned upon him with a direct refusal he must live like the others i cant have the pestle and mortar carried into the drawingroom and the place smelling of aloes must my boy make pills himself then asked the major ruefully to be sure the youngest apprentice always does its not hard work hell have the comfort of thinking he wont have to swallow them himself and hell have the run of the pomfret cakes and the conserve of hips and on sundays he shall have a taste of tamarinds to reward him for his weekly labour at pillmaking major coxe was not quite sure whether mr gibson was not laughing at him in his sleeve but things were so far arranged and the real advantages were so great that he thought it was best to take no notice but even to submit to the indignity of pillmaking he was consoled for all these rubs by mr gibsons manner at last when the supreme moment of final parting arrived the doctor did not say much but there was something of real sympathy in his manner that spoke straight to the fathers heart and an implied you have trusted me with your boy and i have accepted the trust in full in each of the few last words mr gibson knew his business and human nature too well to distinguish young coxe by any overt marks of favouritism but he could not help showing the lad occasionally that he regarded him with especial interest as the son of a friend besides this claim upon his regard there was something about the young man himself that pleased mr gibson he was rash and impulsive apt to speak hitting the nail on the head sometimes with unconscious cleverness at other times making gross and startling blunders mr gibson used to tell him that his motto would always be kill or cure and to this mr coxe once made answer that he thought it was the best motto a doctor could have for if he could not cure the patient it was surely best to get him out of his misery quietly and at once mr wynne looked up in surprise and observed that he should be afraid that such putting out of misery might be looked upon as homicide by some people mr gibson said in a dry tone that for his part he should not mind the imputation of homicide but that it would not do to make away with profitable patients in so speedy a manner and that he thought that as long as they were willing and able to pay twoandsixpence for the doctors visit it was his duty to keep them alive of course when they became paupers the case was different mr wynne pondered over this speech mr coxe only laughed at last mr wynne said but you go every morning sir before breakfast to see old nancy grant and youve ordered her this medicine sir which is about the most costly in corbyns bill have you not found out how difficult it is for men to live up to their precepts youve a great deal to learn yet mr wynne said mr gibson leaving the surgery as he spoke i never can make the governor out said mr wynne in a tone of utter despair what are you laughing at coxey oh im thinking how blest you are in having parents who have instilled moral principles into your youthful bosom youd go and be poisoning all the paupers off if you hadnt been told that murder was a crime by your mother youd be thinking you were doing as you were bid and quote old gibsons words when you came to be tried please my lord judge they were not able to pay for my visits and so i followed the rules of the profession as taught me by mr gibson the great surgeon at hollingford and poisoned the paupers i cant bear that scoffing way of his and i like it if it wasnt for the governors fun and the tamarinds and something else that i know of i would run off to india i hate stifling rooms and sick people and the smell of drugs and the stink of pills on my handsfaugh chapter v calflove one day for some reason or other mr gibson came home unexpectedly he was crossing the hall having come in by the gardendoorthe garden communicated with the stableyard where he had left his horsewhen the kitchen door opened and the girl who was underling in the establishment came quickly into the hall with a note in her hand and made as if she was taking it upstairs but on seeing her master she gave a little start and turned back as if to hide herself in the kitchen if she had not made this movement so conscious of guilt mr gibson who was anything but suspicious would never have taken any notice of her as it was he stepped quickly forwards opened the kitchen door and called out bethia so sharply that she could not delay coming forwards give me that note he said she hesitated a little its for miss molly she stammered out give it to me he repeated more quickly than before she looked as if she would cry but still she kept the note tight held behind her back he said as i was to give it into her own hands and i promised as i would faithful cook go and find miss molly tell her to come here at once he fixed bethia with his eyes it was of no use trying to escape she might have thrown it into the fire but she had not presence of mind enough she stood immovable only her eyes looked any way rather than encounter her masters steady gaze molly my dear papa i did not know you were at home said innocent wondering molly bethia keep your word here is miss molly give her the note indeed miss i couldnt help it molly took the note but before she could open it her father saidthats all my dear you neednt read it give it to me tell those who sent you bethia that all letters for miss molly must pass through my hands now be off with you goosey and go back to where you came from illustration a love letter papa i shall make you tell me who my correspondent is well see about that byandby she went a little reluctantly with ungratified curiosity upstairs to miss eyre who was still her daily companion if not her governess he turned into the empty diningroom shut the door broke the seal of the note and began to read it it was a flaming loveletter from mr coxe who professed himself unable to go on seeing her day after day without speaking to her of the passion she had inspiredan eternal passion he called it on reading which mr gibson laughed a little would she not look kindly at him would she not think of him whose only thought was of her and so on with a very proper admixture of violent compliments to her beauty she was fair not pale her eyes were loadstars her dimples marks of cupids finger c mr gibson finished reading it and began to think about it in his own mind who would have thought the lad had been so poetical but to be sure theres a shakspeare in the surgery library ill take it away and put johnsons dictionary instead one comfort is the conviction of her perfect innocenceignorance i should rather sayfor its easy to see its the first confession of his love as he calls it but its an awful worryto begin with lovers so early why shes only just seventeennot seventeen indeed till july not for six weeks yet sixteen and threequarters why shes quite a baby to be surepoor jeanie was not so old and how i did love her mrs gibsons name was mary so he must have been referring to some one else then his thoughts wandered back to other days though he still held the open note in his hand byandby his eyes fell upon it again and his mind came back to bear upon the present time ill not be hard upon him ill give him a hint hes quite sharp enough to take it poor laddie if i send him away which would be the wisest course i do believe hes got no home to go to after a little more consideration in the same strain mr gibson went and sat down at the writingtable and wrote the following formula master coxe that master will touch him to the quick said mr gibson to himself as he wrote the word rx verecundi i oz fidelitatis domestic i oz reticenti gr iij m capiat hanc dosim ter die in aqu pur r gibson ch mr gibson smiled a little sadly as he reread his words poor jeanie he said aloud and then he chose out an envelope enclosed the fervid loveletter and the above prescription sealed it with his own sharplycut sealring r g in old english letters and then paused over the address hell not like master coxe outside no need to put him to unnecessary shame so the direction on the envelope was edward coxe esq then mr gibson applied himself to the professional business which had brought him home so opportunely and unexpectedly and afterwards he went back through the garden to the stables and just as he had mounted his horse he said to the stablemanoh by the way heres a letter for mr coxe dont send it through the women take it round yourself to the surgerydoor and do it at once the slight smile upon his face as he rode out of the gates died away as soon as he found himself in the solitude of the lanes he slackened his speed and began to think it was very awkward he considered to have a motherless girl growing up into womanhood in the same house with two young men even if she only met them at mealtimes and all the intercourse they had with each other was merely the utterance of such words as may i help you to potatoes or as mr wynne would persevere in saying may i assist you to potatoesa form of speech which grated daily more and more upon mr gibsons ears yet mr coxe the offender in this affair which had just occurred had to remain for three years more as a pupil in mr gibsons family he should be the very last of the race still there were three years to be got over and if this stupid passionate calflove of his lasted what was to be done sooner or later molly would become aware of it the contingencies of the affair were so excessively disagreeable to contemplate that mr gibson determined to dismiss the subject from his mind by a good strong effort he put his horse to a gallop and found that the violent shaking over the lanespaved as they were with round stones which had been dislocated by the wear and tear of a hundred yearswas the very best thing for the spirits if not for the bones he made a long round that afternoon and came back to his home imagining that the worst was over and that mr coxe would have taken the hint conveyed in the prescription all that would be needed was to find a safe place for the unfortunate bethia who had displayed such a daring aptitude for intrigue but mr gibson reckoned without his host it was the habit of the young men to come in to tea with the family in the diningroom to swallow two cups munch their bread or toast and then disappear this night mr gibson watched their countenances furtively from under his long eyelashes while he tried against his wont to keep up a dgag manner and a brisk conversation on general subjects he saw that mr wynne was on the point of breaking out into laughter and that redhaired redfaced mr coxe was redder and fiercer than ever while his whole aspect and ways betrayed indignation and anger he will have it will he thought mr gibson to himself and he girded up his loins for the battle he did not follow molly and miss eyre into the drawingroom as he usually did he remained where he was pretending to read the newspaper while bethia her face swelled up with crying and with an aggrieved and offended aspect removed the teathings not five minutes after the room was cleared came the expected tap at the door may i speak to you sir said the invisible mr coxe from outside to be sure come in mr coxe i was rather wanting to talk to you about that bill of corbyns pray sit down it is about nothing of that kind sir that i wantedthat i wishedno thank youi would rather not sit down he accordingly stood in offended dignity it is about that letter sirthat letter with the insulting prescription sir insulting prescription i am surprised at such a word being applied to any prescription of minethough to be sure patients are sometimes offended at being told the nature of their illnesses and i daresay they may take offence at the medicines which their cases require i did not ask you to prescribe for me oh ho then you were the master coxe who sent the note through bethia let me tell you it has cost her her place and was a very silly letter into the bargain it was not the conduct of a gentleman sir to intercept it and to open it and to read words never addressed to you sir no said mr gibson with a slight twinkle in his eye and a curl on his lips not unnoticed by the indignant mr coxe i believe i was once considered tolerably goodlooking and i daresay i was as great a coxcomb as any one at twenty but i dont think that even then i should quite have believed that all those pretty compliments were addressed to myself it was not the conduct of a gentleman sir repeated mr coxe stammering over his wordshe was going on to say something more when mr gibson broke in and let me tell you young man replied mr gibson with a sudden sternness in his voice that what you have done is only excusable in consideration of your youth and extreme ignorance of what are considered the laws of domestic honour i receive you into my house as a member of my familyyou induce one of my servantscorrupting her with a bribe i have no doubt indeed sir i never gave her a penny then you ought to have done you should always pay those who do your dirty work just now sir you called it corrupting with a bribe muttered mr coxe mr gibson took no notice of this speech but went oninducing one of my servants to risk her place without offering her the slightest equivalent by begging her to convey a letter clandestinely to my daughtera mere child miss gibson sir is nearly seventeen i heard you say so only the other day said mr coxe aged twenty again mr gibson ignored the remark a letter which you were unwilling to have seen by her father who had tacitly trusted to your honour by receiving you as an inmate of his house your fathers soni know major coxe wellought to have come to me and have said out openly mr gibson i loveor i fancy that i loveyour daughter i do not think it right to conceal this from you although unable to earn a penny and with no prospect of an unassisted livelihood even for myself for several years i shall not say a word about my feelingsor fancied feelingsto the very young lady herself that is what your fathers son ought to have said if indeed a couple of grains of reticent silence wouldnt have been better still and if i had said it sirperhaps i ought to have said it said mr coxe in a hurry of anxiety what would have been your answer would you have sanctioned my passion sir i would have said most probablyi will not be certain of my exact words in a suppositional casethat you were a young fool but not a dishonourable young fool and i should have told you not to let your thoughts run upon a calflove until you had magnified it into a passion and i daresay to make up for the mortification i should have given you i might have prescribed your joining the hollingford cricket club and set you at liberty as often as i could on the saturday afternoons as it is i must write to your fathers agent in london and ask him to remove you out of my household repaying the premium of course which will enable you to start afresh in some other doctors surgery it will so grieve my father said mr coxe startled into dismay if not repentance i see no other course open it will give major coxe some trouble i shall take care that he is at no extra expense but what i think will grieve him the most is the betrayal of confidence for i trusted you edward like a son of my own there was something in mr gibsons voice when he spoke seriously especially when he referred to any feeling of his ownhe who so rarely betrayed what was passing in his heartthat was irresistible to most people the change from joking and sarcasm to tender gravity mr coxe hung his head a little and meditated i do love miss gibson said he at length who could help it mr wynne i hope said mr gibson his heart is preengaged replied mr coxe mine was free as air till i saw her would it tend to cure yourwell passion well sayif she wore blue spectacles at mealtimes i observe you dwell much on the beauty of her eyes you are ridiculing my feelings mr gibson do you forget that you yourself were young once poor jeanie rose before mr gibsons eyes and he felt a little rebuked come mr coxe let us see if we cant make a bargain said he after a minute or so of silence you have done a really wrong thing and i hope you are convinced of it in your heart or that you will be when the heat of this discussion is over and you come to think a little about it but i wont lose all respect for your fathers son if you will give me your word that as long as you remain a member of my familypupil apprentice what you willyou wont again try to disclose your passionyou see i am careful to take your view of what i should call a mere fancyby word or writing looks or acts in any manner whatever to my daughter or to talk about your feelings to any one else you shall remain here if you cannot give me your word i must follow out the course i named and write to your fathers agent mr coxe stood irresolute mr wynne knows all i feel for miss gibson sir he and i have no secrets from each other well i suppose he must represent the reeds you know the story of king midass barber who found out that his royal master had the ears of an ass beneath his hyacinthine curls so the barber in default of a mr wynne went to the reeds that grew on the shores of a neighbouring lake and whispered to them king midas has the ears of an ass but he repeated it so often that the reeds learnt the words and kept on saying them all day long till at last the secret was no secret at all if you keep on telling your tale to mr wynne are you sure he wont repeat it in his turn if i pledge my word as a gentleman sir i pledge it for mr wynne as well i suppose i must run the risk but remember how soon a young girls name may be breathed upon and sullied molly has no mother and for that very reason she ought to move among you all as unharmed as una herself mr gibson if you wish it ill swear it on the bible cried the excitable young man nonsense as if your word if its worth anything wasnt enough well shake hands upon it if you like mr coxe came forward eagerly and almost squeezed mr gibsons ring into his finger as he was leaving the room he said a little uneasily may i give bethia a crownpiece no indeed leave bethia to me i hope you wont say another word to her while shes here i shall see that she gets a respectable place when she goes away then mr gibson rang for his horse and went out on the last visits of the day he used to reckon that he rode the world around in the course of the year there were not many surgeons in the county who had so wide a range of practice as he he went to lonely cottages on the borders of great commons to farmhouses at the end of narrow country lanes that led to nowhere else and were overshadowed by the elms and beeches overhead he attended all the gentry within a circle of fifteen miles round hollingford and was the appointed doctor to the still greater families who went up to london every februaryas the fashion then wasand returned to their acres in the early weeks of july he was of necessity a great deal from home and on this soft and pleasant summer evening he felt the absence as a great evil he was startled at discovering that his little one was growing fast into a woman and already the passive object of some of the strong interests that affect a womans life and heher mother as well as her fatherso much away that he could not guard her as he would have wished the end of his cogitations was that ride to hamley the next morning when he proposed to allow his daughter to accept mrs hamleys last invitationan invitation that had been declined at the time you may quote against me the proverb he that will not when he may when he will he shall have nay and i shall have no reason to complain he had said but mrs hamley was only too much charmed with the prospect of having a young girl for a visitor one whom it would not be a trouble to entertain who might be sent out to ramble in the gardens or told to read when the invalid was too much fatigued for conversation and yet one whose youth and freshness would bring a charm like a waft of sweet summer air into her lonely shutup life nothing could be pleasanter and so mollys visit to hamley was easily settled i only wish osborne and roger had been at home said mrs hamley in her low soft voice she may find it dull being with old people like the squire and me from morning till night when can she come the darlingi am beginning to love her already mr gibson was very glad in his heart that the young men of the house were out of the way he did not want his little molly to be passing from scylla to charybdis and as he afterwards scoffed at himself for thinking he had got an idea that all young men were wolves in chase of his one ewelamb she knows nothing of the pleasure in store for her he replied and im sure i dont know what feminine preparations she may think necessary or how long they may take youll remember she is a little ignoramus and has had no training in etiquette our ways at home are rather rough for a girl im afraid but i know i could not send her into a kinder atmosphere than this when the squire heard from his wife of mr gibsons proposal he was as much pleased as she at the prospect of their youthful visitor for he was a man of a hearty hospitality when his pride did not interfere with its gratification and he was delighted to think of his sick wifes having such an agreeable companion in her hours of loneliness after a while he saidits as well the lads are at cambridge we might have been having a loveaffair if they had been at home welland if we had asked his more romantic wife it wouldnt have done said the squire decidedly osborne will have had a firstrate educationas good as any man in the countyhell have this property and hes a hamley of hamley not a family in the shire is as old as we are or settled on their ground so well osborne may marry where he likes if lord hollingford had a daughter osborne would have been as good a match as she could have required it would never do for him to fall in love with gibsons daughteri shouldnt allow it so its as well hes out of the way well perhaps osborne had better look higher perhaps i say he must the squire brought his hand down with a thump on the table near him which made his wifes heart beat hard for some minutes and as for roger he continued unconscious of the flutter he had put her into hell have to make his own way and earn his own bread and im afraid hes not getting on very brilliantly at cambridge he mustnt think of falling in love for these ten years unless he marries a fortune said mrs hamley more by way of concealing her palpitation than anything else for she was unworldly and romantic to a fault no son of mine shall ever marry a wife who is richer than himself with my good will said the squire again with emphasis but without a thump i dont say but what if roger is gaining five hundred a year by the time hes thirty he shall not choose a wife with ten thousand pounds down but i do say if a boy of mine with only two hundred a yearwhich is all roger will have from us and that not for a long timegoes and marries a woman with fifty thousand to her portion ill disown himit would be just disgusting not if they loved each other and their whole happiness depended upon their marrying each other put in mrs hamley mildly pooh away with love nay my dear we loved each other so dearly we should never have been happy with any one else but thats a different thing people arent like what they were when we were young all the love nowadays is just silly fancy and sentimental romance as far as i can see mr gibson thought that he had settled everything about mollys going to hamley before he spoke to her about it which he did not do until the morning of the day on which mrs hamley expected her then he saidby the way molly youre to go to hamley this afternoon mrs hamley wants you to go to her for a week or two and it suits me capitally that you should accept her invitation just now go to hamley this afternoon papa youve got some odd reason at the back of your headsome mystery or something please tell me what it is go to hamley for a week or two why i never was from home before this without you in all my life perhaps not i dont think you ever walked before you put your feet to the ground everything must have a beginning it has something to do with that letter that was directed to me but that you took out of my hands before i could even see the writing of the direction she fixed her grey eyes on her fathers face as if she meant to pluck out his secret he only smiled and saidyoure a witch goosey then it had but if it was a note from mrs hamley why might i not see it i have been wondering if you had some plan in your head ever since that daythursday wasnt it youve gone about in a kind of thoughtful perplexed way just like a conspirator tell me papacoming up to him and putting on a beseeching mannerwhy mightnt i see that note and why am i to go to hamley all on a sudden dont you like to go would you rather not if she had said that she did not want to go he would have been rather pleased than otherwise although it would have put him into a great perplexity but he was beginning to dread the parting from her even for so short a time however she replied directly i dont knowi daresay i shall like it when i have thought a little more about it just now im so startled by the suddenness of the affair i havent considered whether i shall like it or not i shant like going away from you i know why am i to go papa there are three old ladies sitting somewhere and thinking about you just at this very minute one has a distaff in her hands and is spinning a thread she has come to a knot in it and is puzzled what to do with it her sister has a great pair of scissors in her hands and wantsas she always does when any difficulty arises in the smoothness of the threadto cut it off short but the third who has the most head of the three plans how to undo the knot and she it is who has decided that you are to go to hamley the others are quite convinced by her arguments so as the fates have decreed that this visit is to be paid there is nothing left for you and me but to submit thats all nonsense papa and youre only making me more curious to find out this hidden reason mr gibson changed his tone and spoke gravely now there is a reason molly and one which i do not wish to give when i tell you this much i expect you to be an honourable girl and to try and not even conjecture what the reason may bemuch less endeavour to put little discoveries together till very likely you may find out what i want to conceal papa i wont even think about your reason again but then i shall have to plague you with another question ive had no new gown this year and ive outgrown all my last summer frocks ive only three that i can wear at all betty was saying only yesterday that i ought to have some more thatll do that you have got on wont it its a very pretty colour yes but papa holding it out as if she was going to dance its made of woollen and so hot and heavy and every day it will be getting warmer i wish girls could dress like boys said mr gibson with a little impatience how is a man to know when his daughter wants clothes and how is he to rig her out when he finds it out just when she needs them most and hasnt got them ah thats the question said molly in some despair cant you go to miss roses doesnt she keep readymade frocks for girls of your age miss rose i never had anything from her in my life replied molly in some surprise for miss rose was the great dressmaker and milliner of the little town and hitherto betty had made the girls frocks well but it seems people consider you as a young woman now and so i suppose you must run up milliners bills like the rest of your kind not that youre to get anything anywhere that you cant pay for down in ready money heres a tenpound note go to miss roses or miss anybodys and get what you want at once the hamley carriage is to come for you at two and anything that isnt quite ready can easily be sent by their cart on saturday when some of their people always come to market nay dont thank me i dont want to have the money spent and i dont want you to go and leave me i shall miss you i know its only hard necessity that drives me to send you avisiting and to throw away ten pounds on your clothes there go away youre a plague and i mean to leave off loving you as fast as i can papa holding up her finger as in warning youre getting mysterious again and though my honourableness is very strong i wont promise that it shall not yield to my curiosity if you go on hinting at untold secrets go away and spend your ten pounds what did i give it you for but to keep you quiet miss roses readymade resources and mollys taste combined did not arrive at a very great success she bought a lilac print because it would wash and would be cool and pleasant for the mornings and this betty could make at home before saturday and for highdays and holidaysby which was understood afternoons and sundaysmiss rose persuaded her to order a gaycoloured flimsy plaid silk which she assured her was quite the latest fashion in london and which molly thought would please her fathers scotch blood but when he saw the scrap which she had brought home as a pattern he cried out that the plaid belonged to no clan in existence and that molly ought to have known this by instinct it was too late to change it however for miss rose had promised to cut the dress out as soon as molly left her shop mr gibson had hung about the town all the morning instead of going away on his usual distant rides he passed his daughter once or twice in the street but he did not cross over when he was on the opposite sideonly gave her a look or a nod and went on his way scolding himself for his weakness in feeling so much pain at the thought of her absence for a fortnight or so and after all thought he im only where i was when she comes back at least if that foolish fellow goes on with his imaginating fancy shell have to come back some time and if he chooses to imagine himself constant theres still the devil to pay presently he began to hum the air out of the beggars opera i wonder any man alive should ever rear a daughter chapter vi a visit to the hamleys of course the news of miss gibsons approaching departure had spread through the household before the one oclock dinnertime came and mr coxes dismal countenance was a source of much inward irritation to mr gibson who kept giving the youth sharp glances of savage reproof for his melancholy face and want of appetite which he trotted out with a good deal of sad ostentation all of which was lost upon molly who was too full of her own personal concerns to have any thought or observation to spare from them excepting once or twice when she thought of the many days that must pass over before she should again sit down to dinner with her father when she named this to him after the meal was over and they were sitting together in the drawingroom waiting for the sound of the wheels of the hamley carriage he laughed and said im coming over tomorrow to see mrs hamley and i daresay i shall dine at their lunch so you wont have to wait long before youve the treat of seeing the wild beast feed then they heard the approaching carriage oh papa said molly catching at his hand i do so wish i wasnt going now that the time is come nonsense dont let us have any sentiment have you got your keys thats more to the purpose yes she had got her keys and her purse and her little box was put up on the seat by the coachman and her father handed her in the door was shut and she drove away in solitary grandeur looking back and kissing her hand to her father who stood at the gate in spite of his dislike of sentiment as long as the carriage could be seen then he turned into the surgery and found mr coxe had had his watching too and had indeed remained at the window gazing moonstruck at the empty road up which the young lady had disappeared mr gibson startled him from his reverie by a sharp almost venomous speech about some small neglect of duty a day or two before that night mr gibson insisted on passing by the bedside of a poor girl whose parents were wornout by many wakeful anxious nights succeeding to hardworking days molly cried a little but checked her tears as soon as she remembered how annoyed her father would have been at the sight of them it was very pleasant driving quickly along in the luxurious carriage through the pretty green lanes with dogroses and honeysuckles so plentiful and rathe in the hedges that she once or twice was tempted to ask the coachman to stop till she had gathered a nosegay she began to dread the end of her little journey of seven miles the only drawback to which was that her silk was not a true clantartan and a little uncertainty as to miss roses punctuality at length they came to a village straggling cottages lined the road an old church stood on a kind of green with the publichouse close by it there was a great tree with a bench all round the trunk midway between the church gates and the little inn the wooden stocks were close to the gates molly had long passed the limit of her rides but she knew this must be the village of hamley and that they must be very near to the hall they swung in at the gates of the park in a few minutes and drove up through meadowgrass ripening for hayit was no grand aristocratic deerpark thisto the old redbrick hall not three hundred yards from the highroad there had been no footman sent with the carriage but a respectable servant stood at the door even before they drew up ready to receive the expected visitor and take her into the drawingroom where his mistress lay awaiting her mrs hamley rose from her sofa to give molly a gentle welcome she kept the girls hand in hers after she had finished speaking looking into her face as if studying it and unconscious of the faint blush she called up on the otherwise colourless cheeks i think we shall be great friends said she at length i like your face and i am always guided by first impressions give me a kiss my dear it was far easier to be active than passive during this process of swearing eternal friendship and molly willingly kissed the sweet pale face held up to her i meant to have gone and fetched you myself but the heat oppresses me and i did not feel up to the exertion i hope you had a pleasant drive very said molly with shy conciseness and now i will take you to your room i have had you put close to me i thought you would like it better even though it was a smaller room than the other she rose languidly and wrapping her light shawl round her yet elegant figure led the way upstairs mollys bedroom opened out of mrs hamleys private sittingroom on the other side of which was her own bedroom she showed molly this easy means of communication and then telling her visitor she would await her in the sittingroom she closed the door and molly was left at leisure to make acquaintance with her surroundings first of all she went to the window to see what was to be seen a flowergarden right below a meadow of ripe grass just beyond changing colour in long sweeps as the soft wind blew over it great old foresttrees a little on one side and beyond them again to be seen only by standing very close to the side of the windowsill or by putting her head out if the window was open the silver shimmer of a mere about a quarter of a mile off on the opposite side to the trees and the mere the lookout was bounded by the old walls and highpeaked roofs of the extensive farmbuildings the deliciousness of the early summer silence was only broken by the song of the birds and the nearer hum of bees listening to these sounds which enhanced the exquisite sense of stillness and puzzling out objects obscured by distance or shadow molly forgot herself and was suddenly startled into a sense of the present by a sound of voices in the next roomsome servant or other speaking to mrs hamley molly hurried to unpack her box and arrange her few clothes in the pretty oldfashioned chest of drawers which was to serve her as dressingtable as well all the furniture in the room was as oldfashioned and as wellpreserved as it could be the chintz curtains were indian calico of the last centurythe colours almost washed out but the stuff itself exquisitely clean there was a little strip of bedside carpeting but the wooden flooring thus liberally displayed was of finelygrained oak so firmly joined plank to plank that no grain of dust could make its way into the interstices there were none of the luxuries of modern days no writingtable or sofa or pierglass in one corner of the walls was a bracket holding an indian jar filled with potpourri and that and the climbing honeysuckle outside the open window scented the room more exquisitely than any toilette perfumes molly laid out her white gown of last years date and size upon the bed ready for the to her new operation of dressing for dinner and having arranged her hair and dress and taken out her company worstedwork she opened the door softly and saw mrs hamley lying on the sofa shall we stay up here my dear i think it is pleasanter than down below and then i shall not have to come upstairs again at dressingtime i shall like it very much replied molly ah youve got your sewing like a good girl said mrs hamley now i dont sew much i live alone a great deal you see both my boys are at cambridge and the squire is out of doors all day longso i have almost forgotten how to sew i read a great deal do you like reading it depends upon the kind of book said molly im afraid i dont like steady reading as papa calls it but you like poetry said mrs hamley almost interrupting molly i was sure you did from your face have you read this last poem of mrs hemans shall i read it aloud to you so she began molly was not so much absorbed in listening but that she could glance round the room the character of the furniture was much the same as in her own oldfashioned of handsome material and faultlessly clean the age and the foreign appearance of it gave an aspect of comfort and picturesqueness to the whole apartment on the walls there hung some crayon sketchesportraits she thought she could make out that one of them was a likeness of mrs hamley in her beautiful youth and then she became interested in the poem and dropped her work and listened in a manner that was after mrs hamleys own heart when the reading of the poem was ended mrs hamley replied to some of mollys words of admiration by saying ah i think i must read you some of osbornes poetry some day under seal of secrecy remember but i really fancy they are almost as good as mrs hemans to be nearly as good as mrs hemans was saying as much to the young ladies of that day as saying that poetry is nearly as good as tennysons would be in this molly looked up with eager interest mr osborne hamley does your son write poetry yes i really think i may say he is a poet he is a very brilliant clever young man and he quite hopes to get a fellowship at trinity he says he is sure to be high up among the wranglers and that he expects to get one of the chancellors medals that is his likenessthe one hanging against the wall behind you molly turned round and saw one of the crayon sketchesrepresenting two boys in the most youthful kind of jackets and trousers and falling collars the elder was sitting down reading intently the younger was standing by him and evidently trying to call the attention of the reader off to some object out of doorsout of the window of the very room in which they were sitting as molly discovered when she began to recognize the articles of furniture faintly indicated in the picture i like their faces said molly i suppose it is so long ago now that i may speak of their likenesses to you as if they were somebody else may not i certainly said mrs hamley as soon as she understood what molly meant tell me just what you think of them my dear it will amuse me to compare your impressions with what they really are oh but i did not mean to guess at their characters i could not do it and it would be impertinent if i could i can only speak about their faces as i see them in the picture well tell me what you think of them the eldestthe reading boyis very beautiful but i cant quite make out his face yet because his head is down and i cant see the eyes that is the mr osborne hamley who writes poetry yes he is not quite so handsome now but he was a beautiful boy roger was never to be compared with him no he is not handsome and yet i like his face i can see his eyes they are grave and solemnlooking but all the rest of his face is rather merry than otherwise it looks too steady and sober too good a face to go tempting his brother to leave his lesson ah but it was not a lesson i remember the painter mr green once saw osborne reading some poetry while roger was trying to persuade him to come out and have a ride in the haycartthat was the motive of the picture to speak artistically roger is not much of a reader at least he doesnt care for poetry and books of romance or sentiment he is so fond of natural history and that takes him like the squire a great deal out of doors and when he is in he is always reading scientific books that bear upon his pursuits he is a good steady fellow though and gives us great satisfaction but he is not likely to have such a brilliant career as osborne molly tried to find out in the picture the characteristics of the two boys as they were now explained to her by their mother and in questions and answers about the various drawings hung round the room the time passed away until the dressingbell rang for the six oclock dinner molly was rather dismayed by the offers of the maid whom mrs hamley had sent to assist her i am afraid they expect me to be very smart she kept thinking to herself if they do theyll be disappointed thats all but i wish my plaid silk gown had been ready she looked at herself in the glass with some anxiety for the first time in her life she saw a slight lean figure promising to be tall a complexion browner than creamcoloured although in a year or two it might have that tint plentiful curly black hair tied up in a bunch behind with a rosecoloured ribbon long almondshaped soft gray eyes shaded both above and below by curling black eyelashes i dont think i am pretty thought molly as she turned away from the glass and yet im not sure she would have been sure if instead of inspecting herself with such solemnity she had smiled her own sweet merry smile and called out the gleam of her teeth and the charm of her dimples she found her way downstairs into the drawingroom in good time she could look about her and learn how to feel at home in her new quarters the room was fortyfeet long or so fitted up with yellow satin at some distant period high spindlelegged chairs and pembroketables abounded the carpet was of the same date as the curtains and was threadbare in many places and in others was covered with drugget stands of plants great jars of flowers old indian china and cabinets gave the room the pleasant aspect it certainly had and to add to it there were five high long windows on one side of the room all opening to the prettiest bit of flowergarden in the groundsor what was considered as suchbrilliantcoloured geometricallyshaped beds converging to a sundial in the midst the squire came in abruptly and in his morning dress he stood at the door as if surprised at the whiterobed stranger in possession of his hearth then suddenly remembering himself but not before molly had begun to feel very hot he said why god bless my soul id quite forgotten you youre miss gibson gibsons daughter arent you come to pay us a visit im sure im very glad to see you my dear by this time they had met in the middle of the room and he was shaking mollys hand with vehement friendliness intended to make up for his not knowing her at first i must go and dress though said he looking at his soiled gaiters madam likes it its one of her fine london ways and shes broken me into it at last very good plan though and quite right to make oneself fit for ladies society does your father dress for dinner miss gibson he did not stay to wait for her answer but hastened away to perform his toilette they dined at a small table in a great large room there were so few articles of furniture in it and the apartment itself was so vast that molly longed for the snugness of the home diningroom nay it is to be feared that before the stately dinner at hamley hall came to an end she even regretted the crowded chairs and tables the hurry of eating the quick unformal manner in which everybody seemed to finish their meal as fast as possible and to return to the work they had left she tried to think that at six oclock all the business of the day was ended and that people might linger if they chose she measured the distance from the sideboard to the table with her eye and made allowances for the men who had to carry things backwards and forwards but all the same this dinner appeared to her a wearisome business prolonged because the squire liked it for mrs hamley seemed tired out she ate even less than molly and sent for fan and smellingbottle to amuse herself with until at length the tablecloth was cleared away and the dessert was put upon a mahogany table polished like a lookingglass the squire had hitherto been too busy to talk except about the immediate concerns of the table and one or two of the greatest breaks to the usual monotony of his days a monotony in which he delighted but which sometimes became oppressive to his wife now however peeling his orange he turned to molly tomorrow youll have to do this for me miss gibson shall i ill do it today if you like sir no today i shall treat you as a visitor with all proper ceremony tomorrow i shall send you errands and call you by your christian name i shall like that said molly i was wanting to call you something less formal than miss gibson said mrs hamley my name is molly it is an oldfashioned name and i was christened mary but papa likes molly thats right keep to the good old fashions my dear well i must say i think mary is prettier than molly and quite as old a name too said mrs hamley i think it was said molly lowering her voice and dropping her eyes because mamma was mary and i was called molly while she lived ah poor thing said the squire not perceiving his wifes signs to change the subject i remember how sorry every one was when she died no one thought she was delicate she had such a fresh colour till all at once she popped off as one may say it must have been a terrible blow to your father said mrs hamley seeing that molly did not know what to answer ay ay it came so sudden so soon after they were married i thought it was nearly four years said molly and four years is soonis a short time to a couple who look to spending their lifetime together every one thought gibson would have married again hush said mrs hamley seeing in mollys eyes and change of colour how completely this was a new idea to her but the squire was not so easily stopped wellid perhaps better not have said it but its the truth they did hes not likely to marry now so one may say it out why your father is past forty isnt he fortythree i dont believe he ever thought of marrying again said molly recurring to the idea as one does to that of danger which has passed by without ones being aware of it no i dont believe he did my dear he looks to me just like a man who would be constant to the memory of his wife you must not mind what the squire says ah youd better go away if youre going to teach miss gibson such treason as that against the master of the house molly went into the drawingroom with mrs hamley but her thoughts did not change with the room she could not help dwelling on the danger which she fancied she had escaped and was astonished at her own stupidity at never having imagined such a possibility as her fathers second marriage she felt that she was answering mrs hamleys remarks in a very unsatisfactory manner there is papa with the squire she suddenly exclaimed there they were coming across the flowergarden from the stableyard her father switching his boots with his riding whip in order to make them presentable in mrs hamleys drawingroom he looked so exactly like his usual self his homeself that the seeing him in the flesh was the most efficacious way of dispelling the phantom fears of a second wedding which were beginning to harass his daughters mind and the pleasant conviction that he could not rest till he had come over to see how she was going on in her new home stole into her heart although he spoke but little to her and that little was all in a joking tone after he had gone away the squire undertook to teach her cribbage and she was happy enough now to give him all her attention he kept on prattling while they played sometimes in relation to the cards at others telling her of small occurrences which he thought might interest her so you dont know my boys even by sight i should have thought you would have done for theyre fond enough of riding into hollingford and i know roger has often enough been to borrow books from your father roger is a scientific sort of a fellow osborne is clever like his mother i shouldnt wonder if he published a book some day youre not counting right miss gibson why i could cheat you as easily as possible and so on till the butler came in with a solemn look placed a large prayerbook before his master who huddled the cards away in a hurry as if caught in an incongruous employment and then the maids and men trooped in to prayersthe windows were still open and the sounds of the solitary corncrake and the owl hooting in the trees mingled with the words spoken then to bed and so ended the day molly looked out of her chamber windowleaning on the sill and snuffing up the night odours of the honeysuckle the soft velvet darkness hid everything that was at any distance from her although she was as conscious of their presence as if she had seen them i think i shall be very happy here was in mollys thoughts as she turned away at length and began to prepare for bed before long the squires words relating to her fathers second marriage came across her and spoilt the sweet peace of her final thoughts who could he have married she asked herself miss eyre miss browning miss phoebe miss goodenough one by one each of these was rejected for sufficient reasons yet the unsatisfied question rankled in her mind and darted out of ambush to disturb her dreams mrs hamley did not come down to breakfast and molly found out with a little dismay that the squire and she were to have it by themselves on this first morning he put aside his newspapersone an old established tory journal with all the local and county news which was the most interesting to him the other the morning chronicle which he called his dose of bitters and which called out many a strong expression and tolerably pungent oath today however he was on his manners as he afterwards explained to molly and he plunged about trying to find ground for a conversation he could talk of his wife and his sons his estate and his mode of farming his tenants and the mismanagement of the last county election mollys interests were her father miss eyre her garden and pony in a fainter degree miss brownings the cumnor charity school and the new gown that was to come from miss roses into the midst of which the one great question who was it that people thought it was possible papa might marry kept popping up into her mouth like a troublesome jackinthebox for the present however the lid was snapped down upon the intruder as often as he showed his head between her teeth they were very polite to each other during the meal and it was not a little tiresome to both when it was ended the squire withdrew into his study to read the untasted newspapers it was the custom to call the room in which squire hamley kept his coats boots and gaiters his different sticks and favourite spud his gun and fishingrods the study there was a bureau in it and a threecornered armchair but no books were visible the greater part of them were kept in a large mustysmelling room in an unfrequented part of the house so unfrequented that the housemaid often neglected to open the windowshutters which looked into a part of the grounds overgrown with the luxuriant growth of shrubs indeed it was a tradition in the servants hall that in the late squires timehe who had been plucked at collegethe library windows had been boarded up to avoid paying the windowtax and when the young gentlemen were at home the housemaid without a single direction to that effect was regular in her charge of this room opened the windows and lighted fires daily and dusted the handsomelybound volumes which were really a very fair collection of the standard literature in the middle of the last century all the books that had been purchased since that time were held in small bookcases between each two of the drawingroom windows and in mrs hamleys own sittingroom upstairs those in the drawingroom were quite enough to employ molly indeed she was so deep in one of sir walter scotts novels that she jumped as if she had been shot when an hour or so after breakfast the squire came to the gravelpath outside one of the windows and called to ask her if she would like to come out of doors and go about the garden and homefields with him it must be a little dull for you my girl all by yourself with nothing but books to look at in the mornings here but you see madam has a fancy for being quiet in the mornings she told your father about it and so did i but i felt sorry for you all the same when i saw you sitting on the ground all alone in the drawingroom molly had been in the very middle of the bride of lammermoor and would gladly have stayed indoors to finish it but she felt the squires kindness all the same they went in and out of oldfashioned greenhouses over trim lawns the squire unlocked the great walled kitchengarden and went about giving directions to gardeners and all the time molly followed him like a little dog her mind quite full of ravenswood and lucy ashton presently every place near the house had been inspected and regulated and the squire was more at liberty to give his attention to his companion as they passed through the little wood that separated the gardens from the adjoining fields molly too plucked away her thoughts from the seventeenth century and somehow or other that one question which had so haunted her before came out of her lips before she was awarea literal impromptu who did people think papa would marry that timelong agosoon after mamma died she dropped her voice very soft and low as she spoke the last words the squire turned round upon her and looked at her face he knew not why it was very grave a little pale but her steady eyes almost commanded some kind of answer whew said he whistling to gain time not that he had anything definite to say for no one had ever had any reason to join mr gibsons name with any known lady it was only a loose conjecture that had been hazarded on the probabilitiesa young widower with a little girl i never heard of any onehis name was never coupled with any ladystwas only in the nature of things that he should marry again he may do it yet for aught i know and i dont think it would be a bad move either i told him so the last time but one he was here and what did he say asked breathless molly oh he only smiled and said nothing you shouldnt take up words so seriously my dear very likely he may never think of marrying again and if he did it would be a very good thing both for him and for you molly muttered something as if to herself but the squire might have heard it if he had chosen as it was he wisely turned the current of the conversation look at that he said as they suddenly came upon the mere or large pond there was a small island in the middle of the glassy water on which grew tall trees dark scotch firs in the centre silvery shimmering willows close to the waters edge we must get you punted over there some of these days im not fond of using the boat at this time of the year because the young birds are still in the nests among the reeds and waterplants but well go there are coots and grebes oh look theres a swan yes there are two pair of them here and in those trees theres both a rookery and a heronry the herons ought to be here by now for theyre off to the sea in august but ive not seen one yet stay isnt that onethat fellow on a stone with his long neck bent down looking into the water yes i think so i have never seen a heron only pictures of them they and the rooks are always at war which doesnt do for such near neighbours if both herons leave the nest they are building the rooks come and tear it to pieces and once roger showed me a long straggling fellow of a heron with a flight of rooks after him with no friendly purpose in their minds ill be bound roger knows a deal of natural history and finds out queer things sometimes hed have been off a dozen times during this walk of ours if hed been here his eyes are always wandering about and see twenty things where i only see one why ive known him bolt into a copse because he saw something fifteen yards offsome plant maybe which hed tell me was very rare though i should say id seen its marrow at every turn in the woods and if we came upon such a thing as this touching a delicate film of a cobweb upon a leaf with his stick as he spoke why he could tell you what insect or spider made it and if it lived in rotten firwood or in a cranny of good sound timber or deep down in the ground or up in the sky or anywhere its a pity they dont take honours in natural history at cambridge roger would be safe enough if they did mr osborne hamley is very clever is he not molly asked timidly oh yes osbornes a bit of a genius his mother looks for great things from osborne im rather proud of him myself hell get a trinity fellowship if they play him fair as i was saying at the magistrates meeting yesterday ive got a son who will make a noise at cambridge or im very much mistaken now isnt it a queer quip of nature continued the squire turning his honest face towards molly as if he was going to impart a new idea to her that i a hamley of hamley straight in descent from nobody knows wherethe heptarchy they saywhats the date of the heptarchy i dont know said molly startled at being thus appealed to well it was some time before king alfred because he was the king of all england you know but as i was saying here am i of as good and as old a descent as any man in england and i doubt if a stranger to look at me would take me for a gentleman with my red face great hands and feet and thick figure fourteen stone and never less than twelve even when i was a young man and theres osborne who takes after his mother who couldnt tell her greatgrandfather from adam bless her and osborne has a girls delicate face and a slight make and hands and feet as small as a ladys he takes after madams side who as i said cant tell who was her grandfather now roger is like me a hamley of hamley and no one who sees him in the street will ever think that redbrown bigboned clumsy chap is of gentle blood yet all those cumnor people you make such ado of in hollingford are mere muck of yesterday i was talking to madam the other day about osbornes marrying a daughter of lord hollingfordsthats to say if he had a daughterhes only got boys as it happens but im not sure if i should consent to it i really am not sure for you see osborne will have had a firstrate education and his family dates from the heptarchy while i should be glad to know where the cumnor folk were in the time of queen anne he walked on pondering the question of whether he could have given his consent to this impossible marriage and after some time and when molly had quite forgotten the subject to which he alluded he broke out withno im sure i should have looked higher so perhaps its as well my lord hollingford has only boys after a while he thanked molly for her companionship with oldfashioned courtesy and told her that he thought by this time madam would be up and dressed and glad to have her young visitor with her he pointed out the deep purple house with its stone facings as it was seen at some distance between the trees and watched her protectingly on her way along the fieldpaths thats a nice girl of gibsons quoth he to himself but what a tight hold the wench got of the notion of his marrying again one had need be on ones guard as to what one says before her to think of her never having thought of the chance of a stepmother to be sure a stepmother to a girl is a different thing to a second wife to a man chapter vii foreshadows of love perils illustration untitled if squire hamley had been unable to tell molly who had ever been thought of as her fathers second wife fate was all this time preparing an answer of a pretty positive kind to her wondering curiosity but fate is a cunning hussy and builds up her plans as imperceptibly as a bird builds her nest and with much the same kind of unconsidered trifles the first trifle of an event was the disturbance which jenny mr gibsons cook chose to make at bethias being dismissed bethia was a distant relation and protge of jennys and she chose to say it was mr coxe the tempter who ought to have been sent packing not bethia the tempted the victim in this view there was quite enough plausibility to make mr gibson feel that he had been rather unjust he had however taken care to provide bethia with another situation to the full as good as that which she held in his family jenny nevertheless chose to give warning and though mr gibson knew full well from former experience that her warnings were words not deeds he hated the discomfort the uncertaintythe entire disagreeableness of meeting a woman at any time in his house who wore a grievance and an injury upon her face as legibly as jenny took care to do down into the middle of this small domestic trouble came another and one of greater consequence miss eyre had gone with her old mother and her orphan nephews and nieces to the seaside during mollys absence which was only intended at first to last for a fortnight after about ten days of this time had elapsed mr gibson received a beautifully written beautifully worded admirably folded and most neatly sealed letter from miss eyre her eldest nephew had fallen ill of scarlet fever and there was every probability that the younger children would be attacked by the same complaint it was distressing enough for poor miss eyrethis additional expense this anxietythe long detention from home which the illness involved but she said not a word of any inconvenience to herself she only apologized with humble sincerity for her inability to return at the appointed time to her charge in mr gibsons family meekly adding that perhaps it was as well for molly had never had the scarlet fever and even if miss eyre had been able to leave the orphan children to return to her employments it might not have been a safe or a prudent step to be sure not said mr gibson tearing the letter in two and throwing it into the hearth where he soon saw it burnt to ashes i wish id a fivepound house and not a woman within ten miles of me i might have some peace then apparently he forgot mr coxes powers of making mischief but indeed he might have traced that evil back to the unconscious molly the martyrcooks entrance to take away the breakfast things which she announced by a heavy sigh roused mr gibson from thought to action molly must stay a little longer at hamley he resolved theyve often asked for her and now theyll have enough of her i think but i cant have her back here just yet and so the best i can do for her is to leave her where she is mrs hamley seems very fond of her and the child is looking happy and stronger in health ill ride round by hamley today at any rate and see how the land lies he found mrs hamley lying on a sofa placed under the shadow of the great cedartree on the lawn molly was flitting about her gardening away under her directions tying up the long seagreen stalks of bright budded carnations snipping off dead roses oh heres papa she cried out joyfully as he rode up to the white paling which separated the trim lawn and trimmer flowergarden from the rough parklike ground in front of the house come income herethrough the drawingroom window said mrs hamley raising herself on her elbow weve got a rosetree to show you that molly has budded all by herself we are both so proud of it so mr gibson rode round to the stables left his horse there and made his way through the house to the openair summerparlour under the cedartree where there were chairs table books and tangled work somehow he rather disliked asking for molly to prolong her visit so he determined to swallow his bitter first and then take the pleasure of the delicious day the sweet repose the murmurous scented air molly stood by him her hand on his shoulder he sate opposite to mrs hamley ive come here today to ask a favour he began granted before you name it am not i a bold woman he smiled and bowed but went straight on with his speech miss eyre who has been mollys governess i suppose i must call herfor many years writes today to say that one of the little nephews she took with her to newport while molly was staying here has caught the scarlet fever i guess your request i make it before you do i beg for dear little molly to stay on here of course miss eyre cant come back to you and of course molly must stay here thank you thank you very much that was my request mollys hand stole down to his and nestled in that firm compact grasp papamrs hamleyi know youll both understand mebut maynt i go home i am very happy here butoh papa i think i should like to be at home with you best an uncomfortable suspicion flashed across his mind he pulled her round and looked straight and piercingly into her innocent face her colour came at his unwonted scrutiny but her sweet eyes were filled with wonder rather than with any feeling which he dreaded to find for an instant he had doubted whether young redheaded mr coxes love might not have called out a response in his daughters breast but he was quite clear now molly youre rude to begin with i dont know how youre to make your peace with mrs hamley im sure and in the next place do you think youre wiser than i am or that i dont want you at home if all other things were conformable stay where you are and be thankful molly knew him well enough to be certain that the prolongation of her visit at hamley was quite a decided affair in his mind and then she was smitten with a sense of ingratitude she left her father and went to mrs hamley and bent over her and kissed her but she did not speak mrs hamley took hold of her hand and made room on the sofa for her i was going to have asked for a longer visit the next time you came mr gibson we are such happy friends are not we molly and now that this good little nephew of miss eyres i wish he was whipped said mr gibson has given us such a capital reason i shall keep molly for a real long visitation you must come over and see us very often theres a room here for you always you know and i dont see why you should not start on your rounds from hamley every morning just as well as from hollingford thank you if you hadnt been so kind to my little girl i might be tempted to say something rude in answer to your last speech pray say it you wont be easy till you have given it out i know mrs hamley has found out from whom i get my rudeness said molly triumphantly its an hereditary quality i was going to say that proposal of yours that i should sleep at hamley was just like a womans ideaall kindness and no common sense how in the world would my patients find me out seven miles from my accustomed place theyd be sure to send for some other doctor and i should be ruined in a month couldnt they send on here a messenger costs very little fancy old goody henbury struggling up to my surgery groaning at every step and then being told to just step on seven miles farther or take the other end of societyi dont think my lady cumnors smart groom would thank me for having to ride on to hamley every time his mistress wants me well well i submit i am a woman molly thou art a woman go and order some strawberries and cream for this father of yours such humble offices fall within the province of women strawberries and cream are all kindness and no common sense for theyll give him a horrid fit of indigestion please speak for yourself mrs hamley said molly merrily i ateoh such a great basketful yesterday and the squire went himself to the dairy and brought out a great bowl of cream when he found me at my busy work and im as well as ever i was today and never had a touch of indigestion near me shes a good girl said her father when she had danced out of hearing the words were not quite an inquiry he was so certain of his answer there was a mixture of tenderness and trust in his eyes as he awaited the reply which came in a moment shes a darling i cannot tell you how fond the squire and i are of her both of us i am so delighted to think she isnt to go away for a long time the first thing i thought of this morning when i wakened up was that she would soon have to return to you unless i could persuade you into leaving her with me a little longer and now she must stayoh two months at least it was quite true that the squire had become very fond of molly the charm of having a young girl dancing and singing inarticulate ditties about the house and garden was indescribable in its novelty to him and then molly was so willing and so wise ready both to talk and to listen at the right times mrs hamley was quite right in speaking of her husbands fondness for molly but either she herself chose a wrong time for telling him of the prolongation of the girls visit or one of the fits of temper to which he was liable but which he generally strove to check in the presence of his wife was upon him at any rate he received the news in anything but a gracious frame of mind stay longer did gibson ask for it yes i dont see what else is to become of her miss eyre away and all its a very awkward position for a motherless girl like her to be at the head of a household with two young men in it thats gibsons lookout he should have thought of it before taking pupils or apprentices or whatever he calls them my dear squire why i thought youd be as glad as i wasas i am to keep molly i asked her to stay for an indefinite time two months at least and to be in the house with osborne roger too will be at home by the cloud in the squires eyes mrs hamley read his mind oh shes not at all the sort of girl young men of their age would take to we like her because we see what she really is but lads of one or two and twenty want all the accessories of a young woman want what growled the squire such things as becoming dress style of manner they would not at their age even see that she is pretty their ideas of beauty would include colour i suppose all thats very clever but i dont understand it all i know is that its a very dangerous thing to shut two young men of one and three and twenty up in a countryhouse like this with a girl of seventeenchoose what her gowns may be like or her hair or her eyes and i told you particularly i didnt want osborne or either of them indeed to be falling in love with her im very much annoyed mrs hamleys face fell she became a little pale shall we make arrangements for their stopping away while she is here staying up at cambridge or reading with some one going abroad for a month or two no youve been reckoning this ever so long on their coming home ive seen the marks of the weeks on your almanack id sooner speak to gibson and tell him he must take his daughter away for its not convenient to us my dear roger i beg you will do no such thing it will be so unkind it will give the lie to all i said yesterday dont please do that for my sake dont speak to mr gibson well well dont put yourself in a flutter for he was afraid of her becoming hysterical ill speak to osborne when he comes home and tell him how much i should dislike anything of the kind and roger is always far too full of his natural history and comparative anatomy and messes of that sort to be thinking of falling in love with venus herself he has not the sentiment and imagination of osborne ah you dont know you never can be sure about a young man but with roger it wouldnt so much signify he would know he couldnt marry for years to come all that afternoon the squire tried to steer clear of molly to whom he felt himself to have been an inhospitable traitor but she was so perfectly unconscious of his shyness of her and so merry and sweet in her behaviour as a welcome guest never distrusting him for a moment however gruff he might be that by the next morning she had completely won him round and they were quite on the old terms again at breakfast this very morning a letter was passed from the squire to his wife and back again without a word as to its contents but fortunate yes very little did molly apply these expressions to the piece of news mrs hamley told her in the course of the day namely that her son osborne had received an invitation to stay with a friend in the neighbourhood of cambridge and perhaps to make a tour on the continent with him subsequently and that consequently he would not accompany his brother when roger came home molly was very sympathetic oh dear i am so sorry mrs hamley was thankful her husband was not present molly spoke the words so heartily you have been thinking so long of his coming home i am afraid it is a great disappointment mrs hamley smiledrelieved yes it is a disappointment certainly but we must think of osbornes pleasure and with his poetical mind he will write us such delightful travelling letters poor fellow he must be going into the examination today both his father and i feel sure though that he will be a high wrangler onlyi should like to have seen him my own dear boy but it is best as it is molly was a little puzzled by this speech but soon put it out of her head it was a disappointment to her too that she should not see this beautiful brilliant young man his mothers hero from time to time her maiden fancy had dwelt upon what he would be like how the lovely boy of the picture in mrs hamleys dressingroom would have changed in the ten years that had elapsed since the likeness was taken if he would read poetry aloud if he would even read his own poetry however in the neverending feminine business of the day she soon forgot her own disappointment it only came back to her on first wakening the next morning as a vague something that was not quite so pleasant as she had anticipated and then was banished as a subject of regret her days at hamley were well filled up with the small duties that would have belonged to a daughter of the house had there been one she made breakfast for the lonely squire and would willingly have carried up madams but that daily piece of work belonged to the squire and was jealously guarded by him she read the smaller print of the newspapers aloud to him city articles money and corn markets included she strolled about the gardens with him gathering fresh flowers meanwhile to deck the drawingroom against mrs hamley should come down she was her companion when she took her drives in the close carriage they read poetry and mild literature together in mrs hamleys sittingroom upstairs she was quite clever at cribbage now and could beat the squire if she took pains besides these things there were her own independent ways of employing herself she used to try to practise an hour daily on the old grand piano in the solitary drawingroom because she had promised miss eyre she would do so and she had found her way into the library and used to undo the heavy bars of the shutters if the housemaid had forgotten this duty and mount the ladder sitting on the steps for an hour at a time deep in some book of the old english classics the summer days were very short to this happy girl of seventeen chapter viii drifting into danger on thursday the quiet country household was stirred through all its fibres with the thought of rogers coming home mrs hamley had not seemed quite so well or quite in such good spirits for two or three days before and the squire himself had appeared to be put out without any visible cause they had not chosen to tell molly that osbornes name had only appeared very low down in the mathematical tripos so all that their visitor knew was that something was out of tune and she hoped that rogers coming home would set it to rights for it was beyond the power of her small cares and wiles on thursday the housemaid apologized to her for some slight negligence in her bedroom by saying she had been busy scouring mr rogers rooms not but what they were as clean as could be beforehand but mistress would always have the young gentlemens rooms cleaned afresh before they came home if it had been mr osborne the whole house would have had to be done but to be sure he was the eldest son so it was but likely molly was amused at this testimony to the rights of heirship but somehow she herself had fallen into the family manner of thinking that nothing was too great or too good for the eldest son in his fathers eyes osborne was the representative of the ancient house of hamley of hamley the future owner of the land which had been theirs for a thousand years his mother clung to him because they two were cast in the same mould both physically and mentallybecause he bore her maiden name she had indoctrinated molly with her faith and in spite of her amusement at the housemaids speech the girl visitor would have been as anxious as any one to show her feudal loyalty to the heir if indeed it had been he that was coming after luncheon mrs hamley went to rest in preparation for rogers return and molly also retired to her own room feeling that it would be better for her to remain there until dinnertime and so to leave the father and mother to receive their boy in privacy she took a book of ms poems with her they were all of osborne hamleys composition and his mother had read some of them aloud to her young visitor more than once molly had asked permission to copy one or two of those which were her greatest favourites and this quiet summer afternoon she took this copying for her employment sitting at the pleasant open window and losing herself in dreamy outlooks into the gardens and woods quivering in the noontide heat the house was so still in its silence it might have been the moated grange the booming buzz of the blue flies in the great staircase window seemed the loudest noise indoors and there was scarcely a sound outofdoors but the humming of bees in the flowerbeds below the window distant voices from the faraway fields where they were making haythe scent of which came in sudden wafts distinct from that of the nearer roses and honeysucklesthese merry piping voices just made molly feel the depth of the present silence she had left off copying her hand weary with the unusual exertion of so much writing and she was lazily trying to learn one or two of the poems off by heart i asked of the wind but answer made it none save its accustomed sad and solitary moan she kept saying to herself losing her sense of whatever meaning the words had ever had in the repetition which had become mechanical suddenly there was the snap of a shutting gate wheels crackling on the dry gravel horses feet on the drive a loud cheerful voice in the house coming up through the open windows the hall the passages the staircase with unwonted fulness and roundness of tone the entrancehall downstairs was paved with diamonds of black and white marble the low wide staircase that went in short flights around the hall till you could look down upon the marble floor from the top story of the house was uncarpeteduncovered the squire was too proud of his beautifullyjoined oaken flooring to cover this staircase up unnecessarily not to say a word of the usual state of want of ready money to expend upon the decorations of his house so through the undraperied hollow square of the hall and staircase every sound ascended clear and distinct and molly heard the squires glad hallo here he is and madams softer more plaintive voice and then the loud full strange tone which she knew must be rogers then there was an opening and shutting of doors and only a distant buzz of talking molly began again i asked of the wind but answer made it none and this time she had nearly finished learning the poem when she heard mrs hamley come hastily into her sittingroom that adjoined mollys bedroom and burst out into an irrepressible halfhysterical fit of sobbing molly was too young to have any complication of motives which should prevent her going at once to try and give what comfort she could in an instant she was kneeling at mrs hamleys feet holding the poor ladys hands kissing them murmuring soft words which all unmeaning as they were of aught but sympathy with the untold grief did mrs hamley good she checked herself smiling sadly at molly through the midst of her thickcoming sobs its only osborne said she at last roger has been telling us about him what about him asked molly eagerly i knew on monday we had a letterhe said he had not done so well as we had hopedas he had hoped himself poor fellow he said he had just passed but was only low down among the junior optimes and not where he had expected and had led us to expect but the squire has never been at college and does not understand college terms and he has been asking roger all about it and roger has been telling him and it has made him so angry but the squire hates college slanghe has never been there you know and he thought poor osborne was taking it too lightly and he has been asking roger about it and roger there was a fresh fit of the sobbing crying molly burst outi dont think mr roger should have told he had no need to begin so soon about his brothers failure why he hasnt been in the house an hour hush hush love said mrs hamley roger is so good you dont understand the squire would begin and ask questions before roger had tasted foodas soon as ever we had got into the diningroom and all he saidto me at any ratewas that osborne was nervous and that if he could only have gone in for the chancellors medals he would have carried all before him but roger said that after failing like this he is not very likely to get a fellowship which the squire had placed his hopes on osborne himself seemed so sure of it that the squire cant understand it and is seriously angry and growing more so the more he talks about it he has kept it in two or three days and that never suits him he is always better when he is angry about a thing at once and doesnt let it smoulder in his mind poor poor osborne i did wish he had been coming straight home instead of going to these friends of his i thought i could have comforted him but now im glad for it will be better to let his fathers anger cool first so talking out what was in her heart mrs hamley became more composed and at length she dismissed molly to dress for dinner with a kiss saying youre a real blessing to mothers child you give one such pleasant sympathy both in ones gladness and in ones sorrow in ones pride for i was so proud last week so confident and in ones disappointment and now your being a fourth at dinner will keep us off that sore subject there are times when a stranger in the household is a wonderful help molly thought over all that she had heard as she was dressing and putting on the terrible oversmart plaid gown in honour of the new arrival her unconscious fealty to osborne was not in the least shaken by his having come to grief at cambridge only she was indignantwith or without reasonagainst roger who seemed to have brought the reality of bad news as an offering of firstfruits on his return home she went down into the drawingroom with anything but a welcome to him in her heart he was standing by his mother the squire had not yet made his appearance molly thought that the two were hand in hand when she first opened the door but she could not be quite sure mrs hamley came a little forwards to meet her and introduced her in so fondly intimate a way to her son that molly innocent and simple knowing nothing but hollingford manners which were anything but formal half put out her hand to shake hands with one of whom she had heard so muchthe son of such kind friends she could only hope he had not seen the movement for he made no attempt to respond to it only bowed he was a tall powerfullymade young man giving the impression of strength more than elegance his face was rather square ruddycoloured as his father had said hair and eyes brownthe latter rather deepset beneath his thick eyebrows and he had a trick of wrinkling up his eyelids when he wanted particularly to observe anything which made his eyes look even smaller still at such times he had a large mouth with excessively mobile lips and another trick of his was that when he was amused at anything he resisted the impulse to laugh by a droll manner of twitching and puckering up his mouth till at length the sense of humour had its way and his features relaxed and he broke into a broad sunny smile his beautiful teethhis only beautiful featurebreaking out with a white gleam upon the redbrown countenance these two tricks of hisof crumpling up the eyelids so as to concentrate the power of sight which made him look stern and thoughtful and the odd twitching of the lips that was preliminary to a smile which made him look intensely merrygave the varying expressions of his face a greater range from grave to gay from lively to severe than is common with most men to molly who was not finely discriminative in her glances at the stranger this first night he simply appeared heavylooking clumsy and a person she was sure she should never get on with he certainly did not seem to care much what impression he made upon his mothers visitor he was at that age when young men admire a formed beauty more than a face with any amount of future capability of loveliness and when they are morbidly conscious of the difficulty of finding subjects of conversation in talking to girls in a state of feminine hobbledehoyhood besides his thoughts were full of other subjects which he did not intend to allow to ooze out in words yet he wanted to prevent any of that heavy silence which he feared might be impendingwith an angry and displeased father and a timorous and distressed mother he only looked upon molly as a badlydressed and rather awkward girl with black hair and an intelligent face who might help him in the task he had set himself of keeping up a bright general conversation during the rest of the evening might help himif she would but she would not she thought him unfeeling in his talkativeness his constant flow of words upon indifferent subjects was a wonder and a repulsion to her how could he go on so cheerfully while his mother sat there scarcely eating anything and doing her best with illsuccess to swallow down the tears that would keep rising to her eyes when his fathers heavy brow was deeply clouded and he evidently cared nothingat first at leastfor all the chatter his son poured forth had mr roger hamley no sympathy in him she would show that she had some at any rate so she quite declined the part which he had hoped she would have taken of respondent and possible questioner and his work became more and more like that of a man walking in a quagmire once the squire roused himself to speak to the butler he felt the need of outward stimulusof a better vintage than usual bring up a bottle of the burgundy with the yellow seal he spoke low he had no spirit to speak in his usual voice the butler answered in the same tone molly sitting near them and silent herself heard what they said if you please sir there are not above six bottles of that seal left and it is mr osbornes favourite wine the squire turned round with a growl in his voice bring up a bottle of the burgundy with the yellow seal as i said the butler went away wondering mr osbornes likes and dislikes had been the law of the house in general until now if he had liked any particular food or drink any seat or place any special degree of warmth or coolness his wishes were to be attended to for he was the heir and he was delicate and he was the clever one of the family all the outofdoors men would have said the same mr osborne wished a tree cut down or kept standing or had suchandsuch a fancy about the game or desired something unusual about the horses and they had all to attend to it as if it were law but today the burgundy with the yellow seal was to be brought and it was brought molly testified with quiet vehemence of action she never took wine so she need not have been afraid of the mans pouring it into her glass but as an open mark of fealty to the absent osborne however little it might be understood she placed the palm of her small brown hand over the top of the glass and held it there till the wine had gone round and roger and his father were in full enjoyment of it after dinner too the gentlemen lingered long over their dessert and molly heard them laughing and then she saw them loitering about in the twilight outofdoors roger hatless his hands in his pockets lounging by his fathers side who was now able to talk in his usual loud and cheerful way forgetting osborne v victis illustration v victis and so in mute opposition on mollys side in polite indifference scarcely verging upon kindliness on his roger and she steered clear of each other he had many occupations in which he needed no companionship even if she had been qualified to give it the worst was that she found he was in the habit of occupying the library her favourite retreat in the mornings before mrs hamley came down she opened the halfclosed door a day or two after his return home and found him busy among books and papers with which the large leathercovered table was strewn and she softly withdrew before he could turn his head and see her so as to distinguish her from one of the housemaids he rode out every day sometimes with his father about the outlying fields sometimes far away for a good gallop molly would have enjoyed accompanying him on these occasions for she was very fond of riding and there had been some talk of sending for her habit and grey pony when first she came to hamley only the squire after some consideration had said he so rarely did more than go slowly from one field to another where his labourers were at work that he feared she would find such slow workten minutes riding through heavy land twenty minutes sitting still on horseback listening to the directions he should have to give to his menrather dull now when if she had had her pony here she might have ridden out with roger without giving him any troubleshe would have taken care of thatnobody seemed to think of renewing the proposal altogether it was pleasanter before he came home her father rode over pretty frequently sometimes there were long unaccountable absences it was true when his daughter began to fidget after him and to wonder what had become of him but when he made his appearance he had always good reasons to give and the right she felt that she had to his familiar household tenderness the power she possessed of fully understanding the exact value of both his words and his silence made these glimpses of intercourse with him inexpressibly charming latterly her burden had always been when may i come home papa it was not that she was unhappy or uncomfortable she was passionately fond of mrs hamley she was a favourite of the squires and could not as yet fully understand why some people were so much afraid of him and as for roger if he did not add to her pleasure he scarcely took away from it but she wanted to be at home once more the reason why she could not tell but this she knew full well mr gibson reasoned with her till she was weary of being completely convinced that it was right and necessary for her to stay where she was and then with an effort she stopped the cry upon her tongue for she saw that its repetition harassed her father during this absence of hers mr gibson was drifting into matrimony he was partly aware of whither he was going and partly it was like the soft floating movement of a dream he was more passive than active in the affair though if his reason had not fully approved of the step he was tending toif he had not believed that a second marriage was the very best way of cutting the gordian knot of domestic difficulties he could have made an effort without any great trouble and extricated himself without pain from the mesh of circumstances it happened in this mannerlady cumnor having married her two eldest daughters found her labours as a chaperone to lady harriet the youngest considerably lightened by cooperation and at length she had leisure to be an invalid she was however too energetic to allow herself this indulgence constantly only she permitted herself to break down occasionally after a long course of dinners late hours and london atmosphere and then leaving lady harriet with either lady cuxhaven or lady agnes manners she betook herself to the comparative quiet of the towers where she found occupation in doing her benevolence which was sadly neglected in the hurlyburly of london this particular summer she had broken down earlier than usual and longed for the repose of the country she believed that her state of health too was more serious than previously but she did not say a word of this to her husband or daughters reserving her confidence for mr gibsons ears she did not wish to take lady harriet away from the gaieties of town which she was thoroughly enjoying by any complaint of hers which might after all be illfounded and yet she did not quite like being without a companion in the three weeks or a month that might intervene before her family would join her at the towers especially as the annual festivity to the school visitors was impending and both the school and the visit of the ladies connected with it had rather lost the zest of novelty thursday the th harriet said lady cumnor meditatively what do you say to coming down to the towers on the th and helping me over that long day you could stay in the country till monday and have a few days rest and good air you would return a great deal fresher to the remainder of your gaieties your father would bring you down i know indeed he is coming naturally oh mamma said lady harriet the youngest daughter of the housethe prettiest the most indulged i cannot go theres the waterparty up to maidenhead on the th i should be so sorry to miss it and mrs duncans ball and grisis concert please dont want me besides i should do no good i cant make provincial smalltalk im not up in the local politics of hollingford i should be making mischief i know i should very well my dear said lady cumnor sighing i had forgotten the maidenhead waterparty or i would not have asked you what a pity it isnt the eton holidays so that you could have had hollingfords boys to help you to do the honours mamma they are such affable little prigs it was the greatest fun to watch them last year at sir edwards doing the honours of their grandfathers house to much such a collection of humble admirers as you get together at the towers i shall never forget seeing edgar gravely squiring about an old lady in a portentous black bonnet and giving her information in the correctest grammar possible well i like those lads said lady cuxhaven they are on the way to become true gentlemen but mamma why shouldnt you have clare to stay with you you like her and she is just the person to save you the troubles of hospitality to the hollingford people and we should all be so much more comfortable if we knew you had her with you yes clare would do very well said lady cumnor but isnt it her schooltime or something we must not interfere with her school so as to injure her for i am afraid she is not doing too well as it is and she has been so very unlucky ever since she left usfirst her husband died and then she lost lady davies situation and then mrs maudes and now mr preston told your father it was all she could do to pay her way in ashcombe though lord cumnor lets her have the house rentfree i cant think how it is said lady harriet shes not very wise certainly but she is so useful and agreeable and has such pleasant manners i should have thought any one who wasnt particular about education would have been charmed to keep her as a governess what do you mean by not being particular about education most people who keep governesses for their children are supposed to be particular said lady cuxhaven well they think themselves so ive no doubt but i call you particular mary and i dont think mamma was but she thought herself so im sure i cant think what you mean harriet said lady cumnor a good deal annoyed at this speech of her clever heedless youngest daughter oh dear mamma you did everything you could think of for us but you see youd ever so many other engrossing interests and mary hardly ever allows her love for her husband to interfere with her allabsorbing care for the children you gave us the best of masters in every department and clare to dragonize and keep us up to our preparation for them as well as ever she could but then you know or rather you didnt know some of the masters admired our very pretty governess and there was a kind of respectable veiled flirtation going on which never came to anything to be sure and then you were often so overwhelmed with your business as a great ladyfashionable and benevolent and all that sort of thingthat you used to call clare away from us at the most critical times of our lessons to write your notes or add up your accounts and the consequence is that im about the most illinformed girl in london only mary was so capitally trained by good awkward miss benson that she is always full to overflowing with accurate knowledge and her glory is reflected upon me do you think what harriet says is true mary asked lady cumnor rather anxiously i was so little with clare in the schoolroom i used to read french with her she had a beautiful accent i remember both agnes and harriet were very fond of her i used to be jealous for miss bensons sake and perhaps lady cuxhaven paused a minutethat made me fancy that she had a way of flattering and indulging themnot quite conscientious i used to think but girls are severe judges and certainly she had had an anxious enough lifetime i am always so glad when we can have her and give her a little pleasure the only thing that makes me uneasy now is the way in which she seems to send her daughter away from her so much we never can persuade her to bring cynthia with her when she comes to see us now that i call illnatured said lady harriet here is a poor dear woman trying to earn her livelihood first as a governess and what could she do with her daughter then but send her to school and after that when clare is asked to go visiting and is too modest to bring her girl with herbesides all the expense of the journey and the rigging outmary finds fault with her for her modesty and economy well after all we are not discussing clare and her affairs but trying to plan for mammas comfort i dont see that she can do better than ask mrs kirkpatrick to come to the towersas soon as her holidays begin i mean here is her last letter said lady cumnor who had been searching for it in her escritoire while her daughters were talking holding her glasses before her eyes she began to read my wonted misfortunes appear to have followed me to ashcombeum um um thats not itmr preston is most kind in sending me fruit and flowers from the manorhouse according to dear lord cumnors kind injunction oh here it is the vacation begins on the th according to the usual custom of schools in ashcombe and i must then try and obtain some change of air and scene in order to fit myself for the resumption of my duties on the th of august you see girls she would be at liberty if she has not made any other arrangement for spending her holidays today is the th ill write to her at once mamma lady harriet said clare and i are always great friends i was her confidant in her loves with poor mr kirkpatrick and weve kept up our intimacy ever since i know of three offers she had besides i sincerely hope miss bowes is not telling her loveaffairs to grace or lily why harriet you could not have been older than grace when clare was married said lady cuxhaven in maternal alarm no but i was well versed in the tender passion thanks to novels now i daresay you dont admit novels into your schoolroom mary so your daughters wouldnt be able to administer discreet sympathy to their governess in case she was the heroine of a loveaffair my dear harriet dont let me hear you talking of love in that way it is not pretty love is a serious thing my dear mamma your exhortations are just eighteen years too late ive talked all the freshness off love and thats the reason im tired of the subject this last speech referred to a recent refusal of lady harriets which had displeased lady cumnor and rather annoyed my lord as they the parents could see no objection to the gentleman in question lady cuxhaven did not want to have the subject brought up so she hastened to say do ask the poor little daughter to come with her mother to the towers why she must be seventeen or more she would really be a companion to you mamma if her mother was unable to come i was not ten when clare married and im nearly nineandtwenty added lady harriet dont speak of it harriet at any rate you are but eightandtwenty now and you look a great deal younger there is no need to be always bringing up your age on every possible occasion there was need of it now though i wanted to make out how old cynthia kirkpatrick was i think she cant be far from eighteen she is at school at boulogne i know and so i dont think she can be as old as that clare says something about her in this letter under these circumstances the illsuccess of her school i cannot think myself justified in allowing myself the pleasure of having darling cynthia at home for the holidays especially as the period when the vacation in french schools commences differs from that common in england and it might occasion some confusion in my arrangements if darling cynthia were to come to ashcombe and occupy my time and thoughts so immediately before the commencement of my scholastic duties as the th of august on which day her vacation begins which is but two days before my holidays end so you see clare would be quite at liberty to come to me and i daresay it would be a very nice change for her and hollingford is busy seeing after his new laboratory at the towers and is constantly backwards and forwards and agnes wants to go there for change of air as soon as she is strong enough after her confinement and even my own dear insatiable me will have had enough of gaiety in two or three weeks if this hot weather lasts i think i may be able to come down for a few days too if you will let me mamma and ill bring grace who is looking rather pale and weedy growing too fast im afraid so i hope you wont be dull my dear said lady cumnor drawing herself up i should be ashamed of feeling dull with my resources my duties to others and to myself so the plan in its present shape was told to lord cumnor who highly approved of it as he always did of every project of his wifes lady cumnors character was perhaps a little too ponderous for him in reality but he was always full of admiration for all her words and deeds and used to boast of her wisdom her benevolence her power and dignity in her absence as if by this means he could buttress up his own more feeble nature very goodvery good indeed clare to join you at the towers capital i couldnt have planned it better myself i shall go down with you on wednesday in time for the jollification on thursday i always enjoy that day they are such nice friendly people those good hollingford ladies then ill have a day with sheepshanks and perhaps i may ride over to ashcombe and see prestonbrown jess can do it in a day eighteen milesto be sure but theres back again to the towershow much is twice eighteenthirty thirtysix said lady cumnor sharply so it is youre always right my dear prestons a clever sharp fellow i dont like him said my lady he takes looking after but hes a sharp fellow hes such a goodlooking man too i wonder you dont like him i never think whether a landagent is handsome or not they dont belong to the class of people whose appearance i notice to be sure not but he is a handsome fellow and what should make you like him is the interest he takes in clare and her prospects he is constantly suggesting something that can be done to her house and i know he sends her fruit and flowers and game just as regularly as we should ourselves if we lived at ashcombe how old is he said lady cumnor with a faint suspicion of motives in her mind about twentyseven i think ah i see what is in your ladyships head no no hes too young for that you must look out for some middleaged man if you want to get poor clare married preston wont do im not a matchmaker as you might know i never did it for my own daughters im not likely to do it for clare said she leaning back languidly well you might do a worse thing im beginning to think shell never get on as a schoolmistress though why she shouldnt im sure i dont know for shes an uncommonly pretty woman for her age and her having lived in our family and your having had her so often with you ought to go a good way i say my lady what do you think of gibson he would be just the right agewidowerlives near the towers i told you just now i was no matchmaker my lord i suppose we had better go by the old roadthe people at those inns know us and so they passed on to speaking about other things than mrs kirkpatrick and her prospects scholastic or matrimonial chapter ix the widower and the widow mrs kirkpatrick was only too happy to accept lady cumnors invitation it was what she had been hoping for but hardly daring to expect as she believed that the family were settled in london for some time to come the towers was a pleasant and luxurious house in which to pass her holidays and though she was not one to make deep plans or to look far ahead she was quite aware of the prestige which her being able to say she had been staying with dear lady cumnor at the towers was likely to give her and her school in the eyes of a good many people so she gladly prepared to join her ladyship on the th her wardrobe did not require much arrangement if it had done the poor lady would not have had much money to appropriate to the purpose she was very pretty and graceful and that goes a great way towards carrying off shabby clothes and it was her taste more than any depth of feeling that had made her persevere in wearing all the delicate tintsthe violets and grayswhich with a certain admixture of black constitute halfmourning this style of becoming dress she was supposed to wear in memory of mr kirkpatrick in reality because it was both ladylike and economical her beautiful hair was of that rich auburn that hardly ever turns gray and partly out of consciousness of its beauty and partly because the washing of caps is expensive she did not wear anything on her head her complexion had the vivid tints that often accompany the kind of hair which has once been red and the only injury her skin had received from advancing years was that the colouring was rather more brilliant than delicate and varied less with every passing emotion she could no longer blush and at eighteen she had been very proud of her blushes her eyes were soft large and chinablue in colour they had not much expression or shadow about them which was perhaps owing to the flaxen colour of her eyelashes her figure was a little fuller than it used to be but her movements were as soft and sinuous as ever altogether she looked much younger than her age which was not far short of forty she had a very pleasant voice and read aloud well and distinctly which lady cumnor liked indeed for some inexplicable reason she was a greater more positive favourite with lady cumnor than with any of the rest of the family though they all liked her up to a certain point and found it agreeably useful to have any one in the house who was so well acquainted with their ways and habits so ready to talk when a little trickle of conversation was required so willing to listen and to listen with tolerable intelligence if the subjects spoken about did not refer to serious solid literature or science or politics or social economy about novels and poetry travels and gossip personal details or anecdotes of any kind she always made exactly the remarks which are expected from an agreeable listener and she had sense enough to confine herself to those short expressions of wonder admiration and astonishment which may mean anything when more recondite things were talked about it was a very pleasant change to a poor unsuccessful schoolmistress to leave her own house full of battered and shabby furniture she had taken the goodwill and furniture of her predecessor at a valuation two or three years before where the lookout was as gloomy and the surrounding as squalid as is often the case in the smaller streets of a country town and to come bowling through the towers park in the luxurious carriage sent to meet her to alight and feel secure that the welltrained servants would see after her bags and umbrella and parasol and cloak without her loading herself with all these portable articles as she had had to do while following the wheelbarrow containing her luggage in going to the ashcombe coachoffice that morning to pass up the deeppiled carpets of the broad shallow stairs into my ladys own room cool and deliciously fresh even on this sultry day and fragrant with great bowls of freshly gathered roses of every shade of colour there were two or three new novels lying uncut on the table the daily papers the magazines every chair was an easychair of some kind or other and all covered with french chintz that mimicked the real flowers in the garden below she was familiar with the bedroom called hers to which she was soon ushered by lady cumnors maid it seemed to her far more like home than the dingy place she had left that morning it was so natural to her to like dainty draperies and harmonious colouring and fine linen and soft raiment she sate down in the armchair by the bedside and wondered over her fate something in this fashion one would think it was an easy enough thing to deck a lookingglass like that with muslin and pink ribbons and yet how hard it is to keep it up people dont know how hard it is till theyve tried as i have i made my own glass just as pretty when i first went to ashcombe but the muslin got dirty and the pink ribbons faded and it is so difficult to earn money to renew them and when one has got the money one hasnt the heart to spend it all at once one thinks and one thinks how one can get the most good out of it and a new gown or a days pleasure or some hothouse fruit or some piece of elegance that can be seen and noticed in ones drawingroom carries the day and goodby to prettily decked lookingglasses now here money is like the air they breathe no one even asks or knows how much the washing costs or what pink ribbon is a yard ah it would be different if they had to earn every penny as i have they would have to calculate like me how to get the most pleasure out of it i wonder if i am to go on all my life toiling and moiling for money its not natural marriage is the natural thing then the husband has all that kind of dirty work to do and his wife sits in the drawingroom like a lady i did when poor kirkpatrick was alive heigho its a sad thing to be a widow then there was the contrast between the dinners which she had to share with her scholars at ashcomberounds of beef legs of mutton great dishes of potatoes and large batterpuddings with the tiny meal of exquisitely cooked delicacies sent up on old chelsea china that was served every day to the earl and countess and herself at the towers she dreaded the end of her holidays as much as the most homeloving of her pupils but at this time that end was some weeks off so clare shut her eyes to the future and tried to relish the present to its fullest extent a disturbance to the pleasant even course of the summer days came in the indisposition of lady cumnor her husband had gone back to london and she and mrs kirkpatrick had been left to the very even tenor of life which was according to my ladys wish just now in spite of her languor and fatigue she had gone through the day when the school visitors came to the towers in full dignity dictating clearly all that was to be done what walks were to be taken what hothouses to be seen and when the party were to return to the collation she herself remained indoors with one or two ladies who had ventured to think that the fatigue or the heat might be too much for them and who had therefore declined accompanying the ladies in charge of mrs kirkpatrick or those other favoured few to whom lord cumnor was explaining the new buildings in his farmyard with the utmost condescension as her hearers afterwards expressed it lady cumnor told them all about her married daughters establishments nurseries plans for the education of their children and manner of passing the day but the exertion tired her and when every one had left the probability is that she would have gone to lie down and rest had not her husband made an unlucky remark in the kindness of his heart he came up to her and put his hand on her shoulder im afraid youre sadly tired my lady he said she braced her muscles and drew herself up saying coldly when i am tired lord cumnor i will tell you so and her fatigue showed itself during the rest of the evening in her sitting particularly upright and declining all offers of easychairs or footstools and refusing the insult of a suggestion that they should all go to bed earlier she went on in something of this kind of manner as long as lord cumnor remained at the towers mrs kirkpatrick was quite deceived by it and kept assuring lord cumnor that she had never seen dear lady cumnor looking better or so strong but he had an affectionate heart if a blundering head and though he could give no reason for his belief he was almost certain his wife was not well yet he was too much afraid of her to send for mr gibson without her permission his last words to clare were its such a comfort to leave my lady to you only dont you be deluded by her ways shell not show shes ill till she cant help it consult with bradley lady cumnors own womanshe disliked the newfangledness of ladysmaid and if i were you id send and ask gibson to callyou might make any kind of a pretenceand then the idea he had had in london of the fitness of a match between the two coming into his head just now he could not help addingget him to come and see you hes a very agreeable man lord hollingford says theres no one like him in these parts and he might be looking at my lady while he was talking to you and see if he thinks her really ill and let me know what he says about her but clare was just as great a coward about doing anything for lady cumnor which she had not expressly ordered as lord cumnor himself she knew she might fall into such disgrace if she sent for mr gibson without direct permission that she might never be asked to stay at the towers again and the life there monotonous in its smoothness of luxury as it might be to some was exactly to her taste she in her turn tried to put upon bradley the duty which lord cumnor had put upon her mrs bradley she said one day are you quite comfortable about my ladys health lord cumnor fancied that she was looking worn and ill indeed mrs kirkpatrick i dont think my lady is herself i cant persuade myself as she is though if you was to question me till night i couldnt tell you why dont you think you could make some errand to hollingford and see mr gibson and ask him to come round this way some day and make a call on lady cumnor it would be as much as my place is worth mrs kirkpatrick till my ladys dying day if providence keeps her in her senses shell have everything done her own way or not at all theres only lady harriet that can manage her the least and she not always well thenwe must hope that there is nothing the matter with her and i daresay there is not she says there is not and she ought to know best herself but a day or two after this conversation took place lady cumnor startled mrs kirkpatrick by saying suddenlyclare i wish youd write a note to mr gibson saying i should like to see him this afternoon i thought he would have called of himself before now he ought to have done so to pay his respects mr gibson had been far too busy in his profession to have time for mere visits of ceremony though he knew quite well he was neglecting what was expected of him but the district of which he may be said to have had medical charge was full of a bad kind of low fever which took up all his time and thought and often made him very thankful that molly was out of the way in the quiet shades of hamley his domestic rows had not healed over in the least though he was obliged to put the perplexities on one side for the time the last dropthe final straw had been an impromptu visit of lord hollingfords whom he had met in the town one forenoon they had had a good deal to say to each other about some new scientific discovery with the details of which lord hollingford was well acquainted while mr gibson was ignorant and deeply interested at length lord hollingford said suddenly gibson i wonder if youd give me some lunch ive been a good deal about since my sevenoclock breakfast and am getting quite ravenous now mr gibson was only too much pleased to show hospitality to one whom he liked and respected so much as lord hollingford and he gladly took him home with him to the early family dinner but it was just at the time when the cook was sulking at bethias dismissaland she chose to be unpunctual and careless there was no successor to bethia as yet appointed to wait at the meals so though mr gibson knew well that breadandcheese cold beef or the simplest food available would have been welcome to the hungry lord he could not get either these things for luncheon or even the family dinner at anything like the proper time in spite of all his ringing and as much anger as he liked to show for fear of making lord hollingford uncomfortable at last dinner was ready but the poor host saw the want of nicetyalmost the want of cleanliness in all its accompanimentsdingy plate dulllooking glass a tablecloth that if not absolutely dirty was anything but fresh in its splashed and rumpled condition and compared it in his own mind with the dainty delicacy with which even a loaf of brown bread was served up at his guests home he did not apologize directly but after dinner just as they were parting he saidyou see a man like mea widowerwith a daughter who cannot always be at homehas not the regulated household which would enable me to command the small portions of time i can spend there he made no allusion to the comfortless meal of which they had both partaken though it was full in his mind nor was it absent from lord hollingfords as he made reply true true yet a man like you ought to be free from any thought of household cares you ought to have somebody how old is miss gibson seventeen its a very awkward age for a motherless girl yes very i have only boys but it must be very awkward with a girl excuse me gibson but were talking like friends have you never thought of marrying again it wouldnt be like a first marriage of course but if you found a sensible agreeable woman of thirty or so i really think you couldnt do better than take her to manage your home and so save you either discomfort or worry and besides she would be able to give your daughter that kind of tender supervision which i fancy all girls of that age require its a delicate subject but youll excuse my having spoken frankly mr gibson had thought of this advice several times since it was given but it was a case of first catch your hare where was the sensible and agreeable woman of thirty or so not miss browning nor miss phoebe nor miss goodenough among his country patients there were two classes pretty distinctly marked farmers whose children were unrefined and uneducated squires whose daughters would indeed think the world was coming to a pretty pass if they were to marry a country surgeon but the first day on which mr gibson paid his visit to lady cumnor he began to think it possible that mrs kirkpatrick was his hare he rode away with slack rein thinking over what he knew of her more than about the prescriptions he should write or the way he was going he remembered her as a very pretty miss clare the governess who had the scarlet fever that was in his wifes days a long time ago he could hardly understand mrs kirkpatricks youthfulness of appearance when he thought how long then he had heard of her marriage to a curate and the next day or so it seemed he could not recollect the exact duration of the interval of his death he knew in some way that she had been living ever since as a governess in different families but that she had always been a great favourite with the family at the towers for whom quite independent of their rank he had a true respect a year or two ago he had heard that she had taken the goodwill of a school at ashcombe a small town close to another property of lord cumnors in the same county ashcombe was a larger estate than that near hollingford but the old manorhouse there was not nearly so good a residence as the towers so it was given up to mr preston the landagent for the ashcombe property just as mr sheepshanks was for that at hollingford there were a few rooms at the manorhouse reserved for the occasional visits of the family otherwise mr preston a handsome young bachelor had it all to himself mr gibson knew that mrs kirkpatrick had one child a daughter who must be much about the same age as molly of course she had very little if any property but he himself had lived carefully and had a few thousands well invested besides which his professional income was good and increasing rather than diminishing every year by the time he had arrived at this point in his consideration of the case he was at the house of the next patient on his round and he put away all thought of matrimony and mrs kirkpatrick for the time once again in the course of the day he remembered with a certain pleasure that molly had told him some little details connected with her unlucky detention at the towers five or six years ago which had made him feel at the time as if mrs kirkpatrick had behaved very kindly to his little girl so there the matter rested for the present as far as he was concerned lady cumnor was out of health but not so ill as she had been fancying herself during all those days when the people about her dared not send for the doctor it was a great relief to her to have mr gibson to decide for her what she was to do what to eat drink avoid such decisions ab extra are sometimes a wonderful relief to those whose habit it has been to decide not only for themselves but for every one else and occasionally the relaxation of the strain which a character for infallible wisdom brings with it does much to restore health mrs kirkpatrick thought in her secret soul that she had never found it so easy to get on with lady cumnor and bradley and she had never done singing the praises of mr gibson who always managed my lady so beautifully reports were duly sent up to my lord but he and his daughters were strictly forbidden to come down lady cumnor wished to be weak and languid and uncertain both in body and mind without family observation it was a condition so different to anything she had ever been in before that she was unconsciously afraid of losing her prestige if she was seen in it sometimes she herself wrote the daily bulletins at other times she bade clare do it but she would always see the letters any answers she received from her daughters she used to read herself occasionally imparting some of their contents to that good clare but anybody might read my lords letters there was no great fear of family secrets oozing out in his sprawling lines of affection but once mrs kirkpatrick came upon a sentence in a letter from lord cumnor which she was reading out loud to his wife that caught her eye before she came to it and if she could have skipped it and kept it for private perusal she would gladly have done so my lady was too sharp for her though in her opinion clare was a good creature but not clever the truth being that she was not always quick at resources though tolerably unscrupulous in the use of them read on what are you stopping for there is no bad news is there about agnesgive me the letter lady cumnor read half aloud how are clare and gibson getting on you despised my advice to help on that affair but i really think a little matchmaking would be a very pleasant amusement now that you are shut up in the house and i cannot conceive any marriage more suitable oh said lady cumnor laughing it was awkward for you to come upon that clare i dont wonder you stopped short you gave me a terrible fright though lord cumnor is so fond of joking said mrs kirkpatrick a little flurried yet quite recognizing the truth of his last wordsi cannot conceive any marriage more suitable she wondered what lady cumnor thought of it lord cumnor wrote as if there was really a chance it was not an unpleasant idea it brought a faint smile out upon her face as she sat by lady cumnor while the latter took her afternoon nap chapter x a crisis illustration untitled mrs kirkpatrick had been reading aloud till lady cumnor fell asleep the book rested on her knee just kept from falling by her hold she was looking out of the window not seeing the trees in the park nor the glimpses of the hills beyond but thinking how pleasant it would be to have a husband once moresome one who would work while she sate at her elegant ease in a prettilyfurnished drawingroom and she was rapidly investing this imaginary breadwinner with the form and features of the country surgeon when there was a slight tap at the door and almost before she could rise the object of her thoughts came in she felt herself blush and she was not displeased at the consciousness she advanced to meet him making a sign towards her sleeping ladyship very good said he in a low voice casting a professional eye on the slumbering figure can i speak to you for a minute or two in the library is he going to offer thought she with a sudden palpitation and a conviction of her willingness to accept a man whom an hour before she had simply looked upon as one of the category of unmarried men to whom matrimony was possible he was only going to make one or two medical inquiries she found that out very speedily and considered the conversation as rather flat to her though it might be instructive to him she was not aware that he finally made up his mind to propose during the time that she was speakinganswering his questions in many words but he was accustomed to winnow the chaff from the corn and her voice was so soft her accent so pleasant that it struck him as particularly agreeable after the broad country accent he was perpetually hearing then the harmonious colours of her dress and her slow and graceful movements had something of the same soothing effect upon his nerves that a cats purring has upon some peoples he began to think that he should be fortunate if he could win her for his own sake yesterday he had looked upon her more as a possible stepmother for molly today he thought more of her as a wife for himself the remembrance of lord cumnors letter gave her a very becoming consciousness she wished to attract and hoped that she was succeeding still they only talked of the countesss state for some time then a lucky shower came on mr gibson did not care a jot for rain but just now it gave him an excuse for lingering its very stormy weather said he yes very my daughter writes me word that for two days last week the packet could not sail from boulogne miss kirkpatrick is at boulogne is she yes poor girl she is at school there trying to perfect herself in the french language but mr gibson you must not call her miss kirkpatrick cynthia remembers you with so muchaffection i may say she was your little patient when she had the measles here four years ago you know pray call her cynthia she would be quite hurt at such a formal name as miss kirkpatrick from you cynthia seems to me such an outoftheway name only fit for poetry not for daily use it is mine said mrs kirkpatrick in a plaintive tone of reproach i was christened hyacinth and her poor father would have her called after me im sorry you dont like it mr gibson did not know what to say he was not quite prepared to plunge into the directly personal style while he was hesitating she went on hyacinth clare once upon a time i was quite proud of my pretty name and other people thought it pretty too ive no doubt mr gibson began and then stopped perhaps i did wrong in yielding to his wish to have her called by such a romantic name it may excite prejudice against her in some people and poor child she will have enough to struggle with a young daughter is a great charge mr gibson especially when there is only one parent to look after her you are quite right said he recalled to the remembrance of molly though i should have thought that a girl who is so fortunate as to have a mother could not feel the loss of her father so acutely as one who is motherless must suffer from her deprivation you are thinking of your own daughter it was careless of me to say what i did dear child how well i remember her sweet little face as she lay sleeping on my bed i suppose she is nearly grownup now she must be near my cynthias age how i should like to see her i hope you will i should like you to see her i should like you to love my poor little mollyto love her as your own he swallowed down something that rose in his throat and was nearly choking him is he going to offer is he she wondered and she began to tremble in the suspense before he next spoke could you love her as your daughter will you try will you give me the right of introducing you to her as her future mother as my wife there he had done itwhether it was wise or foolishhe had done it but he was aware that the question as to its wisdom came into his mind the instant that the words were said past recall she hid her face in her hands oh mr gibson she said and then a little to his surprise and a great deal to her own she burst into hysterical tears it was such a wonderful relief to feel that she need not struggle any more for a livelihood my dearmy dearest said he trying to soothe her with word and caress but just at the moment uncertain what name he ought to use after her sobbing had abated a little she said herself as if understanding his difficulty call me hyacinthyour own hyacinth i cant bear clare it does so remind me of being a governess and those days are all past now yes but surely no one can have been more valued more beloved than you have been in this family at least oh yes they have been very good but still one has always had to remember ones position we ought to tell lady cumnor said he thinking perhaps more of the various duties which lay before him in consequence of the step he had just taken than of what his future bride was saying youll tell her wont you said she looking up in his face with beseeching eyes i always like other people to tell her things and then i can see how she takes them certainly i will do whatever you wish shall we go and see if she is awake now no i think not i had better prepare her you will come tomorrow wont you and you will tell her then yes that will be best i ought to tell molly first she has the right to know i do hope you and she will love each other dearly oh yes im sure we shall then youll come tomorrow and tell lady cumnor and ill prepare her i dont see what preparation is necessary but you know best my dear when can we arrange for you and molly to meet just then a servant came in and the pair started apart her ladyship is awake and wishes to see mr gibson they both followed the man upstairs mrs kirkpatrick trying hard to look as if nothing had happened for she particularly wished to prepare lady cumnor that is to say to give her version of mr gibsons extreme urgency and her own coy unwillingness but lady cumnor had observant eyes in sickness as well as in health she had gone to sleep with the recollection of the passage in her husbands letter full in her mind and perhaps it gave a direction to her wakening ideas im glad youre not gone mr gibson i wanted to tell you whats the matter with you both what have you been saying to clare im sure something has happened there was nothing for it in mr gibsons opinion but to make a clean breast of it and tell her ladyship all he turned round and took hold of mrs kirkpatricks hand and said out straight i have been asking mrs kirkpatrick to be my wife and to be a mother to my child and she has consented i hardly know how to thank her enough in words umph i dont see any objection i daresay youll be very happy im very glad of it here shake hands with me both of you then laughing a little she added it does not seem to me that any exertion has been required on my part mr gibson looked perplexed at these words mrs kirkpatrick reddened did she not tell you oh then i must its too good a joke to be lost especially as everything has ended so well when lord cumnors letter came this morningthis very morningi gave it to clare to read aloud to me and i saw she suddenly came to a full stop where no full stop could be and i thought it was something about agnes so i took the letter and readstay ill read the sentence to you wheres the letter clare oh dont trouble yourself here it is how are clare and gibson getting on you despised my advice to help on that affair but i really think a little matchmaking would be a very pleasant amusement now that you are shut up in the house and i cannot conceive any marriage more suitable you see you have my lords full approbation but i must write and tell him you have managed your own affairs without any interference of mine now well just have a little medical talk mr gibson and then you and clare shall finish your ttette they were neither of them quite as desirous of further conversation together as they had been before the passage out of lord cumnors letter had been read aloud mr gibson tried not to think about it for he was aware that if he dwelt upon it he might get to fancy all sorts of things as to the conversation which had ended in his offer but lady cumnor was imperious now as always come no nonsense i always made my girls go and have ttettes with the men who were to be their husbands whether they would or no theres a great deal to be talked over before every marriage and you two are certainly old enough to be above affectation go away with you so there was nothing for it but for them to return to the library mrs kirkpatrick pouting a little and mr gibson feeling more like his own cool sarcastic self by many degrees than he had done when last in that room she began half crying i cannot tell what poor kirkpatrick would say if he knew what i have done he did so dislike the notion of second marriages poor fellow let us hope that he doesnt know then or that if he does he is wiseri mean that he sees how second marriages may be most desirable and expedient in some cases altogether this second ttette done to command was not so satisfactory as the first and mr gibson was quite alive to the necessity of proceeding on his round to see his patients before very much time had elapsed we shall shake down into uniformity before long ive no doubt said he to himself as he rode away its hardly to be expected that our thoughts should run in the same groove all at once nor should i like it he added it would be very flat and stagnant to have only an echo of ones own opinions from ones wife heigho i must tell molly about it dear little woman i wonder how shell take it its done in a great measure for her good and then he lost himself in recapitulating mrs kirkpatricks good qualities and the advantages to be gained to his daughter from the step he had just taken it was too late to go round by hamley that afternoon the towers and the towers round lay just in the opposite direction to hamley so it was the next morning before mr gibson arrived at the hall timing his visit as well as he could so as to have halfanhours private talk with molly before mrs hamley came down into the drawingroom he thought that his daughter would require sympathy after receiving the intelligence he had to communicate and he knew there was no one more fit to give it than mrs hamley it was a brilliantly hot summers morning men in their shirtsleeves were in the fields getting in the early harvest of oats as mr gibson rode slowly along he could see them over the tall hedgerows and even hear the soothing measured sound of the fall of the long swathes as they were mown the labourers seemed too hot to talk the dog guarding their coats and cans lay panting loudly on the other side of the elm under which mr gibson stopped for an instant to survey the scene and gain a little delay before the interview that he wished was well over in another minute he had snapped at himself for his weakness and put spurs to his horse he came up to the hall at a good sharp trot it was earlier than the usual time of his visits and no one was expecting him all the stablemen were in the fields but that signified little to mr gibson he walked his horse about for five minutes or so before taking him into the stable and loosened his girths examining him with perhaps unnecessary exactitude he went into the house by a private door and made his way into the drawingroom half expecting however that molly would be in the garden she had been there but it was too hot and dazzling now for her to remain out of doors and she had come in by the open window of the drawingroom oppressed with the heat she had fallen asleep in an easychair her bonnet and open book upon her knee one arm hanging listlessly down she looked very soft and young and childlike and a gush of love sprang into her fathers heart as he gazed at her molly said he gently taking the little brown hand that was hanging down and holding it in his own molly she opened her eyes that for one moment had no recognition in them then the light came brilliantly into them and she sprang up and threw her arms round his neck exclaiming oh papa my dear dear papa what made you come while i was asleep i lose the pleasure of watching for you mr gibson turned a little paler than he had been before he still held her hand and drew her to a seat by him on a sofa without speaking there was no need she was chattering away i was up so early it is so charming to be out here in the fresh morning air i think that made me sleepy but isnt it a gloriously hot day i wonder if the italian skies they talk about can be bluer than thatthat little bit you see just between the oaksthere she pulled her hand away and used both it and the other to turn her fathers head so that he should exactly see the very bit she meant she was rather struck by his unusual silence have you heard from miss eyre papa how are they all and this fever that is about do you know papa i dont think you are looking well you want me at home to take care of you how soon may i come home dont i look well that must be all your fancy goosey i feel uncommonly well and i ought to look well for i have a piece of news for you little woman he felt that he was doing his business very awkwardly but he was determined to plunge on can you guess it how should i said she but her tone was changed and she was evidently uneasy as with the presage of an instinct why you see my love said he again taking her hand that you are in a very awkward positiona girl growing up in such a family as mineyoung menwhich was a piece of confounded stupidity on my part and i am obliged to be away so much but there is miss eyre said she sick with the strengthening indefinite presage of what was to come dear miss eyre i want nothing but her and you still there are times like the present when miss eyre cannot be with you her home is not with us she has other duties ive been in great perplexity for some time but at last ive taken a step which will i hope make us both happier youre going to be married again said she helping him out with a quiet dry voice and gently drawing her hand out of his yes to mrs kirkpatrickyou remember her they call her clare at the towers you recollect how kind she was to you that day you were left there she did not answer she could not tell what words to use she was afraid of saying anything lest the passion of anger dislike indignationwhatever it was that was boiling up in her breastshould find vent in cries and screams or worse in raging words that could never be forgotten it was as if the piece of solid ground on which she stood had broken from the shore and she was drifting out to the infinite sea alone mr gibson saw that her silence was unnatural and halfguessed at the cause of it but he knew that she must have time to reconcile herself to the idea and still believed that it would be for her eventual happiness he had besides the relief of feeling that the secret was told the confidence made which he had been dreading for the last twentyfour hours he went on recapitulating all the advantages of the marriage he knew them off by heart now shes a very suitable age for me i dont know how old she is exactly but she must be nearly forty i shouldnt have wished to marry any one younger shes highly respected by lord and lady cumnor and their family which is of itself a character she has very agreeable and polished mannersof course from the circles she has been thrown intoand you and i goosey are apt to be a little brusque or so we must brush up our manners now no remark from her on this little bit of playfulness he went on she has been accustomed to housekeepingeconomical housekeeping toofor of late years she has had a school at ashcombe and has had of course to arrange all things for a large family and last but not least she has a daughterabout your age mollywho of course will come and live with us and be a nice companiona sisterfor you still she was silent at length she said so i was sent out of the house that all this might be quietly arranged in my absence out of the bitterness of her heart she spoke but she was roused out of her assumed impassiveness by the effect produced her father started up and quickly left the room saying something to himselfwhat she could not hear though she ran after him followed him through dark stone passages into the glare of the stableyard into the stables oh papa papaim not myselfi dont know what to say about this hatefuldetestable he led his horse out she did not know if he heard her words just as he mounted he turned round upon her with a grey grim face i think its better for both of us for me to go away now we may say things difficult to forget we are both much agitated by tomorrow we shall be more composed you will have thought it over and have seen that the principalone great motive i meanwas your good you may tell mrs hamleyi meant to have told her myself i will come again tomorrow goodby molly for many minutes after he had ridden awaylong after the sound of his horses hoofs on the round stones of the paved lane beyond the homemeadows had died awaymolly stood there shading her eyes and looking at the empty space of air in which his form had last appeared her very breath seemed suspended only two or three times after long intervals she drew a miserable sigh which was caught up into a sob she turned away at last but could not go into the house could not tell mrs hamley could not forget how her father had looked and spokenand left her she went out through a sidedoorit was the way by which the gardeners passed when they took the manure into the gardenand the walk to which it led was concealed from sight as much as possible by shrubs and evergreens and overarching trees no one would know what became of herand with the ingratitude of misery she added to herself no one would care mrs hamley had her own husband her own children her close home interestsshe was very good and kind but there was a bitter grief in mollys heart with which the stranger could not intermeddle she went quickly on to the bourne which she had fixed for herselfa seat almost surrounded by the drooping leaves of a weepingasha seat on the long broad terrace walk on the other side of the wood that overlooked the pleasant slope of the meadows beyond the walk had probably been made to command this sunny peaceful landscape with trees and a church spire two or three redtiled roofs of old cottages and a purple bit of rising ground in the distance and at some previous date when there might have been a large family of hamleys residing at the hall ladies in hoops and gentlemen in bagwigs with swords by their sides might have filled up the breadth of the terrace as they sauntered smiling along but no one ever cared to saunter there now it was a deserted walk the squire or his sons might cross it in passing to a little gate that led to the meadow beyond but no one loitered there molly almost thought that no one knew of the hidden seat under the ashtree but herself for there were not more gardeners employed upon the grounds than were necessary to keep the kitchengardens and such of the ornamental part as was frequented by the family or in sight of the house in good order when she had once got to the seat she broke out with suppressed passion of grief she did not care to analyze the sources of her tears and sobsher father was going to be married againher father was angry with her she had done very wronghe had gone away displeased she had lost his love he was going to be marriedaway from heraway from his childhis little daughterforgetting her own dear dear mother so she thought in a tumultuous kind of way sobbing till she was wearied out and had to gain strength by being quiet for a time to break forth into her passion of tears afresh she had cast herself on the groundthat natural throne for violent sorrowand leant up against the old mossgrown seat sometimes burying her face in her hands sometimes clasping them together as if by the tight painful grasp of her fingers she could deaden mental suffering she did not see roger hamley returning from the meadows nor hear the click of the little white gate he had been out dredging in ponds and ditches and had his wet slingnet with its imprisoned treasures of nastiness over his shoulder he was coming home to lunch having always a fine midday appetite though he pretended to despise the meal in theory but he knew that his mother liked his companionship then she depended much upon her luncheon and was seldom downstairs and visible to her family much before the time so he overcame his theory for the sake of his mother and had his reward in the hearty relish with which he kept her company in eating he did not see molly as he crossed the terracewalk on his way homewards he had gone about twenty yards along the small woodpath at right angles to the terrace when looking among the grass and wild plants under the trees he spied out one which was rare one which he had been long wishing to find in flower and saw it at last with those bright keen eyes of his down went his net skilfully twisted so as to retain its contents while it lay amid the herbage and he himself went with light and wellplanted footsteps in search of the treasure he was so great a lover of nature that without any thought but habitually he always avoided treading unnecessarily on any plant who knew what longsought growth or insect might develop itself in that which now appeared but insignificant his steps led him in the direction of the ashtree seat much less screened from observation on this side than on the terrace he stopped he saw a lightcoloured dress on the groundsomebody halflying on the seat so still just then he wondered if the person whoever it was had fallen ill or fainted he paused to watch in a minute or two the sobs broke out againthe words it was miss gibson crying out in a broken voice oh papa papa if you would but come back for a minute or two he thought it would be kinder to leave her fancying herself unobserved he had even made a retrograde step or two on tiptoe but then he heard the miserable sobbing again it was farther than his mother could walk or else be the sorrow what it would she was the natural comforter of this girl her visitor however whether it was right or wrong delicate or obtrusive when he heard the sad voice talking again in such tones of uncomforted lonely misery he turned back and went to the green tent under the ashtree she started up when he came thus close to her she tried to check her sobs and instinctively smoothed her wet tangled hair back with her hands he looked down upon her with grave kind sympathy but he did not know exactly what to say is it lunchtime said she trying to believe that he did not see the traces of her tears and the disturbance of her featuresthat he had not seen her lying sobbing her heart out there i dont know i was going home to lunch butyou must let me say iti couldnt go on when i saw your distress has anything happenedanything in which i can help you i mean for of course ive no right to make the inquiry if it is any private sorrow in which i can be of no use she had exhausted herself so much with crying that she felt as if she could neither stand nor walk just yet she sate down on the seat and sighed and turned so pale he thought she was going to faint wait a moment said hequite unnecessarily for she could not have stirredand he was off like a shot to some spring of water that he knew of in the wood and in a minute or two he returned with careful steps bringing a little in a broad green leaf turned into an impromptu cup little as it was it did her good thank you she said i can walk back now in a short time dont stop you must let me said he my mother wouldnt like me to leave you to come home alone while you are so faint so they remained in silence for a little while he breaking off and examining one or two abnormal leaves of the ashtree partly from the custom of his nature partly to give her time to recover papa is going to be married again said she at length she could not have said why she told him this an instant before she spoke she had no intention of doing so he dropped the leaf he held in his hand turned round and looked at her her poor wistful eyes were filling with tears as they met his with a dumb appeal for sympathy her look was much more eloquent than her words there was a momentary pause before he replied and then it was more because he felt that he must say something than that he was in any doubt as to the answer to the question he asked you are sorry for it she did not take her eyes away from his as her quivering lips formed the word yes though her voice made no sound he was silent again now looking on the ground kicking softly at a loose pebble with his foot his thoughts did not come readily to the surface in the shape of words nor was he apt at giving comfort till he saw his way clear to the real source from which consolation must come at last he spokealmost as if he was reasoning out the matter with himself it seems as if there might be cases wheresetting the question of love entirely on one sideit must be almost a duty to find some one to be a substitute for the mother i can believe said he in a different tone of voice and looking at molly afresh that this step may be greatly for your fathers happinessit may relieve him from many cares and may give him a pleasant companion he had me you dont know what we were to each otherat least what he was to me she added humbly still he must have thought it for the best or he wouldnt have done it he may have thought it the best for your sake even more than for his own that is what he tried to convince me of roger began kicking the pebble again he had not got hold of the right end of the clue suddenly he looked up i want to tell you of a girl i know her mother died when she was about sixteenthe eldest of a large family from that timeall through the bloom of her youthshe gave herself up to her father first as his comforter afterwards as his companion friend secretaryanything you like he was a man with a great deal of business on hand and often came home only to set to afresh to preparations for the next days work harriet was always there ready to help to talk or to be silent it went on for eight or ten years in this way and then her father married againa woman not many years older than harriet herself wellthey are just the happiest set of people i knowyou wouldnt have thought it likely would you she was listening but she had no heart to say anything yet she was interested in this little story of harrieta girl who had been so much to her father more than molly in this early youth of hers could have been to mr gibson how was it she sighed out at last harriet thought of her fathers happiness before she thought of her own roger answered with something of severe brevity molly needed the bracing she began to cry again a little if it were for papas happiness he must believe that it is whatever you fancy give him a chance he cannot have much comfort i should think if he sees you fretting or piningyou who have been so much to him as you say the lady herself tooif harriets stepmother had been a selfish woman and been always clutching after the gratification of her own wishes but she was not she was as anxious for harriet to be happy as harriet was for her fatherand your fathers future wife may be another of the same kind though such people are rare i dont think she is though murmured molly a waft of recollection bringing to her mind the details of her day at the towers long ago roger did not want to hear mollys reasons for this doubting speech he felt as if he had no right to hear more of mr gibsons family life past present or to come than was absolutely necessary for him in order that he might comfort and help the crying girl whom he had come upon so unexpectedly and besides he wanted to go home and be with his mother at lunchtime yet he could not leave her alone it is right to hope for the best about everybody and not to expect the worst this sounds like a truism but it has comforted me before now and some day youll find it useful one has always to try to think more of others than of oneself and it is best not to prejudge people on the bad side my sermons arent long are they have they given you an appetite for lunch sermons always make me hungry i know he appeared to be waiting for her to get up and come along with him as indeed he was but he meant her to perceive that he should not leave her so she rose up languidly too languid to say how much she should prefer being left alone if he would only go away without her she was very weak and stumbled over the straggling root of a tree that projected across the path he watchful though silent saw this stumble and putting out his hand held her up from falling he still held her hand when the occasion was past this little physical failure impressed on his heart how young and helpless she was and he yearned to her remembering the passion of sorrow in which he had found her and longing to be of some little tender bit of comfort to her before they partedbefore their ttette walk was merged in the general familiarity of the household life yet he did not know what to say you will have thought me hard he burst out at length as they were nearing the drawingroom windows and the gardendoor i never can manage to express what i feelsomehow i always fall to philosophizingbut i am sorry for you yes i am its beyond my power to help you as far as altering facts goes but i can feel for you in a way which its best not to talk about for it can do no good remember how sorry i am for you i shall often be thinking of you though i daresay its best not to talk about it again she said i know you are sorry under her breath and then she broke away and ran indoors and upstairs to the solitude of her own room he went straight to his mother who was sitting before the untasted luncheon as much annoyed by the mysterious unpunctuality of her visitor as she was capable of being with anything for she had heard that mr gibson had been and was gone and she could not discover if he had left any message for her and her anxiety about her own health which some people esteemed hypochondriacal always made her particularly craving for the wisdom which might fall from her doctors lips where have you been roger where is mollymiss gibson i mean for she was careful to keep up a barrier of forms between the young man and young woman who were thrown together in the same household ive been out dredging by the way i left my net on the terrace walk i found miss gibson sitting there crying as if her heart would break her father is going to be married again married again you dont say so yes he is and she takes it very hardly poor girl mother i think if you could send some one to her with a glass of wine a cup of tea or something of that sortshe was very nearly fainting ill go to her myself poor child said mrs hamley rising indeed you must not said he laying his hand upon her arm we have kept you waiting already too long you are looking quite pale hammond can take it he continued ringing the bell she sate down again almost stunned with surprise whom is he going to marry i dont know i didnt ask and she didnt tell me thats so like a man why half the character of the affair lies in the question of who it is that he is going to marry i daresay i ought to have asked but somehow im not a good one on such occasions i was as sorry as could be for her and yet i couldnt tell what to say what did you say i gave her the best advice in my power advice you ought to have comforted her poor little molly i think that if advice is good its the best comfort that depends on what you mean by advice hush here she is to their surprise molly came in trying hard to look as usual she had bathed her eyes and arranged her hair and was making a great struggle to keep from crying and to bring her voice into order she was unwilling to distress mrs hamley by the sight of pain and suffering she did not know that she was following rogers injunction to think more of others than of herselfbut so she was mrs hamley was not sure if it was wise in her to begin on the piece of news she had just heard from her son but she was too full of it herself to talk of anything else so i hear your father is going to be married my dear may i ask whom it is to mrs kirkpatrick i think she was governess a long time ago at the countess of cumnors she stays with them a great deal and they call her clare and i believe they are very fond of her molly tried to speak of her future stepmother in the most favourable manner she knew how i think ive heard of her then shes not very young thats as it should be a widow too has she any family one girl i believe but i know so little about her molly was very near crying again never mind my dear that will all come in good time roger youve hardly eaten anything where are you going to fetch my dredgingnet its full of things i dont want to lose besides i never eat much as a general thing the truth was partly told not all he thought he had better leave the other two alone his mother had such sweet power of sympathy that she would draw the sting out of the girls heart when she had her alone as soon as he was gone molly lifted up her poor swelled eyes and looking at mrs hamley she saidhe was so good to me i mean to try and remember all he said im glad to hear it love very glad from what he told me i was afraid he had been giving you a little lecture he has a good heart but he isnt so tender in his manner as osborne roger is a little rough sometimes then i like roughness it did me good it made me feel how badlyoh mrs hamley i did behave so badly to papa this morning she rose up and threw herself into mrs hamleys arms and sobbed upon her breast her sorrow was not now for the fact that her father was going to be married again but for her own illbehaviour if roger was not tender in words he was in deeds unreasonable and possibly exaggerated as mollys grief had appeared to him it was real suffering to her and he took some pains to lighten it in his own way which was characteristic enough that evening he adjusted his microscope and put the treasures he had collected in his mornings ramble on a little table and then he asked his mother to come and admire of course molly came too and this was what he had intended he tried to interest her in his pursuit cherished her first little morsel of curiosity and nursed it into a very proper desire for further information then he brought out books on the subject and translated the slightly pompous and technical language into homely everyday speech molly had come down to dinner wondering how the long hours till bedtime would ever pass away hours during which she must not speak on the one thing that would be occupying her mind to the exclusion of all others for she was afraid that already she had wearied mrs hamley with it during their afternoon ttette but prayers and bedtime came long before she expected she had been refreshed by a new current of thought and she was very thankful to roger and now there was tomorrow to come and a confession of penitence to be made to her father but mr gibson did not want speech or words he was not fond of expressions of feeling at any time and perhaps too he felt that the less said the better on a subject about which it was evident that his daughter and he were not thoroughly and impulsively in harmony he read her repentance in her eyes he saw how much she had suffered and he had a sharp pang at his heart in consequence and he stopped her from speaking out her regret at her behaviour the day before by a there there that will do i know all you want to say i know my little mollymy silly little gooseybetter than she knows herself ive brought you an invitation lady cumnor wants you to go and spend next thursday at the towers do you wish me to go said she her heart sinking i wish you and hyacinth to become better acquaintedto learn to love each other hyacinth said molly entirely bewildered yes hyacinth its the silliest name i ever heard of but its hers and i must call her by it i cant bear clare which is what my lady and all the family at the towers call her and mrs kirkpatrick is formal and nonsensical too as shell change her name so soon when papa asked molly feeling as if she were living in a strange unknown world not till after michaelmas and then continuing on his own thoughts he added and the worst is shes gone and perpetuated her own affected name by having her daughter called after her cynthia one thinks of the moon and the man in the moon with his bundle of faggots im thankful youre plain molly child how old is shecynthia i mean ay get accustomed to the name i should think cynthia kirkpatrick was about as old as you are shes at school in france picking up airs and graces shes to come home for the wedding so youll be able to get acquainted with her then though i think shes to go back again for another halfyear or so chapter xi making friendship mr gibson believed that cynthia kirkpatrick was to return to england to be present at her mothers wedding but mrs kirkpatrick had no such intention she was not what is commonly called a woman of determination but somehow what she disliked she avoided and what she liked she tried to do or to have so although in the conversation which she had already led to as to the when and the how she was to be married she had listened quietly to mr gibsons proposal that molly and cynthia should be the two bridesmaids still she had felt how disagreeable it would be to her to have her young daughter flashing out her beauty by the side of the faded bride her mother and as the further arrangements for the wedding became more definite she saw further reasons in her own mind for cynthias remaining quietly at her school at boulogne mrs kirkpatrick had gone to bed that first night of her engagement to mr gibson fully anticipating a speedy marriage she looked to it as a release from the thraldom of keeping schoolkeeping an unprofitable school with barely pupils enough to pay for house rent and taxes food washing and the requisite masters she saw no reason for ever going back to ashcombe except to wind up her affairs and to pack up her clothes she hoped that mr gibsons ardour would be such that he would press on the marriage and urge her never to resume her school drudgery but to relinquish it now and for ever she even made up a very pretty very passionate speech for him in her own mind quite sufficiently strong to prevail upon her and to overthrow the scruples which she felt she ought to have at telling the parents of her pupils that she did not intend to resume school and that they must find another place of education for their daughters in the last week but one of the midsummer holidays it was rather like a douche of cold water on mrs kirkpatricks plans when the next morning at breakfast lady cumnor began to decide upon the arrangements and duties of the two middleaged lovers of course you cant give up your school all at once clare the wedding cant be before christmas but that will do very well we shall all be down at the towers and it will be a nice amusement for the children to go over to ashcombe and see you married i thinki am afraidi dont believe mr gibson will like waiting so long men are so impatient under these circumstances oh nonsense lord cumnor has recommended you to his tenants and im sure he wouldnt like them to be put to any inconvenience mr gibson will see that in a moment hes a man of sense or else he wouldnt be our family doctor now what are you going to do about your little girl have you fixed yet no yesterday there seemed so little time and when one is agitated it is so difficult to think of anything cynthia is nearly eighteen old enough to go out as a governess if he wishes it but i dont think he will he is so generous and kind well i must give you time to settle some of your affairs today dont waste it in sentiment youre too old for that come to a clear understanding with each other it will be for your happiness in the long run so they did come to a clear understanding about one or two things to mrs kirkpatricks dismay she found that mr gibson had no more idea than lady cumnor of her breaking faith with the parents of her pupils though he really was at a serious loss as to what was to become of molly till she could be under the protection of his new wife at her own home and though his domestic worries teased him more and more every day he was too honourable to think of persuading mrs kirkpatrick to give up school a week sooner than was right for his sake he did not even perceive how easy the task of persuasion would be with all her winning wiles she could scarcely lead him to feel impatience for the wedding to take place at michaelmas i can hardly tell you what a comfort and relief it will be to me hyacinth when you are once my wifethe mistress of my homepoor little mollys mother and protector but i wouldnt interfere with your previous engagements for the world it wouldnt be right thank you my own love how good you are so many men would think only of their own wishes and interests im sure the parents of my dear pupils will admire youwill be quite surprised at your consideration for their interests dont tell them then i hate being admired why shouldnt you say it is your wish to keep on your school till theyve had time to look out for another because it isnt said she daring all i long to be making you happy i want to make your home a place of rest and comfort to you and i do so wish to cherish your sweet molly as i hope to do when i come to be her mother i cant take virtue to myself which doesnt belong to me if i have to speak for myself i shall say good people find a school for your daughters by michaelmasfor after that time i must go and make the happiness of others i cant bear to think of your long rides in novembercoming home wet at night with no one to take care of you oh if you leave it to me i shall advise the parents to take their daughters away from the care of one whose heart will be absent though i couldnt consent to any time before michaelmasthat wouldnt be fair or right and im sure you wouldnt urge meyou are too good well if you think that they will consider we have acted uprightly by them let it be michaelmas with all my heart what does lady cumnor say oh i told her i was afraid you wouldnt like waiting because of your difficulties with your servants and because of mollyit would be so desirable to enter on the new relationship with her as soon as possible to be sure so it would poor child im afraid the intelligence of my engagement has rather startled her cynthia will feel it deeply too said mrs kirkpatrick unwilling to let her daughter be behind mr gibsons in sensibility and affection we will have her over to the wedding she and molly shall be bridesmaids said mr gibson in the unguarded warmth of his heart this plan did not quite suit mrs kirkpatrick but she thought it best not to oppose it until she had a presentable excuse to give and perhaps also some reason would naturally arise out of future circumstances so at this time she only smiled and softly pressed the hand she held in hers it is a question whether mrs kirkpatrick or molly wished the most for the day to be over which they were to spend together at the towers mrs kirkpatrick was rather weary of girls as a class all the trials of her life were connected with girls in some way she was very young when she first became a governess and had been worsted in her struggles with her pupils in the first place she ever went to her elegance of appearance and manner and her accomplishments more than her character and acquirements had rendered it easier for her than for most to obtain good situations and she had been absolutely petted in some but still she was constantly encountering naughty or stubborn or overconscientious or severejudging or curious and observant girls and again before cynthia was born she had longed for a boy thinking it possible that if some three or four intervening relations died he might come to be a baronet and instead of a son lo and behold it was a daughter nevertheless with all her dislike to girls in the abstract as the plagues of her life and her aversion was not diminished by the fact of her having kept a school for young ladies at ashcombe she really meant to be as kind as she could be to her new stepdaughter whom she remembered principally as a blackhaired sleepy child in whose eyes she had read admiration of herself mrs kirkpatrick accepted mr gibson principally because she was tired of the struggle of earning her own livelihood but she liked him personallynay she even loved him in her torpid way and she intended to be good to his daughter though she felt as if it would have been easier for her to have been good to his son molly was bracing herself up in her way too i will be like harriet i will think of others i wont think of myself she kept repeating all the way to the towers but there was no selfishness in wishing that the day was come to an end and that she did very heartily mrs hamley sent her thither in the carriage which was to wait and bring her back at night mrs hamley wanted molly to make a favourable impression and she sent for her to come and show herself before she set out dont put on your silk gownyour white muslin will look the nicest my dear not my silk it is quite new i had it to come here still i think your white muslin suits you the best anything but that horrid plaid silk was the thought in mrs hamleys mind and thanks to her molly set off for the towers looking a little quaint it is true but thoroughly ladylike if she was oldfashioned her father was to meet her there but he had been detained and she had to face mrs kirkpatrick by herself the recollection of her last day of misery at the towers fresh in her mind as if it had been yesterday mrs kirkpatrick was as caressing as could be she held mollys hand in hers as they sate together in the library after the first salutations were over she kept stroking it from time to time and purring out inarticulate sounds of loving satisfaction as she gazed in the blushing face illustration the new mamma what eyes so like your dear fathers how we shall love each othershant we darling for his sake ill try said molly bravely and then she could not finish her sentence and youve just got the same beautiful black curling hair said mrs kirkpatrick softly lifting one of mollys curls from off her white temple papas hair is growing grey said molly is it i never see it i never shall see it he will always be to me the handsomest of men mr gibson was really a very handsome man and molly was pleased with the compliment but she could not help saying still he will grow old and his hair will grow grey i think he will be just as handsome but it wont be as a young man ah thats just it love hell always be handsome some people always are and he is so fond of you dear mollys colour flashed into her face she did not want an assurance of her own fathers love from this strange woman she could not help being angry all she could do was to keep silent you dont know how he speaks of you his little treasure as he calls you im almost jealous sometimes molly took her hand away and her heart began to harden these speeches were so discordant to her but she set her teeth together and tried to be good we must make him so happy im afraid he has had a great deal to annoy him at home but we will do away with all that now you must tell me seeing the cloud in mollys eyes what he likes and dislikes for of course you will know mollys face cleared a little of course she did know she had not watched and loved him so long without believing that she understood him better than any one else though how he had come to like mrs kirkpatrick enough to wish to marry her was an unsolved problem that she unconsciously put aside as inexplicable mrs kirkpatrick went onall men have their fancies and antipathies even the wisest i have known some gentlemen annoyed beyond measure by the merest trifles leaving a door open or spilling tea in their saucers or a shawl crookedly put on why continued she lowering her voice i know of a house to which lord hollingford will never be asked again because he didnt wipe his shoes on both the mats in the hall now you must tell me what your dear father dislikes most in these fanciful ways and i shall take care to avoid it you must be my little friend and helper in pleasing him it will be such a pleasure to me to attend to his slightest fancies about my dress toowhat colours does he like best i want to do everything in my power with a view to his approval molly was gratified by all this and began to think that really after all perhaps her father had done well for himself and that if she could help towards his new happiness she ought to do it so she tried very conscientiously to think over mr gibsons wishes and ways to ponder over what annoyed him the most in his household i think said she papa isnt particular about many things but i think our not having the dinner quite punctualquite ready for him when he comes in fidgets him more than anything you see he has often had a long ride and there is another long ride to come and he has only halfanhoursometimes only a quarterto eat his dinner in thank you my own love punctuality yes its a great thing in a household its what ive had to enforce with my young ladies at ashcombe no wonder poor dear mr gibson has been displeased at his dinner not being ready and he so hardworked papa doesnt care what he has if its only ready he would take breadandcheese if cook would only send it in instead of dinner breadandcheese does mr gibson eat cheese yes hes very fond of it said molly innocently ive known him eat toasted cheese when he has been too tired to fancy anything else oh but my dear we must change all that i shouldnt like to think of your father eating cheese its such a strongsmelling coarse kind of thing we must get him a cook who can toss him up an omelette or something elegant cheese is only fit for the kitchen papa is very fond of it persevered molly oh but we will cure him of that i couldnt bear the smell of cheese and im sure he would be sorry to annoy me molly was silent it did not do she found to be too minute in telling about her fathers likes or dislikes she had better leave them for mrs kirkpatrick to find out for herself it was an awkward pause each was trying to find something agreeable to say molly spoke at length please i should so like to know something about cynthiayour daughter yes call her cynthia its a pretty name isnt it cynthia kirkpatrick not so pretty though as my old name hyacinth clare people used to say it suited me so well i must show you an acrostic that a gentlemanhe was a lieutenant in the rdmade upon it oh we shall have a great deal to say to each other i foresee but about cynthia oh yes about dear cynthia what do you want to know my dear papa said she was to live with us when will she come oh was it not sweet of your kind father i thought of nothing else but cynthias going out as a governess when she had completed her education she has been brought up for it and has had great advantages but good dear mr gibson wouldnt hear of it he said yesterday that she must come and live with us when she left school when will she leave school she went for two years i dont think i must let her leave before next summer she teaches english as well as learning french next summer she shall come home and then shant we be a happy little quartette i hope so said molly but she is to come to the wedding isnt she she went on timidly not knowing how far mrs kirkpatrick would like the allusion to her marriage your father has begged for her to come but we must think about it a little more before quite fixing it the journey is a great expense is she like you i do so want to see her she is very handsome people say in the brightcoloured styleperhaps something like what i was but i like the darkhaired foreign kind of beauty bestjust now touching mollys hair and looking at her with an expression of sentimental remembrance does cynthiais she very clever and accomplished asked molly a little afraid lest the answer should remove miss kirkpatrick at too great a distance from her she ought to be ive paid ever so much money to have her taught by the best masters but you will see her before long and im afraid we must go now to lady cumnor it has been very charming having you all to myself but i know lady cumnor will be expecting us now and she was very curious to see youmy future daughter as she calls you molly followed mrs kirkpatrick into the morningroom where lady cumnor was sittinga little annoyed because having completed her toilette earlier than usual clare had not been aware by instinct of the fact and so had not brought molly gibson for inspection a quarter of an hour before every small occurrence is an event in the day of a convalescent invalid and a little while ago molly would have met with patronizing appreciation where now she had to encounter criticism of lady cumnors character as an individual she knew nothing she only knew she was going to see and be seen by a live countess nay more by the countess of hollingford mrs kirkpatrick led her into lady cumnors presence by the hand and in presenting her saidmy dear little daughter lady cumnor now clare dont let me have nonsense she is not your daughter yet and may never bei believe that onethird of the engagements i have heard of have never come to marriages miss gibson i am very glad to see you for your fathers sake when i know you better i hope it will be for your own molly very heartily hoped that she might never be known any better by the sternlooking lady who sate so upright in the easy chair prepared for lounging and which therefore gave all the more effect to the stiff attitude lady cumnor luckily took mollys silence for acquiescent humility and went on speaking after a further little pause of inspection yes yes i like her looks clare you may make something of her it will be a great advantage to you my dear to have a lady who has trained up several young people of quality always about you just at the time when you are growing up ill tell you what clarea sudden thought striking heryou and she must become better acquaintedyou know nothing of each other at present you are not to be married till christmas and what could be better than that she should go back with you to ashcombe she would be with you constantly and have the advantage of the companionship of your young people which would be a good thing for an only child its a capital plan im very glad i thought of it now it would be difficult to say which of lady cumnors two hearers was the most dismayed at the idea which had taken possession of her mrs kirkpatrick had no fancy for being encumbered with a stepdaughter before her time if molly came to be an inmate of her house farewell to many little background economies and a still more serious farewell to many little indulgences that were innocent enough in themselves but which mrs kirkpatricks former life had caused her to look upon as sins to be concealed the dirty dogseared delightful novel from the ashcombe circulating library the leaves of which she turned over with a pair of scissors the loungingchair which she had for use at her own home straight and upright as she sate now in lady cumnors presence the dainty morsel savoury and small to which she treated herself for her own solitary supperall these and many other similarly pleasant things would have to be foregone if molly came to be her pupil parlourboarder or visitor as lady cumnor was planning onetwo things clare was instinctively resolved upon to be married at michaelmas and not to have molly at ashcombe but she smiled as sweetly as if the plan proposed was the most charming project in the world while all the time her poor brains were beating about in every bush for the reasons or excuses of which she should make use at some future time molly however saved her all this trouble it was a question which of the three was the most surprised by the words which burst out of her lips she did not mean to speak but her heart was very full and almost before she was aware of her thought she heard herself saying i dont think it would be nice at all i mean my lady that i should dislike it very much it would be taking me away from papa just these very few last months i will like you she went on her eyes full of tears and turning to mrs kirkpatrick she put her hand into her future stepmothers with the prettiest and most trustful action i will try hard to love you and to do all i can to make you happy but you must not take me away from papa just this very last bit of time that i shall have him mrs kirkpatrick fondled the hand thus placed in hers and was grateful to the girl for her outspoken opposition to lady cumnors plan clare was however exceedingly unwilling to back up molly by any words of her own until lady cumnor had spoken and given the cue but there was something in mollys little speech or in her straightforward manner that amused instead of irritating lady cumnor in her present mood perhaps she was tired of the silkiness with which she had been shut up for so many days she put up her glasses and looked at them both before speaking then she saidupon my word young lady why clare youve got your work before you not but what there is a good deal of truth in what she says it must be very disagreeable to a girl of her age to have a stepmother coming in between her father and herself whatever may be the advantages to her in the long run molly almost felt as if she could make a friend of the stiff old countess for her clearness of sight as to the plan proposed being a trial but she was afraid in her newborn desire of thinking for others of mrs kirkpatrick being hurt she need not have feared as far as outward signs went for the smile was still on that ladys pretty rosy lips and the soft fondling of her hand never stopped lady cumnor was more interested in molly the more she looked at her and her gaze was pretty steady through her goldrimmed eyeglasses she began a sort of catechism a string of very straightforward questions such as any lady under the rank of countess might have scrupled to ask but which were not unkindly meant you are sixteen are you not no i am seventeen my birthday was three weeks ago very much the same thing i should think have you ever been to school no never miss eyre has taught me everything i know umph miss eyre was your governess i suppose i should not have thought your father could have afforded to keep a governess but of course he must know his own affairs best certainly my lady replied molly a little touchy as to any reflections on her fathers wisdom you say certainly as if it was a matter of course that every one should know their own affairs best you are very young miss gibsonvery youll know better before you come to my age and i suppose youve been taught music and the use of globes and french and all the usual accomplishments since you have had a governess i never heard of such nonsense she went on lashing herself up an only daughter if there had been halfadozen there might have been some sense in it molly did not speak but it was by a strong effort that she kept silence mrs kirkpatrick fondled her hand more perseveringly than ever hoping thus to express a sufficient amount of sympathy to prevent her from saying anything injudicious but the caress had become wearisome to molly and only irritated her nerves she took her hand out of mrs kirkpatricks with a slight manifestation of impatience it was perhaps fortunate for the general peace that just at this moment mr gibson was announced it is odd enough to see how the entrance of a person of the opposite sex into an assemblage of either men or women calms down the little discordances and the disturbance of mood it was the case now at mr gibsons entrance my lady took off her glasses and smoothed her brow mrs kirkpatrick managed to get up a very becoming blush and as for molly her face glowed with delight and the white teeth and pretty dimples came out like sunlight on a landscape of course after the first greeting my lady had to have a private interview with her doctor and molly and her future stepmother wandered about in the gardens with their arms round each others waists or hand in hand like two babes in the wood mrs kirkpatrick active in such endearments molly passive and feeling within herself very shy and strange for she had that particular kind of shy modesty which makes any one uncomfortable at receiving caresses from a person towards whom the heart does not go forth with an impulsive welcome then came the early dinner lady cumnor having hers in the quiet of her own room to which she was still a prisoner once or twice during the meal the idea crossed mollys mind that her father disliked his position as a middleaged lover being made so evident to the men in waiting as it was by mrs kirkpatricks affectionate speeches and innuendos he tried to banish every tint of pink sentimentalism from the conversation and to confine it to matter of fact and when mrs kirkpatrick would persevere in referring to such things as had a bearing on the future relationship of the parties he insisted upon viewing them in the most matteroffact way and this continued even after the men had left the room an old rhyme molly had heard betty use would keep running in her head and making her uneasy two is company three is trumpery but where could she go to in that strange house what ought she to do she was roused from this fit of wonder and abstraction by her fathers sayingwhat do you think of this plan of lady cumnors she says she was advising you to have molly as a visitor at ashcombe until we are married mrs kirkpatricks countenance fell if only molly would be so good as to testify again as she had done before lady cumnor but if the proposal was made by her father it would come to his daughter from a different quarter than it had done from a strange lady be she ever so great molly did not say anything she only looked pale and wistful and anxious mrs kirkpatrick had to speak for herself it would be a charming plan onlywell we know why we would rather not have it dont we love and we wont tell papa for fear of making him vain no i think i must leave her with you dear mr gibson to have you all to herself for these last few weeks it would be cruel to take her away but you know my dear i told you of the reason why it does not do to have molly at home just at present said mr gibson eagerly for the more he knew of his future wife the more he felt it necessary to remember that with all her foibles she would be able to stand between molly and any such adventures as that which had occurred lately with mr coxe so that one of the good reasons for the step he had taken was always present to him while it had slipped off the smooth surface of mrs kirkpatricks mirrorlike mind without leaving any impression she now recalled it on seeing mr gibsons anxious face but what were mollys feelings at these last words of her fathers she had been sent from home for some reason kept a secret from her but told to this strange woman was there to be perfect confidence between these two and she to be for ever shut out was she and what concerned herthough how she did not knowto be discussed between them for the future and she to be kept in the dark a bitter pang of jealousy made her heartsick she might as well go to ashcombe or anywhere else now thinking more of others happiness than of her own was very fine but did it not mean giving up her very individuality quenching all the warm love the true desires that made her herself yet in this deadness lay her only comfort or so it seemed wandering in such mazes she hardly knew how the conversation went on a third was indeed trumpery where there was entire confidence between the two who were company from which the other was shut out she was positively unhappy and her father did not appear to see it he was absorbed with his new plans and his new wife that was to be but he did notice it and was truly sorry for his little girl only he thought that there was a greater chance for the future harmony of the household if he did not lead molly to define her present feelings by putting them into words it was his general plan to repress emotion by not showing the sympathy he felt yet when he had to leave he took mollys hand in his and held it there in such a different manner to that in which mrs kirkpatrick had done and his voice softened to his child as he bade her goodby and added the words most unusual to him god bless you child molly had held up all the day bravely she had not shown anger or repugnance or annoyance or regret but when once more by herself in the hamley carriage she burst into a passion of tears and cried her fill till she reached the village of hamley then she tried in vain to smooth her face into smiles and do away with the other signs of her grief she only hoped she could run upstairs to her own room without notice and bathe her eyes in cold water before she was seen but at the halldoor she was caught by the squire and roger coming in from an afterdinner stroll in the garden and hospitably anxious to help her to alight roger saw the state of things in an instant and saying my mother has been looking for you to come back for this last hour he led the way to the drawingroom but mrs hamley was not there the squire had stopped to speak to the coachman about one of the horses they two were alone roger said im afraid youve had a very trying day i have thought of you several times for i know how awkward these new relations are thank you said she her lips trembling and on the point of crying again i did try to remember what you said and to think more of others but it is so difficult sometimes you know it is dont you yes said he gravely he was gratified by her simple confession of having borne his words of advice in mind and tried to act up to them he was but a very young man and he was honestly flattered perhaps this led him on to offer more advice and this time it was evidently mingled with sympathy he did not want to draw out her confidence which he felt might very easily be done with such a simple girl but he wished to help her by giving her a few of the principles on which he had learnt to rely it is difficult he went on but byandby you will be so much happier for it no i shant said molly shaking her head it will be very dull when i shall have killed myself as it were and live only in trying to do and to be as other people like i dont see any end to it i might as well never have lived and as for the happiness you speak of i shall never be happy again there was an unconscious depth in what she said that roger did not know how to answer at the moment it was easier to address himself to the assertion of the girl of seventeen that she should never be happy again nonsense perhaps in ten years time you will be looking back on this trial as a very light onewho knows i daresay it seems foolish perhaps all our earthly trials will appear foolish to us after a while perhaps they seem so now to angels but we are ourselves you know and this is now not some time to come a long long way off and we are not angels to be comforted by seeing the ends for which everything is sent she had never spoken so long a sentence to him before and when she had said it though she did not take her eyes away from his as they stood steadily looking at each other she blushed a little she could not have told why nor did he tell himself why a sudden pleasure came over him as he gazed at her simple expressive faceand for a moment lost the sense of what she was saying in the sensation of pity for her sad earnestness in an instant more he was himself again only it is pleasant to the wisest most reasonable youth of one or two and twenty to find himself looked up to as a mentor by a girl of seventeen i know i understand yes it is now we have to do with dont let us go into metaphysics molly opened her eyes wide at this had she been talking metaphysics without knowing it one looks forward to a mass of trials which will only have to be encountered one by one little by little oh here is my mother she will tell you better than i can and the ttette was merged in a trio mrs hamley lay down she had not been well all dayshe had missed molly she saidand now she wanted to hear of all the adventures that had occurred to the girl at the towers molly sate on a stool close to the head of the sofa and roger though at first he took up a book and tried to read that he might be no restraint soon found his reading all a pretence it was so interesting to listen to mollys little narrative and besides if he could give her any help in her time of need was it not his duty to make himself acquainted with all the circumstances of her case and so they went on during all the remaining time of mollys stay at hamley mrs hamley sympathized and liked to hear details as the french say her sympathy was given en dtail the squires en gros he was very sorry for her evident grief and almost felt guilty as if he had had a share in bringing it about by the mention he had made of the possibility of mr gibsons marrying again when first molly came on her visit to them he said to his wife more than once pon my word now i wish id never spoken those unlucky words that first day at dinner do you remember how she took them up it was like a prophecy of what was to come now wasnt it and she looked pale from that day and i dont think she has ever fairly enjoyed her food since i must take more care what i say for the future not but what gibson is doing the very best thing both for himself and her that he can do i told him so only yesterday but im very sorry for the little girl though i wish id never spoken about it that i do but it was like a prophecy wasnt it roger tried hard to find out a reasonable and right method of comfort for he too in his way was sorry for the girl who bravely struggled to be cheerful in spite of her own private grief for his mothers sake he felt as if high principle and noble precept ought to perform an immediate work but they do not for there is always the unknown quantity of individual experience and feeling which offer a tacit resistance the amount incalculable by another to all good counsel and high decree but the bond between the mentor and his telemachus strengthened every day he endeavoured to lead her out of morbid thought into interest in other than personal things and naturally enough his own objects of interest came readiest to hand she felt that he did her good she did not know why or how but after a talk with him she always fancied that she had got the clue to goodness and peace whatever befell chapter xii preparing for the wedding illustration untitled meanwhile the loveaffairs between the middleaged couple were prospering well after a fashion after the fashion that they liked best although it might probably have appeared dull and prosaic to younger people lord cumnor had come down in great glee at the news he had heard from his wife at the towers he too seemed to think he had taken an active part in bringing about the match by only speaking about it his first words on the subject to lady cumnor were i told you so now didnt i say what a good suitable thing this affair between gibson and clare would be i dont know when ive been so much pleased you may despise the trade of matchmaker my lady but i am very proud of it after this i shall go on looking out for suitable cases among the middleaged people of my acquaintance i shant meddle with young folks they are so apt to be fanciful but ive been so successful in this that i do think its good encouragement to go on go onwith what asked lady cumnor drily oh planningyou cant deny that i planned this match i dont think you are likely to do either much good or harm by planning she replied with cool good sense it puts it into peoples heads my dear yes if you speak about your plans to them of course it does but in this case you never spoke to either mr gibson or clare did you all at once the recollection of how clare had come upon the passage in lord cumnors letter flashed on his lady but she did not say anything about it but left her husband to flounder about as best he might no i never spoke to them of course not then you must be strongly mesmeric and your will acted upon theirs if you are to take credit for any part in the affair continued his pitiless wife i really cant say its no use looking back to what i said or did im very well satisfied with it and thats enough and i mean to show them how much im pleased i shall give clare something towards her rigging out and they shall have a breakfast at ashcombe manorhouse ill write to preston about it when did you say they were to be married i think theyd better wait till christmas and i have told them so it would amuse the children going over to ashcombe for the wedding and if its bad weather during the holidays im always afraid of their finding it dull at the towers its very different if its a good frost and they can go out skating and sledging in the park but these last two years it has been so wet for them poor dears and will the other poor dears be content to wait to make a holiday for your grandchildren to make a roman holiday pope or somebody else has a line of poetry like that to make a roman holidayhe repeated pleased with his unusual aptitude at quotation its byron and its nothing to do with the subject in hand im surprised at your lordships quoting byronhe was a very immoral poet i saw him take his oaths in the house of lords said lord cumnor apologetically well the less said about him the better said lady cumnor i have told clare that she had better not think of being married before christmas and it wont do for her to give up her school in a hurry either but clare did not intend to wait till christmas and for this once she carried her point against the will of the countess and without many words or any open opposition she had a harder task in setting aside mr gibsons desire to have cynthia over for the wedding even if she went back to her school at boulogne directly after the ceremony at first she had said that it would be delightful a charming plan only she feared that she must give up her own wishes to have her child near her at such a time on account of the expense of the double journey but mr gibson economical as he was in his habitual expenditure had a really generous heart he had already shown it in entirely relinquishing his future wifes lifeinterest in the very small property the late mr kirkpatrick had left in favour of cynthia while he arranged that she should come to his home as a daughter as soon as she left the school she was at the lifeinterest was about thirty pounds a year now he gave mrs kirkpatrick three fivepound notes saying that he hoped they would do away with the objections to cynthias coming over to the wedding and at the time mrs kirkpatrick felt as if they would and caught the reflection of his strong wish and fancied it was her own if the letter could have been written and the money sent off that day while the reflected glow of affection lasted cynthia would have been bridesmaid to her mother but a hundred little interruptions came in the way of letterwriting and by the next day maternal love had diminished and the value affixed to the money had increased money had been so much needed so hardly earned in mrs kirkpatricks life while the perhaps necessary separation of mother and child had lessened the amount of affection the former had to bestow so she persuaded herself afresh that it would be unwise to disturb cynthia at her studies to interrupt the fulfilment of her duties just after the semestre had begun afresh and she wrote a letter to madame lefevre so well imbued with this persuasion that an answer which was almost an echo of her words was returned the sense of which being conveyed to mr gibson who was no great french scholar settled the vexed question to his moderate but unfeigned regret but the fifteen pounds were not returned indeed not merely that sum but a great part of the hundred which lord cumnor had given her for her trousseau was required to pay off debts at ashcombe for the school had been anything but flourishing since mrs kirkpatrick had had it it was really very much to her credit that she preferred clearing herself from debt to purchasing wedding finery but it was one of the few points to be respected in mrs kirkpatrick that she had always been careful in payment to the shops where she dealt it was a little sense of duty cropping out whatever other faults might arise from her superficial and flimsy character she was always uneasy till she was out of debt yet she had no scruple in appropriating her future husbands money to her own use when it was decided that it was not to be employed as he intended what new articles she bought for herself were all such as would make a show and an impression upon the ladies of hollingford she argued with herself that linen and all underclothing would never be seen while she knew that every gown she had would give rise to much discussion and would be counted up in the little town so her stock of underclothing was very small and scarcely any of it new but it was made of dainty material and was finely mended up by her deft fingers many a night long after her pupils were in bed inwardly resolving all the time she sewed that hereafter some one else should do her plainwork indeed many a little circumstance of former subjection to the will of others rose up before her during these quiet hours as an endurance or a suffering never to occur again so apt are people to look forward to a different kind of life from that to which they have been accustomed as being free from care and trial she recollected how one time during this very summer at the towers after she was engaged to mr gibson when she had taken above an hour to arrange her hair in some new mode carefully studied from mrs bradleys fashionbookafter all when she came down looking her very best as she thought and ready for her lover lady cumnor had sent her back again to her room just as if she had been a little child to do her hair over again and not to make such a figure of fun of herself another time she had been sent to change her gown for one in her opinion far less becoming but which suited lady cumnors taste better these were little things but they were late samples of what in different shapes she had had to endure for many years and her liking for mr gibson grew in proportion to her sense of the evils from which he was going to serve as a means of escape after all that interval of hope and plainsewing intermixed though it was with tuition was not disagreeable her weddingdress was secure her former pupils at the towers were going to present her with that they were to dress her from head to foot on the auspicious day lord cumnor as has been said had given her a hundred pounds for her trousseau and had sent mr preston a carteblanche order for the weddingbreakfast in the old hall in ashcombe manorhouse lady cumnora little put out by the marriage not being deferred till her grandchildrens christmas holidayshad nevertheless given mrs kirkpatrick an excellent englishmade watch and chain more clumsy but more serviceable than the little foreign elegance that had hung at her side so long and misled her so often her preparations were thus in a very considerable state of forwardness while mr gibson had done nothing as yet towards any new arrangement or decoration of his house for his intended bride he knew he ought to do something but what where to begin when so much was out of order and he had so little time for superintendence at length he came to the wise decision of asking one of the miss brownings for old friendships sake to take the trouble of preparing what was immediately requisite and resolved to leave all the more ornamental decorations that he proposed to the taste of his future wife but before making his request to the miss brownings he had to tell them of his engagement which had hitherto been kept a secret from the townspeople who had set down his frequent visits at the towers to the score of the countesss health he felt how he should have laughed in his sleeve at any middleaged widower who came to him with a confession of the kind he had now to make to miss brownings and disliked the idea of the necessary call but it was to be done so one evening he went in promiscuous as they called it and told them his story at the end of the first chapterthat is to say at the end of the story of mr coxes calflove miss browning held up her hands in surprise to think of molly as i have held in longclothes coming to have a lover well to be sure sister phoebe she was just coming into the room heres a piece of news molly gibson has got a lover one may almost say shes had an offer mr gibson may not oneand shes but sixteen seventeen sister said miss phoebe who piqued herself on knowing all about dear mr gibsons domestic affairs seventeen the nd of last june well have it your own way seventeen if you like to call her so said miss browning impatiently the fact is still the sameshes got a lover and it seems to me she was in longclothes only yesterday im sure i hope her course of true love will run smooth said miss phoebe now mr gibson came in for his story was not half told and he did not want them to run away too far with the idea of mollys loveaffair molly knows nothing about it i havent even named it to any one but you two and to one other friend i trounced coxe well and did my best to keep his attachmentas he calls itin bounds but i was sadly puzzled what to do about molly miss eyre was away and i couldnt leave them in the house together without any older woman oh mr gibson why did you not send her to us broke in miss browning we would have done anything in our power for you for your sake as well as her poor dear mothers thank you i know you would but it wouldnt have done to have had her in hollingford just at the time of coxes effervescence hes better now his appetite has come back with double force after the fasting he thought it right to exhibit he had three helpings of blackcurrant dumpling yesterday i am sure you are most liberal mr gibson three helpings and i daresay butchers meat in proportion oh i only named it because with such very young men its generally seesaw between appetite and love and i thought the third helping a very good sign but still you know what has happened once may happen again i dont know phoebe had an offer of marriage once said miss browning hush sister it might hurt his feelings to have it spoken about nonsense child its fiveandtwenty years ago and his eldest daughter is married herself i own he has not been constant pleaded miss phoebe in her tender piping voice all men are notlike you mr gibsonfaithful to the memory of their firstlove mr gibson winced jeannie was his first love but her name had never been breathed in hollingford his wifegood pretty sensible and beloved as she had beenwas not his second no nor his third love and now he was come to make a confidence about his second marriage well well said he at any rate i thought i must do something to protect molly from such affairs while she was so young and before i had given my sanction miss eyres little nephew fell ill of scarlet fever ah bytheby how careless of me not to inquire how is the poor little fellow worsebetter it doesnt signify to what ive got to say now the fact was miss eyre couldnt come back to my house for some time and i cannot leave molly altogether at hamley ah i see now why there was that sudden visit to hamley upon my word its quite a romance i do like hearing of a loveaffair murmured miss phoebe then if youll let me get on with my story you shall hear of mine said mr gibson quite beyond his patience with their constant interruptions yours said miss phoebe faintly bless us and save us said miss browning with less sentiment in her tone what next my marriage i hope said mr gibson choosing to take her expression of intense surprise literally and thats what i came to speak to you about a little hope darted up in miss phoebes breast she had often said to her sister in the confidence of curlingtime ladies wore curls in those days that the only man who could ever bring her to think of matrimony was mr gibson but that if he ever proposed she should feel bound to accept him for poor dear marys sake never explaining what exact style of satisfaction she imagined she should give to her dead friend by marrying her late husband phoebe played nervously with the strings of her black silk apron like the caliph in the eastern story a whole lifetime of possibilities passed through her mind in an instant of which possibilities the question of questions was could she leave her sister attend phoebe to the present moment and listen to what is being said before you distress yourself with a perplexity which will never arise of course it has been an anxious thing for me to decide who i should ask to be the mistress of my family the mother of my girl but i think ive decided rightly at last the lady i have chosen tell us at once who she is theres a good man said straightforward miss browning mrs kirkpatrick said the bridegroom elect what the governess at the towers that the countess makes so much of yes she is much valued by themand deservedly so she keeps a school now at ashcombe and is accustomed to housekeeping she has brought up the young ladies at the towers and has a daughter of her own therefore it is probable she will have a kind motherly feeling towards molly shes a very elegantlooking woman said miss phoebe feeling it incumbent upon her to say something laudatory by way of concealing the thoughts that had just been passing through her mind ive seen her in the carriage riding backwards with the countess a very pretty woman i should say nonsense sister said miss browning what has her elegance or prettiness to do with the affair did you ever know a widower marry again for such trifles as those its always from a sense of duty of one kind or anotherisnt it mr gibson they want a housekeeper or they want a mother for their children or they think their last wife would have liked it perhaps the thought had passed through the elder sisters mind that phoebe might have been chosen for there was a sharp acrimony in her tone not unfamiliar to mr gibson but with which he did not choose to cope at this present moment you must have it your own way miss browning settle my motives for me i dont pretend to be quite clear about them myself but i am clear in wishing heartily to keep my old friends and for them to love my future wife for my sake i dont know any two women in the world except molly and mrs kirkpatrick i regard as much as i do you besides i want to ask you if you will let molly come and stay with you till after my marriage you might have asked us before you asked madam hamley said miss browning only half mollified we are your old friends and we were her mothers friends too though we are not county folk thats unjust said mr gibson and you know it is i dont know you are always with lord hollingford when you can get at him much more than you ever are with mr goodenough or mr smith and you are always going over to hamley miss browning was not one to give in all at once i seek lord hollingford as i should seek such a man whatever his rank or position might be usher to a school carpenter shoemaker if it were possible for them to have had a similar character of mind developed by similar advantages mr goodenough is a very clever attorney with strong local interests and not a thought beyond well well dont go on arguing it always gives me a headache as phoebe knows i didnt mean what i said thats enough isnt it ill retract anything sooner than be reasoned with where were we before you began your arguments about dear little molly coming to pay us a visit said miss phoebe i should have asked you at first only coxe was so rampant with his love i didnt know what he might do or how troublesome he might be both to molly and you but he has cooled down now absence has had a very tranquillizing effect and i think molly may be in the same town with him without any consequences beyond a few sighs every time shes brought to his mind by meeting her and ive got another favour to ask of you so you see it would never do for me to argue with you miss browning when i ought to be a humble suppliant something must be done to the house to make it all ready for the future mrs gibson it wants painting and papering shamefully and i should think some new furniture but im sure i dont know what would you be so very kind as to look over the place and see how far a hundred pounds will go the diningroom walls must be painted well keep the drawingroom paper for her choice and ive a little spare money for that room for her to lay out but all the rest of the house ill leave to you if youll only be kind enough to help an old friend this was a commission which exactly gratified miss brownings love of power the disposal of money involved patronage of trades people such as she had exercised in her fathers lifetime but had had very little chance of showing since his death her usual goodhumour was quite restored by this proof of confidence in her taste and economy while miss phoebes imagination dwelt rather on the pleasure of a visit from molly chapter xiii molly gibsons new friends time was speeding on it was now the middle of augustif anything was to be done to the house it must be done at once indeed in several ways mr gibsons arrangements with miss browning had not been made too soon the squire had heard that osborne might probably return home for a few days before going abroad and though the growing intimacy between roger and molly did not alarm him in the least yet he was possessed by a very hearty panic lest the heir might take a fancy to the surgeons daughter and he was in such a fidget for her to leave the house before osborne came home that his wife lived in constant terror lest he should make it too obvious to their visitor every young girl of seventeen or so who is at all thoughtful is very apt to make a pope out of the first person who presents to her a new or larger system of duty than that by which she has been unconsciously guided hitherto such a pope was roger to molly she looked to his opinion to his authority on almost every subject yet he had only said one or two things in a terse manner which gave them the force of preceptsstable guides to her conductand had shown the natural superiority in wisdom and knowledge which is sure to exist between a highly educated young man of no common intelligence and an ignorant girl of seventeen who yet was well capable of appreciation still although they were drawn together in this very pleasant relationship each was imagining some one very different for the future owner of their whole hearttheir highest and completest love roger looked to find a grand woman his equal and his empress beautiful in person serene in wisdom ready for counsel as was egeria mollys little wavering maiden fancy dwelt on the unseen osborne who was now a troubadour and now a knight such as he wrote about in one of his own poems some one like osborne perhaps rather than osborne himself for she shrank from giving a personal form and name to the hero that was to be the squire was not unwise in wishing her well out of the house before osborne came home if he was considering her peace of mind yet when she went away from the hall he missed her constantly it had been so pleasant to have her there fulfilling all the pretty offices of a daughter cheering the meals so often ttette betwixt him and roger with her innocent wise questions her lively interest in their talk her merry replies to his banter and roger missed her too sometimes her remarks had probed into his mind and excited him to the deep thought in which he delighted at other times he had felt himself of real help to her in her hours of need and in making her take an interest in books which treated of higher things than the continual fiction and poetry which she had hitherto read he felt something like an affectionate tutor suddenly deprived of his most promising pupil he wondered how she would go on without him whether she would be puzzled and disheartened by the books he had lent her to read how she and her stepmother would get along together she occupied his thoughts a good deal those first few days after she left the hall mrs hamley regretted her more and longer than did the other two she had given her the place of a daughter in her heart and now she missed the sweet feminine companionship the playful caresses the neverceasing attentions the very need of sympathy in her sorrows that molly had shown so openly from time to time all these things had extremely endeared her to the tenderhearted mrs hamley molly too felt the change of atmosphere keenly and she blamed herself for so feeling even more keenly still but she could not help having a sense of refinement which had made her appreciate the whole manner of being at the hall by her dear old friends the miss brownings she was petted and caressed so much that she became ashamed of noticing the coarser and louder tones in which they spoke the provincialism of their pronunciation the absence of interest in things and their greediness of details about persons they asked her questions which she was puzzled enough to answer about her future stepmother her loyalty to her father forbidding her to reply fully and truthfully she was always glad when they began to make inquiries as to every possible affair at the hall she had been so happy there she had liked them all down to the very dogs so thoroughly that it was easy work replying she did not mind telling them everything even to the style of mrs hamleys invalid dress nor what wine the squire drank at dinner indeed talking about these things helped her to recall the happiest time in her life but one evening as they were all sitting together after tea in the little upstairs drawingroom looking into the high streetmolly discoursing away on the various pleasures of hamley hall and just then telling of all rogers wisdom in natural science and some of the curiosities he had shown her she was suddenly pulled up by this little speech you seem to have seen a great deal of mr roger molly said miss browning in a way intended to convey a great deal of meaning to her sister and none at all to molly but the man recovered of the bite the dog it was that died molly was perfectly aware of miss brownings emphatic tone though at first she was perplexed as to its cause while miss phoebe was just then too much absorbed in knitting the heel of her stocking to be fully alive to her sisters nods and winks yes he was very kind to me said molly slowly pondering over miss brownings manner and unwilling to say more until she had satisfied herself to what the question tended i daresay you will soon be going to hamley hall again hes not the eldest son you know phoebe dont make my head ache with your eternal eighteen nineteen but attend to the conversation molly is telling us how much she saw of mr roger and how kind he was to her ive always heard he was a very nice young man my dear tell us some more about him now phoebe attend how was he kind to you molly oh he told me what books to read and one day he made me notice how many bees i saw bees child what do you mean either you or he must have been crazy no not at all there are more than two hundred kinds of bees in england and he wanted me to notice the difference between them and flies miss browning i cant help seeing what you fancy said molly as red as fire but it is very wrong it is all a mistake i wont speak another word about mr roger or hamley at all if it puts such silly notions into your head hightytighty heres a young lady to be lecturing her elders silly notions indeed they are in your head it seems and let me tell you molly you are too young to let your mind be running on lovers molly had been once or twice called saucy and impertinent and certainly a little sauciness came out now i never said what the silly notion was miss browning did i now miss phoebe dont you see dear miss phoebe it is all her own interpretation and according to her own fancy this foolish talk about lovers molly was flaming with indignation but she had appealed to the wrong person for justice miss phoebe tried to make peace after the fashion of weakminded people who would cover over the unpleasant sight of a sore instead of trying to heal it im sure i dont know anything about it my dear it seems to me that what dorothy was saying was very truevery true indeed and i think love you misunderstood her or perhaps she misunderstood you or i may be misunderstanding it altogether so wed better not talk any more about it what price did you say you were going to give for the drugget in mr gibsons diningroom sister so miss browning and molly went on till evening each chafed and angry with the other they wished each other goodnight going through the usual forms in the coolest manner possible molly went up to her little bedroom clean and neat as a bedroom could be with draperies of small delicate patchworkbedcurtains windowcurtains and counterpane a japanned toilettetable full of little boxes with a small lookingglass affixed to it that distorted every face that was so unwise as to look in it this room had been to the child one of the most dainty and luxurious places ever seen in comparison with her own bare whitedimity bedroom and now she was sleeping in it as a guest and all the quaint adornments she had once peeped at as a great favour as they were carefully wrapped up in cappaper were set out for her use and yet how little she had deserved this hospitable care how impertinent she had been how cross she had felt ever since she was crying tears of penitence and youthful misery when there came a low tap to the door molly opened it and there stood miss browning in a wonderful erection of a nightcap and scantily attired in a coloured calico jacket over her scrimpy and short white petticoat i was afraid you were asleep child said she coming in and shutting the door but i wanted to say to you weve got wrong today somehow and i think it was perhaps my doing its as well phoebe shouldnt know for she thinks me perfect and when theres only two of us we get along better if one of us thinks the other can do no wrong but i rather think i was a little cross well not say any more about it molly only well go to sleep friendsand friends well always be child wont we now give me a kiss and dont cry and swell your eyes upand put out your candle carefully i was wrongit was my fault said molly kissing her fiddlestickends dont contradict me i say it was my fault and i wont hear another word about it the next day molly went with miss browning to see the changes going on in her fathers house to her they were but dismal improvements the faint grey of the diningroom walls which had harmonized well enough with the deep crimson of the moreen curtains and which when well cleaned looked thinly coated rather than dirty was now exchanged for a pink salmoncolour of a very glowing hue and the new curtains were of that pale seagreen just coming into fashion very bright and pretty miss browning called it and in the first renewing of their love molly could not bear to contradict her she could only hope that the green and brown drugget would tone down the brightness and prettiness there was scaffolding here scaffolding there and betty scolding everywhere come up now and see your papas bedroom hes sleeping upstairs in yours that everything may be done up afresh in his molly could just remember in faint clear lines of distinctness the being taken into this very room to bid farewell to her dying mother she could see the white linen the white muslin surrounding the pale wan wistful face with the large longing eyes yearning for one more touch of the little soft warm child whom she was too feeble to clasp in her arms already growing numb in death many a time when molly had been in this room since that sad day had she seen in vivid fancy that same wan wistful face lying on the pillow the outline of the form beneath the clothes and the girl had not shrunk from such visions but rather cherished them as preserving to her the remembrance of her mothers outward semblance her eyes were full of tears as she followed miss browning into this room to see it under its new aspect nearly everything was changedthe position of the bed and the colour of the furniture there was a grand toilettetable now with a glass upon it instead of the primitive substitute of the top of a chest of drawers with a mirror above upon the wall sloping downwards these latter things had served her mother during her short married life you see we must have all in order for a lady who has passed so much of her time in the countesss mansion said miss browning who was now quite reconciled to the marriage thanks to the pleasant employment of furnishing that had devolved upon her in consequence cromer the upholsterer wanted to persuade me to have a sofa and a writingtable these men will say anything is the fashion if they want to sell an article i said no no cromer bedrooms are for sleeping in and sittingrooms are for sitting in keep everything to its right purpose and dont try and delude me into nonsense why my mother would have given us a fine scolding if she had ever caught us in our bedrooms in the daytime we kept our outdoor things in a closet downstairs and there was a very tidy place for washing our hands which is as much as one wants in the daytime stuffing up a bedroom with sofas and tables i never heard of such a thing besides a hundred pounds wont last for ever i shant be able to do anything for your room molly im right down glad of it said molly nearly everything in it was what mamma had when she lived with my greatuncle i wouldnt have had it changed for the world i am so fond of it well theres no danger of it now the money is run out by the way molly whos to buy you a bridesmaids dress i dont know said molly i suppose i am to be a bridesmaid but no one has spoken to me about my dress then i shall ask your papa please dont he must have to spend a great deal of money just now besides i would rather not be at the wedding if theyll let me stay away nonsense child why all the town would be talking of it you must go and you must be well dressed for your fathers sake but mr gibson had thought of mollys dress although he had said nothing about it to her he had commissioned his future wife to get her what was requisite and presently a very smart dressmaker came over from the countytown to try on a dress which was both so simple and so elegant as at once to charm molly when it came home all ready to put on molly had a private dressingup for the miss brownings benefit and she was almost startled when she looked into the glass and saw the improvement in her appearance i wonder if im pretty thought she i almost think i amin this kind of dress i mean of course betty would say fine feathers make fine birds when she went downstairs in her bridal attire and with shy blushes presented herself for inspection she was greeted with a burst of admiration well upon my word i shouldnt have known you fine feathers thought molly and checked her rising vanity you are really beautifulisnt she sister said miss phoebe why my dear if you were always dressed you would be prettier than your dear mamma whom we always reckoned so very personable youre not a bit like her you favour your father and white always sets off a brown complexion but isnt she beautiful persevered miss phoebe well and if she is providence made her and not she herself besides the dressmaker must go shares what a fine india muslin it is itll have cost a pretty penny mr gibson and molly drove over to ashcombe the night before the wedding in the one yellow postchaise that hollingford possessed they were to be mr prestons or rather my lords guests at the manorhouse the manorhouse came up to its name and delighted molly at first sight it was built of stone had many gables and mullioned windows and was covered over with virginian creeper and lateblowing roses molly did not know mr preston who stood in the doorway to greet her father she took standing with him as a young lady at once and it was the first time she had met with the kind of behaviourhalf complimentary half flirtingwhich some men think it necessary to assume with every woman under fiveandtwenty mr preston was very handsome and knew it he was a fair man with lightbrown hair and whiskers grey roving wellshaped eyes with lashes darker than his hair and a figure rendered easy and supple by the athletic exercises in which his excellence was famous and which had procured him admission into much higher society than he was otherwise entitled to enter he was a capital cricketer was so good a shot that any house desirous of reputation for its bags on the th or the st was glad to have him for a guest he taught young ladies to play billiards on a wet day or went in for the game in serious earnest when required he knew half the private theatrical plays off by heart and was invaluable in arranging impromptu charades and tableaux he had his own private reasons for wishing to get up a flirtation with molly just at this time he had amused himself so much with the widow when she first came to ashcombe that he fancied that the sight of him standing by her less polished less handsome middleaged husband might be too much of a contrast to be agreeable besides he had really a strong passion for some one else some one who would be absent and that passion it was necessary for him to conceal so that altogether he had resolved even had the little gibsongirl as he called her been less attractive than she was to devote himself to her for the next sixteen hours they were taken by their host into a wainscoted parlour where a wood fire crackled and burnt and the crimson curtains shut out the waning day and the outer chill here the table was laid for dinner snowy tablelinen bright silver clear sparkling glass wine and an autumnal dessert on the sideboard yet mr preston kept apologizing to molly for the rudeness of his bachelor home for the smallness of the room the great diningroom being already appropriated by his housekeeper in preparation for the morrows breakfast and then he rang for a servant to show molly to her room she was taken into a most comfortable chamber a wood fire on the hearth candles lighted on the toilettetable dark woollen curtains surrounding a snowwhite bed great vases of china standing here and there this is my lady harriets room when her ladyship comes to the manorhouse with my lord the earl said the housemaid striking out thousands of brilliant sparks by a welldirected blow at a smouldering log shall i help you to dress miss i always helps her ladyship molly quite aware of the fact that she had but her white muslin gown for the wedding besides that she had on dismissed the good woman and was thankful to be left to herself dinner was it called why it was nearly eight oclock and preparations for bed seemed a more natural employment than dressing at this hour of night all the dressing she could manage was the placing of a red damask rose or two in the band of her grey stuff gown there being a great nosegay of choice autumnal flowers on the toilettetable she did try the effect of another crimson rose in her black hair just above her ear it was very pretty but too coquettish and so she put it back again the darkoak panels and wainscoting of the whole house seemed to glow in warm light there were so many fires in different rooms in the hall and even one on the landing of the staircase mr preston must have heard her step for he met her in the hall and led her into a small drawingroom with closed foldingdoors on one side opening into the larger drawingroom as he told her this room into which she entered reminded her a little of hamleyyellowsatin upholstery of seventy or a hundred years ago all delicately kept and scrupulously clean great indian cabinets and china jars emitting spicy odours a large blazing fire before which her father stood in his morning dress grave and thoughtful as he had been all day this room is that which lady harriet uses when she comes here with her father for a day or two said mr preston and molly tried to save her father by being ready to talk herself does she often come here not often but i fancy she likes being here when she does perhaps she finds it an agreeable change after the more formal life she leads at the towers i should think it was a very pleasant house to stay at said molly remembering the look of warm comfort that pervaded it but a little to her dismay mr preston seemed to take it as a compliment to himself i was afraid a young lady like you might perceive all the incongruities of a bachelors home im very much obliged to you miss gibson in general i live pretty much in the room in which we shall dine and ive a sort of agents office in which i keep books and papers and receive callers on business then they went in to dinner molly thought everything that was served was delicious and cooked to the point of perfection but they did not seem to satisfy mr preston who apologized to his guests several times for the bad cooking of this dish or the omission of a particular sauce to that always referring to bachelors housekeeping bachelors this and bachelors that till molly grew quite impatient at the word her fathers depression which was still continuing and rendering him very silent made her uneasy yet she wished to conceal it from mr preston and so she talked away trying to obviate the sort of personal bearing which their host would give to everything she did not know when to leave the gentlemen but her father made a sign to her and she was conducted back to the yellow drawingroom by mr preston who made many apologies for leaving her there alone she enjoyed herself extremely however feeling at liberty to prowl about and examine all the curiosities the room contained among other things was a louis quinze cabinet with lovely miniatures in enamel let into the fine woodwork she carried a candle to it and was looking intently at these faces when her father and mr preston came in her father still looked careworn and anxious he came up and patted her on the back looked at what she was looking at and then went off to silence and the fire mr preston took the candle out of her hand and threw himself into her interests with an air of ready gallantry that is said to be mademoiselle de st quentin a great beauty at the french court this is madame du barri do you see any likeness in mademoiselle de st quentin to any one you know he had lowered his voice a little as he asked this question no said molly looking at it again i never saw any one half so beautiful but dont you see a likenessin the eyes particularly he asked again with some impatience molly tried hard to find out a resemblance and was again unsuccessful it constantly reminds me ofof miss kirkpatrick does it said molly eagerly oh i am so gladive never seen her so of course i couldnt find out the likeness you know her then do you please tell me all about her he hesitated a moment before speaking he smiled a little before replying shes very beautiful that of course is understood when i say that this miniature does not come up to her for beauty and besidesgo on please what do you mean by besides oh i suppose shes very clever and accomplished that was not in the least what molly wanted to ask but it was difficult to word the vague vastness of her unspoken inquiry she is clever naturally she has picked up accomplishments but she has such a charm about her one forgets what she herself is in the halo that surrounds her you ask me all this miss gibson and i answer truthfully or else i should not entertain one young lady with my enthusiastic praises of another i dont see why not said molly besides if you wouldnt do it in general i think you ought to do it in my case for you perhaps dont know but she is coming to live with us when she leaves school and we are very nearly the same age so it will be almost like having a sister she is to live with you is she said mr preston to whom this intelligence was news and when is she to leave school i thought she would surely have been at this wedding but i was told she was not to come when is she to leave school i think it is to be at easter you know shes at boulogne and its a long journey for her to come alone or else papa wished for her to be at the marriage very much indeed and her mother prevented iti understand no it wasnt her mother it was the french schoolmistress who didnt think it desirable it comes to pretty much the same thing and shes to return and live with you after easter i believe so is she a grave or a merry person never very grave as far as i have seen of her sparkling would be the word for her i think do you ever write to her if you do pray remember me to her and tell her how we have been talking about heryou and i i never write to her said molly rather shortly tea came in and after that they all went to bed molly heard her father exclaim at the fire in his bedroom and mr prestons reply i pique myself on my keen relish for all creature comforts and also on my power of doing without them if need be my lords woods are ample and i indulge myself with a fire in my bedroom for nine months in the year yet i could travel in iceland without wincing from the cold chapter xiv molly finds herself patronized the wedding went off much as such affairs do lord cumnor and lady harriet drove over from the towers so the hour for the ceremony was as late as possible lord cumnor came in order to officiate as the brides father and was in more open glee than either bride or bridegroom or any one else lady harriet came as a sort of amateur bridesmaid to share mollys duties as she called it they went from the manorhouse in two carriages to the church in the park mr preston and mr gibson in one and molly to her dismay shut up with lord cumnor and lady harriet in the other lady harriets gown of white muslin had seen one or two gardenparties and was not in the freshest order it had been rather a freak of the young ladys at the last moment she was very merry and very much inclined to talk to molly by way of finding out what sort of a little personage clare was to have for her future daughter she began we mustnt crush this pretty muslin dress of yours put it over papas knee he doesnt mind it in the least what my dear a white dressno to be sure not i rather like it besides going to a wedding who minds anything it would be different if we were going to a funeral molly conscientiously strove to find out the meaning of this speech but before she had done so lady harriet spoke again going to the point as she always piqued herself on doing i daresay its something of a trial to you this second marriage of your fathers but youll find clare the most amiable of women she always let me have my own way and ive no doubt shell let you have yours i mean to try and like her said molly in a low voice striving hard to keep down the tears that would keep rising to her eyes this morning ive seen very little of her yet why its the very best thing for you that could have happened my dear said lord cumnor youre growing up into a young ladyand a very pretty young lady too if youll allow an old man to say soand who so proper as your fathers wife to bring you out and show you off and take you to balls and that kind of thing i always said this match that is going to come off today was the most suitable thing i ever knew and its even a better thing for you than for the people themselves poor child said lady harriet who had caught a sight of mollys troubled face the thought of balls is too much for her just now but youll like having cynthia kirkpatrick for a companion shant you dear very much said molly cheering up a little do you know her oh ive seen her over and over again when she was a little girl and once or twice since shes the prettiest creature that you ever saw and with eyes that mean mischief if im not mistaken but clare kept her spirit under pretty well when she was staying with usafraid of her being troublesome i fancy before molly could shape her next question they were at the church and she and lady harriet went into a pew near the door to wait for the bride in whose train they were to proceed to the altar the earl drove on alone to fetch her from her own house not a quarter of a mile distant it was pleasant to her to be led to the hymeneal altar by a belted earl and pleasant to have his daughter as a volunteer bridesmaid mrs kirkpatrick in this flush of small gratifications and on the brink of matrimony with a man whom she liked and who would be bound to support her without any exertion of her own looked beamingly happy and handsome a little cloud came over her face at the sight of mr prestonthe sweet perpetuity of her smile was rather disturbed as he followed in mr gibsons wake but his face never changed he bowed to her gravely and then seemed absorbed in the service ten minutes and all was over the bride and bridegroom were driving together to the manorhouse mr preston was walking thither by a short cut and molly was again in the carriage with my lord rubbing his hands and chuckling and lady harriet trying to be kind and consolatory when her silence would have been the best comfort molly found out to her dismay that the plan was for her to return with lord cumnor and lady harriet when they went back to the towers in the evening in the meantime lord cumnor had business to do with mr preston and after the happy couple had driven off on their weeks holiday tour she was to be left alone with the formidable lady harriet when they were by themselves after all the others had been thus disposed of lady harriet sate still over the drawingroom fire holding a screen between it and her face but gazing intently at molly for a minute or two molly was fully conscious of this prolonged look and was trying to get up her courage to return the stare when lady harriet suddenly said i like youyou are a little wild creature and i want to tame you come here and sit on this stool by me what is your name or what do they call youas northcountry people would express it molly gibson my real name is mary molly is a nice softsounding name people in the last century werent afraid of homely names now we are all so smart and fine no more lady bettys now i almost wonder they havent rechristened all the worsted and knittingcotton that bears her name fancy lady constantias cotton or lady annamarias worsted i didnt know there was a lady bettys cotton said molly that proves you dont do fancywork youll find clare will set you to it though she used to set me at piece after piece knights kneeling to ladies impossible flowers but i must do her the justice to add that when i got tired of them she finished them herself i wonder how youll get on together so do i sighed out molly under her breath i used to think i managed her till one day an uncomfortable suspicion arose that all the time she had been managing me still its easy work to let oneself be managed at any rate till one wakens up to the consciousness of the process and then it may become amusing if one takes it in that light i should hate to be managed said molly indignantly ill try and do what she wishes for papas sake if shell only tell me outright but i should dislike to be trapped into anything now i said lady harriet am too lazy to avoid traps and i rather like to remark the cleverness with which theyre set but then of course i know that if i choose to exert myself i can break through the withes of green flax with which they try to bind me now perhaps you wont be able i dont quite understand what you mean said molly oh wellnever mind i daresay its as well for you that you shouldnt the moral of all i have been saying is be a good girl and suffer yourself to be led and youll find your new stepmother the sweetest creature imaginable youll get on capitally with her i make no doubt how youll get on with her daughter is another affair but i daresay very well now well ring for tea for i suppose that heavy breakfast is to stand for our lunch mr preston came into the room just at this time and molly was a little surprised at lady harriets cool manner of dismissing him remembering as she did how mr preston had implied his intimacy with her ladyship the evening before at dinnertime i cannot bear that sort of person said lady harriet almost before he was out of hearing giving himself airs of gallantry towards one to whom his simple respect is all his duty i can talk to one of my fathers labourers with pleasure while with a man like that underbred fop i am all over thorns and nettles what is it the irish call that style of creature theyve some capital word for it i know what is it i dont knowi never heard it said molly a little ashamed of her ignorance oh that shows youve never read miss edgeworths talesnow have you if you had youd have recollected that there was such a word even if you didnt remember what it was if youve never read those stories they would be just the thing to beguile your solitudevastly improving and moral and yet quite sufficiently interesting ill lend them to you while youre all alone im not alone im not at home but on a visit to miss brownings then ill bring them to you i know the miss brownings they used to come regularly on the schoolday to the towers pecksy and flapsy i used to call them i like the miss brownings one gets enough of respect from them at any rate and ive always wanted to see the kind of mnage of such people ill bring you a whole pile of miss edgeworths stories my dear molly sate quite silent for a minute or two then she mustered up courage to speak out what was in her mind your ladyship the title was the firstfruits of the lesson as molly took it on paying due respectyour ladyship keeps speaking of the sort ofthe class of people to which i belong as if it was a kind of strange animal you were talking about yet you talk so openly to me that well go oni like to hear you still silence you think me in your heart a little impertinentnow dont you said lady harriet almost kindly molly held her peace for two or three moments then she lifted her beautiful honest eyes to lady harriets face and said yesa little but i think you a great many other things well leave the other things for the present dont you see little one i talk after my kind just as you talk after your kind its only on the surface with both of us why i daresay some of your good hollingford ladies talk of the poor people in a manner which they would consider as impertinent in their turn if they could hear it but i ought to be more considerate when i remember how often my blood has boiled at the modes of speech and behaviour of one of my aunts mammas sister lady no i wont name names any one who earns his livelihood by any exercise of head or hands from professional people and rich merchants down to labourers she calls persons she would never in her most slipslop talk accord them even the conventional title of gentlemen and the way in which she takes possession of human beings my woman my peoplebut after all it is only a way of speaking i ought not to have used it to you but somehow i separate you from all these hollingford people but why persevered molly im one of them yes you are butnow dont reprove me again for impertinencemost of them are so unnatural in their exaggerated respect and admiration when they come up to the towers and put on so much pretence by way of fine manners that they only make themselves objects of ridicule you at least are simple and truthful and thats why i separate you in my own mind from them and have talked unconsciously to you as i wouldwell now heres another piece of impertinenceas i would to my equalin rank i mean for i dont set myself up in solid things as any better than my neighbours heres tea however come in time to stop me from growing too humble it was a very pleasant little tea in the fading september twilight just as it was ended in came mr preston again lady harriet will you allow me the pleasure of showing you some alterations i have made in the flowergardenin which i have tried to consult your tastebefore it grows dark illustration unwelcome attentions thank you mr preston i will ride over with papa some day and we will see if we approve of them mr prestons brow flushed but he affected not to perceive lady harriets haughtiness and turning to molly he said will not you come out miss gibson and see something of the gardens you havent been out at all i think excepting to church molly did not like the idea of going out for a walk with only mr preston yet she pined for a little fresh air would have been glad to see the gardens and look at the manorhouse from different aspects and besides this much as she recoiled from mr preston she felt sorry for him under the repulse he had just received while she was hesitating and slowly tending towards consent lady harriet spoke i cannot spare miss gibson if she would like to see the place i will bring her over some day myself when he had left the room lady harriet saidi daresay its my own lazy selfishness has kept you indoors all day against your will but at any rate you are not to go out walking with that man ive an instinctive aversion to him not entirely instinctive either it has some foundation in fact and i desire you dont allow him ever to get intimate with you hes a very clever landagent and does his duty by papa and i dont choose to be taken up for libel but remember what i say then the carriage came round and after numberless last words from the earlwho appeared to have put off every possible direction to the moment when he stood like an awkward mercury balancing himself on the step of the carriagethey drove back to the towers would you rather come in and dine with uswe should send you home of courseor go home straight asked lady harriet of molly she and her father had both been sleeping till they drew up at the bottom of the flight of steps tell the truth now and evermore truth is generally amusing if its nothing else i would rather go back to miss brownings at once please said molly with a nightmarelike recollection of the last the only evening she had spent at the towers lord cumnor was standing on the steps waiting to hand his daughter out of the carriage lady harriet stopped to kiss molly on the forehead and to say i shall come some day soon and bring you a load of miss edgeworths tales and make further acquaintance with pecksy and flapsy no dont please said molly taking hold of her to detain her you must not comeindeed you must not why not because i would rather notbecause i think that i ought not to have any one coming to see me who laughs at the friends i am staying with and calls them names mollys heart beat very fast but she meant every word that she said my dear little woman said lady harriet bending over her and speaking quite gravely im very sorry to have called them namesvery very sorry to have hurt you if i promise you to be respectful to them in word and in deedand in very thought if i canyoull let me then wont you molly hesitated id better go home at once i shall only say wrong thingsand theres lord cumnor waiting all this time let him alone hes very well amused hearing all the news of the day from brown then i shall comeunder promise so molly drove off in solitary grandeur and miss brownings knocker was loosened on its venerable hinges by the neverending peal of lord cumnors footman they were full of welcome full of curiosity all through the long day they had been missing their bright young visitor and three or four times in every hour they had been wondering and settling what everybody was doing at that exact minute what had become of molly during all the afternoon had been a great perplexity to them and they were very much oppressed with a sense of the great honour she had received in being allowed to spend so many hours alone with lady harriet they were indeed more excited by this one fact than by all the details of the wedding most of which they had known of beforehand and talked over with much perseverance during the day molly began to feel as if there was some foundation for lady harriets inclination to ridicule the worship paid by the good people of hollingford to their liege lord and to wonder with what tokens of reverence they would receive lady harriet if she came to pay her promised visit she had never thought of concealing the probability of this call until this evening but now she felt as if it would be better not to speak of the chance as she was not at all sure that the promise would be fulfilled before lady harriets call was paid molly received another visit roger hamley came riding over one day with a note from his mother and a waspsnest as a present from himself molly heard his powerful voice come sounding up the little staircase as he asked if miss gibson was at home from the servantmaid at the door and she was half amused and half annoyed as she thought how this call of his would give colour to miss brownings fancies i would rather never be married at all thought she than marry an ugly manand dear good mr roger is really ugly i dont think one could even call him plain yet miss brownings who did not look upon young men as if their natural costume was a helmet and a suit of armour thought mr roger hamley a very personable young fellow as he came into the room his face flushed with exercise his white teeth showing pleasantly in the courteous bow and smile he gave to all around he knew the miss brownings slightly and talked pleasantly to them while molly read mrs hamleys little missive of sympathy and good wishes relating to the wedding then he turned to her and though miss brownings listened with all their ears they could not find out anything remarkable either in the words he said or the tone in which they were spoken ive brought you the waspsnest i promised you miss gibson there has been no lack of such things this year weve taken seventyfour on my fathers land alone and one of the labourers a poor fellow who ekes out his wages by beekeeping has had a sad misfortunethe wasps have turned the bees out of his seven hives taken possession and eaten up the honey what greedy little vermin said miss browning molly saw rogers eyes twinkle at the misapplication of the word but though he had a strong sense of humour it never appeared to diminish his respect for the people who amused him im sure they deserve fire and brimstone more than the poor dear innocent bees said miss phoebe and then it seems so ungrateful of mankind who are going to feast on the honey she sighed over the thought as if it was too much for her while molly finished reading her note he explained its contents to miss browning my brother and i are going with my father to an agricultural meeting at canonbury on thursday and my mother desired me to say to you how very much obliged she should be if you would spare her miss gibson for the day she was very anxious to ask for the pleasure of your company too but she really is so poorly that we persuaded her to be content with miss gibson as she wouldnt scruple leaving a young lady to amuse herself which she would be unwilling to do if you and your sister were there im sure shes very kind very nothing would have given us more pleasure said miss browning drawing herself up in gratified dignity oh yes we quite understand mr roger and we fully recognize mrs hamleys kind intention we will take the will for the deed as the common people express it i believe that there was an intermarriage between the brownings and the hamleys a generation or two ago i daresay there was said roger my mother is very delicate and obliged to humour her health which has made her keep aloof from society then i may go said molly sparkling with the idea of seeing her dear mrs hamley again yet afraid of appearing too desirous of leaving her kind old friends to be sure my dear write a pretty note and tell mrs hamley how much obliged to her we are for thinking of us im afraid i cant wait for a note said roger i must take a message instead for i have to meet my father at one oclock and its close upon it now when he was gone molly felt so lighthearted at the thoughts of thursday that she could hardly attend to what the miss brownings were saying one was talking about the pretty muslin gown which molly had sent to the wash only that morning and contriving how it could be had back again in time for her to wear and the other miss phoebe totally inattentive to her sisters speaking for a wonder was piping out a separate strain of her own and singing roger hamleys praises such a finelooking young man and so courteous and affable like the young men of our youth now is he not sister and yet they all say mr osborne is the handsomest what do you think child ive never seen mr osborne said molly blushing and hating herself for doing so why was it she had never seen him as she said it was only that her fancy had dwelt on him so much he was goneall the gentlemen were gone before the carriage which came to fetch molly on thursday reached hamley hall but molly was almost glad she was so much afraid of being disappointed besides she had her dear mrs hamley the more to herself the quiet sit in the morningroom talking poetry and romance the midday saunter into the garden brilliant with autumnal flowers and glittering dewdrops on the gossamer webs that stretched from scarlet to blue and thence to purple and yellow petals as they were sitting at lunch a strange mans voice and step were heard in the hall the door was opened and a young man came in who could be no other than osborne he was beautiful and languidlooking almost as frail in appearance as his mother whom he strongly resembled this seeming delicacy made him appear older than he was he was dressed to perfection and yet with easy carelessness he came up to his mother and stood by her holding her hand while his eyes sought molly not boldly or impertinently but as if appraising her critically yes im back again bullocks i find are not in my line i only disappointed my father in not being able to appreciate their merits and im afraid i didnt care to learn and the smell was insufferable on such a hot day my dear boy dont make apologies to me keep them for your father im only too glad to have you back miss gibson this tall fellow is my son osborne as i daresay you have guessed osbornemiss gibson now what will you have he looked round the table as he sate down nothing here said he isnt there some cold gamepie ill ring for that molly was trying to reconcile the ideal with the real the ideal was agile yet powerful with greek features and an eagleeye capable of enduring long fasting and indifferent as to what he ate the real was almost effeminate in movement though not in figure he had the greek features but his blue eyes had a cold weary expression in them he was dainty in eating and had anything but a homeric appetite however mollys hero was not to eat more than ivanhoe when he was friar tucks guest and after all with a little alteration she began to think mr osborne hamley might turn out a poetical if not a chivalrous hero he was extremely attentive to his mother which pleased molly and in return mrs hamley seemed charmed with him to such a degree that molly once or twice fancied that mother and son would have been happier in her absence yet again it struck on the shrewd if simple girl that osborne was mentally squinting at her in the conversation which was directed to his mother there were little turns and fioriture of speech which molly could not help feeling were graceful antics of language not common in the simple daily intercourse between mother and son but it was flattering rather than otherwise to perceive that a very fine young man who was a poet to boot should think it worth while to talk on the tight rope for her benefit and before the afternoon was ended without there having been any direct conversation between osborne and molly she had reinstated him on his throne in her imagination indeed she had almost felt herself disloyal to her dear mrs hamley when in the first hour after her introduction she had questioned his claims on his mothers idolatry his beauty came out more and more as he became animated in some discussion with her and all his attitudes if a little studied were graceful in the extreme before molly left the squire and roger returned from canonbury osborne here said the squire red and panting why the deuce couldnt you tell us you were coming home i looked about for you everywhere just as we were going into the ordinary i wanted to introduce you to grantley and fox and lord forrestmen from the other side of the county whom you ought to know and roger there missed above half his dinner hunting about for you and all the time youd stole away and were quietly sitting here with the women i wish youd let me know the next time you make off ive lost half my pleasure in looking at as fine a lot of cattle as i ever saw with thinking you might be having one of your old attacks of faintness i should have had one i think if id stayed longer in that atmosphere but im sorry if ive caused you anxiety well well said the squire somewhat mollified and roger toothere ive been sending him here and sending him there all the afternoon i didnt mind it sir i was only sorry you were so uneasy i thought osborne had gone home for i knew it wasnt much in his way said roger molly intercepted a glance between the two brothersa look of true confidence and love which suddenly made her like them both under the aspect of relationshipnew to her observation roger came up to her and sat down by her well and how are you getting on with huber dont you find him very interesting im afraid said molly penitently i havent read much miss brownings like me to talk and besides there is so much to do at home before papa comes back and miss browning doesnt like me to go without her i know it sounds nothing but it does take up a great deal of time when is your father coming back next tuesday i believe he cannot stay long away i shall ride over and pay my respects to mrs gibson said he i shall come as soon as i may your father has been a very kind friend to me ever since i was a boy and when i come i shall expect my pupil to have been very diligent he concluded smiling his kind pleasant smile at idle molly then the carriage came round and she had the long solitary drive back to miss brownings it was dark out of doors when she got there but miss phoebe was standing on the stairs with a lighted candle in her hand peering into the darkness to see molly come in oh molly i thought youd never come back such a piece of news sister has gone to bed shes had a headachewith the excitement i think but she says its new bread come upstairs softly my dear and ill tell you what it is who do you think has been heredrinking tea with us too in the most condescending manner lady harriet said molly suddenly enlightened by the word condescending yes why how did you guess it but after all her call at any rate in the first instance was upon you oh dear molly if youre not in a hurry to go to bed let me sit down quietly and tell you all about it for my heart jumps into my mouth still when i think of how i was caught shethat is her ladyshipleft the carriage at the george and took to her feet to go shoppingjust as you or i may have done many a time in our lives and sister was taking her forty winks and i was sitting with my gown up above my knees and my feet on the fender pulling out my grandmothers lace which id been washing the worst has yet to be told id taken off my cap for i thought it was getting dusk and no one would come and there was i in my black silk skullcap when nancy put her head in and whispered theres a lady downstairsa real grand one by her talk and in there came my lady harriet so sweet and pretty in her ways it was some time before i remembered i had never a cap on sister never wakened or never roused up so to say she says she thought it was nancy bringing in the tea when she heard some one moving for her ladyship as soon as she saw the state of the case came and knelt down on the rug by me and begged my pardon so prettily for having followed nancy upstairs without waiting for permission and was so taken by my old lace and wanted to know how i washed it and where you were and when youd be back and when the happy couple would be back till sister wakenedshes always a little bit put out you know when she first wakens from her afternoon napand without turning her head to see who it was she said quite sharpbuzz buzz buzz when will you learn that whispering is more fidgeting than talking out loud ive not been able to sleep at all for the chatter you and nancy have been keeping up all this time you know that was a little fancy of sisters for shed been snoring away as naturally as could be so i went to her and leant over her and said in a low voice sister its her ladyship and me that has been conversing ladyship here ladyship there have you lost your wits phoebe that you talk such nonsenseand in your skullcap too by this time she was sitting upand looking round her she saw lady harriet in her velvets and silks sitting on our rug smiling her bonnet off and her pretty hair all bright with the blaze of the fire my word sister was up on her feet directly and she dropped her curtsey and made her excuses for sleeping as fast as might be while i went off to put on my best cap for sister might well say i was out of my wits to go on chatting to an earls daughter in an old black silk skullcap black silk too when if id only known she was coming i might have put on my new brown silk one lying idle in my top drawer and when i came back sister was ordering tea for her ladyshipour tea i mean so i took my turn at talk and sister slipped out to put on her sunday silk but i dont think we were quite so much at our ease with her ladyship as when i sat pulling out my lace in my skullcap and she was quite struck with our tea and asked where we got it for she had never tasted any like it before and i told her we gave only s d a pound for it at johnsonssister says i ought to have told her the price of our companytea which is s a pound only that was not what we were drinking for as illluck would have it wed none of it in the houseand she said she would send us some of hers all the way from russia or prussia or some outoftheway place and we were to compare and see which we liked best and if we liked hers best she could get it for us at s a pound and she left her love for you and though she was going away you were not to forget her sister thought such a message would set you up too much and told me she would not be chargeable for the giving it you but i said a message is a message and its on mollys own shoulders if shes set up by it let us show her an example of humility sister though we have been sitting cheekbyjowl in such company so sister humphed and said shed a headache and went to bed and now you may tell me your news my dear so molly told her small events which interesting as they might have been at other times to the gossiploving and sympathetic miss phoebe were rather pale in the stronger light reflected from the visit of an earls daughter chapter xv the new mamma illustration untitled on tuesday afternoon molly returned hometo the home which was already strange and what warwickshire people would call unked to her new paint new paper new colours grim servants dressed in their best and objecting to every changefrom their masters marriage to the new oilcloth in the hall which tripped em up and threw em down and was cold to the feet and smelt just abominable all these complaints molly had to listen to and it was not a cheerful preparation for the reception which she already felt to be so formidable the sound of their carriagewheels was heard at last and molly went to the front door to meet them her father got out first and took her hand and held it while he helped his bride to alight then he kissed her fondly and passed her on to his wife but her veil was so securely and becomingly fastened down that it was some time before mrs gibson could get her lips clear to greet her new daughter then there was luggage to be seen about and both the travellers were occupied in this while molly stood by trembling with excitement unable to help and only conscious of bettys rather cross looks as heavy box after heavy box jammed up the passage molly my dear showyour mamma to her room mr gibson had hesitated because the question of the name by which molly was to call her new relation had never occurred to him before the colour flashed into mollys face was she to call her mammathe name long appropriated in her mind to some one elseto her own dead mother the rebellious heart rose against it but she said nothing she led the way upstairs mrs gibson turning round from time to time with some fresh direction as to which bag or trunk she needed most she hardly spoke to molly till they were both in the newlyfurnished bedroom where a small fire had been lighted by mollys orders now my love we can embrace each other in peace o dear how tired i amafter the embrace had been accomplished my spirits are so easily affected with fatigue but your dear papa has been kindness itself dear what an oldfashioned bed and what a but it doesnt signify byandby well renovate the housewont we my dear and youll be my little maid tonight and help me to arrange a few things for im just worn out with the days journey ive ordered a sort of teadinner to be ready for you said molly shall i go and tell them to send it in im not sure if i can go down again tonight it would be very comfortable to have a little table brought in here and sit in my dressinggown by this cheerful fire but to be sure theres your dear papa i really dont think he would eat anything if i were not there one must not think about oneself you know yes ill come down in a quarter of an hour but mr gibson had found a note awaiting him with an immediate summons to an old patient dangerously ill and snatching a mouthful of food while his horse was being saddled he had to resume at once his old habits of attention to his profession above everything as soon as mrs gibson found that he was not likely to miss her presencehe had eaten a very tolerable lunch of bread and cold meat in solitude so her fears about his appetite in her absence were not well foundedshe desired to have her meal upstairs in her own room and poor molly not daring to tell the servants of this whim had to carry up first a table which however small was too heavy for her and afterwards all the choice portions of the meal which she had taken great pains to arrange on the table as she had seen such things done at hamley intermixed with fruit and flowers that had that morning been sent in from various great houses where mr gibson was respected and valued how pretty molly had thought her handiwork an hour or two before how dreary it seemed as at last released from mrs gibsons conversation she sate down in solitude to cold tea and the drumsticks of the chicken no one to look at her preparations and admire her defthandedness and taste she had thought that her father would be gratified by it and then he had never seen it she had meant her cares as an offering of goodwill to her stepmother who even now was ringing her bell to have the tray taken away and miss gibson summoned to her bedroom molly hastily finished her meal and went upstairs again i feel so lonely darling in this strange house do come and be with me and help me to unpack i think your dear papa might have put off his visit to mr craven smith for just this one evening mr craven smith couldnt put off his dying said molly bluntly you droll girl said mrs gibson with a faint laugh but if this mr smith is dying as you say whats the use of your fathers going off to him in such a hurry does he expect any legacy or anything of that kind molly bit her lips to prevent herself from saying something disagreeable she only answered i dont quite know that he is dying the man said so and papa can sometimes do something to make the last struggle easier at any rate its always a comfort to the family to have him what dreary knowledge of death you have learned for a girl of your age really if i had heard all these details of your fathers profession i doubt if i could have brought myself to have him he doesnt make the illness or the death he does his best against them i call it a very fine thing to think of what he does or tries to do and you will think so too when you see how he is watched for and how people welcome him well dont let us talk any more of such gloomy things tonight i think i shall go to bed at once i am so tired if you will only sit by me till i get sleepy darling if you will talk to me the sound of your voice will soon send me off molly got a book and read her stepmother to sleep preferring that to the harder task of keeping up a continual murmur of speech then she stole down and went into the diningroom where the fire was gone out purposely neglected by the servants to mark their displeasure at their new mistresss having had her tea in her own room molly managed to light it however before her father came home and collected and rearranged some comfortable food for him then she knelt down again on the hearthrug gazing into the fire in a dreamy reverie which had enough of sadness about it to cause the tears to drop unnoticed from her eyes but she jumped up and shook herself into brightness at the sound of her fathers step how is mr craven smith said she dead he just recognized me he was one of my first patients on coming to hollingford mr gibson sate down in the armchair made ready for him and warmed his hands at the fire seeming neither to need food nor talk as he went over a train of recollections then he roused himself from his sadness and looking round the room he said briskly enough and wheres the new mamma she was tired and went to bed early oh papa must i call her mamma i should like it replied he with a slight contraction of the brows molly was silent she put a cup of tea near him he stirred it and sipped it and then he recurred to the subject why shouldnt you call her mamma im sure she means to do the duty of a mother to you we all may make mistakes and her ways may not be quite all at once our ways but at any rate let us start with a family bond between us what would roger say was rightthat was the question that rose to mollys mind she had always spoken of her fathers new wife as mrs gibson and had once burst out at miss brownings with a protestation that she never would call her mamma she did not feel drawn to her new relation by their intercourse that evening she kept silence though she knew her father was expecting an answer at last he gave up his expectation and turned to another subject told about their journey questioned her as to the hamleys the brownings lady harriet and the afternoon they had passed together at the manorhouse but there was a certain hardness and constraint in his manner and in hers a heaviness and absence of mind all at once she said papa i will call her mamma he took her hand and grasped it tight but for an instant or two he did not speak then he said you wont be sorry for it molly when you come to lie as poor craven smith did tonight for some time the murmurs and grumblings of the two elder servants were confined to mollys ears then they spread to her fathers who to mollys dismay made summary work with them you dont like mrs gibsons ringing her bell so often dont you youve been spoilt im afraid but if you dont conform to my wifes desires you have the remedy in your own hands you know what servant ever resisted the temptation to give warning after such a speech as that betty told molly she was going to leave in as indifferent a manner as she could possibly assume towards the girl whom she had tended and been about for the last sixteen years molly had hitherto considered her former nurse as a fixture in the house she would almost as soon have thought of her fathers proposing to sever the relationship between them and here was betty coolly talking over whether her next place should be in town or country but a great deal of this was assumed hardness in a week or two betty was in floods of tears at the prospect of leaving her nursling and would fain have stayed and answered all the bells in the house once every quarter of an hour even mr gibsons masculine heart was touched by the sorrow of the old servant which made itself obvious to him every time he came across her by her broken voice and her swollen eyes one day he said to molly i wish youd ask your mamma if betty might not stay if she made a proper apology and all that sort of thing i dont much think it will be of any use said molly in a mournful voice i know she is writing or has written about some underhousemaid at the towers wellall i want is peace and a decent quantity of cheerfulness when i come home i see enough of tears at other peoples houses after all betty has been with us sixteen yearsa sort of service of the antique world but the woman may be happier elsewhere do as you like about asking mamma only if she agrees i shall be quite willing so molly tried her hand at making a request to that effect to mrs gibson her instinct told her she would be unsuccessful but surely favour was never refused in so soft a tone my dear girl i should never have thought of sending an old servant awayone who has had the charge of you from your birth or nearly so i could not have had the heart to do it she might have stayed for ever for me if she had only attended to all my wishes and i am not unreasonable am i but you see she complained and when your dear papa spoke to her she gave warning and it is quite against my principles ever to take an apology from a servant who has given warning she is so sorry pleaded molly she says she will do anything you wish and attend to all your orders if she may only stay but sweet one you seem to forget that i cannot go against my principles however much i may be sorry for betty she should not have given way to illtemper as i said before although i never liked her and considered her a most inefficient servant thoroughly spoilt by having had no mistress for so long i should have borne with herat least i think i shouldas long as i could now i have all but engaged maria who was underhousemaid at the towers so dont let me hear any more of bettys sorrow or anybody elses sorrow for im sure what with your dear papas sad stories and other things im getting quite low molly was silent for a moment or two have you quite engaged maria asked she noi said all but engaged sometimes one would think you did not hear things dear molly replied mrs gibson petulantly maria is living in a place where they dont give her as much wages as she deserves perhaps they cant afford it poor things im always sorry for poverty and would never speak hardly of those who are not rich but i have offered her two pounds more than she gets at present so i think shell leave at any rate if they increase her wages i shall increase my offer in proportion so i think im sure to get her such a genteel girlalways brings in a letter on a salver poor betty said molly softly poor old soul i hope shell profit by the lesson im sure sighed out mrs gibson but its a pity we hadnt maria before the county families began to call mrs gibson had been highly gratified by the circumstance of so many calls from county families her husband was much respected and many ladies from various halls courts and houses who had profited by his services towards themselves and their families thought it right to pay his new wife the attention of a call when they drove into hollingford to shop the state of expectation into which these calls threw mrs gibson rather diminished mr gibsons domestic comfort it was awkward to be carrying hot savourysmelling dishes from the kitchen to the diningroom at the very time when highborn ladies with noses of aristocratic refinement might be calling still more awkward was the accident which happened in consequence of clumsy bettys haste to open the front door to a lofty footmans rantan which caused her to set down the basket containing the dirty plates right in his mistresss way as she stepped gingerly through the comparative darkness of the hall and then the young men leaving the diningroom quietly enough but bursting with longrepressed giggle or no longer restraining their tendency to practical joking no matter who might be in the passage when they made their exit the remedy proposed by mrs gibson for all these distressing grievances was a late dinner the luncheon for the young men as she observed to her husband might be sent into the surgery a few elegant cold trifles for herself and molly would not scent the house and she would always take care to have some little dainty ready for him he acceded but unwillingly for it was an innovation on the habits of a lifetime and he felt as if he should never be able to arrange his rounds aright with this newfangled notion of a six oclock dinner dont get any dainties for me my dear breadandcheese is the chief of my diet like it was that of the old womans i know nothing of your old woman replied his wife but really i cannot allow cheese to come beyond the kitchen then ill eat it there said he its close to the stableyard and if i come in in a hurry i can get it in a moment really mr gibson it is astonishing to compare your appearance and manners with your tastes you look such a gentleman as dear lady cumnor used to say then the cook left also an old servant though not so old a one as betty the cook did not like the trouble of late dinners and being a methodist she objected on religious grounds to trying any of mrs gibsons new receipts for french dishes it was not scriptural she said there was a deal of mention of food in the bible but it was of sheep ready dressed which meant mutton and of wine and of breadandmilk and figs and raisins of fatted calves a good wellbrowned fillet of veal and such like but it had always gone against her conscience to cook swineflesh and make raised porkpies and now if she was to be set to cook heathen dishes after the fashion of the papists shed sooner give it all up together so the cook followed in bettys track and mr gibson had to satisfy his healthy english appetite on badlymade omelettes rissoles volauvents croquets and timbales never being exactly sure what he was eating he had made up his mind before his marriage to yield in trifles and be firm in greater things but the differences of opinion about trifles arose every day and were perhaps more annoying than if they had related to things of more consequence molly knew her fathers looks as well as she knew her alphabet his wife did not and being an unperceptive person except when her own interests were dependent upon another persons humour never found out how he was worried by all the small daily concessions which he made to her will or her whims he never allowed himself to put any regret into shape even in his own mind he repeatedly reminded himself of his wifes good qualities and comforted himself by thinking they should work together better as time rolled on but he was very angry at a bachelor greatuncle of mr coxes who after taking no notice of his redheaded nephew for years suddenly sent for him after the old man had partially recovered from a serious attack of illness and appointed him his heir on condition that his greatnephew remained with him during the rest of his life this had happened almost directly after mr and mrs gibsons return from their wedding journey and once or twice since that time mr gibson had found himself wondering why the deuce old benson could not have made up his mind sooner and so have rid his house of the unwelcome presence of the young lover to do mr coxe justice in the very last conversation he had as a pupil with mr gibson he said with hesitating awkwardness that perhaps the new circumstances in which he should be placed might make some difference with regard to mr gibsons opinion on not at all said mr gibson quickly you are both of you too young to know your own minds and if my daughter was silly enough to be in love she should never have to calculate her happiness on the chances of an old mans death i dare say hell disinherit you after all he may do and then youd be worse off than ever no go away and forget all this nonsense and when youve done come back and see us so mr coxe went away with an oath of unalterable faithfulness in his heart and mr gibson had unwillingly to fulfil an old promise made to a gentleman farmer in the neighbourhood a year or two before and to take the second son of mr browne in young coxes place he was to be the last of the race of pupils and as he was rather more than a year younger than molly mr gibson trusted that there would be no repetition of the coxe romance chapter xvi the bride at home among the county people as mrs gibson termed them who called upon her as a bride were the two young mr hamleys the squire their father had done his congratulations as far as he ever intended to do them to mr gibson himself when he came to the hall but mrs hamley unable to go and pay visits herself anxious to show attention to her kind doctors new wife and with perhaps a little sympathetic curiosity as to how molly and her stepmother got on together made her sons ride over to hollingford with her cards and apologies they came into the newlyfurnished drawingroom looking bright and fresh from their ride osborne first as usual perfectly dressed for the occasion and with the sort of fine manner which sate so well upon him roger looking like a strongbuilt cheerful intelligent country farmer followed in his brothers train mrs gibson was dressed for receiving callers and made the effect she always intended to produce of a very pretty woman no longer in first youth but with such soft manners and such a caressing voice that people forgot to wonder what her real age might be molly was better dressed than formerly her stepmother saw after that she disliked anything old or shabby or out of taste about her it hurt her eye and she had already fidgeted molly into a new amount of care about the manner in which she put on her clothes arranged her hair and was gloved and shod mrs gibson had tried to put her through a course of rosemary washes and creams in order to improve her tanned complexion but about that molly was either forgetful or rebellious and mrs gibson could not well come up to the girls bedroom every night and see that she daubed her face and neck over with the cosmetics so carefully provided for her still her appearance was extremely improved even to osbornes critical eye roger sought rather to discover in her looks and expression whether she was happy or not his mother had especially charged him to note all these signs osborne and mrs gibson made themselves agreeable to each other according to the approved fashion when a young man calls on a middleaged bride they talked of the shakspeare and musical glasses of the day each vieing with the other in their knowledge of london topics molly heard fragments of their conversation in the pauses of silence between roger and herself her hero was coming out in quite a new character no longer literary or poetical or romantic or critical he was now full of the last new play the singers at the opera he had the advantage over mrs gibson who in fact only spoke of these things from hearsay from listening to the talk at the towers while osborne had run up from cambridge two or three times to hear this or to see that wonder of the season but she had the advantage over him in greater boldness of invention to eke out her facts and besides she had more skill in the choice and arrangement of her words so as to make it appear as if the opinions that were in reality quotations were formed by herself from actual experience or personal observation such as in speaking of the mannerisms of a famous italian singer she would ask illustration shakspeare and the musical glasses did you observe her constant trick of heaving her shoulders and clasping her hands together before she took a high notewhich was so said as to imply that mrs gibson herself had noticed this trick molly who had a pretty good idea by this time of how her stepmother had passed the last year of her life listened with no small bewilderment to this conversation but at length decided that she must misunderstand what they were saying as she could not gather up the missing links for the necessity of replying to rogers questions and remarks osborne was not the same osborne he was when with his mother at the hall roger saw molly glancing at his brother you think my brother looking ill said he lowering his voice nonot exactly he is not well both my father and i are anxious about him that run on the continent did him harm instead of good and his disappointment at his examination has told upon him im afraid i was not thinking he looked ill only changed somehow he says he must go back to cambridge soon possibly it may do him good and i shall be off next week this is a farewell visit to you as well as one of congratulation to mrs gibson your mother will feel your both going away wont she but of course young men will always have to live away from home yes he replied still she feels it a good deal and im not satisfied about her health either you will go out and see her sometimes will you she is very fond of you if i may said molly unconsciously glancing at her stepmother she had an uncomfortable instinct that in spite of mrs gibsons own perpetual flow of words she could and did hear everything that fell from mollys lips do you want any more books said he if you do make a list out and send it to my mother before i leave next tuesday after i am gone there will be no one to go into the library and pick them out as soon as they had left mrs gibson began her usual comments on the departed visitors i do like that osborne hamley what a nice fellow he is somehow i always do like eldest sons he will have the estate wont he i shall ask your dear papa to encourage him to come about the house he will be a very good very pleasant acquaintance for you and cynthia the other is but a loutish young fellow to my mind there is no aristocratic bearing about him i suppose he takes after his mother who is but a parvenue ive heard them say at the towers molly was spiteful enough to have great pleasure in saying i think ive heard her father was a russian merchant and imported tallow and hemp mr osborne hamley is extremely like her indeed but theres no calculating these things anyhow he is the perfect gentleman in appearance and manner the estate is entailed is it not i know nothing about it said molly a short silence ensued then mrs gibson said do you know i almost think i must get dear papa to give a little dinnerparty and ask mr osborne hamley i should like to have him feel at home in this house it would be something cheerful for him after the dulness and solitude of hamley hall for the old people dont visit much i believe hes going back to cambridge next week said molly is he well then well put off our little dinner till cynthia comes home i should like to have some young society for her poor darling when she returns when is she coming said molly who had always a longing curiosity for this same cynthias return oh im not sure perhaps at the new yearperhaps not till easter i must get this drawingroom all new furnished first and then i mean to fit up her room and yours just alike they are just the same size only on opposite sides of the passage are you going to newfurnish that room said molly in astonishment at the neverending changes yes and yours too darling so dont be jealous oh please mamma not mine said molly taking in the idea for the first time yes dear you shall have yours done as well a little french bed and a new paper and a pretty carpet and a dressedup toilettable and glass will make it look quite a different place but i dont want it to look different i like it as it is pray dont do anything to it what nonsense child i never heard anything more ridiculous most girls would be glad to get rid of furniture only fit for the lumberroom it was my own mammas before she was married said molly in a very low voice bringing out this last plea unwillingly but with a certainty that it would not be resisted mrs gibson paused for a moment before she replied its very much to your credit that you should have such feelings im sure but dont you think sentiment may be carried too far why we should have no new furniture at all and should have to put up with wormeaten horrors besides my dear hollingford will seem very dull to cynthia after pretty gay france and i want to make the first impressions attractive ive a notion i can settle her down near here and i want her to come in a good temper for between ourselves my dear she is a little leetle wilful you need not mention this to your papa but cant you do cynthias room and not mine please let mine alone no indeed i couldnt agree to that only think what would be said of me by everybody petting my own child and neglecting my husbands i couldnt bear it no one need know in such a tittletattle place as hollingford really molly you are either very stupid or very obstinate or else you dont care what hard things may be said about me and all for a selfish fancy of your own no i owe myself the justice of acting in this matter as i please every one shall know im not a common stepmother every penny i spend on cynthia i shall spend on you too so its no use talking any more about it so mollys little white dimity bed her oldfashioned chest of drawers and her other cherished relics of her mothers maidendays were consigned to the lumberroom and after a while when cynthia and her great french boxes had come home the old furniture that had filled up the space required for the fresh importation of trunks disappeared likewise into the same room all this time the family at the towers had been absent lady cumnor had been ordered to bath for the early part of the winter and her family were with her there on dull rainy days mrs gibson used to bethink her of missing the cumnors for so she had taken to calling them since her position had become more independent of theirs it marked a distinction between her intimacy in the family and the reverential manner in which the townspeople were accustomed to speak of the earl and the countess both lady cumnor and lady harriet wrote to their dear clare from time to time the former had generally some commissions that she wished to have executed at the towers or in the town and no one could do them so well as clare who was acquainted with all the tastes and ways of the countess these commissions were the cause of various bills for flys and cars from the george inn mr gibson pointed out this consequence to his wife but she in return bade him remark that a present of game was pretty sure to follow upon the satisfactory execution of lady cumnors wishes somehow mr gibson did not quite like this consequence either but he was silent about it at any rate lady harriets letters were short and amusing she had that sort of regard for her old governess which prompted her to write from time to time and to feel glad when the halfvoluntary task was accomplished so there was no real outpouring of confidence but enough news of the family and gossip of the place she was in as she thought would make clare feel that she was not forgotten by her former pupils intermixed with moderate but sincere expressions of regard how those letters were quoted and referred to by mrs gibson in her conversations with the hollingford ladies she had found out their effect at ashcombe and it was not less at hollingford but she was rather perplexed at kindly messages to molly and at inquiries as to how the miss brownings liked the tea she had sent and molly had first to explain and then to narrate at full length all the occurrences of the afternoon at ashcombe manorhouse and lady harriets subsequent call upon her at miss brownings what nonsense said mrs gibson with some annoyance lady harriet only went to see you out of a desire of amusement she would only make fun of miss brownings and those two will be quoting her and talking about her just as if she was their intimate friend i dont think she did make fun of them she really seemed as if she had been very kind and you suppose you know her ways better than i do who have known her these fifteen years i tell you she turns every one into ridicule who does not belong to her set why she used always to speak of miss brownings as pecksy and flapsy she promised me she would not said molly driven to bay promised youlady harriet what do you mean onlyshe spoke of them as pecksy and flapsyand when she talked of coming to call on me at their house i asked her not to come if she was going toto make fun of them upon my word with all my long acquaintance with lady harriet i should never have ventured on such impertinence i didnt mean it as impertinence said molly sturdily and i dont think lady harriet took it as such you cant know anything about it she can put on any kind of manner just then squire hamley came in it was his first call and mrs gibson gave him a graceful welcome and was quite ready to accept his apology for its tardiness and to assure him that she quite understood the pressure of business on every landowner who farmed his own estate but no such apology was made he shook her hand heartily as a mark of congratulation on her good fortune in having secured such a prize as his friend gibson but said nothing about his long neglect of duty molly who by this time knew the few strong expressions of his countenance well was sure that something was the matter and that he was very much disturbed he hardly attended to mrs gibsons fluent opening of conversation for she had already determined to make a favourable impression on the father of the handsome young man who was heir to an estate besides his own personal agreeableness but he turned to molly and addressing her saidalmost in a low voice as if he was making a confidence to her that he did not intend mrs gibson to hear molly we are all wrong at home osborne has lost the fellowship at trinity he went back to try for then he has gone and failed miserably in his degree after all that he said and that his mother said and i like a fool went and boasted about my clever son i cant understand it i never expected anything extraordinary from roger but osborne and then it has thrown madam into one of her bad fits of illness and she seems to have a fancy for you child your father came to see her this morning poor thing shes very poorly im afraid and she told him how she should like to have you about her and he said i might fetch you youll come wont you my dear shes not a poor woman such as many people think its the only charity to be kind to but shes just as forlorn of womans care as if she was poorworse i daresay ill be ready in ten minutes said molly much touched by the squires words and manner never thinking of asking her stepmothers consent now that she had heard that her father had given his as she rose to leave the room mrs gibson who had only half heard what the squire had said and was a little affronted at the exclusiveness of his confidence saidmy dear where are you going mrs hamley wants me and papa says i may go said molly and almost at the same time the squire replied my wife is ill and as shes very fond of your daughter she begged mr gibson to allow her to come to the hall for a little while and he kindly said she might and im come to fetch her stop a minute darling said mrs gibson to mollya slight cloud over her countenance in spite of her caressing word i am sure dear papa quite forgot that you were to go out with me tonight to visit people continued she addressing herself to the squire with whom i am quite unacquaintedand it is very uncertain if mr gibson can return in time to accompany meso you see i cannot allow molly to go with you i shouldnt have thought it would have signified brides are always brides i suppose and its their part to be timid but i shouldnt have thought itin this case and my wife sets her heart on things as sick people do well molly in a louder tone for these foregoing sentences were spoken sotto voce we must put it off till tomorrow and its our loss not yours he continued as he saw the reluctance with which she slowly returned to her place youll be as gay as can be tonight i daresay no i shall not broke in molly i never wanted to go and now i shall want it less than ever hush my dear said mrs gibson and addressing the squire she added the visiting here is not all one could wish for so young a girlno young people no dances nothing of gaiety but it is wrong in you molly to speak against such kind friends of your fathers as i understand these cockerells are dont give so bad an impression of yourself to the kind squire let her alone let her alone quoth he i see what she means shed rather come and be in my wifes sickroom than go out for this visit tonight is there no way of getting her off none whatever said mrs gibson an engagement is an engagement with me and i consider that she is not only engaged to mrs cockerell but to mebound to accompany me in my husbands absence the squire was put out and when he was put out he had a trick of placing his hands on his knees and whistling softly to himself molly knew this phase of his displeasure and only hoped he would confine himself to this wordless expression of annoyance it was pretty hard work for her to keep the tears out of her eyes and she endeavoured to think of something else rather than dwell on regrets and annoyances she heard mrs gibson talking on in a sweet monotone and wished to attend to what she was saying but the squires visible annoyance struck sharper on her mind at length after a pause of silence he started up and said well its no use poor madam she wont like it shell be disappointed but its but for one eveningbut for one evening she may come tomorrow maynt she or will the dissipation of such an evening as she describes be too much for her there was a touch of savage irony in his manner which frightened mrs gibson into good behaviour she shall be ready at any time you name i am so sorry my foolish shyness is in fault i believe but still you must acknowledge that an engagement is an engagement did i ever say an engagement was an elephant madam however theres no use saying any more about it or i shall forget my manners im an old tyrant and shelying there in bed poor girlhas always given me my own way so youll excuse me mrs gibson wont you and let molly come along with me at ten tomorrow morning certainly said mrs gibson smiling but when his back was turned she said to molly now my dear i must never have you exposing me to the illmanners of such a man again i dont call him a squire i call him a boor or a yeoman at best you must not go on accepting or rejecting invitations as if you were an independent young lady molly pay me the respect of a reference to my wishes another time if you please my dear papa had said i might go said molly choking a little as i am now your mamma your references must be to me for the future but as you are to go you may as well look well dressed i will lend you my new shawl for this visit if you like it and my set of green ribbons i am always indulgent when proper respect is paid to me and in such a house as hamley hall no one can tell who may be coming and going even if there is sickness in the family thank you but i dont want the shawl and the ribbons please there will be nobody there except the family there never is i think and now that she is so illmolly was on the point of crying at the thought of her friend lying ill and lonely and looking for her arrival moreover she was sadly afraid lest the squire had gone off with the idea that she did not want to comethat she preferred that stupid stupid party at the cockerells mrs gibson too was sorry she had an uncomfortable consciousness of having given way to temper before a stranger and a stranger too whose good opinion she had meant to cultivate and she was also annoyed at mollys tearful face what can i do for you to bring you back into good temper she said first you insist upon your knowing lady harriet better than i doi who have known her for eighteen or nineteen years at least then you jump at invitations without ever consulting me or thinking of how awkward it would be for me to go stumping into a drawingroom all by myself following my new name too which always makes me feel uncomfortable it is such a sad comedown after kirkpatrick and then when i offer you some of the prettiest things i have got you say it does not signify how you are dressed what can i do to please you molly i who delight in nothing more than peace in a family to see you sitting there with despair upon your face molly could stand it no longer she went upstairs to her own roomher own smart new room which hardly yet seemed a familiar place and began to cry so heartily and for so long a time that she stopped at length for very weariness she thought of mrs hamley wearying for her of the old hall whose very quietness might become oppressive to an ailing person of the trust the squire had had in her that she would come off directly with him and all this oppressed her much more than the querulousness of her stepmothers words chapter xvii trouble at hamley hall if molly thought that peace dwelt perpetually at hamley hall she was sorely mistaken something was out of tune in the whole establishment and for a very unusual thing the common irritation seemed to have produced a common bond all the servants were old in their places and were told by some one of the family or gathered from the unheeded conversation carried on before them everything that affected master or mistress or either of the young gentlemen any one of them could have told molly that the grievance which lay at the root of everything was the amount of the bills run up by osborne at cambridge and which now that all chance of his obtaining a fellowship was over came pouring down upon the squire but molly confident of being told by mrs hamley herself anything which she wished her to hear encouraged no confidences from any one else she was struck with the change in madams look as soon as she caught sight of her in the darkened room lying on the sofa in her dressingroom all dressed in white which almost rivalled the white wanness of her face the squire ushered molly in with here she is at last and molly had scarcely imagined that he had so much variety in the tones of his voicethe beginning of the sentence was spoken in a loud congratulatory manner while the last words were scarcely audible he had seen the deathlike pallor on his wifes face not a new sight and one which had been presented to him gradually enough but which was now always giving him a fresh shock it was a lovely tranquil winters day every branch and every twig on the trees and shrubs was glittering with drops of the sunmelted hoarfrost a robin was perched on a hollybush piping cheerily but the blinds were down and out of mrs hamleys windows nothing of all this was to be seen there was even a large screen placed between her and the woodfire to keep off that cheerful blaze mrs hamley stretched out one hand to molly and held hers firm with the other she shaded her eyes she is not so well this morning said the squire shaking his head but never fear my dear one heres the doctors daughter nearly as good as the doctor himself have you had your medicine your beeftea he continued going about on heavy tiptoe and peeping into every empty cup and glass then he returned to the sofa looked at her for a minute or two and then softly kissed her and told molly he would leave her in charge as if mrs hamley was afraid of mollys remarks or questions she began in her turn a hasty system of interrogatories now dear child tell me all its no breach of confidence for i shant mention it again and i shant be here long how does it all go onthe new mother the good resolutions let me help you if i can i think with a girl i could have been of usea mother does not know boys but tell me anything you like and will dont be afraid of details even with mollys small experience of illness she saw how much of restless fever there was in this speech and instinct or some such gift prompted her to tell a long story of many thingsthe weddingday her visit to miss brownings the new furniture lady harriet c all in an easy flow of talk which was very soothing to mrs hamley inasmuch as it gave her something to think about beyond her own immediate sorrows but molly did not speak of her own grievances nor of the new domestic relationship mrs hamley noticed this and you and mrs gibson get on happily together not always said molly you know we didnt know much of each other before we were put to live together i didnt like what the squire told me last night he was very angry that sore had not yet healed over but molly resolutely kept silence beating her brains to think of some other subject of conversation ah i see molly said mrs hamley you wont tell me your sorrows and yet perhaps i could have done you some good i dont like said molly in a low voice i think papa wouldnt like it and besides you have helped me so muchyou and mr roger hamley i often think of the things he said they come in so usefully and are such a strength to me ah roger yes he is to be trusted oh molly ive a great deal to say to you myself only not now i must have my medicine and try to go to sleep good girl you are stronger than i am and can do without sympathy molly was taken to another room the maid who conducted her to it told her that mrs hamley had not wished her to have her nights disturbed as they might very probably have been if she had been in her former sleepingroom in the afternoon mrs hamley sent for her and with the want of reticence common to invalids especially to those suffering from long and depressing maladies she told molly of the family distress and disappointment she made molly sit down near her on a little stool and holding her hand and looking into her eyes to catch her spoken sympathy from their expression quicker than she could from her words she said osborne has so disappointed us i cannot understand it yet and the squire was so terribly angry i cannot think how all the money was spentadvances through moneylenders besides bills the squire does not show me how angry he is now because hes afraid of another attack but i know how angry he is you see he has been spending ever so much money in reclaiming that land at upton common and is very hard pressed himself but it would have doubled the value of the estate and so we never thought anything of economies which would benefit osborne in the long run and now the squire says he must mortgage some of the land and you cant think how it cuts him to the heart he sold a great deal of timber to send the two boys to college osborneoh what a dear innocent boy he was he was the heir you know and he was so clever every one said he was sure of honours and a fellowship and i dont know what all and he did get a scholarship and then all went wrong i dont know how that is the worst perhaps the squire wrote too angrily and that stopped up confidence but he might have told me he would have done i think molly if he had been here face to face with me but the squire in his anger told him not to show his face at home till he had paid off the debts he had incurred out of his allowance out of two hundred and fifty a year to pay off more than nine hundred one way or another and not to come home till then perhaps roger will have debts too he had but two hundred but then he was not the eldest son the squire has given orders that the men are to be turned off the drainingworks and i lie awake thinking of their poor families this wintry weather but what shall we do ive never been strong and perhaps ive been extravagant in my habits and there were family traditions as to expenditure and the reclaiming of this land oh molly osborne was such a sweet little baby and such a loving boy so clever too you know i read you some of his poetry now could a person who wrote like that do anything very wrong and yet im afraid he has dont you know at all how the money has gone asked molly no not at all thats the sting there are tailors bills and bills for bookbinding and wine and picturesthose come to four or five hundred and though this expenditure is extraordinaryinexplicable to such simple folk as we areyet it may be only the luxury of the present day but the money for which he will give no accountof which indeed we only heard through the squires london agents who found out that certain disreputable attorneys were making inquiries as to the entail of the estateoh molly worse than alli dont know how to bring myself to tell youas to the age and health of the squire his dear fathershe began to sob almost hysterically yet she would go on talking in spite of mollys efforts to stop herwho held him in his arms and blessed him even before i had kissed him and thought always so much of him as his heir and firstborn darling how he has loved him how i have loved him i sometimes have thought of late that weve almost done that good roger injustice no im sure youve not only look at the way he loves you why you are his first thought he may not speak about it but any one may see it and dear dear mrs hamley said molly determined to say out all that was in her mind now that she had once got the word dont you think that it would be better not to misjudge mr osborne hamley we dont know what he has done with the money he is so good is he not that he may have wanted it to relieve some poor personsome tradesman for instance pressed by creditorssome you forget dear said mrs hamley smiling a little at the girls impetuous romance but sighing the next instant that all the other bills come from tradesmen who complain piteously of being kept out of their money molly was nonplussed for the moment but then she said i daresay they imposed upon him im sure ive heard stories of young men being made regular victims of by the shopkeepers in great towns youre a great darling child said mrs hamley comforted by mollys strong partisanship unreasonable and ignorant though it was and besides continued molly some one must be acting wrongly in osbornesmr osborne hamleys i meani cant help saying osborne sometimes but indeed i always think of him as mr osborne never mind molly what you call him only go on talking it seems to do me good to hear the hopeful side taken the squire has been so hurt and displeased strangelooking men coming into the neighbourhood too questioning the tenants and grumbling about the last fall of timber as if they were calculating on the squires death thats just what i was going to speak about doesnt it show that they are bad men and would bad men scruple to impose upon him and to tell lies in his name and to ruin him dont you see you only make him out weak instead of wicked yes perhaps i do but i dont think he is weak you know yourself dear mrs hamley how very clever he really is besides i would rather he was weak than wicked weak people may find themselves all at once strong in heaven when they see things quite clearly but i dont think the wicked will turn themselves into virtuous people all at once i think ive been very weak molly said mrs hamley stroking mollys curls affectionately ive made such an idol of my beautiful osborne and he turns out to have feet of clay not strong enough to stand firm on the ground and thats the best view of his conduct too what with his anger against his son and his anxiety about his wife the difficulty of raising the money immediately required and his irritation at the scarceconcealed inquiries made by strangers as to the value of his property the poor squire was in a sad state he was angry and impatient with every one who came near him and then was depressed at his own violent temper and unjust words the old servants who perhaps cheated him in many small things were beautifully patient under his upbraidings they could understand bursts of passion and knew the cause of his variable moods as well as he did himself the butler who was accustomed to argue with his master about every fresh direction as to his work now nudged molly at dinnertime to make her eat of some dish which she had just been declining and explained his conduct afterwards as follows you see miss me and cook had planned a dinner as would tempt master to eat but when you say no thank you when i hand you anything master never so much as looks at it but if you takes a thing and eats with a relish why first he waits and then he looks and byandby he smells and then he finds out as hes hungry and falls to eating as natural as a kitten takes to mewing thats the reason miss as i gave you a nudge and a wink which no one knows better nor me was not manners osbornes name was never mentioned during these cheerless meals the squire asked molly questions about hollingford people but did not seem much to attend to her answers he used also to ask her every day how she thought that his wife was but if molly told the truththat every day seemed to make her weaker and weakerhe was almost savage with the girl he could not bear it and he would not nay once he was on the point of dismissing mr gibson because he insisted on a consultation with dr nicholls the great physician of the county its nonsense thinking her so ill as thatyou know its only the delicacy shes had for years and if you cant do her any good in such a simple caseno painonly weakness and nervousnessit is a simple case ehdont look in that puzzled way manyoud better give her up altogether and ill take her to bath or brighton or somewhere for change for in my opinion its only moping and nervousness but the squires bluff florid face was pinched with anxiety and worn with the effort of being deaf to the footsteps of fate as he said these words which belied his fears mr gibson replied very quietly i shall go on coming to see her and i know youll not forbid my visits but i shall bring dr nicholls with me the next time i come i may be mistaken in my treatment and i wish to god he may say i am mistaken in my apprehensions dont tell me them i cannot bear them cried the squire of course we must all die and she must too but the cleverest doctor in england shant go about coolly meting out the life of such as her i daresay i shall die first i hope i shall but ill knock any one down who speaks to me of death sitting within me and besides i think all doctors are ignorant quacks pretending to knowledge they havent got ay you may smile at me i dont care unless you can tell me i shall die first neither you nor your dr nicholls shall come prophesying and croaking about this house mr gibson went away heavy at heart from the thought of mrs hamleys approaching death but thinking little enough of the squires speeches he had almost forgotten them in fact when about nine oclock that evening a groom rode in from hamley hall in hot haste with a note from the squire dear gibson for gods sake forgive me if i was rude today she is much worse come and spend the night here write for nicholls and all the physicians you want write before you start off they may give her ease there were whitworth doctors much talked of in my youth for curing people given up by the regular doctors cant you get one of them i put myself in your hands sometimes i think it is the turning point and shell rally after this bout i trust all to you yours ever r hamley psmolly is a treasuregod help me of course mr gibson went for the first time since his marriage cutting short mrs gibsons querulous lamentations over her life as involved in that of a doctor called out at all hours of day and night he brought mrs hamley through this attack and for a day or two the squires alarm and gratitude made him docile in mr gibsons hands then he returned to the idea of its being a crisis through which his wife had passed and that she was now on the way to recovery but the day after the consultation with dr nicholls mr gibson said to molly molly ive written to osborne and roger do you know osbornes address no papa hes in disgrace i dont know if the squire knows and she has been too ill to write never mind ill enclose it to roger whatever those lads may be to others theres as strong brotherly love as ever i saw between the two roger will know and molly they are sure to come home as soon as they hear my report of their mothers state i wish youd tell the squire what ive done its not a pleasant piece of work and ill tell madam myself in my own way id have told him if hed been at home but you say he was obliged to go to ashcombe on business quite obliged he was so sorry to miss you but papa he will be so angry you dont know how mad he is against osborne molly dreaded the squires anger when she gave him her fathers message she had seen quite enough of the domestic relations of the hamley family to understand that underneath his oldfashioned courtesy and the pleasant hospitality he showed to her as a guest there was a strong will and a vehement passionate temper along with that degree of obstinacy in prejudices or opinions as he would have called them so common to those who have neither in youth nor in manhood mixed largely with their kind she had listened day after day to mrs hamleys plaintive murmurs as to the deep disgrace in which osborne was being held by his fatherthe prohibition of his coming home and she hardly knew how to begin to tell him that the letter summoning osborne had already been sent off their dinners were ttette the squire tried to make them pleasant to molly feeling deeply grateful to her for the soothing comfort she was to his wife he made merry speeches which sank away into silence and at which they each forgot to smile he ordered up rare wines which she did not care for but tasted out of complaisance he noticed that one day she had eaten some brown beurr pears as if she liked them and as his trees had not produced many this year he gave directions that this particular kind should be sought for through the neighbourhood molly felt that in many ways he was full of goodwill towards her but it did not diminish her dread of touching on the one sore point in the family however it had to be done and that without delay the great log was placed on the afterdinner fire the hearth swept up the ponderous candles snuffed and then the door was shut and molly and the squire were left to their dessert she sat at the side of the table in her old place that at the head was vacant yet as no orders had been given to the contrary the plate and glasses and napkin were always arranged as regularly and methodically as if mrs hamley would come in as usual indeed sometimes when the door by which she used to enter was opened by any chance molly caught herself looking round as if she expected to see the tall languid figure in the elegant draperies of rich silk and soft lace which mrs hamley was wont to wear of an evening this evening it struck her as a new thought of pain that into that room she would come no more she had fixed to give her fathers message at this very point of time but something in her throat choked her and she hardly knew how to govern her voice the squire got up and went to the broad fireplace to strike into the middle of the great log and split it up into blazing sparkling pieces his back was towards her molly began when papa was here today he bade me tell you he had written to mr roger hamley to say thatthat he thought he had better come home and he enclosed a letter to mr osborne hamley to say the same thing the squire put down the poker but he still kept his back to molly he sent for osborne and roger he asked at length molly answered yes then there was a dead silence which molly thought would never end the squire had placed his two hands on the high chimneypiece and stood leaning over the fire roger would have been down from cambridge on the th said he and he has sent for osborne too did he knowhe continued turning round to molly with something of the fierceness she had anticipated in voice and look in another moment he had dropped his voice its right quite right i understand it has come at length come come osborne has brought it on though with a fresh access of anger in his tones she might have some word molly could not hearshe thought it sounded like lingered but for that i cant forgive him i cannot and then he suddenly left the room while molly sat there still very sad in her sympathy with all he put his head in again go to her my dear i cannotnot just yet but i will soon just this bit and after that i wont lose a moment youre a good girl god bless you it is not to be supposed that molly had remained all this time at the hall without interruption once or twice her father had brought her a summons home molly thought she could perceive that he had brought it unwillingly in fact it was mrs gibson that had sent for her almost as it were to preserve a right of way through her actions you shall come back tomorrow or the next day her father had said but mamma seems to think people will put a bad construction on your being so much away from home so soon after our marriage oh papa im afraid mrs hamley will miss me i do so like being with her i dont think it is likely she will miss you as much as she would have done a month or two ago she sleeps so much now that she is scarcely conscious of the lapse of time ill see that you come back here again in a day or two so out of the silence and the soft melancholy of the hall molly returned into the allpervading element of chatter and gossip at hollingford mrs gibson received her kindly enough once she had a smart new winter bonnet ready to give her as a present but she did not care to hear any particulars about the friends whom molly had just left and her few remarks on the state of affairs at the hall jarred terribly on the sensitive molly what a time she lingers your papa never expected she would last half so long after that attack it must be very wearing work to them all i declare you look quite another creature since you were there one can only wish it maynt last for their sakes you dont know how the squire values every minute said molly why you say she sleeps a great deal and doesnt talk much when shes awake and theres not the slightest hope for her and yet at such times people are kept on the tenterhooks with watching and waiting i know it by my dear kirkpatrick there really were days when i thought it never would end but we wont talk any more of such dismal things youve had quite enough of them im sure and it always makes me melancholy to hear of illness and death and yet your papa seems sometimes as if he could talk of nothing else im going to take you out tonight though and that will give you something of a change and ive been getting miss rose to trim up one of my old gowns for you its too tight for me theres some talk of dancingits at mrs edwards oh mamma i cannot go cried molly ive been so much with her and she may be suffering so or even dyingand i to be dancing nonsense youre no relation so you need not feel it so much i wouldnt urge you if she was likely to know about it and be hurt but as it is its all fixed that you are to go and dont let us have any nonsense about it we might sit twirling our thumbs and repeating hymns all our lives long if we were to do nothing else when people were dying i cannot go repeated molly and acting upon impulse and almost to her own surprise she appealed to her father who came into the room at this very time he contracted his dark eyebrows and looked annoyed as both wife and daughter poured their different sides of the argument into his ears he sat down in desperation of patience when his turn came to pronounce a decision he said i suppose i can have some lunch i went away at six this morning and theres nothing in the diningroom i have to go off again directly molly started to the door mrs gibson made haste to ring the bell where are you going molly said she sharply only to see about papas lunch there are servants to do it and i dont like your going into the kitchen come molly sit down and be quiet said her father one comes home wanting peace and quietnessand food too if i am to be appealed to which i beg i may not be another time i settle that molly stops at home this evening i shall come back late and tired see that i have something ready to eat goosey and then ill dress myself up in my best and go and fetch you home my dear i wish all these wedding festivities were well over ready is it then ill go into the diningroom and gorge myself a doctor ought to be able to eat like a camel or like major dugald dalgetty it was well for molly that callers came in just at this time for mrs gibson was extremely annoyed they told her some little local piece of news however which filled up her mind and molly found that if she only expressed wonder enough at the engagement they had both heard of from the departed callers the previous discussion as to her accompanying her stepmother or not might be entirely passed over not entirely though for the next morning she had to listen to a very brilliantly touchedup account of the dance and the gaiety which she had missed and also to be told that mrs gibson had changed her mind about giving her the gown and thought now that she should reserve it for cynthia if only it was long enough but cynthia was so tallquite overgrown in fact the chances seemed equally balanced as to whether molly might not have the gown after all chapter xviii mr osbornes secret illustration untitled osborne and roger came to the hall molly found roger established there when she returned after this absence at home she gathered that osborne was coming but very little was said about him in any way the squire scarcely ever left his wifes room he sat by her watching her and now and then moaning to himself she was so much under the influence of opiates that she did not often rouse up but when she did she almost invariably asked for molly on these rare occasions she would ask after osbornewhere he was if he had been told and if he was coming in her weakened and confused state of intellect she seemed to have retained two strong impressionsone of the sympathy with which molly had received her confidence about osborne the other of the anger which her husband entertained against him before the squire she never mentioned osbornes name nor did she seem at her ease in speaking about him to roger while when she was alone with molly she hardly spoke of any one else she must have had some sort of wandering idea that roger blamed his brother while she remembered mollys eager defence which she had thought hopelessly improbable at the time at any rate she made molly her confidante about her firstborn she sent her to ask roger how soon he would come for she seemed to know perfectly well that he was coming tell me all roger says he will tell you but it was several days before molly could ask roger any questions and meanwhile mrs hamleys state had materially altered at length molly came upon roger sitting in the library his head buried in his hands he did not hear her footstep till she was close beside him then he lifted up his face red and stained with tears his hair all ruffled up and in disorder ive been wanting to see you alone she began your mother does so want some news of your brother osborne she told me last week to ask you about him but i did not like to speak of him before your father she has hardly ever named him to me i dont know why for to me she used to talk of him perpetually i have seen so little of her this week and i think she forgets a great deal now still if you dont mind i should like to be able to tell her something if she asks me again he put his head again between his hands and did not answer her for some time what does she want to know said he at last does she know that osborne is coming soonany day yes but she wants to know where he is i cant tell you i dont exactly know i believe hes abroad but im not sure but youve sent papas letter to him ive sent it to a friend of his who will know better than i do where hes to be found you must know that he isnt free from creditors molly you cant have been one of the family like a child of the house almost without knowing that much for that and for other reasons i dont exactly know where he is i will tell her so you are sure he will come quite sure but molly i think my mother may live some time yet dont you dr nicholls said so yesterday when he was here with your father he said she had rallied more than he had ever expected youre not afraid of any change that makes you so anxious for osbornes coming no its only for her that i asked she did seem so to crave for news of him i think she dreamed of him and then when she wakened it was a relief to her to talk about him to me she always seemed to associate me with him we used to speak so much of him when we were together i dont know what we should any of us have done without you youve been like a daughter to my mother i do so love her said molly softly yes i see have you ever noticed that she sometimes calls you fanny it was the name of a little sister of ours who died i think she often takes you for her it was partly that and partly that at such a time as this one cant stand on formalities that made me call you molly i hope you dont mind it no i like it but will you tell me something more about your brother she really hungers for news of him shed better ask me herself yet no i am so involved by promises of secrecy molly that i couldnt satisfy her if she once began to question me i believe hes in belgium and that he went there about a fortnight ago partly to avoid his creditors you know my father has refused to pay his debts yes at least i knew something like it i dont believe my father could raise the money all at once without having recourse to steps which he would exceedingly recoil from yet for the time it places osborne in a very awkward position i think what vexes your father a good deal is some mystery as to how the money was spent if my mother ever says anything about that part of the affair said roger hastily assure her from me that theres nothing of vice or wrongdoing about it i cant say more im tied but set her mind at ease on that point im not sure if she remembers all her painful anxiety about this said molly she used to speak a great deal to me about him before you came when your father seemed so angry and now whenever she sees me she wants to talk on the old subject but she doesnt remember so clearly if she were to see him i dont believe she would recollect why she was uneasy about him while he was absent he must be here soon i expect him every day said roger uneasily do you think your father will be very angry with him asked molly with as much timidity as if the squires displeasure might be directed against her i dont know said roger my mothers illness may alter him but he didnt easily forgive us formerly i remember oncebut that is nothing to the purpose i cant help fancying that he has put himself under some strong restraint for my mothers sake and that he wont express much but it doesnt follow that he will forget it my father is a man of few affections but what he has are very strong he feels anything that touches him on these points deeply and permanently that unlucky valuing of the property it has given my father the idea of postobits what are they asked molly raising money to be paid on my fathers death which of course involves calculations as to the duration of his life how shocking said she im as sure as i am of my own life that osborne never did anything of the kind but my father expressed his suspicions in language that irritated osborne and he doesnt speak out and wont justify himself even as much as he might and much as he loves me ive but little influence over him or else he would tell my father all well we must leave it to time he added sighing my mother would have brought us all right if shed been what she once was he turned away leaving molly very sad she knew that every member of the family she cared for so much was in trouble out of which she saw no exit and her small power of helping them was diminishing day by day as mrs hamley sank more and more under the influence of opiates and stupefying illness her father had spoken to her only this very day of the desirableness of her returning home for good mrs gibson wanted herfor no particular reason but for many small fragments of reasons mrs hamley had ceased to want her much only occasionally appearing to remember her existence her position her father thoughtthe idea had not entered her head in a family of which the only woman was an invalid confined to bed was becoming awkward but molly had begged hard to remain two or three days longeronly thatonly till friday if mrs hamley should want her she argued with tears in her eyes and should hear that she had left the house she would think her so unkind so ungrateful my dear child shes getting past wanting any one the keenness of earthly feelings is deadened papa that is worst of all i cannot bear it i wont believe it she may not ask for me again and may quite forget me but im sure to the very last if the medicines dont stupefy her she will look round for the squire and her children for poor osborne most of all because hes in sorrow mr gibson shook his head but said nothing in reply in a minute or two he asked i dont like to take you away while you even fancy you can be of use or comfort to one who has been so kind to you but if she hasnt wanted you before friday will you be convinced will you come home willingly if i go then i may see her once again even if she hasnt asked for me inquired molly yes of course you must make no noise no step but you may go in and see her i must tell you im almost certain she wont ask for you but she may papa i will go home on friday if she does not i think she will so molly hung about the house trying to do all she could out of the sickroom for the comfort of those in it they only came out for meals or for necessary business and found little time for talking to her so her life was solitary enough waiting for the call that never came the evening of the day on which she had had the above conversation with roger osborne arrived he came straight into the drawingroom where molly was seated on the rug reading by firelight as she did not like to ring for candles merely for her own use osborne came in with a kind of hurry which almost made him appear as if he would trip himself up and fall down molly rose he had not noticed her before now he came forwards and took hold of both her hands leading her into the full flickering light and straining his eyes to look into her face how is she you will tell meyou must know the truth ive travelled day and night since i got your fathers letter before she could frame her answer he had sate down in the nearest chair covering his eyes with his hand shes very ill said molly that you know but i dont think she suffers much pain she has wanted you sadly he groaned aloud my father forbade me to come i know said molly anxious to prevent his selfreproach your brother was away too i think no one knew how ill she wasshe had been an invalid for so long you know yes she told you a great dealshe was very fond of you and god knows how i loved her if i had not been forbidden to come home i should have told her all does my father know of my coming now yes said molly i told him papa had sent for you just at that moment the squire came in he had not heard of osbornes arrival and was seeking molly to ask her to write a letter for him osborne did not stand up when his father entered he was too much exhausted too much oppressed by his feelings and also too much estranged by his fathers angry suspicious letters if he had come forward with any manifestation of feeling at this moment everything might have been different but he waited for his father to see him before he uttered a word all that the squire said when his eye fell upon him at last was you here sir and breaking off in the directions he was giving to molly he abruptly left the room all the time his heart was yearning after his firstborn but mutual pride kept them asunder yet he went straight to the butler and asked of him when mr osborne had arrived and how he had come and if he had had any refreshmentdinner or whatsince his arrival for i think i forget everything now said the poor squire putting his hand up to his head for the life of me i cant remember whether weve had dinner or not these long nights and all this sorrow and watching quite bewilder me perhaps sir you will take some dinner with mr osborne mrs morgan is sending up his directly you hardly sate down at dinnertime sir you thought my mistress wanted something ay i remember now no i wont have any more give mr osborne what wine he chooses perhaps he can eat and drink so the squire went away upstairs with bitterness as well as sorrow in his heart when lights were brought molly was struck with the change in osborne he looked haggard and worn perhaps with travelling and anxiety not quite such a dainty gentleman either as molly had thought him when she had last seen him calling on her stepmother two months before but she liked him better now the tone of his remarks pleased her more he was simpler and less ashamed of showing his feelings he asked after roger in a warm longing kind of way roger was out he had ridden to ashcombe to transact some business for the squire osborne evidently wished for his return and hung about restlessly in the drawingroom after he had dined youre sure i maynt see her tonight he asked molly for the third or fourth time no indeed i will go up again if you like it but mrs jones the nurse dr nicholls sent is a very decided person i went up while you were at dinner and mrs hamley had just taken her drops and was on no account to be disturbed by seeing any one much less by any excitement osborne kept walking up and down the long drawingroom half talking to himself half to molly i wish roger would come he seems to be the only one to give me a welcome does my father always live upstairs in my mothers rooms miss gibson he has done since her last attack i believe he reproaches himself for not having been enough alarmed before you heard all the words he said to me they were not much of a welcome were they and my dear mother who alwayswhether i was to blame or noti suppose roger is sure to come home tonight quite sure you are staying here are you not do you often see my mother or does this omnipotent nurse keep you out too mrs hamley hasnt asked for me for three days now and i dont go into her room unless she asks im leaving on friday i believe my mother was very fond of you i know after a while he said in a voice that had a great deal of sensitive pain in its tone i supposedo you know whether she is quite consciousquite herself not always conscious said molly tenderly she has to take so many opiates but she never wanders only forgets and sleeps oh mother mother said he stopping suddenly and hanging over the fire his hands on the chimneypiece when roger came home molly thought it time to retire poor girl it was getting to be time for her to leave this scene of distress in which she could be of no use she sobbed herself to sleep this tuesday night two days more and it would be friday and she would have to wrench up the roots she had shot down into this ground the weather was bright the next morning and morning and sunny weather cheer up young hearts molly sate in the diningroom making tea for the gentlemen as they came down she could not help hoping that the squire and osborne might come to a better understanding before she left for after all in the dissension between father and son lay a bitterer sting than in the illness sent by god but though they met at the breakfasttable they purposely avoided addressing each other perhaps the natural subject of conversation between the two at such a time would have been osbornes long journey the night before but he had never spoken of the place he had come from whether north south east or west and the squire did not choose to allude to anything that might bring out what his son wished to conceal again there was an unexpressed idea in both their minds that mrs hamleys present illness was much aggravated if not entirely brought on by the discovery of osbornes debts so many inquiries and answers on that head were tabooed in fact their attempts at easy conversation were limited to local subjects and principally addressed to molly or roger such intercourse was not productive of pleasure or even of friendly feeling though there was a thin outward surface of politeness and peace long before the day was over molly wished that she had acceded to her fathers proposal and gone home with him no one seemed to want her mrs jones the nurse assured her time after time that mrs hamley had never named her name and her small services in the sickroom were not required since there was a regular nurse osborne and roger seemed all in all to each other and molly now felt how much the short conversations she had had with roger had served to give her something to think about all during the remainder of her solitary days osborne was extremely polite and even expressed his gratitude to her for her attentions to his mother in a very pleasant manner but he appeared to be unwilling to show her any of the deeper feelings of his heart and almost ashamed of his exhibition of emotion the night before he spoke to her as any agreeable young man speaks to any pleasant young lady but molly almost resented this it was only the squire who seemed to make her of any account he gave her letters to write small bills to reckon up and she could have kissed his hands for thankfulness the last afternoon of her stay at the hall came roger had gone out on the squires business molly went into the garden thinking over the last summer when mrs hamleys sofa used to be placed under the old cedartree on the lawn and when the warm air seemed to be scented with roses and sweetbriar now the trees leafless there was no sweet odour in the keen frosty air and looking up at the house there were the white sheets of blinds shutting out the pale winter sky from the invalids room then she thought of the day her father had brought her the news of his second marriage the thicket was tangled with dead weeds and rime and hoarfrost and the beautiful fine articulations of branches and boughs and delicate twigs were all intertwined in leafless distinctness against the sky could she ever be so passionately unhappy again was it goodness or was it numbness that made her feel as though life was too short to be troubled much about anything death seemed the only reality she had neither energy nor heart to walk far or briskly and turned back towards the house the afternoon sun was shining brightly on the windows and stirred up to unusual activity by some unknown cause the housemaids had opened the shutters and windows of the generally unused library the middle window was also a door the whitepainted wood went halfway up molly turned along the little flagpaved path that led past the library windows to the gate in the white railings at the front of the house and went in at the opened door she had had leave given to choose out any books she wished to read and to take them home with her and it was just the sort of halfdawdling employment suited to her taste this afternoon she mounted on the ladder to get to a particular shelf high up in a dark corner of the room and finding there some volume that looked interesting she sat down on the step to read part of it there she sat in her bonnet and cloak when osborne suddenly came in he did not see her at first indeed he seemed in such a hurry that he probably might not have noticed her at all if she had not spoken am i in your way i only came here for a minute to look for some books she came down the steps as she spoke still holding the book in her hand not at all it is i who am disturbing you i must just write a letter for the post and then i shall be gone is not this open door too cold for you oh no it is so fresh and pleasant she began to read again sitting on the lowest step of the ladder he to write at the large oldfashioned writingtable close to the window there was a minute or two of profound silence in which the rapid scratching of osbornes pen upon the paper was the only sound then came a click of the gate and roger stood at the open door his face was towards osborne sitting in the light his back to molly crouched up in her corner he held out a letter and said in hoarse breathlessness heres a letter from your wife osborne i went past the postoffice and thought osborne stood up angry dismay upon his face roger what have you done dont you see her roger looked round and molly stood up in her corner red trembling miserable as though she were a guilty person roger entered the room all three seemed to be equally dismayed molly was the first to speak she came forward and said i am so sorry i didnt wish to hear it but i couldnt help it you will trust me wont you and turning to roger she said to him with tears in her eyesplease say you know i shall not tell we cant help it said osborne gloomily only roger who knew of what importance it was ought to have looked round him before speaking so i should said roger im more vexed with myself than you can conceive not but what im as sure of you as of myself continued he turning to molly yes but said osborne you see how many chances there are that even the bestmeaning persons may let out what it is of such consequence to me to keep secret i know you think it so said roger well dont let us begin that old discussion againat any rate before a third person molly had had hard work all this time to keep from crying now that she was alluded to as the third person before whom conversation was to be restrained she said im going away perhaps i ought not to have been here im very sorryvery but ill try and forget what ive heard you cant do that said osborne still ungraciously but will you promise me never to speak about it to any onenot even to me or to roger will you try to act and speak as if you had never heard it im sure from what roger has told me about you that if you give me this promise i may rely upon it yes i will promise said molly putting out her hand as a kind of pledge osborne took it but rather as if the action was superfluous she added i think i should have done so even without a promise but it is perhaps better to bind oneself i will go away now i wish id never come into this room she put down her book on the table very softly and turned to leave the room choking down her tears until she was in the solitude of her own chamber but roger was at the door before her holding it open for her and readingshe felt that he was readingher face he held out his hand for hers and his firm grasp expressed both sympathy and regret for what had occurred she could hardly keep back her sobs till she reached her bedroom her feelings had been overwrought for some time past without finding the natural vent in action the leaving hamley hall had seemed so sad before and now she was troubled with having to bear away a secret which she ought never to have known and the knowledge of which had brought out a very uncomfortable responsibility then there would arise a very natural wonder as to who osbornes wife was molly had not stayed so long and so intimately in the hamley family without being well aware of the manner in which the future lady of hamley was planned for the squire for instance partly in order to show that osborne his heir was above the reach of molly gibson the doctors daughter in the early days before he knew molly well had often alluded to the grand the high and the wealthy marriage which hamley of hamley as represented by his clever brilliant handsome son osborne might be expected to make mrs hamley too unconsciously on her part showed the projects that she was constantly devising for the reception of the unknown daughterinlaw that was to be the drawingroom must be refurnished when osborne marriesor osbornes wife will like to have the west suite of rooms to herself it will perhaps be a trial to her to live with the old couple but we must arrange it so that she will feel it as little as possibleof course when mrs osborne comes we must try and give her a new carriage the old one does well enough for usthese and similar speeches had given molly the impression of the future mrs osborne as of some beautiful grand young lady whose very presence would make the old hall into a stately formal mansion instead of the pleasant unceremonious home that it was at present osborne too who had spoken with such languid criticism to mrs gibson about various country belles and even in his own home was apt to give himself airsonly at home his airs were poetically fastidious while with mrs gibson they had been socially fastidiouswhat unspeakably elegant beauty had he chosen for his wife who had satisfied him and yet satisfying him had to have her marriage kept in concealment from his parents at length molly tore herself up from her wonderings it was of no use she could not find out she might not even try the blank wall of her promise blocked up the way perhaps it was not even right to wonder and endeavour to remember slight speeches casual mentions of a name so as to piece them together into something coherent molly dreaded seeing either of the brothers again but they all met at dinnertime as if nothing had happened the squire was taciturn either from melancholy or displeasure he had never spoken to osborne since his return excepting about the commonest trifles when intercourse could not be avoided and his wifes state oppressed him like a heavy cloud coming over the light of his day osborne put on an indifferent manner to his father which molly felt sure was assumed but it was not conciliatory for all that roger quiet steady and natural talked more than all the others but he too was uneasy and in distress on many accounts today he principally addressed himself to molly entering into rather long narrations of late discoveries in natural history which kept up the current of talk without requiring much reply from any one molly had expected osborne to look something different from usualconscious or ashamed or resentful or even marriedbut he was exactly the osborne of the morninghandsome elegant languid in manner and in look cordial with his brother polite towards her secretly uneasy at the state of things between his father and himself she would never have guessed the concealed romance which lay perdu under that everyday behaviour she had always wished to come into direct contact with a lovestory here she had and she only found it very uncomfortable there was a sense of concealment and uncertainty about it all and her honest straightforward father her quiet life at hollingford which even with all its drawbacks was aboveboard and where everybody knew what everybody was doing seemed secure and pleasant in comparison of course she felt great pain at quitting the hall and at the mute farewell she had taken of her sleeping and unconscious friend but leaving mrs hamley now was a different thing to what it had been a fortnight ago then she was wanted at any moment and felt herself to be of comfort now her very existence seemed forgotten by the poor lady whose body appeared to be living so long after her soul she was sent home in the carriage loaded with true thanks from every one of the family osborne ransacked the greenhouses for flowers for her roger had chosen her out books of every kind the squire himself kept shaking her hand without being able to speak his gratitude till at last he took her in his arms and kissed her as he would have done a daughter chapter xix cynthias arrival mollys father was not at home when she returned and there was no one to give her a welcome mrs gibson was out paying calls the servants told molly she went upstairs to her own room meaning to unpack and arrange her borrowed books rather to her surprise she saw the chamber corresponding to her own being dusted water and towels too were being carried in is any one coming she asked of the housemaid missuss daughter from france miss kirkpatrick is coming tomorrow was cynthia coming at last oh what a pleasure it would be to have a companion a girl a sister of her own age mollys depressed spirits sprang up again with bright elasticity she longed for mrs gibsons return to ask her all about it it must be very sudden for mr gibson had said nothing of it at the hall the day before no quiet reading now the books were hardly put away with mollys usual neatness she went down into the drawingroom and could not settle to anything at last mrs gibson came home tired out with her walk and her heavy velvet cloak until that was taken off and she had rested herself for a few minutes she seemed quite unable to attend to mollys questions oh yes cynthia is coming home tomorrow by the umpire which passes through at ten oclock what an oppressive day it is for the time of the year i really am almost ready to faint cynthia heard of some opportunity i believe and was only too glad to leave school a fortnight earlier than we planned she never gave me the chance of writing to say i did or did not like her coming so much before the time and i shall have to pay for her just the same as if she had stopped and i meant to have asked her to bring me a french bonnet and then you could have had one made after mine but im very glad shes coming poor dear is anything the matter with her asked molly oh no why should there be you called her poor dear and it made me afraid lest she might be ill oh no its only a way i got into when mr kirkpatrick died a fatherless girlyou know one always does call them poor dears oh no cynthia never is ill shes as strong as a horse she never would have felt today as i have done could you get me a glass of wine and a biscuit my dear im really quite faint mr gibson was much more excited about cynthias arrival than her own mother was he anticipated her coming as a great pleasure to molly on whom in spite of his recent marriage and his new wife his interests principally centred he even found time to run upstairs and see the bedrooms of the two girls for the furniture of which he had paid a pretty round sum well i suppose young ladies like their bedrooms decked out in this way its very pretty certainly but i liked my own old room better papa but perhaps cynthia is accustomed to such decking up perhaps at any rate shell see weve tried to make it pretty yours is like hers thats right it might have hurt her if hers had been smarter than yours now goodnight in your fine flimsy bed molly was up betimesalmost before it was lightarranging her pretty hamley flowers in cynthias room she could hardly eat her breakfast that morning she ran upstairs and put on her things thinking that mrs gibson was quite sure to go down to the george inn where the umpire stopped to meet her daughter after a two years absence but to her surprise mrs gibson had arranged herself at her great worstedwork frame just as usual and she in her turn was astonished at mollys bonnet and cloak where are you going so early child the fog hasnt cleared away yet i thought you would go and meet cynthia and i wanted to go with you she will be here in half an hour and dear papa has told the gardener to take the wheelbarrow down for her luggage im not sure if he is not gone himself then are not you going asked molly with a good deal of disappointment no certainly not she will be here almost directly and besides i dont like to expose my feelings to every passerby in high street you forget i have not seen her for two years and i hate scenes in the marketplace she settled herself to her work again and molly after some consideration gave up her own going and employed herself in looking out of the downstairs window which commanded the approach from the town here she ishere she is she cried out at last her father was walking by the side of a tall young lady william the gardener was wheeling along a great cargo of baggage molly flew to the frontdoor and had it wide open to admit the newcomer some time before she arrived well here she is molly this is cynthia cynthia molly youre to be sisters you know molly saw the beautiful tall swaying figure against the light of the open door but could not see any of the features that were for the moment in shadow a sudden gush of shyness had come over her just at the instant and quenched the embrace she would have given a moment before but cynthia took her in her arms and kissed her on both cheeks heres mamma she said looking beyond molly on to the stairs where mrs gibson stood wrapped up in a shawl and shivering in the cold she ran past molly and mr gibson who rather averted their eyes from this first greeting between mother and child mrs gibson said why how you are grown darling you look quite a woman and so i am said cynthia i was before i went away ive hardly grown sinceexcept it is always to be hoped in wisdom yes that we will hope said mrs gibson in rather a meaning way indeed there were evidently hidden allusions in their seeming commonplace speeches when they all came into the full light and repose of the drawingroom molly was absorbed in the contemplation of cynthias beauty perhaps her features were not regular but the changes in her expressive countenance gave one no time to think of that her smile was perfect her pouting charming the play of the face was in the mouth her eyes were beautifully shaped but their expression hardly seemed to vary in colouring she was not unlike her mother only she had not so much of the redhaired tints in her complexion and her longshaped serious grey eyes were fringed with dark lashes instead of her mothers insipid flaxen ones molly fell in love with her so to speak on the instant she sate there warming her feet and hands as much at her ease as if she had been there all her life not particularly attending to her motherwho all the time was studying either her or her dressmeasuring molly and mr gibson with grave observant looks as if guessing how she should like them theres hot breakfast ready for you in the diningroom when you are ready for it said mr gibson im sure you must want it after your night journey he looked round at his wife at cynthias mother but she did not seem inclined to leave the warm room again molly will take you to your room darling said she it is near hers and she has got her things to take off ill come down and sit in the diningroom while you are having your breakfast but i really am afraid of the cold now cynthia rose and followed molly upstairs im so sorry there isnt a fire for you said molly buti suppose it wasnt ordered and of course i dont give any orders here is some hot water though stop a minute said cynthia getting hold of both mollys hands and looking steadily into her face but in such a manner that she did not dislike the inspection i think i shall like you i am so glad i was afraid i should not were all in a very awkward position together arent we i like your fathers looks though illustration first impressions molly could not help smiling at the way this was said cynthia replied to her smile ah you may laugh but i dont know that i am easy to get on with mamma and i didnt suit when we were last together but perhaps we are each of us wiser now now please leave me for a quarter of an hour i dont want anything more molly went into her own room waiting to show cynthia down to the diningroom not that in the moderatesized house there was any difficulty in finding the way a very little trouble in conjecturing would enable a stranger to discover any room but cynthia had so captivated molly that she wanted to devote herself to the newcomers service ever since she had heard of the probability of her having a sistershe called her a sister but whether it was a scotch sister or a sister la mode de brtagne would have puzzled most peoplemolly had allowed her fancy to dwell much on the idea of cynthias coming and in the short time since they had met cynthias unconscious power of fascination had been exercised upon her some people have this power of course its effects are only manifested in the susceptible a schoolgirl may be found in every school who attracts and influences all the others not by her virtues nor her beauty nor her sweetness nor her cleverness but by something that can neither be described nor reasoned upon it is the something alluded to in the old lines love me not for comely grace for my pleasing eye and face no nor for my constant heart for these may change and turn to ill and thus true love may sever but love me on and know not why so hast thou the same reason still to dote upon me ever a woman will have this charm not only over men but over her own sex it cannot be defined or rather it is so delicate a mixture of many gifts and qualities that it is impossible to decide on the proportions of each perhaps it is incompatible with very high principle as its essence seems to consist in the most exquisite power of adaptation to varying people and still more various moods being all things to all men at any rate molly might soon have been aware that cynthia was not remarkable for unflinching morality but the glamour thrown over her would have prevented molly from any attempt at penetrating into and judging her companions character even had such processes been the least in accordance with her own disposition cynthia was very beautiful and was so well aware of this fact that she had forgotten to care about it no one with such loveliness ever appeared so little conscious of it molly would watch her perpetually as she moved about the room with the free stately step of some wild animal of the forestmoving almost as it were to the continual sound of music her dress too though now to our ideas it would be considered ugly and disfiguring was suited to her complexion and figure and the fashion of it subdued within due bounds by her exquisite taste it was inexpensive enough and the changes in it were but few mrs gibson professed herself shocked to find that cynthia had but four gowns when she might have stocked herself so well and brought over so many useful french patterns if she had but patiently waited for her mothers answer to the letter which she had sent announcing her return by the opportunity madame had found for her molly was hurt for cynthia at all these speeches she thought they implied that the pleasure which her mother felt in seeing her a fortnight sooner after her two years absence was inferior to that which she would have received from a bundle of silverpaper patterns but cynthia took no apparent notice of the frequent recurrence of these small complaints indeed she received much of what her mother said with a kind of complete indifference that made mrs gibson hold her rather in awe and she was much more communicative to molly than to her own child with regard to dress however cynthia soon showed that she was her mothers own daughter in the manner in which she could use her deft and nimble fingers she was a capital workwoman and unlike molly who excelled in plain sewing but had no notion of dressmaking or millinery she could repeat the fashions she had only seen in passing along the streets of boulogne with one or two pretty rapid movements of her hands as she turned and twisted the ribbons and gauze her mother furnished her with so she refurbished mrs gibsons wardrobe doing it all in a sort of contemptuous manner the source of which molly could not quite make out day after day the course of these small frivolities was broken in upon by the news mr gibson brought of mrs hamleys nearer approach to death mollyvery often sitting by cynthia and surrounded by ribbon and wire and netheard the bulletins like the toll of a funeral bell at a marriage feast her father sympathized with her it was the loss of a dear friend to him too but he was so accustomed to death that it seemed to him but as it was the natural end of all things human to molly the death of some one she had known so well and loved so much was a sad and gloomy phenomenon she loathed the small vanities with which she was surrounded and would wander out into the frosty garden and pace the walk which was both sheltered and concealed by evergreens at lengthand yet it was not so long not a fortnight since molly had left the hallthe end came mrs hamley had sunk out of life as gradually as she had sunk out of consciousness and her place in this world the quiet waves closed over her and her place knew her no more they all sent their love to you molly said her father roger said he knew how you would feel it mr gibson had come in very late and was having a solitary dinner in the diningroom molly was sitting near him to keep him company cynthia and her mother were upstairs the latter was trying on a headdress which cynthia had made for her molly remained downstairs after her father had gone out afresh on his final round among his town patients the fire was growing very low and the lights were waning cynthia came softly in and taking mollys listless hand that hung down by her side sat at her feet on the rug chafing her chilly fingers without speaking the tender action thawed the tears that had been gathering heavily at mollys heart and they came dropping down her cheeks you loved her dearly did you not molly yes sobbed molly and then there was a silence had you known her long no not a year but i had seen a great deal of her i was almost like a daughter to her she said so yet i never bid her goodby or anything her mind became weak and confused she had only sons i think no only mr osborne and mr roger hamley she had a daughter oncefanny sometimes in her illness she used to call me fanny the two girls were silent for some time both gazing into the fire cynthia spoke first i wish i could love people as you do molly dont you said the other in surprise no a good number of people love me i believe or at least they think they do but i never seem to care much for any one i do believe i love you little molly whom i have only known for ten days better than any one not than your mother said molly in grave astonishment yes than my mother replied cynthia halfsmiling its very shocking i daresay but it is so now dont go and condemn me i dont think love for ones mother quite comes by nature and remember how much i have been separated from mine i loved my father if you will she continued with the force of truth in her tone and then she stopped but he died when i was quite a little thing and no one believes that i remember him i heard mamma say to a caller not a fortnight after his funeral oh no cynthia is too young she has quite forgotten himand i bit my lips to keep from crying out papa papa have i but its of no use well then mamma had to go out as a governess she couldnt help it poor thing but she didnt much care for parting with me i was a trouble i daresay so i was sent to school at four years old first one school and then another and in the holidays mamma went to stay at grand houses and i was generally left with the schoolmistresses once i went to the towers and mamma lectured me continually and yet i was very naughty i believe and so i never went again and i was very glad of it for it was a horrid place that it was said molly who remembered her own day of tribulation there and once i went to london to stay with my uncle kirkpatrick he is a lawyer and getting on now but then he was poor enough and had six or seven children it was wintertime and we were all shut up in a small house in doughty street but after all that wasnt so bad but then you lived with your mother when she began school at ashcombe mr preston told me that when i stayed that day at the manorhouse what did he tell you asked cynthia almost fiercely nothing but that oh yes he praised your beauty and wanted me to tell you what he had said i should have hated you if you had said cynthia of course i never thought of doing such a thing replied molly i didnt like him and lady harriet spoke of him the next day as if he wasnt a person to be liked cynthia was quite silent at length she said i wish i was good so do i said molly simply she was thinking again of mrs hamley only the actions of the just smell sweet and blossom in the dust and goodness just then seemed to her to be the only enduring thing in the world nonsense molly you are good at least if youre not good what am i theres a ruleofthree sum for you to do but its no use talking i am not good and i never shall be now perhaps i might be a heroine still but i shall never be a good woman i know do you think it easier to be a heroine yes as far as one knows of heroines from history im capable of a great jerk an effort and then a relaxationbut steady everyday goodness is beyond me i must be a moral kangaroo molly could not follow cynthias ideas she could not distract herself from the thoughts of the sorrowing group at the hall how i should like to see them all and yet one can do nothing at such a time papa says the funeral is to be on tuesday and that after that roger hamley is to go back to cambridge it will seem as if nothing had happened i wonder how the squire and mr osborne hamley will get on together hes the eldest son is he not why shouldnt he and his father get on well together oh i dont know that is to say i do know but i think i ought not to tell dont be so pedantically truthful molly besides your manner shows when you speak truth and when you speak falsehood without troubling yourself to use words i knew exactly what your i dont know meant i never consider myself bound to be truthful so i beg we may be on equal terms cynthia might well say she did not consider herself bound to be truthful she literally said what came uppermost without caring very much whether it was accurate or not but there was no illnature and in a general way no attempt at procuring any advantage for herself in all her deviations and there was often such a latent sense of fun in them that molly could not help being amused with them in fact though she condemned them in theory cynthias playfulness of manner glossed such failings over with a kind of charm and yet at times she was so soft and sympathetic that molly could not resist her even when she affirmed the most startling things the little account she made of her own beauty pleased mr gibson extremely and her pretty deference to him won his heart she was restless too till she had attacked mollys dress after she had remodelled her mothers now for you sweet one said she as she began upon one of mollys gowns ive been working as connoisseur until now now i begin as amateur she brought down her pretty artificial flowers plucked out of her own best bonnet to put into mollys saying they would suit her complexion and that a knot of ribbons would do well enough for her all the time she worked she sang she had a sweet voice in singing as well as in speaking and used to run up and down her gay french chansons without any difficulty so flexible in the art was she yet she did not seem to care for music she rarely touched the piano on which molly practised with daily conscientiousness cynthia was always willing to answer questions about her previous life though after the first she rarely alluded to it of herself but she was a most sympathetic listener to all mollys innocent confidences of joys and sorrows sympathizing even to the extent of wondering how she could endure mr gibsons second marriage and why she did not take some active steps of rebellion in spite of all this agreeable and pungent variety of companionship at home molly yearned after the hamleys if there had been a woman in that family she would probably have received many little notes and heard numerous details which were now lost to her or summed up in condensed accounts of her fathers visits at the hall which since his dear patient was dead were only occasional yes the squire is a good deal changed but hes better than he was theres an unspoken estrangement between him and osborne one can see it in the silence and constraint of their manners but outwardly they are friendlycivil at any rate the squire will always respect osborne as his heir and the future representative of the family osborne doesnt look well he says he wants change i think hes weary of the domestic dullness or domestic dissension but he feels his mothers death acutely its a wonder that he and his father are not drawn together by their common loss rogers away at cambridge tooexamination for the mathematical tripos altogether the aspect of both people and place is changed it is but natural such is perhaps the summingup of the news of the hamleys as contained in many bulletins they always ended in some kind message to molly mrs gibson generally said as a comment upon her husbands account of osbornes melancholy my dear why dont you ask him to dinner here a little quiet dinner you know cook is quite up to it and we would all of us wear blacks and lilacs he couldnt consider that as gaiety mr gibson took no more notice of these suggestions than by shaking his head he had grown accustomed to his wife by this time and regarded silence on his own part as a great preservative against long inconsequential arguments but every time that mrs gibson was struck by cynthias beauty she thought it more and more advisable that mr osborne hamley should be cheered up by a quiet little dinnerparty as yet no one but the ladies of hollingford and mr ashton the vicarthat hopeless and impracticable old bachelorhad seen cynthia and what was the good of having a lovely daughter if there were none but old women to admire her cynthia herself appeared extremely indifferent upon the subject and took very little notice of her mothers constant talk about the gaieties that were possible and the gaieties that were impossible in hollingford she exerted herself just as much to charm the two miss brownings as she would have done to delight osborne hamley or any other young heir that is to say she used no exertion but simply followed her own nature which was to attract every one of those she was thrown amongst the exertion seemed rather to be to refrain from doing so and to protest as she often did by slight words and expressive looks against her mothers words and humoursalike against her folly and her caresses molly was almost sorry for mrs gibson who seemed so unable to gain influence over her child one day cynthia read mollys thought im not good and i told you so somehow i cannot forgive her for her neglect of me as a child when i would have clung to her besides i hardly ever heard from her when i was at school and i know she put a stop to my coming over to her wedding i saw the letter she wrote to madame lefevre a child should be brought up with its parents if it is to think them infallible when it grows up but though it may know that there must be faults replied molly it ought to cover them over and try to forget their existence it ought but dont you see i have grown up outside the pale of duty and oughts love me as i am sweet one for i shall never be better chapter xx mrs gibsons visitors one day to mollys infinite surprise mr preston was announced as a caller mrs gibson and she were sitting together in the drawingroom cynthia was outgone into the town ashoppingwhen the door was opened the name given and in walked the young man his entrance seemed to cause more confusion than molly could well account for he came in with the same air of easy assurance with which he had received her and her father at ashcombe manorhouse he looked remarkably handsome in his ridingdress and with the openair exercise he had just had but mrs gibsons smooth brows contracted a little at the sight of him and her reception of him was much cooler than that which she usually gave to visitors yet there was a degree of agitation in it which surprised molly a little mrs gibson was at her everlasting worstedwork frame when mr preston entered the room but somehow in rising to receive him she threw down her basket of crewels and declining mollys offer to help her she would pick up all the reels herself before she asked her visitor to sit down he stood there hat in hand affecting an interest in the recovery of the worsted which molly was sure he did not feel for all the time his eyes were glancing round the room and taking note of the details in the arrangement at length they were seated and conversation began it is the first time i have been in hollingford since your marriage mrs gibson or i should certainly have called to pay my respects sooner i know you are very busy at ashcombe i did not expect you to call is lord cumnor at the towers i have not heard from her ladyship for more than a week no he seemed still detained at bath but i had a letter from him giving me certain messages for mr sheepshanks mr gibson is not at home im afraid no he is a great deal outalmost constantly i may say i had no idea that i should see so little of him a doctors wife leads a very solitary life mr preston you can hardly call it solitary i should think when you have such a companion as miss gibson always at hand said he bowing to molly oh but i call it solitude for a wife when her husband is away poor mr kirkpatrick was never happy unless i always went with himall his walks all his visits he liked me to be with him but somehow mr gibson feels as if i should be rather in his way i dont think you could ride pillion behind him on black bess mamma said molly and unless you could do that you could hardly go with him in his rounds up and down all the rough lanes oh but he might keep a brougham ive often said so and then i could use it for visiting in the evenings really it was one reason why i didnt go to the hollingford charity ball i couldnt bring myself to use the dirty fly from the george we really must stir papa up against next winter molly it will never do for you and she pulled herself up suddenly and looked furtively at mr preston to see if he had taken any notice of her abruptness of course he had but he was not going to show it he turned to molly and said have you ever been to a public ball yet miss gibson no said molly it will be a great pleasure to you when the time comes im not sure i shall like it if i have plenty of partners but im afraid i shant know many people and you suppose that young men havent their own ways and means of being introduced to pretty girls it was exactly one of the speeches molly had disliked him for before and delivered too in that kind of underbred manner which showed that it was meant to convey a personal compliment molly took great credit to herself for the unconcerned manner with which she went on with her tatting exactly as if she had never heard it i only hope i may be one of your partners at the first ball you go to pray remember my early application for that honour when you are overwhelmed with requests for dances i dont choose to engage myself beforehand said molly perceiving from under her dropped eyelids that he was leaning forward and looking at her as though he was determined to have an answer young ladies are always very cautious in fact however modest they may be in profession he replied addressing himself in a nonchalant manner to mrs gibson in spite of miss gibsons apprehension of not having many partners she declines the certainty of having one i suppose miss kirkpatrick will have returned from france before then he said these last words exactly in the same tone as he had used before but mollys instinct told her that he was making an effort to do so she looked up he was playing with his hat almost as if he did not care to have any answer to his question yet he was listening acutely and with a half smile on his face mrs gibson reddened a little and hesitated yes certainly my daughter will be with us next winter i believe and i daresay she will go out with us why cant she say at once that cynthia is here now asked molly of herself yet glad that mr prestons curiosity was baffled he still smiled but this time he looked up at mrs gibson as he askedyou have good news from her i hope yes very by the way how are our old friends the robinsons how often i think of their kindness to me at ashcombe dear good people i wish i could see them again i will certainly tell them of your kind inquiries they are very well i believe just at this moment molly heard the familiar sound of the click and opening of the front door she knew it must be cynthia and conscious of some mysterious reason which made mrs gibson wish to conceal her daughters whereabouts from mr preston and maliciously desirous to baffle him she rose to leave the room and meet cynthia on the stairs but one of the lost crewels of worsted had entangled itself in her gown and feet and before she had freed herself of the encumbrance cynthia had opened the drawingroom door and stood in it looking at her mother at molly at mr preston but not advancing one step her colour which had been brilliant the first moment of her entrance faded away as she gazed but her eyesher beautiful eyesusually so soft and grave seemed to fill with fire and her brows to contract as she took the resolution to come forward and take her place among the three who were all looking at her with different emotions she moved calmly and slowly forwards mr preston went a step or two to meet her his hand held out and the whole expression of his face that of eager delight but she took no notice of the outstretched hand nor of the chair that he offered her she sate down on a little sofa in one of the windows and called molly to her look at my purchases said she this green ribbon was fourteenpence a yard this silk three shillings and so she went on forcing herself to speak about these trifles as if they were all the world to her and she had no attention to throw away on her mother and her mothers visitor mr preston took his cue from her he too talked of the news of the day the local gossipbut molly who glanced up at him from time to time was almost alarmed by the bad expression of suppressed anger almost amounting to vindictiveness which entirely marred his handsome looks she did not wish to look again and tried rather to back up cynthias efforts at maintaining a separate conversation yet she could not help overhearing mrs gibsons strain after increased civility as if to make up for cynthias rudeness and if possible to deprecate his anger she talked perpetually as though her object were to detain him whereas previous to cynthias return she had allowed frequent pauses in the conversation as though to give him the opportunity to take his leave in the course of the conversation between them the hamleys came up mrs gibson was never unwilling to dwell upon mollys intimacy with this county family and when the latter caught the sound of her own name her stepmother was saying poor mrs hamley could hardly do without molly she quite looked upon her as a daughter especially towards the last when i am afraid she had a good deal of anxiety mr osborne hamleyi daresay you have heardhe did not do so well at college and they had expected so muchparents will you know but what did it signify for he had not to earn his living i call it a very foolish kind of ambition when a young man has not to go into a profession well at any rate the squire must be satisfied now i saw this mornings times with the cambridge examination lists in it isnt the second son called after his father roger yes said molly starting up and coming nearer hes senior wrangler thats all said mr preston almost as though he were vexed with himself for having anything to say that could give her pleasure molly went back to her seat by cynthia poor mrs hamley said she very softly as if to herself cynthia took her hand in sympathy with mollys sad and tender look rather than because she understood all that was passing in her mind nor did she quite understand it herself a death that had come out of time a wonder whether the dead knew what passed upon the earth they had leftthe brilliant osbornes failure rogers success the vanity of human wishesall these thoughts and what they suggested were inextricably mingled up in her mind she came to herself in a few minutes mr preston was saying all the unpleasant things he could think of about the hamleys in a tone of false sympathy the poor old squirenot the wisest of menhas woefully mismanaged his estate and osborne hamley is too fine a gentleman to understand the means by which to improve the value of the landeven if he had the capital a man who had practical knowledge of agriculture and some thousands of ready money might bring the rental up to eight thousand or so of course osborne will try and marry some one with money the family is old and wellestablished and he mustnt object to commercial descent though i daresay the squire will for him but then the young fellow himself is not the man for the work no the familys going down fast and its a pity when these old saxon houses vanish off the land but it is kismet with the hamleys even the senior wranglerif it is that roger hamleyhe will have spent all his brains in one effort you never hear of a senior wrangler being worth anything afterwards hell be a fellow of his college of coursethat will be a livelihood for him at any rate i believe in senior wranglers said cynthia her clear high voice ringing through the room and from all ive ever heard of mr roger hamley i believe he will keep up the distinction he has earned and i dont believe that the house of hamley is so near extinction in wealth and fame and good name they are fortunate in having miss kirkpatricks good word said mr preston rising to take his leave dear molly said cynthia in a whisper i know nothing about your friends the hamleys except that they are your friends and what you have told me about them but i wont have that man speaking of them soand your eyes filling with tears all the time id sooner swear to their having all the talents and good fortune under the sun the only person of whom cynthia appeared to be wholesomely afraid was mr gibson when he was present she was more careful in speaking and showed more deference to her mother her evident respect for him and desire to win his good opinion made her curb herself before him and in this manner she earned his favour as a lively sensible girl with just so much knowledge of the world as made her a very desirable companion to molly indeed she made something of the same kind of impression on all men they were first struck with her personal appearance and then with her pretty deprecating manner which appealed to them much as if she had said you are wise and i am foolishhave mercy on my folly it was a way she had it meant nothing really and she was hardly conscious of it herself but it was very captivating all the same even old williams the gardener felt it he said to his confidante molly eh miss but that be a rare young lady she do have such pretty coaxing ways i be to teach her to bud roses come the seasonand ill warrant ye shell learn sharp enough for all she says she bees so stupid if molly had not had the sweetest disposition in the world she might have become jealous of all the allegiance laid at cynthias feet but she never thought of comparing the amount of admiration and love which they each received yet once she did feel a little as if cynthia were poaching on her manor the invitation to the quiet dinner had been sent to osborne hamley and declined by him but he thought it right to call soon afterwards it was the first time molly had seen any of the family since she left the hall just before mrs hamleys death and there was so much that she wanted to ask she tried to wait patiently till mrs gibson had exhausted the first gush of her infinite nothings and then molly came in with her modest questions how was the squire had he returned to his old habits had his health sufferedputting each inquiry with as light and delicate a touch as if she had been dressing a wound she hesitated a little a very little before speaking of roger for just one moment the thought flitted across her mind that osborne might feel the contrast between his own and his brothers college career too painfully to like to have it referred to but then she remembered the generous brotherly love that had always existed between the two and had just entered upon the subject when cynthia in obedience to her mothers summons came into the room and took up her work no one could have been quietershe hardly uttered a word but osborne seemed to fall under her power at once he no longer gave his undivided attention to molly he cut short his answers to her questions and byandby without mollys rightly understanding how it was he had turned towards cynthia and was addressing himself to her molly saw the look of content on mrs gibsons face perhaps it was her own mortification at not having heard all she wished to know about roger which gave her a keener insight than usual but certain it is that all at once she perceived that mrs gibson would not dislike a marriage between osborne and cynthia and considered the present occasion as an auspicious beginning remembering the secret which she had been let into so unwillingly molly watched his behaviour almost as if she had been retained in the interest of the absent wife but after all thinking as much of the possibility of his attracting cynthia as of the unknown and mysterious mrs osborne hamley his manner was expressive of great interest and of strong prepossession in favour of the beautiful girl to whom he was talking he was in deep mourning which showed off his slight figure and delicate refined face but there was nothing of flirting as far as molly understood the meaning of the word in either looks or words cynthia too was extremely quiet she was always much quieter with men than with women it was part of the charm of her soft allurement that she was so passive they were talking of france mrs gibson herself had passed two or three years of her girlhood there and cynthias late return from boulogne made it a very natural subject of conversation but molly was thrown out of it and with her heart still unsatisfied as to the details of rogers success she had to stand up at last and receive osbornes goodby scarcely longer or more intimate than his farewell to cynthia as soon as he was gone mrs gibson began in his praise well really i begin to have some faith in long descent what a gentleman he is how agreeable and polite so different from that forward mr preston she continued looking a little anxiously at cynthia cynthia quite aware that her reply was being watched for said coolly mr preston doesnt improve on acquaintance there was a time mamma when i think both you and i thought him very agreeable i dont remember youve a clearer memory than i have but we were talking of this delightful mr osborne hamley why molly you were always talking of his brotherit was roger this and roger thati cant think how it was you so seldom mentioned this young man i didnt know i had mentioned mr roger hamley so often said molly blushing a little but i saw much more of himhe was more at home well well its all right my dear i daresay he suits you best but really when i saw osborne hamley close to my cynthia i couldnt help thinkingbut perhaps id better not tell you what i was thinking of only they are each of them so much above the average in appearance and of course that suggests things i perfectly understand what you were thinking of mamma said cynthia with the greatest composure and so does molly i have no doubt well theres no harm in it im sure did you hear him say that though he did not like to leave his father alone just at present yet that when his brother roger came back from cambridge he should feel more at liberty it was quite as much as to say if you will ask me to dinner then i shall be delighted to come and chickens will be so much cheaper and cook has such a nice way of boning them and doing them up with forcemeat everything seems to be falling out so fortunately and molly my dear you know i wont forget you byandby when roger hamley has taken his turn at stopping at home with his father we will ask him to one of our little quiet dinners molly was very slow at taking this in but in about a minute the sense of it had reached her brain and she went all over very red and hot especially as she saw that cynthia was watching the light come into her mind with great amusement im afraid molly isnt properly grateful mamma if i were you i wouldnt exert myself to give a dinnerparty on her account bestow all your kindness upon me molly was often puzzled by cynthias speeches to her mother and this was one of these occasions but she was more anxious to say something for herself she was so much annoyed at the implication in mrs gibsons last words mr roger hamley has been very good to me he was a great deal at home when i was there and mr osborne hamley was very little there that was the reason i spoke so much more of one than the other if i hadif he hadlosing her coherence in the difficulty of finding wordsi dont think i shouldoh cynthia instead of laughing at me i think you might help me to explain myself instead cynthia gave a diversion to the conversation mammas paragon gives me an idea of weakness i cant quite make out whether its in body or mind which is it molly he is not strong i know but hes very accomplished and clever every one says thateven papa who doesnt generally praise young men that made the puzzle the greater when he did so badly at college then its his character that is weak im sure theres weakness somewhere but hes very agreeable it must have been very pleasant staying at the hall yes but its all over now oh nonsense said mrs gibson wakening up from counting the stitches in her pattern we shall have the young men coming to dinner pretty often youll see your father likes them and i shall always make a point of welcoming his friends they cant go on mourning for a mother for ever i expect we shall see a great deal of them and that the two families will become very intimate after all these good hollingford people are terribly behindhand and i should say rather commonplace chapter xxi the halfsisters illustration untitled it appeared as if mrs gibsons predictions were likely to be verified for osborne hamley found his way to her drawingroom pretty frequently to be sure sometimes prophets can help on the fulfilment of their own prophecies and mrs gibson was not passive molly was altogether puzzled by his manners and ways he spoke of occasional absences from the hall without exactly saying where he had been but that was not her idea of the conduct of a married man who she imagined ought to have a house and servants and pay rent and taxes and live with his wife who this mysterious wife might be faded into insignificance before the wonder of where she was london cambridge dover nay even france were mentioned by him as places to which he had been on these different little journeys these facts came out quite casually almost as if he was unaware of what he was betraying sometimes he dropped out such sentences as theseah that would be the day i was crossing it was stormy indeed instead of our being only two hours we were nearly five or i met lord hollingford at dover last week and he said c the cold now is nothing to what it was in london on thursdaythe thermometer was down at perhaps in the rapid flow of conversation these small revelations were noticed by no one but molly whose interest and curiosity were always hovering over the secret she had become possessed of in spite of all her selfreproach for allowing her thoughts to dwell on what was still to be kept as a mystery it was also evident to her that osborne was not too happy at home he had lost the slight touch of cynicism which he had affected when he was expected to do wonders at college and that was one good result of his failure if he did not give himself the trouble of appreciating other people and their performances at any rate his conversation was not so amply sprinkled with critical pepper he was more absent not so agreeable mrs gibson thought but did not say he looked ill in health but that might be the consequence of the real depression of spirits which molly occasionally saw peeping out through all his pleasant surfacetalk now and then when he was talking directly to her he referred to the happy days that are gone or to the time when my mother was alive and then his voice sank and a gloom came over his countenance and molly longed to express her own deep sympathy he did not often mention his father and molly thought she could read in his manner when he did that something of the painful restraint she had noticed when she was last at the hall still existed between them nearly every particular she knew of the family interior she had heard from mrs hamley and she was uncertain how far her father was acquainted with them so she did not like to question him too closely nor was he a man to be so questioned as to the domestic affairs of his patients sometimes she wondered if it was a dreamthat short halfhour in the library at hamley hallwhen she had learnt a fact which seemed so allimportant to osborne yet which made so little difference in his way of lifeeither in speech or action during the twelve or fourteen hours that she had remained at the hall afterwards no further allusion had been made to his marriage either by himself or by roger it was indeed very like a dream probably molly would have been rendered much more uncomfortable in the possession of her secret if osborne had struck her as particularly attentive in his devotion to cynthia she evidently amused and attracted him but not in any lively or passionate kind of way he admired her beauty and seemed to feel her charm but he would leave her side and come to sit near molly if anything reminded him of his mother about which he could talk to her and to her alone yet he came so often to the gibsons that mrs gibson might be excused for the fancy she had taken into her head that it was for cynthias sake he liked the lounge the friendliness the company of two intelligent girls of beauty and manners above the average one of whom stood in a peculiar relation to him as having been especially beloved by the mother whose memory he cherished so fondly knowing himself to be out of the category of bachelors he was perhaps too indifferent as to other peoples ignorance and its possible consequences somehow molly did not like to be the first to introduce rogers name into the conversation so she lost many an opportunity of hearing intelligence about him osborne was often so languid or so absent that he only followed the lead of talk and as an awkward fellow who had paid her no particular attention and as a second son roger was not preeminent in mrs gibsons thoughts cynthia had never seen him and the freak did not take her often to speak about him he had not come home since he had obtained his high place in the mathematical lists that molly knew and she knew too that he was working hard for somethingshe supposed a fellowshipand that was all osbornes tone in speaking of him was always the same every word every inflection of the voice breathed out affection and respectnay even admiration and this from the nil admirari brother who seldom carried his exertions so far ah roger he said one day molly caught the name in an instant though she had not heard what had gone before he is a fellow in a thousandin a thousand indeed i dont believe there is his match anywhere for goodness and real solid power combined molly said cynthia after mr osborne hamley had gone what sort of a man is this roger hamley one cant tell how much to believe of his brothers praises for it is the one subject on which osborne hamley becomes enthusiastic ive noticed it once or twice before while molly hesitated on which point of the large round to begin her description mrs gibson struck in it just shows what a sweet disposition osborne hamley is ofthat he should praise his brother as he does i daresay he is a senior wrangler and much good may it do him i dont deny that but as for conversation hes as heavy as heavy can be a great awkward fellow to boot who looks as if he did not know two and two made four for all he is such a mathematical genius you would hardly believe he was osborne hamleys brother to see him i should not think he has a profile at all what do you think of him molly said the persevering cynthia i like him said molly he has been very kind to me i know he isnt handsome like osborne it was rather difficult to say all this quietly but molly managed to do it quite aware that cynthia would not rest till she had extracted some kind of an opinion out of her i suppose he will come home at easter said cynthia and then i shall see him for myself its a great pity that their being in mourning will prevent their going to the easter charity ball said mrs gibson plaintively i shant like to take you two girls if you are not to have any partners it will put me in such an awkward position i wish we could join on to the towers party that would secure you partners for they always bring a number of dancing men who might dance with you after they had done their duty by the ladies of the house but really everything is so changed since dear lady cumnor has been an invalid that perhaps they wont go at all this easter ball was a great subject of conversation with mrs gibson she sometimes spoke of it as her first appearance in society as a bride though she had been visiting once or twice a week all winter long then she shifted her ground and said she felt so much interest in it because she would then have the responsibility of introducing both her own and mr gibsons daughter to public notice though the fact was that pretty nearly every one who was going to this ball had seen the two young ladiesthough not their ball dressesbefore but aping the manners of the aristocracy as far as she knew them she intended to bring out molly and cynthia on this occasion which she regarded in something of the light of a presentation at court they are not out yet was her favourite excuse when either of them was invited to any house to which she did not wish them to go or they were invited without her she even made a difficulty about their not being out when miss browningthat old friend of the gibson familycame in one morning to ask the two girls to come to a friendly tea and a round game afterwards this mild piece of gaiety being designed as an attention to three of mrs goodenoughs grandchildrentwo young ladies and their schoolboy brotherwho were staying on a visit to their grandmamma you are very kind miss browning but you see i hardly like to let them gothey are not out you know till after the easter ball till when we are invisible said cynthia always ready with her mockery to exaggerate any pretension of her mothers we are so high in rank that our sovereign must give us her sanction before we can play a round game at your house cynthia enjoyed the idea of her own fullgrown size and stately gait as contrasted with that of a meek halffledged girl in the nursery but miss browning was half puzzled and half affronted i dont understand it at all in my days girls went wherever it pleased people to ask them without this farce of bursting out in all their new fine clothes at some public place i dont mean but what the gentry took their daughters to york or matlock or bath to give them a taste of gay society when they were growing up and the quality went up to london and their young ladies were presented to queen charlotte and went to a birthday ball perhaps but for us little hollingford peoplewhy we knew every child amongst us from the day of its birth and many a girl of twelve or fourteen have i seen go out to a cardparty and sit quiet at her work and know how to behave as well as any lady there there was no talk of coming out in those days for any one under the daughter of a squire after easter molly and i shall know how to behave at a cardparty but not before said cynthia demurely youre always fond of your quips and your cranks my dear said miss browning and i wouldnt quite answer for your behaviour you sometimes let your spirits carry you away but im quite sure molly will be a little lady as she always is and always was and i have known her from a babe mrs gibson took up arms on behalf of her own daughter or rather she took up arms against mollys praises i dont think you would have called molly a lady the other day miss browning if you had found her where i did sitting up in a cherrytree six feet from the ground at least i do assure you oh but that wasnt pretty said miss browning shaking her head at molly i thought youd left off those tomboy ways she wants the refinement which good society gives in several ways said mrs gibson returning to the attack on poor molly shes very apt to come upstairs two steps at a time only two molly said cynthia why today i found i could manage four of these broad shallow steps my dear child what are you saying only confessing that i like molly want the refinements which good society gives therefore please do let us go to miss brownings this evening i will pledge myself for molly that she shant sit in a cherrytree and molly shall see that i dont go upstairs in an unladylike way i will go upstairs as meekly as if i were a comeout young lady and had been to the easter ball so it was agreed that they should go if mr osborne hamley had been named as one of the probable visitors there would have been none of this difficulty about the affair but though he was not there his brother roger was molly saw him in a minute when she entered the little drawingroom but cynthia did not and see my dears said miss phoebe browning turning them round to the side where roger stood waiting for his turn of speaking to molly weve got a gentleman for you after all wasnt it fortunatejust as sister said that you might find it dullyou cynthia she meant because you know you come from francethen just as if he had been sent from heaven mr roger came in to call and i wont say we laid violent hands on him because he was too good for that but really we should have been near it if he had not stayed of his own accord the moment roger had done his cordial greeting to molly he asked her to introduce him to cynthia illustration roger is introduced and enslaved i want to know heryour new sister he added with the kind smile molly remembered so well since the very first day she had seen it directed towards her as she sate crying under the weeping ash cynthia was standing a little behind molly when roger asked for this introduction she was generally dressed with careless grace molly who was delicate neatness itself used sometimes to wonder how cynthias tumbled gowns tossed away so untidily had the art of looking so well and falling in such graceful folds for instance the pale lilac muslin gown she wore this evening had been worn many times before and had looked unfit to wear again till cynthia put it on then the limpness became softness and the very creases took the lines of beauty molly in a daintily clean pink muslin did not look half so elegantly dressed as cynthia the grave eyes that the latter raised when she had to be presented to roger had a sort of childlike innocence and wonder about them which did not quite belong to cynthias character she put on her armour of magic that eveninginvoluntarily as she always did but on the other side she could not help trying her power on strangers molly had always felt that she should have a right to a good long talk with roger when she next saw him and that he would tell her or she should gather from him all the details she so longed to hear about the squireabout the hallabout osborneabout himself he was just as cordial and friendly as ever with her if cynthia had not been there all would have gone on as she had anticipated but of all the victims to cynthias charms he fell most prone and abject molly saw it all as she was sitting next to miss phoebe at the teatable acting righthand and passing cake cream sugar with such busy assiduity that every one besides herself thought that her mind as well as her hands was fully occupied she tried to talk to the two shy girls as in virtue of her two years seniority she thought herself bound to do and the consequence was she went upstairs with the twain clinging to her arms and willing to swear an eternal friendship nothing would satisfy them but that she must sit between them at vingtun and they were so desirous of her advice in the important point of fixing the price of the counters that she could not ever have joined in the animated conversation going on between roger and cynthia or rather it would be more correct to say that roger was talking in a most animated manner to cynthia whose sweet eyes were fixed upon his face with a look of great interest in all he was saying while it was only now and then she made her low replies molly caught a few words occasionally in intervals of business at my uncles we always give a silver threepence for three dozen you know what a silver threepence is dont you dear miss gibson the three classes are published in the senate house at nine oclock on the friday morning and you cant imagine i think it will be thought rather shabby to play at anything less than sixpence that gentleman this in a whisper is at cambridge and you know they always play very high there and sometimes ruin themselves dont they dear miss gibson oh on this occasion the master of arts who precedes the candidates for honours when they go into the senate house is called the father of the college to which he belongs i think i mentioned that before didnt i so cynthia was hearing all about cambridge and the very examination about which molly had felt such keen interest without having ever been able to have her questions answered by a competent person and roger to whom she had always looked as the final and most satisfactory answerer was telling the whole of what she wanted to know and she could not listen it took all her patience to make up little packets of counters and settle as the arbiter of the game whether it would be better for the round or the oblong counters to be reckoned as six and when all was done and every one sate in their places round the table roger and cynthia had to be called twice before they came they stood up it is true at the first sound of their names but they did not moveroger went on talking cynthia listening till the second call when they hurried to the table and tried to appear all on a sudden quite interested in the great questions of the gamenamely the price of three dozen counters and whether all things considered it would be better to call the round counters or the oblong halfadozen each miss browning drumming the pack of cards on the table and quite ready to begin dealing decided the matter by saying rounds are sixes and three dozen counters cost sixpence pay up if you please and let us begin at once cynthia sate between roger and william orford the young schoolboy who bitterly resented on this occasion his sisters habit of calling him willie as he thought it was this boyish sobriquet which prevented cynthia from attending as much to him as to mr roger hamley he also was charmed by the charmer who found leisure to give him one or two of her sweet smiles on his return home to his grandmammas he gave out one or two very decided and rather original opinions quite opposedas was naturalto his sisters one was that after all a senior wrangler was no great shakes any man might be one if he liked but there were a lot of fellows that he knew who would be very sorry to go in for anything so slow molly thought the game never would end she had no particular turn for gambling in her and whatever her card might be she regularly put on two counters indifferent as to whether she won or lost cynthia on the contrary staked high and was at one time very rich but ended by being in debt to molly something like six shillings she had forgotten her purse she said and was obliged to borrow from the more provident molly who was aware that the round game of which miss browning had spoken to her was likely to require money if it was not a very merry affair for all the individuals concerned it was a very noisy one on the whole molly thought it was going to last till midnight but punctually as the clock struck nine the little maidservant staggered in under the weight of a tray loaded with sandwiches cakes and jelly this brought on a general move and roger who appeared to have been on the watch for something of the kind came and took a chair by molly i am so glad to see you againit seems such a long time since christmas said he dropping his voice and not alluding more exactly to the day when she had left the hall it is a long time she replied we are close to easter now i have so wanted to tell you how glad i was to hear about your honours at cambridge i once thought of sending you a message through your brother but then i thought it might be making too much fuss because i know nothing of mathematics or of the value of a senior wranglership and you were sure to have so many congratulations from people who did know i missed yours though molly said he kindly but i felt sure you were glad for me glad and proud too said she i should so like to hear something more about it i heard you telling cynthia yes what a charming person she is i should think you must be happier than we expected long ago but tell me something about the senior wranglership please said molly its a long story and i ought to be helping the miss brownings to hand sandwichesbesides you wouldnt find it very interesting its so full of technical details cynthia looked very much interested said molly well then i refer you to her for i must go now i cant for shame go on sitting here and letting those good ladies have all the trouble but i shall come and call on mrs gibson soon are you walking home tonight yes i think so replied molly eagerly foreseeing what was to come then i shall walk home with you i left my horse at the george and thats halfway i suppose old betty will allow me to accompany you and your sister you used to describe her as something of a dragon betty has left us said molly sadly shes gone to live at a place at ashcombe he made a face of dismay and then went off to his duties the short conversation had been very pleasant and his manner had had just the brotherly kindness of old times but it was not quite the manner he had to cynthia and molly half thought she would have preferred the latter he was now hovering about cynthia who had declined the offer of refreshments from willie orford roger was tempting her and with playful entreaties urging her to take some thing from him every word they said could be heard by the whole room yet every word was said on rogers part at least as if he could not have spoken it in that peculiar manner to any one else at length and rather more because she was weary of being entreated than because it was his wish cynthia took a macaroon and roger seemed as happy as though she had crowned him with flowers the whole affair was as trifling and commonplace as could be in itself hardly worth noticing and yet molly did notice it and felt uneasy she could not tell why as it turned out it was a rainy night and mrs gibson sent a fly for the two girls instead of old bettys substitute both cynthia and molly thought of the possibility of their taking the two orford girls back to their grandmothers and so saving them a wet walk but cynthia got the start in speaking about it and the thanks and the implied praise for thoughtfulness were hers when they got home mr and mrs gibson were sitting in the drawingroom quite ready to be amused by any details of the evening cynthia began oh it wasnt very entertaining one didnt expect that and she yawned wearily who were there asked mr gibson quite a young partywasnt it theyd only asked lizzie and fanny orford and their brother but mr roger hamley had ridden over and called on miss brownings and they kept him to tea no one else roger hamley there said mr gibson hes come home then i must make time to ride over and see him youd much better ask him here said mrs gibson suppose you invite him and his brother to dine here on friday my dear it would be a very pretty attention i think my dear these young cambridge men have a very good taste in wine and dont spare it my cellar wont stand many of their attacks i didnt think you were so inhospitable mr gibson im not inhospitable im sure if youll put bitter beer in the corner of your notes of invitation just as the smart people put quadrilles as a sign of the entertainment offered well have osborne and roger to dinner any day you like and what did you think of my favourite cynthia you hadnt seen him before i think oh hes nothing like so handsome as his brother nor so polished nor so easy to talk to he entertained me for more than an hour with a long account of some examination or other but theres something one likes about him welland molly said mrs gibson who piqued herself on being an impartial stepmother and who always tried hard to make molly talk as much as cynthiawhat sort of an evening have you had very pleasant thank you her heart a little belied her as she said this she had not cared for the round game and she would have cared for rogers conversation she had had what she was indifferent to and not had what she would have liked weve had our unexpected visitor too said mr gibson just after dinner who should come in but mr preston i fancy hes having more of the management of the hollingford property than formerly sheepshanks is getting an old man and if so i suspect we shall see a good deal of preston hes no blate as they used to say in scotland and made himself quite at home tonight if id asked him to stay or indeed if id done anything but yawn hed have been here now but i defy any man to stay when ive a fit of yawning do you like mr preston papa asked molly about as much as i do half the men i meet he talks well and has seen a good deal i know very little of him though except that hes my lords steward which is a guarantee for a good deal lady harriet spoke pretty strongly against him that day i was with her at the manorhouse lady harriets always full of fancies she likes persons today and dislikes them tomorrow said mrs gibson who was touched on her sore point whenever molly quoted lady harriet or said anything to imply ever so transitory an intimacy with her you must know a good deal about mr preston my dear i suppose you saw a good deal of him at ashcombe mrs gibson coloured and looked at cynthia before she replied cynthias face was set into a determination not to speak however much she might be referred to yes we saw a good deal of himat one time i mean hes changeable i think but he always sent us game and sometimes fruit there were some stories against him but i never believed them what kind of stories said mr gibson quickly oh vague stories you know scandal i daresay no one ever believed them he could be so agreeable if he chose and my lord who is so very particular would never have kept him as agent if they were true not that i ever knew what they were for i consider all scandal as abominable gossip im very glad i yawned in his face said mr gibson i hope hell take the hint if it was one of your giantgapes papa i should call it more than a hint said molly and if you want a yawning chorus the next time he comes ill join in wont you cynthia i dont know replied the latter shortly as she lighted her bedcandle the two girls had usually some nightly conversation in one or other of their bedrooms but tonight cynthia said something or other about being terribly tired and hastily shut her door the very next day roger came to pay his promised call molly was out in the garden with williams planning the arrangement of some new flowerbeds and deep in her employment of placing pegs upon the lawn to mark out the different situations when standing up to mark the effect her eye was caught by the figure of a gentleman sitting with his back to the light leaning forwards and talking or listening eagerly molly knew the shape of the head perfectly and hastily began to put off her brownholland gardening apron emptying the pockets as she spoke to williams you can finish it now i think said she you know about the brightcoloured flowers being against the privethedge and where the new rosebed is to be i cant justly say as i do said he mebbe youll just go oer it all once again miss molly im not so young as i oncst was and my head is not so clear nowadays and id be loath to make mistakes when youre so set upon your plans molly gave up her impulse in a moment she saw that the old gardener was really perplexed yet that he was as anxious as he could be to do his best so she went over the ground again pegging and explaining till the wrinkled brow was smooth again and he kept saying i see miss all right miss molly ise gotten it in my head as clear as patchwork now so she could leave him and go in but just as she was close to the garden door roger came out it really was for once a case of virtue its own reward for it was far pleasanter to her to have him in a ttette however short than in the restraint of mrs gibsons and cynthias presence i only just found out where you were molly mrs gibson said you had gone out but she didnt know where and it was the greatest chance that i turned round and saw you i saw you some time ago but i couldnt leave williams i think he was unusually slow today and he seemed as if he couldnt understand my plans for the new flowerbeds is that the paper youve got in your hand let me look at it will you ah i see youve borrowed some of your ideas from our garden at home havent you this bed of scarlet geraniums with the border of young oaks pegged down that was a fancy of my dear mothers they were both silent for a minute or two then molly said how is the squire ive never seen him since no he told me how much he wanted to see you but he couldnt make up his mind to come and call i suppose it would never do now for you to come and stay at the hall would it it would give my father so much pleasure he looks upon you as a daughter and im sure both osborne and i shall always consider you are like a sister to us after all my mothers love for you and your tender care of her at last but i suppose it wouldnt do no certainly not said molly hastily i fancy if you could come it would put us a little to rights you know as i think i once told you osborne has behaved differently to what i should have done though not wronglyonly what i call an error of judgment but my father im sure has taken up some notion ofnever mind only the end of it is that he holds osborne still in tacit disgrace and is miserable himself all the time osborne too is sore and unhappy and estranged from my father it is just what my mother would have put right very soon and perhaps you could have done itunconsciously i meanfor this wretched mystery that osborne preserves about his affairs is at the root of it all but theres no use talking about it i dont know why i began then with a wrench changing the subject while molly still thought of what he had been telling her he broke outi cant tell you how much i like miss kirkpatrick molly it must be a great pleasure to you having such a companion yes said molly half smiling im very fond of her and i think i like her better every day i know her but how quickly you have found out her virtues i didnt say virtues did i asked he reddening but putting the question in all good faith yet i dont think one could be deceived in that face and mrs gibson appears to be a very friendly personshe has asked osborne and me to dine here on friday bitter beer came into mollys mind but what she said was and are you coming certainly i am unless my father wants me and ive given mrs gibson a conditional promise for osborne too so i shall see you all very soon again but i must go now i have to keep an appointment seven miles from here in halfanhours time good luck to your flowergarden molly chapter xxii the old squires troubles affairs were going on worse at the hall than roger had liked to tell moreover very much of the discomfort there arose from mere manner as people express it which is always indescribable and indefinable quiet and passive as mrs hamley had always been in appearance she was the ruling spirit of the house as long as she lived the directions to the servants down to the most minute particulars came from her sittingroom or from the sofa on which she lay her children always knew where to find her and to find her was to find love and sympathy her husband who was often restless and angry from one cause or another always came to her to be smoothed down and put right he was conscious of her pleasant influence over him and became at peace with himself when in her presence just as a child is at ease when with some one who is both firm and gentle but the keystone of the family arch was gone and the stones of which it was composed began to fall apart it is always sad when a sorrow of this kind seems to injure the character of the mourning survivors yet perhaps this injury may be only temporary or superficial the judgments so constantly passed upon the way in which people bear the loss of those whom they have deeply loved appear to be even more cruel and wrongly meted out than human judgments generally are to careless observers for instance it would seem as though the squire was rendered more capricious and exacting more passionate and authoritative by his wifes death the truth was that it occurred at a time when many things came to harass him and some to bitterly disappoint him and she was no longer there to whom he used to carry his sore heart for the gentle balm of her sweet words so the sore heart ached and smarted intensely and often when he saw how his violent conduct affected others he could have cried out for their pity instead of their anger and resentment have mercy upon me for i am very miserable how often have such dumb thoughts gone up from the hearts of those who have taken hold of their sorrow by the wrong end as prayers against sin and when the squire saw that his servants were learning to dread him and his firstborn to avoid him he did not blame them he knew he was becoming a domestic tyrant it seemed as if all circumstances conspired against him and as if he was too weak to struggle with them else why did everything in doors and out of doors go so wrong just now when all he could have done had things been prosperous was to have submitted in very imperfect patience to the loss of his wife but just when he needed ready money to pacify osbornes creditors the harvest had turned out remarkably plentiful and the price of corn had sunk down to a level it had not touched for years the squire had insured his life at the time of his marriage for a pretty large sum it was to be a provision for his wife if she survived him and for their younger children roger was the only representative of these interests now but the squire was unwilling to lose the insurance by ceasing to pay the annual sum he would not if he could have sold any part of the estate which he inherited from his father and besides it was strictly entailed he had sometimes thought how wise a step it would have been could he have sold a portion of it and with the purchasemoney have drained and reclaimed the remainder and at length learning from some neighbour that government would make certain advances for drainage c at a very low rate of interest on condition that the work was done and the money repaid within a given time his wife had urged him to take advantage of the proffered loan but now that she was no longer there to encourage him and take an interest in the progress of the work he grew indifferent to it himself and cared no more to go out on his stout roan cob and sit square on his seat watching the labourers on the marshy land all overgrown with rushes speaking to them from time to time in their own strong nervous country dialect but the interest to government had to be paid all the same whether the men worked well or ill then the roof of the hall let in the melted snowwater this winter and on examination it turned out that a new roof was absolutely required the men who had come about the advances made to osborne by the london moneylender had spoken disparagingly of the timber on the estatevery fine treessound perhaps too fifty years ago but gone to rot now had wanted lopping and clearing was there no woodranger or forester they were nothing like the value young mr hamley had represented them to be the remarks had come round to the squires ears he loved the trees he had played under as a boy as if they were living creatures that was on the romantic side of his nature merely looking at them as representing so many pounds sterling he had esteemed them highly and had had until now no opinion of another by which to correct his own judgment so these words of the valuers cut him sharp although he affected to disbelieve them and tried to persuade himself that he did so but after all these cares and disappointments did not touch the root of his deep resentment against osborne there is nothing like wounded affection for giving poignancy to anger and the squire believed that osborne and his advisers had been making calculations based upon his own death he hated the idea so muchit made him so miserablethat he would not face it and define it and meet it with full inquiry and investigation he chose rather to cherish the morbid fancy that he was useless in this worldborn under an unlucky starthat all things went badly under his management but he did not become humble in consequence he put his misfortunes down to the score of fatenot to his own and he imagined that osborne saw his failures and that his firstborn grudged him his natural term of life all these fancies would have been set to rights could he have talked them over with his wife or even had he been accustomed to mingle much in the society of those whom he esteemed his equals but as has been stated he was inferior in education to those who should have been his mates and perhaps the jealousy and mauvaise honte that this inferiority had called out long ago extended itself in some measure to the feelings he entertained towards his sonsless to roger than to osborne though the former was turning out by far the most distinguished man but roger was practical interested in all outofdoors things and he enjoyed the details homely enough which his father sometimes gave him of the everyday occurrences which the latter had noticed in the woods and the fields osborne on the contrary was what is commonly called fine delicate almost to effeminacy in dress and in manner careful in small observances all this his father had been rather proud of in the days when he looked forward to a brilliant career at cambridge for his son he had at that time regarded osbornes fastidiousness and elegance as another steppingstone to the high and prosperous marriage which was to restore the ancient fortunes of the hamley family but now that osborne had barely obtained his degree that all the boastings of his father had proved vain that the fastidiousness had led to unexpected expenses to attribute the most innocent cause to osbornes debts the poor young mans ways and manners became a subject of irritation to his father osborne was still occupied with his books and his writings when he was at home and this mode of passing the greater part of the day gave him but few subjects in common with his father when they did meet at meal times or in the evenings perhaps if osborne had been able to have more outofdoor amusements it would have been better but he was shortsighted and cared little for the carefully observant pursuits of his brother he knew but few young men of his own standing in the county his hunting even of which he was passionately fond had been curtailed this season as his father had disposed of one of the two hunters he had been hitherto allowed the whole stable establishment had been reduced perhaps because it was the economy which told most on the enjoyment of both the squire and osborne and which therefore the former took a savage pleasure in enforcing the old carriagea heavy family coach bought in the days of comparative prosperitywas no longer needed after madams death and fell to pieces in the cobwebbed seclusion of the coachhouse the best of the two carriagehorses was taken for a gig which the squire now set up saying many a time to all who might care to listen to him that it was the first time for generations that the hamleys of hamley had not been able to keep their own coach the other carriagehorse was turned out to grass being too old for regular work conqueror used to come whinnying up to the park palings whenever he saw the squire who had always a piece of bread or some sugar or an apple for the old favourite and would make many a complaining speech to the dumb animal telling him of the change of times since both were in their prime it had never been the squires custom to encourage his boys to invite their friends to the hall perhaps this too was owing to his mauvaise honte and also to an exaggerated consciousness of the deficiencies of his establishment as compared with what he imagined these lads were accustomed to at home he explained this once or twice to osborne and roger when they were at rugby you see all you public schoolboys have a kind of freemasonry of your own and outsiders are looked on by you much as i look on rabbits and all that isnt game ay you may laugh but it is so and your friends will throw their eyes askance at me and never think on my pedigree which would beat theirs all to shivers ill be bound no ill have no one here at the hall who will look down on a hamley of hamley even if he only knows how to make a cross instead of write his name then of course they must not visit at houses to whose sons the squire could not or would not return a like hospitality on all these points mrs hamley had used her utmost influence without avail his prejudices were immoveable as regarded his position as head of the oldest family in three counties his pride was invincible as regarded himself personallyill at ease in the society of his equals deficient in manners and in educationhis morbid sensitiveness was too sore and too selfconscious to be called humility take one instance from among many similar scenes of the state of feeling between him and his eldest son which if it could not be called active discord showed at least passive estrangement it took place on an evening in the march succeeding mrs hamleys death roger was at cambridge osborne had also been from home and he had not volunteered any information as to his absence the squire believed that osborne had been either at cambridge with his brother or in london he would have liked to hear where his son had been what he had been doing and whom he had seen purely as pieces of news and as some diversion from the domestic worries and cares which were pressing him hard but he was too proud to ask any questions and osborne had not given him any details of his journey this silence had aggravated the squires internal dissatisfaction and he came home to dinner weary and sorehearted a day or two after osbornes return it was just six oclock and he went hastily into his own little businessroom on the groundfloor and after washing his hands came into the drawingroom feeling as if he were very late but the room was empty he glanced at the clock over the mantelpiece as he tried to warm his hands at the fire the fire had been neglected and had gone out during the day it was now piled up with halfdried wood which sputtered and smoked instead of doing its duty in blazing and warming the room through which the keen wind was cutting its way in all directions the clock had stopped no one had remembered to wind it up but by the squires watch it was already past dinnertime the old butler put his head into the room but seeing the squire alone he was about to draw it back and wait for mr osborne before announcing dinner he had hoped to do this unperceived but the squire caught him in the act why isnt dinner ready he called out sharply its ten minutes past six and pray why are you using this wood its impossible to get oneself warm by such a fire as this i believe sir that thomas dont talk to me of thomas send dinner in directly about five minutes elapsed spent by the hungry squire in all sorts of impatient waysattacking thomas who came in to look after the fire knocking the logs about scattering out sparks but considerably lessening the chances of warmth touching up the candles which appeared to him to give a light unusually insufficient for the large cold room while he was doing this osborne came in dressed in full evening dress he always moved slowly and this to begin with irritated the squire then an uncomfortable consciousness of a black coat drab trousers checked cotton cravat and splashed boots forced itself upon him as he saw osbornes pointdevice costume he chose to consider it affectation and finery in osborne and was on the point of bursting out with some remark when the butler who had watched osborne downstairs before making the announcement came in to say dinner was ready it surely isnt six oclock said osborne pulling out his dainty little watch he was scarcely more unaware than it of the storm that was brewing six oclock its more than a quarter past growled out his father i fancy your watch must be wrong sir i set mine by the horse guards only two days ago now impugning that old steady turnipshaped watch of the squires was one of the insults which as it could not reasonably be resented was not to be forgiven that watch had been given him by his father when watches were watches long ago it had given the law to houseclocks stableclocks kitchenclocksnay even to hamley church clock in its day and was it now in its respectable old age to be looked down upon by a little whippersnapper of a french watch which could go into a mans waistcoat pocket instead of having to be extricated with due effort like a respectable watch of size and position from a fob in the waistband no not if the whippersnapper were backed by all the horse guards that ever were with the life guards to boot poor osborne might have known better than to cast this slur on his fathers flesh and blood for so dear did he hold his watch my watch is like myself said the squire girning as the scotch sayplain but steadygoing at any rate it gives the law in my house the king may go by the horse guards if he likes i beg your pardon sir said osborne really anxious to keep the peace i went by my watch which is certainly right by london time and id no idea you were waiting for me otherwise i could have dressed much quicker i should think so said the squire looking sarcastically at his sons attire when i was a young man i should have been ashamed to have spent as much time at my lookingglass as if id been a girl i could make myself as smart as any one when i was going to a dance or to a party where i was likely to meet pretty girls but i should have laughed myself to scorn if id stood fiddlefaddling at a glass smirking at my own likeness all for my own pleasure osborne reddened and was on the point of letting fly some caustic remark on his fathers dress at the present moment but he contented himself with saying in a low voice my mother always expected us all to dress for dinner i got into the habit of doing it to please her and i keep it up now indeed he had a certain kind of feeling of loyalty to her memory in keeping up all the little domestic habits and customs she had instituted or preferred but the contrast which the squire thought was implied by osbornes remark put him beside himself and i too try to attend to her wishes i do and in more important things i did when she was alive and i do so now i never said you did not said osborne astonished at his fathers passionate words and manner yes you did sir you meant it i could see by your looks i saw you look at my morning coat at any rate i never neglected any wish of hers in her lifetime if shed wished me to go to school again and learn my a b c i would by i would and i wouldnt have gone playing me and lounging away my time for fear of vexing and disappointing her yet some folks older than schoolboys the squire choked here but though the words would not come his passion did not diminish ill not have you casting up your mothers wishes to me sir you who went near to break her heart at last osborne was strongly tempted to get up and leave the room perhaps it would have been better if he had it might then have brought about an explanation and a reconciliation between father and son but he thought he did well in sitting still and appearing to take no notice this indifference to what he was saying appeared to annoy the squire still more and he kept on grumbling and talking to himself till osborne unable to bear it any longer said very quietly but very bitterly i am only a cause of irritation to you and home is no longer home to me but a place in which i am to be controlled in trifles and scolded about trifles as if i were a child put me in a way of making a living for myselfthat much your oldest son has a right to ask of youi will then leave this house and you shall be no longer vexed by my dress or my want of punctuality you make your request pretty much as another son did long ago give me the portion that falleth to me but i dont think what he did with his money is much encouragement for me to then the thought of how little he could give his son his portion or any part of it stopped the squire osborne took up the speech im as ready as any man to earn my living only the preparation for any profession will cost money and money i havent got no more have i said the squire shortly what is to be done then said osborne only half believing his fathers words why you must learn to stop at home and not take expensive journeys and you must reduce your tailors bill i dont ask you to help me in the management of the landyoure far too fine a gentleman for that but if you cant earn money at least you neednt spend it ive told you im willing enough to earn money cried osborne passionately at last but how am i to do it you really are very unreasonable sir am i said the squirecooling in manner though not in temper as osborne grew warm but i dont set up for being reasonable men who have to pay away money that they havent got for their extravagant sons arent likely to be reasonable theres two things youve gone and done which put me beside myself when i think of them youve turned out next door to a dunce at college when your poor mother thought so much of youand when you might have pleased and gratified her so if you choseand well i wont say what the other thing is tell me sir said osborne almost breathless with the idea that his father had discovered his secret marriage but the father was thinking of the moneylenders who were calculating how soon osborne would come into the estate no said the squire i know what i know and im not going to tell you how i know it only ill just say thisyour friends no more know a piece of good timber when they see it than you or i know how you could earn five pounds if it was to keep you from starving now theres rogerwe none of us made an ado about him but hell have his fellowship now ill warrant him and be a bishop or a chancellor or something before weve found out hes cleverweve been so much taken up thinking about you i dont know whats come over me to speak of wewe in this way said he suddenly dropping his voicea change of tone as sad as sad could be i ought to say i it will be i for evermore in this world he got up and left the room in quick haste knocking over his chair and not stopping to pick it up osborne who was sitting and shading his eyes with his hand as he had been doing for some time looked up at the noise and then rose as quickly and hurried after his father only in time to hear the studydoor locked on the inside the moment he reached it osborne returned into the diningroom chagrined and sorrowful but he was always sensitive to any omission of the usual observances which might excite remark and even with his heavy heart he was careful to pick up the fallen chair and restore it to its place near the bottom of the table and afterwards so to disturb the dishes as to make it appear that they had been touched before ringing for robinson when the latter came in followed by thomas osborne thought it necessary to say to him that his father was not well and had gone into the study and that he himself wanted no dessert but would have a cup of coffee in the drawingroom the old butler sent thomas out of the room and came up confidentially to osborne i thought master wasnt justly himself mr osborne before dinner and therefore i made excuses for himi did he spoke to thomas about the fire sir which is a thing i could in nowise put up with unless by reason of sickness which i am always ready to make allowances for why shouldnt my father speak to thomas said osborne but perhaps he spoke angrily i daresay for im sure hes not well no mr osborne it wasnt that i myself am given to anger and im blessed with as good health as any man in my years besides angers a good thing for thomas he needs a deal of it but it should come from the right quarterand that is me myself mr osborne i know my place and i know my rights and duties as well as any butler that lives and its my duty to scold thomas and not masters master ought to have said robinson you must speak to thomas about letting out the fire and id ha given it him wellas i shall do now for that matter but as i said before i make excuses for master as being in mental distress and bodily illhealth so ive brought myself round not to give warning as i should ha done for certain under happier circumstances really robinson i think its all great nonsense said osborne weary of the long story the butler had told him and to which he had not half attended what in the world does it signify whether my father speaks to you or to thomas bring me coffee in the drawingroom and dont trouble your head any more about scolding thomas robinson went away offended at his grievance being called nonsense he kept muttering to himself in the intervals of scolding thomas and sayingthings is a deal changed since poor missis went i dont wonder master feels it for im sure i do she was a lady who had always a becoming respect for a butlers position and could have understood how he might be hurt in his mind shed never ha called his delicacies of feelings nonsensenot she no more would mr roger hes a merry young gentleman and over fond of bringing dirty slimy creatures into the house but hes always a kind word for a man who is hurt in his mind hed cheer up the squire and keep him from getting so cross and wilful i wish mr roger was here i do the poor squire shut up with his grief and his illtemper as well in the dingy dreary study where he daily spent more and more of his indoors life turned over his cares and troubles till he was as bewildered with the process as a squirrel must be in going round in a cage he had out daybooks and ledgers and was calculating up backrents and every time the sumtotals came to different amounts he could have cried like a child over his sums he was worn out and weary angry and disappointed he closed his books at last with a bang im getting old he said and my heads less clear than it used to be i think sorrow for her has dazed me i never was much to boast on but she thought a deal of mebless her shed never let me call myself stupid but for all that i am stupid osborne ought to help me hes had money enough spent on his learning but instead he comes down dressed like a popinjay and never troubles his head to think how im to pay his debts i wish id told him to earn his living as a dancingmaster said the squire with a sad smile at his own wit hes dressed for all the world like one and how hes spent the money no one knows perhaps roger will turn up some day with a heap of creditors at his heels no he wontnot roger he may be slow but hes steady is old roger i wish he was here hes not the eldest son but hed take an interest in the estate and hed do up these weary accounts for me i wish roger was here chapter xxiii osborne hamley reviews his position osborne had his solitary cup of coffee in the drawingroom he was very unhappy too after his fashion he stood on the hearthrug pondering over his situation he was not exactly aware how hardly his father was pressed for readymoney the squire had never spoken to him on the subject without being angry and many of his loose contradictory statementsall of which however contradictory they might appear had their basis in truthwere set down by his son to the exaggeration of passion but it was uncomfortable enough to a young man of osbornes age to feel himself continually hampered for want of a fivepound note the principal supplies for the liberalalmost luxurious table at the hall came off the estate so that there was no appearance of poverty as far as the household went and as long as osborne was content at home he had everything he could wish for but he had a wife elsewherehe wanted to see her continuallyand that necessitated journeys she poor thing had to be supportedwhere was the money for the journeys and for aimes modest wants to come from that was the puzzle in osbornes mind just now while he had been at college his allowanceheir of the hamleyshad been three hundred while roger had to be content with a hundred less the payment of these annual sums had given the squire a good deal of trouble but he thought of it as a merely temporary inconvenience perhaps unreasonably thought so osborne was to do great things take high honours get a fellowship marry a longdescended heiress live in some of the many uninhabited rooms at the hall and help the squire in the management of the estate that would some time be his roger was to be a clergyman steady slow roger was just fitted for that and when he declined entering the church preferring a life of more activity and adventure roger was to beanything he was useful and practical and fit for all the employments from which osborne was shut out by his fastidiousness and his pseudo genius so it was well he was an eldest son for he would never have done to struggle through the world and as for his settling down to a profession it would be like cutting blocks with a razor and now here was osborne living at home but longing to be elsewhere his allowance stopped in reality indeed the punctual payment of it during the last year or two had been owing to his mothers exertions but nothing had been said about its present cessation by either father or son money matters were too sore a subject between them every now and then the squire threw him a tenpound note or so but the sort of suppressed growl with which it was given and the entire uncertainty as to when he might receive such gifts rendered any calculation based upon their receipt exceedingly vague and uncertain what in the world can i do to secure an income thought osborne as he stood on the hearthrug his back to a blazing fire his cup of coffee sent up in the rare old china that had belonged to the hall for generations his dress finished as dress of osbornes could hardly fail to be one could hardly have thought that this elegant young man standing there in the midst of comfort that verged on luxury should have been turning over that one great problem in his mind but so it was what can i do to be sure of a present income things cannot go on as they are i should need support for two or three years even if i entered myself at the temple or lincolns inn it would be impossible to live on my pay in the army besides i should hate that profession in fact there are evils attending all professionsi couldnt bring myself to become a member of any ive ever heard of perhaps im more fitted to take orders than anything else but to be compelled to write weekly sermons whether one had anything to say or not and probably doomed only to associate with people below one in refinement and education yet poor aime must have money i cant bear to compare our dinners here overloaded with joints and game and sweets as morgan will persist in sending them up with aimes two little muttonchops yet what would my father say if he knew id married a frenchwoman in his present mood hed disinherit me if that is possible and hed speak about her in a way i couldnt stand a roman catholic too well i dont repent it id do it again only if my mother had been in good healthif she could have heard my story and known aime as it is i must keep it secret but where to get money where to get money then he bethought him of his poemswould they sell and bring him in money in spite of milton he thought they might and he went to fetch his mss out of his room he sate down near the fire trying to study them with a critical eye to represent public opinion as far as he could he had changed his style since the mrs hemans days he was essentially imitative in his poetic faculty and of late he had followed the lead of a popular writer of sonnets he turned his poems over they were almost equivalent to an autobiographical passage in his life arranging them in their order they came as follows to aime walking with a little child to aime singing at her work to aime turning away from me while i told my love aimes confession aime in despair the foreign land in which my aime dwells the wedding ring the wife when he came to this last sonnet he put down his bundle of papers and began to think the wife yes and a french wife and a roman catholic wifeand a wife who might be said to have been in service and his fathers hatred of the french both collectively and individuallycollectively as tumultuous brutal ruffians who murdered their king and committed all kinds of bloody atrocitiesindividually as represented by boney and the various caricatures of johnny crapaud that had been in full circulation about fiveandtwenty years before this time when the squire had been young and capable of receiving impressions as for the form of religion in which mrs osborne hamley had been brought up it is enough to say that catholic emancipation had begun to be talked about by some politicians and that the sullen roar of the majority of englishmen at the bare idea of it was surging in the distance with ominous threatenings the very mention of such a measure before the squire was as osborne well knew like shaking a red flag before a bull and then he considered that if aime had had the unspeakable the incomparable blessing of being born of english parents in the very heart of englandwarwickshire for instanceand had never heard of priests or mass or confession or the pope or guy fawkes but had been born baptized and bred in the church of england without having ever seen the outside of a dissenting meetinghouse or a papist chapeleven with all these advantages her having been a what was the equivalent for bonne in english nurserygoverness was a term hardly invented nurserymaid with wages paid down once a quarter liable to be dismissed at a months warning and having her tea and sugar doled out to her would be a shock to his fathers old ancestral pride that he would hardly ever get over if he saw her thought osborne if he could but see her but if the squire were to see aime he would also hear her speak her pretty broken englishprecious to her husband as it was in it that she had confessed brokenly with her english tongue that she loved him soundly with her french heartand squire hamley piqued himself on being a good hater of the french she would make such a loving sweet docile little daughter to my fathershe would go as near as any one could towards filling up the blank void in this house if he would but have her but he wont he never would and he shant have the opportunity of scouting her yet if i called her lucy in these sonnets and if they made a great effectwere praised in blackwood and the quarterlyand all the world was agog to find out the author and i told him my secreti could if i were successfuli think then he would ask who lucy was and i could tell him all then ifhow i hate ifs if me no ifs my life has been based on whens and first they have turned to ifs and then they have vanished away it was when osborne gets honours and then if osborne and then a failure altogether i said to aime when my mother sees you and now it is if my father saw her with a very faint prospect of its ever coming to pass so he let the evening hours flow on and disappear in reveries like these winding up with a sudden determination to try the fate of his poems with a publisher with the direct expectation of getting money for them and an ulterior fancy that if successful they might work wonders with his father when roger came home osborne did not let a day pass before telling his brother of his plans he never did conceal anything long from roger the feminine part of his character made him always desirous of a confidant and as sweet sympathy as he could extract but rogers opinion had no effect on osbornes actions and roger knew this full well so when osborne began withi want your advice on a plan i have got in my head roger replied some one told me that the duke of wellingtons maxim was never to give advice unless he could enforce its being carried into effect now i cant do that and you know old boy you dont follow out my advice when youve got it not always i know not when it doesnt agree with my own opinion youre thinking about this concealment of my marriage but youre not up in all the circumstances you know how fully i meant to have done it if there hadnt been that row about my debts and then my mothers illness and death and now youve no conception how my father is changedhow irritable he has become wait till youve been at home a week robinson morganits the same with them all but worst of all with me poor fellow said roger i thought he looked terribly changed shrunken and his ruddiness of complexion altered why he hardly takes half the exercise he used to do so its no wonder he has turned away all the men off the new works which used to be such an interest to him and because the roan cob stumbled with him one day and nearly threw him he wont ride it and yet he wont sell it and buy another which would be the sensible plan so there are two old horses eating their heads off while he is constantly talking about money and expense and that brings me to what i was going to say im desperately hard up for money and so ive been collecting my poemsweeding them well you knowgoing over them quite critically in fact and i want to know if you think deighton would publish them youve a name in cambridge you know and i daresay he would look at them if you offered them to him i can but try said roger but im afraid you wont get much by them i dont expect much im a new man and must make my name i should be content with a hundred if id a hundred pounds id set myself to do something i might keep myself and aime by my writings while i studied for the bar or if the worst came to the worst a hundred pounds would take us to australia australia why osborne what could you do there and leave my father i hope youll never get your hundred pounds if thats the use youre to make of it why youd break the squires heart it might have done once said osborne gloomily but it wouldnt now he looks at me askance and shies away from conversation with me let me alone for noticing and feeling this kind of thing its this very susceptibility to outward things that gives me what faculty i have and it seems to me as if my bread and my wifes too were to depend upon it youll soon see for yourself the terms which i am on with my father roger did soon see his father had slipped into a habit of silence at mealtimesa habit which osborne who was troubled and anxious enough for his own part had not striven to break father and son sate together and exchanged all the necessary speeches connected with the occasion civilly enough but it was a relief to them when their intercourse was over and they separatedthe father to brood over his sorrow and his disappointment which were real and deep enough and the injury he had received from his boy which was exaggerated in his mind by his ignorance of the actual steps osborne had taken to raise money if the moneylenders had calculated the chances of his fathers life or death in making their bargain osborne himself had thought only of how soon and how easily he could get the money requisite for clearing him from all imperious claims at cambridge and for enabling him to follow aime to her home in alsace and for the subsequent marriage as yet roger had never seen his brothers wife indeed he had only been taken into osbornes full confidence after all was decided in which his advice could have been useful and now in the enforced separation osbornes whole thought both the poetical and practical sides of his mind ran upon the little wife who was passing her lonely days in farmhouse lodgings wondering when her bridegroom husband would come to her next with such an engrossing subject it was perhaps no wonder that he unconsciously neglected his father but it was none the less sad at the time and to be regretted in its consequences i may come in and have a pipe with you sir maynt i said roger that first evening pushing gently against the studydoor which his father held only half open youll not like it said the squire still holding the door against him but speaking in a relenting tone the tobacco i use isnt what young men like better go and have a cigar with osborne no i want to sit with you and i can stand pretty strong tobacco roger pushed in the resistance slowly giving way before him it will make your clothes smell youll have to borrow osbornes scents to sweeten yourself said the squire grimly at the same time pushing a short smart ambermouthed pipe to his son no ill have a churchwarden why father do you think im a baby to put up with a dolls head like this looking at the carving upon it the squire was pleased in his heart though he did not choose to show it he only said osborne brought it me when he came back from germany thats three years ago and then for some time they smoked in silence but the voluntary companionship of his son was very soothing to the squire though not a word might be said the next speech he made showed the direction of his thoughts indeed his words were always a transparent medium through which the current might be seen a deal of a mans life comes and goes in three yearsive found that out and he puffed away at his pipe again while roger was turning over in his mind what answer to make to this truism the squire again stopped his smoking and spoke i remember when there was all that fuss about the prince of wales being made regent i read somewherei daresay it was in a newspaperthat kings and their heirsapparent were always on bad terms osborne was quite a little chap then he used to go out riding with me on white surreyyou wont remember the pony we called white surrey i remember it but i thought it a tall horse in those days ah that was because you were such a small lad you know id seven horses in the stable thennot counting the farmhorses i dont recollect having a care then exceptshe was always delicate you know but what a beautiful boy osborne was he was always dressed in black velvetit was a foppery but it wasnt my doing and it was all right im sure hes a handsome fellow now but the sunshine has gone out of his face hes a good deal troubled about this money and the anxiety he has given you said roger rather taking his brothers feelings for granted not he said the squire taking the pipe out of his mouth and hitting the bowl so sharply against the hob that it broke in pieces there but never mind i say not he roger hes none troubled about the money its easy getting money from jews if youre the eldest son and the heir they just ask how old is your father and has he had a stroke or a fit and its settled out of hand and then they come prowling about a place and running down the timber and landdont let us speak of him its no good roger he and i are out of tune and it seems to me as if only god almighty could put us to rights its thinking of how he grieved her at last that makes me so bitter with him and yet theres a deal of good in him and hes so quick and clever if only hed give his mind to things now you were always slow rogerall your masters used to say so roger laughed a little yes id many a nickname at school for my slowness said he never mind said the squire consolingly im sure i dont if you were a clever fellow like osborne yonder youd be all for caring for books and writing and youd perhaps find it as dull as he does to keep company with a bumpkinsquire jones like me yet i daresay they think a deal of you at cambridge said he after a pause since youve got this fine wranglership id nearly forgotten thatthe news came at such a miserable time well yes theyre always proud of the senior wrangler of the year up at cambridge next year i must abdicate the squire sat and gazed into the embers still holding his useless pipestem at last he said in a low voice as if scarcely aware he had got a listeneri used to write to her when she was away in london and tell her the home news but no letter will reach her now nothing reaches her roger started up wheres the tobaccobox father let me fill you another pipe and when he had done so he stooped over his father and stroked his cheek the squire shook his head youve only just come home lad you dont know me as i am nowadays ask robinsoni wont have you asking osborne he ought to keep it to himselfbut any of the servants will tell you im not like the same man for getting into passions with them i used to be reckoned a good master but thats past now osborne was once a little boy and she was once aliveand i was once a good mastera good masteryes its all past now he took up his pipe and began to smoke afresh and roger after a silence of some minutes began a long story about some cambridge mans misadventure on the huntingfield telling it with such humour that the squire was beguiled into hearty laughing when they rose to go to bed his father said to roger well weve had a pleasant eveningat least i have but perhaps you havent for im but poor company now i know i dont know when ive passed a happier evening father said roger and he spoke truly though he did not trouble himself to find out the cause of his happiness chapter xxiv mrs gibsons little dinner illustration untitled all this had taken place before rogers first meeting with molly and cynthia at miss brownings and the little dinner on the friday at mr gibsons which followed in due sequence mrs gibson intended the hamleys to find this dinner pleasant and they did mr gibson was fond of the two young men both for their parents sake and their own for he had known them since boyhood and to those whom he liked mr gibson could be remarkably agreeable mrs gibson really gave them a welcomeand cordiality in a hostess is a very becoming mantle for any other deficiencies there may be cynthia and molly looked their best which was all the duty mrs gibson absolutely required of them as she was willing enough to take her full share in the conversation osborne fell to her lot of course and for some time he and she prattled on with all the ease of manner and commonplaceness of meaning which go far to make the art of polite conversation roger who ought to have made himself agreeable to one or the other of the young ladies was exceedingly interested in what mr gibson was telling him of a paper on comparative osteology in some foreign journal of science which lord hollingford was in the habit of forwarding to his friend the country surgeon yet every now and then while he listened he caught his attention wandering to the face of cynthia who was placed between his brother and mr gibson she was not particularly occupied with attending to anything that was going on her eyelids were carelessly dropped as she crumbled her bread on the tablecloth and her beautiful long eyelashes were seen on the clear tint of her oval cheek she was thinking of something else molly was trying to understand with all her might suddenly cynthia looked up and caught rogers gaze of intent admiration too fully for her to be unaware that he was staring at her she coloured a little but after the first moment of rosy confusion at his evident admiration of her she flew to the attack diverting his confusion at thus being caught to the defence of himself from her accusation it is quite true she said to him i was not attending you see i dont know even the a b c of science but please dont look so severely at me even if i am a dunce i didnt knowi didnt mean to look severely i am sure replied he not knowing well what to say cynthia is not a dunce either said mrs gibson afraid lest her daughters opinion of herself might be taken seriously but i have always observed that some people have a talent for one thing and some for another now cynthias talents are not for science and the severer studies do you remember love what trouble i had to teach you the use of the globes yes and i dont know longitude from latitude now and im always puzzled as to which is perpendicular and which is horizontal yet i do assure you her mother continued rather addressing herself to osborne that her memory for poetry is prodigious i have heard her repeat the prisoner of chillon from beginning to end it would be rather a bore to have to hear her i think said mr gibson smiling at cynthia who gave him back one of her bright looks of mutual understanding ah mr gibson i have found out before now that you have no soul for poetry and molly there is your own child she reads such deep booksall about facts and figures shell be quite a bluestocking byandby mamma said molly reddening you think it was a deep book because there were the shapes of the different cells of bees in it but it was not at all deep it was very interesting never mind molly said osborne i stand up for bluestockings and i object to the distinction implied in what you say said roger it was not deep ergo it was very interesting now a book may be both deep and interesting oh if you are going to chop logic and use latin words i think it is time for us to leave the room said mrs gibson dont let us run away as if we were beaten mamma said cynthia though it may be logic i for one can understand what mr roger hamley said just now and i read some of mollys books and whether it was deep or not i found it very interestingmore so than i should think the prisoner of chillon nowadays ive displaced the prisoner to make room for johnnie gilpin as my favourite poem how could you talk such nonsense cynthia said mrs gibson as the girls followed her upstairs you know you are not a dunce it is all very well not to be a bluestocking because gentlepeople dont like that kind of woman but running yourself down and contradicting all i said about your liking for byron and poets and poetryto osborne hamley of all men too mrs gibson spoke quite crossly for her but mamma cynthia replied i am either a dunce or i am not if i am i did right to own it if i am not hes a dunce if he doesnt find out i was joking well said mrs gibson a little puzzled by this speech and wanting some elucidatory addition only that if hes a dunce his opinion of me is worth nothing so any way it doesnt signify you really bewilder me with your nonsense child molly is worth twenty of you i quite agree with you mamma said cynthia turning round to take mollys hand yes but she ought not to be said mrs gibson still irritated think of the advantages youve had im afraid i had rather be a dunce than a bluestocking said molly for the term had a little annoyed her and the annoyance was rankling still hush here they are coming i hear the diningroom door i never meant you were a bluestocking dear so dont look vexedcynthia my love where did you get those lovely flowersanemones are they they suit your complexion so exactly come molly dont look so grave and thoughtful exclaimed cynthia dont you perceive mamma wants us to be smiling and amiable mr gibson had had to go out to his evening round and the young men were all too glad to come up into the pretty drawingroom the bright little woodfire the comfortable easychairs which with so small a party might be drawn round the hearth the goodnatured hostess the pretty agreeable girls roger sauntered up to the corner where cynthia was standing playing with a handscreen there is a charity ball in hollingford soon isnt there asked he yes on easter tuesday she replied are you going i suppose you are yes mamma is going to take molly and me you will enjoy it very muchgoing together for the first time during this little conversation she glanced up at himreal honest pleasure shining out of her eyes yes going together will make the enjoyment of the thing it would be dull without her you are great friends then he asked i never thought i should like any one so muchany girl i mean she put in the final reservation in all simplicity of heart and in all simplicity did he understand it he came ever so little nearer and dropped his voice a little i was so anxious to know i am so glad i have often wondered how you two were getting on have you said she looking up again at cambridge you must be very fond of molly yes i am she was with us so long and at such a time i look upon her almost as a sister and she is very fond of all of you i seem to know you all from hearing her talk about you so muchall of you said she laying an emphasis on all to show that it included the dead as well as the living roger was silent for a minute or two i didnt know you even by hearsay so you mustnt wonder that i was a little afraid but as soon as i saw you i knew how it must be and it was such a relief cynthia said mrs gibson who thought that the younger son had had quite his share of low confidential conversation come here and sing that little french ballad to mr osborne hamley which do you mean mamma tu ten repentiras colin yes such a pretty playful little warning to young men said mrs gibson smiling up at osborne the refrain is tu ten repentiras colin tu ten repentiras car si tu prends une femme colin tu ten repentiras the advice may apply very well when there is a french wife in the case but not i am sure to an englishman who is thinking of an english wife illustration tu ten repentiras colin this choice of a song was exceedingly malpropos had mrs gibson but known it osborne and roger knowing that the wife of the former was a frenchwoman and conscious of each others knowledge felt doubly awkward while molly was as much confused as though she herself were secretly married however cynthia carolled the saucy ditty out and her mother smiled at it in total ignorance of any application it might have osborne had instinctively gone to stand behind cynthia as she sate at the piano so as to be ready to turn over the leaves of her music if she required it he kept his hands in his pockets and his eyes fixed on her fingers his countenance clouded with gravity at all the merry quips which she so playfully sang roger looked grave as well but was much more at his ease than his brother indeed he was halfamused by the awkwardness of the situation he caught mollys troubled eyes and heightened colour and he saw that she was feeling this contretemps more seriously than she needed to do he moved to a seat by her and half whispered too late a warning is it not molly looked up at him as he leant towards her and replied in the same toneoh i am so sorry you need not be he wont mind it long and a man must take the consequences when he puts himself in a false position molly could not tell what to reply to this so she hung her head and kept silence yet she could see that roger did not change his attitude or remove his hand from the back of his chair and impelled by curiosity to find out the cause of his stillness she looked up at him at length and saw his gaze fixed on the two who were near the piano osborne was saying something eagerly to cynthia whose grave eyes were upturned to him with soft intentness of expression and her pretty mouth halfopen with a sort of impatience for him to cease speaking that she might reply they are talking about france said roger in answer to mollys unspoken question osborne knows it well and miss kirkpatrick has been at school there you know it sounds very interesting shall we go nearer and hear what they are saying it was all very well to ask this civilly but molly thought it would have been better to wait for her answer instead of waiting however roger went to the piano and leaning on it appeared to join in the light merry talk while he feasted his eyes as much as he dared by looking at cynthia molly suddenly felt as if she could scarcely keep from cryinga minute ago he had been so near to her and talking so pleasantly and confidentially and now he almost seemed as if he had forgotten her existence she thought that all this was wrong and she exaggerated its wrongness to herself mean and envious of cynthia and illnatured and selfish were the terms she kept applying to herself but it did no good she was just as naughty at the last as at the first mrs gibson broke into the state of things which molly thought was to endure for ever her work had been intricate up to this time and had required a great deal of counting so she had had no time to attend to her duties one of which she always took to be to show herself to the world as an impartial stepmother cynthia had played and sung and now she must give molly her turn of exhibition cynthias singing and playing was light and graceful but anything but correct but she herself was so charming that it was only fanatics for music who cared for false chords and omitted notes molly on the contrary had an excellent ear if she had ever been well taught and both from inclination and conscientious perseverance of disposition she would go over an incorrect passage for twenty times but she was very shy of playing in company and when forced to do it she went through her performance heavily and hated her handiwork more than any one now you must play a little molly said mrs gibson play us that beautiful piece of kalkbrenners my dear molly looked up at her stepmother with beseeching eyes but it only brought out another form of request still more like a command go at once my dear you may not play it quite rightly and i know you are very nervous but youre quite amongst friends so there was a disturbance made in the little group at the piano and molly sate down to her martyrdom please go away said she to osborne who was standing behind her ready to turn over i can quite well do it for myself and oh if you would but talk osborne remained where he was in spite of her appeal and gave her what little approval she got for mrs gibson exhausted by her previous labour of counting her stitches fell asleep in her comfortable sofacorner near the fire and roger who began at first to talk a little in compliance with mollys request found his conversation with cynthia so agreeable that molly lost her place several times in trying to catch a sudden glimpse of cynthia sitting at her work and roger by her intent on catching her low replies to what he was saying there now ive done said molly standing up quickly as soon as she had finished the eighteen dreary pages and i think i will never sit down to play again osborne laughed at her vehemence cynthia began to take some part in what was being said and thus made the conversation general mrs gibson wakened up gracefully as was her way of doing all things and slid into the subjects they were talking about so easily that she almost succeeded in making them believe she had never been asleep at all chapter xxv hollingford in a bustle all hollingford felt as if there was a great deal to be done before easter this year there was easter proper which always required new clothing of some kind for fear of certain consequences from little birds who were supposed to resent the impiety of those that did not wear some new article of dress on easterday and most ladies considered it wiser that the little birds should see the new article for themselves and not have to take it upon trust as they would have to do if it were merely a pockethandkerchief or a petticoat or any article of underclothing so piety demanded a new bonnet or a new gown and was barely satisfied with an easter pair of gloves miss rose was generally very busy just before easter in hollingford then this year there was the charity ball ashcombe hollingford and coreham were three neighbouring towns of about the same number of population lying at the three equidistant corners of a triangle in imitation of greater cities with their festivals these three towns had agreed to have an annual ball for the benefit of the county hospital to be held in turn at each place and hollingford was to be the place this year it was a fine time for hospitality and every house of any pretension was as full as it could hold and flys were engaged long months before if mrs gibson could have asked osborne or in default roger hamley to go to the ball with them and to sleep at their houseor if indeed she could have picked up any stray scion of a county family to whom such an offer would have been a convenience she would have restored her own dressingroom to its former use as the spareroom with pleasure but she did not think it was worth her while to put herself out for any of the humdrum and illdressed women who had been her former acquaintances at ashcombe for mr preston it might have been worth while to give up her room considering him in the light of a handsome and prosperous young man and a good dancer besides but there were more lights in which he was to be viewed mr gibson who really wanted to return the hospitality shown to him by mr preston at the time of his marriage had yet an instinctive distaste to the man which no wish of freeing himself from obligation nor even the more worthy feeling of hospitality could overcome mrs gibson had some old grudges of her own against him but she was not one to retain angry feelings or be very active in her retaliation she was afraid of mr preston and admired him at the same time it was awkward tooso she saidto go into a ballroom without any gentleman at all and mr gibson was so uncertain on the wholepartly for this lastgiven reason and partly because conciliation was the best policy mrs gibson was slightly in favour of inviting mr preston to be their guest but as soon as cynthia heard the question discussedor rather as soon as she heard it discussed in mr gibsons absence she said that if mr preston came to be their visitor on the occasion she for one would not go to the ball at all she did not speak with vehemence or in anger but with such quiet resolution that molly looked up in surprise she saw that cynthia was keeping her eyes fixed on her work and that she had no intention of meeting any ones gaze or giving any further explanation mrs gibson too looked perplexed and once or twice seemed on the point of asking some question but she was not angry as molly had fully expected she watched cynthia furtively and in silence for a minute or two and then said that after all she could not conveniently give up her dressingroom and altogether they had better say no more about it so no stranger was invited to stay at mr gibsons at the time of the ball but mrs gibson openly spoke of her regret at the unavoidable inhospitality and hoped that they might be able to build an addition to their house before the next triennial hollingford ball another cause of unusual bustle at hollingford this easter was the expected return of the family to the towers after their unusually long absence mr sheepshanks might be seen trotting up and down on his stout old cob speaking to attentive masons plasterers and glaziers about putting everythingon the outside at leastabout the cottages belonging to my lord in perfect repair lord cumnor owned the greater part of the town and those who lived under other landlords or in houses of their own were stirred up by the dread of contrast to do up their dwellings so the ladders of whitewashers and painters were sadly in the way of the ladies tripping daintily along to make their purchases and holding their gowns up in a bunch behind after a fashion quite gone out in these days the housekeeper and steward from the towers might also be seen coming in to give orders at the various shops and stopping here and there at those kept by favourites to avail themselves of the eagerlytendered refreshments lady harriet came to call on her old governess the day after the arrival of the family at the towers molly and cynthia were out walking when she camedoing some errands for mrs gibson who had a secret idea that lady harriet would call at the particular time she did and had a not uncommon wish to talk to her ladyship without the corrective presence of any member of her own family mrs gibson did not give molly the message of remembrance that lady harriet had left for her but she imparted various pieces of news relating to the towers with great animation and interest the duchess of menteith and her daughter lady alice were coming to the towers would be there the day of the ball would come to the ball and the menteith diamonds were famous that was piece of news the first the second was that ever so many gentlemen were coming to the towerssome english some french this piece of news would have come first in order of importance had there been much probability of their being dancing men and as such possible partners at the coming ball but lady harriet had spoken of them as lord hollingfords friends useless scientific men in all probability then finally mrs gibson was to go to the towers next day to lunch lady cumnor had written a little note by lady harriet to beg her to come if mrs gibson could manage to find her way to the towers one of the carriages in use should bring her back to her own home in the course of the afternoon the dear countess said mrs gibson with soft affection it was a soliloquy uttered after a minutes pause at the end of all this information and all the rest of that day her conversation had an aristocratic perfume hanging about it one of the few books she had brought with her into mr gibsons house was bound in pink and in it she studied menteith duke of adolphus george c c till she was fully up in all the duchesss connections and probable interests mr gibson made his mouth up into a droll whistle when he came home at night and found himself in a towers atmosphere molly saw the shade of annoyance through the drollery she was beginning to see it oftener than she liked not that she reasoned upon it or that she consciously traced the annoyance to its source but she could not help feeling uneasy in herself when she knew her father was in the least put out of course a fly was ordered for mrs gibson in the early afternoon she came home if she had been disappointed in her interview with the countess she never told her woe nor revealed the fact that when she first arrived at the towers she had to wait for an hour in lady cumnors morningroom uncheered by any companionship save that of her old friend mrs bradley till suddenly lady harriet coming in she exclaimed why clare you dear woman are you here all alone does mamma know and after a little more affectionate conversation she rushed to find her ladyship who was perfectly aware of the fact but too deep in giving the duchess the benefit of her wisdom and experience in trousseaux to be at all aware of the length of time mrs gibson had been passing in patient solitude at lunch mrs gibson was secretly hurt by my lords supposing it to be her dinner and calling out his urgent hospitality from the very bottom of the table giving as a reason for it that she must remember it was her dinner in vain she piped out in her soft high voice oh my lord i never eat meat in the middle of the day i can hardly eat anything at lunch her voice was lost and the duchess might go away with the idea that the hollingford doctors wife dined early that is to say if her grace ever condescended to have any idea on the subject at all which presupposes that she was cognizant of the fact of there being a doctor at hollingford and that he had a wife and that his wife was the pretty faded elegantlooking woman sending away her plate of untasted foodfood which she longed to eat for she was really desperately hungry after her drive and her solitude and then after lunch there did come a ttette with lady cumnor which was conducted after this wise well clare i am really glad to see you i once thought i should never get back to the towers but here i am there was such a clever man at batha doctor snapehe cured me at lastquite set me up i really think if ever i am ill again i shall send for him it is such a thing to find a really clever medical man oh by the way i always forget youve married mr gibsonof course he is very clever and all that the carriage to the door in ten minutes brown and desire bradley to bring my things down what was i asking you oh how do you get on with the stepdaughter she seemed to me to be a young lady with a pretty stubborn will of her own i put a letter for the post down somewhere and i cannot think where do help me look for it theres a good woman just run to my room and see if brown can find it for it is of great consequence off went mrs gibson rather unwillingly for there were several things she wanted to speak about and she had not heard half of what she had expected to learn of the family gossip but all chance was gone for when she came back from her fruitless errand lady cumnor and the duchess were in full talk lady cumnor with the missing letter in her hand which she was using something like a baton to enforce her words every iota from paris every iota lady cumnor was too much of a lady not to apologize for useless trouble but they were nearly the last words she spoke to mrs gibson for she had to go out and drive with the duchess and the brougham to take clare as she persisted in calling mrs gibson back to hollingford followed the carriage to the door lady harriet came away from her entourage of young men and young ladies all prepared for some walking expedition to wish mrs gibson goodby we shall see you at the ball she said youll be there with your two girls of course and i must have a little talk with you there with all these visitors in the house it has been impossible to see anything of you today you know such were the facts but rosecolour was the medium through which they were seen by mrs gibsons household listeners on her return there are many visitors staying at the towersoh yes a great many the duchess and lady alice and mr and mrs grey and lord albert monson and his sister and my old friend captain james of the bluesmany more in fact but of course i preferred going to lady cumnors own room where i could see her and lady harriet quietly and where we were not disturbed by the bustle downstairs of course we were obliged to go down to lunch and then i saw my old friends and renewed pleasant acquaintances but i really could hardly get any connected conversation with any one lord cumnor seemed so delighted to see me there again though there were six or seven between us he was always interrupting with some civil or kind speech especially addressed to me and after lunch lady cumnor asked me all sorts of questions about my new life with as much interest as if i had been her daughter to be sure when the duchess came in we had to leave off and talk about the trousseau she is preparing for lady alice lady harriet made such a point of our meeting at the ball she is such a good affectionate creature is lady harriet this last was said in a tone of meditative appreciation the afternoon of the day on which the ball was to take place a servant rode over from hamley with two lovely nosegays with the mr hamleys compliments to miss gibson and miss kirkpatrick cynthia was the first to receive them she came dancing into the drawingroom flourishing the flowers about in either hand and danced up to molly who was trying to settle to her reading by way of passing the time away till the evening came look molly look here are bouquets for us long life to the givers who are they from asked molly taking hold of one and examining it with tender delight at its beauty who from why the two paragons of hamleys to be sure is it not a pretty attention how kind of them said molly im sure it is osborne who thought of it he has been so much abroad where it is such a common compliment to send bouquets to young ladies i dont see why you should think it is osbornes thought said molly reddening a little mr roger hamley used to gather nosegays constantly for his mother and sometimes for me well never mind whose thought it was or who gathered them weve got the flowers and thats enough molly im sure these red flowers will just match your coral necklace and bracelets said cynthia pulling out some camellias then a rare kind of flower oh please dont exclaimed molly dont you see how carefully the colours are arrangedthey have taken such pains please dont nonsense said cynthia continuing to pull them out see here are quite enough ill make you a little coronet of themsewn on black velvet which will never be seenjust as they do in france oh i am so sorry it is quite spoilt said molly never mind ill take this spoilt bouquet i can make it up again just as prettily as ever and you shall have this which has never been touched cynthia went on arranging the crimson buds and flowers to her taste molly said nothing but kept watching cynthias nimble fingers tying up the wreath there said cynthia at last when that is sewn on black velvet to keep the flowers from dying youll see how pretty it will look and there are enough red flowers in this untouched nosegay to carry out the idea thank you very slowly but shant you mind having only the wrecks of the other not i red flowers would not go with my pink dress buti daresay they arranged each nosegay so carefully perhaps they did but i never would allow sentiment to interfere with my choice of colours and pink does tie one down now you in white muslin just tipped with crimson like a daisy may wear anything cynthia took the utmost pains in dressing molly leaving the clever housemaid to her mothers exclusive service mrs gibson was more anxious about her attire than was either of the girls it had given her occasion for deep thought and not a few sighs her deliberation had ended in her wearing her pearlgrey satin weddinggown with a profusion of lace and white and coloured lilacs cynthia was the one who took the affair most lightly molly looked upon the ceremony of dressing for a first ball as rather a serious ceremony certainly as an anxious proceeding cynthia was almost as anxious as herself only molly wanted her appearance to be correct and unnoticed and cynthia was desirous of setting off mollys rather peculiar charmsher creamcoloured skin her profusion of curly black hair her beautiful longshaped eyes with their shy loving expression cynthia took up so much time in dressing molly to her mind that she herself had to perform her toilette in a hurry molly ready dressed sate on a low chair in cynthias room watching the pretty creatures rapid movements as she stood in her petticoat before the glass doing up her hair with quick certainty of effect at length molly heaved a long sigh and said i should like to be pretty why molly said cynthia turning round with an exclamation on the tip of her tongue but when she caught the innocent wistful look on mollys face she instinctively checked what she was going to say and halfsmiling to her own reflection in the glass she saidthe french girls would tell you to believe that you were pretty would make you so molly paused before replying i suppose they would mean that if you knew you were pretty you would never think about your looks you would be so certain of being liked and that it is caring listen thats eight oclock striking dont trouble yourself with trying to interpret a french girls meaning but help me on with my frock theres a dear one the two girls were dressed and were standing over the fire waiting for the carriage in cynthias room when maria bettys successor came hurrying into the room maria had been officiating as maid to mrs gibson but she had had intervals of leisure in which she had rushed upstairs and under the pretence of offering her services had seen the young ladies dresses and the sight of so many nice clothes had sent her into a state of excitement which made her think nothing of rushing upstairs for the twentieth time with a nosegay still more beautiful than the two previous ones here miss kirkpatrick no its not for you miss as molly being nearer to the door offered to take it and pass it to cynthia its for miss kirkpatrick and theres a note for her besides cynthia said nothing but took the note and the flowers she held the note so that molly could read it at the same time she did i send you some flowers and you must allow me to claim the first dance after nine oclock before which time i fear i cannot arriver p who is it asked molly cynthia looked extremely irritated indignant perplexedwhat was it turned her cheek so pale and made her eyes so full of fire it is mr preston said she in answer to molly i shall not dance with him and here go his flowers into the very middle of the embers which she immediately stirred down upon the beautiful shrivelling petals as if she wished to annihilate them as soon as possible her voice had never been raised it was as sweet as usual nor though her movements were prompt enough were they hasty or violent oh said molly those beautiful flowers we might have put them in water no said cynthia its best to destroy them we dont want them and i cant bear to be reminded of that man it was an impertinent familiar note said molly what right had he to express himself in that wayno beginning no end and only initials did you know him well when you were at ashcombe cynthia oh dont let us think any more about him replied cynthia it is quite enough to spoil any pleasure at the ball to think that he will be there but i hope i shall get engaged before he comes so that i cant dance with himand dont you either there they are calling for us exclaimed molly and with quick step yet careful of their draperies they made their way downstairs to the place where mr and mrs gibson awaited them yes mr gibson was goingeven if he had to leave them afterwards to attend to any professional call and molly suddenly began to admire her father as a handsome man when she saw him now in full evening attire mrs gibson toohow pretty she was in short it was true that no betterlooking a party than these four people entered the hollingford ballroom that evening chapter xxvi a charity ball at the present time there are few people at a public ball besides the dancers and their chaperones or relations in some degree interested in them but in the days when molly and cynthia were youngbefore railroads were and before their consequences the excursiontrains which take every one up to london nowadays there to see their fill of gay crowds and fine dressesto go to an annual charityball even though all thought of dancing had passed by years ago and without any of the responsibilities of a chaperone was a very allowable and favourite piece of dissipation to all the kindly old maids who thronged the country towns of england they aired their old lace and their best dresses they saw the aristocratic magnates of the country side they gossipped with their coevals and speculated on the romances of the young around them in a curious yet friendly spirit the miss brownings would have thought themselves sadly defrauded of the gayest event of the year if anything had prevented their attending the charity ball and miss browning would have been indignant miss phoebe aggrieved had they not been asked to ashcombe and coreham by friends at each place who had like them gone through the dancingstage of life some fiveandtwenty years before but who liked still to haunt the scenes of their former enjoyment and see a younger generation dance on regardless of their doom they had come in one of the two sedanchairs that yet lingered in use at hollingford such a night as this brought a regular harvest of gains to the two old men who in what was called the towns livery trotted backwards and forwards with their many loads of ladies and finery there were some postchaises and some flys but after mature deliberation miss browning had decided to keep to the more comfortable custom of the sedanchair which as she said to miss piper one of her visitors came into the parlour and got full of the warm air and nipped you up and carried you tight and cosy into another warm room where you could walk out without having to show your legs by going up steps or down steps of course only one could go at a time but here again a little of miss brownings good management arranged everything so very nicely as miss hornblower their other visitor remarked she went first and remained in the warm cloakroom until her hostess followed and then the two ladies went arminarm into the ballroom finding out convenient seats whence they could watch the arrivals and speak to their passing friends until miss phoebe and miss piper entered and came to take possession of the seats reserved for them by miss brownings care these two younger ladies came in also arminarm but with a certain timid flurry in look and movement very different from the composed dignity of their seniors by two or three years when all four were once more assembled together they took breath and began to converse upon my word i really do think this is a better room than our ashcombe courthouse and how prettily it is decorated piped out miss piper how well the roses are made but you all have such taste at hollingford theres mrs dempster cried miss hornblower she said she and her two daughters were asked to stay at mr sheepshanks mr preston was to be there too but i suppose they could not all come at once look and there is young roscoe our new doctor i declare it seems as if all ashcombe were here mr roscoe mr roscoe come here and let me introduce you to miss browning the friend we are staying with we think very highly of our young doctor i can assure you miss browning mr roscoe bowed and simpered at hearing his own praises but miss browning had no notion of having any doctor praised who had come to settle on the very verge of mr gibsons practice so she said to miss hornblower you must be glad i am sure to have somebody you can call in if you are in any sudden hurry or for things that are too trifling to trouble mr gibson about and i should think mr roscoe would feel it a great advantage to profit as he will naturally have the opportunity of doing by witnessing mr gibsons skill probably mr roscoe would have felt more aggrieved by this speech than he really was if his attention had not been called off just then by the entrance of the very mr gibson who was being spoken of almost before miss browning had ended her severe and depreciatory remarks he had asked his friend miss hornblower who is that lovely girl in pink just come in why thats cynthia kirkpatrick said miss hornblower taking up a ponderous gold eyeglass to make sure of her fact how she has grown to be sure it is two or three years since she left ashcombeshe was very pretty thenpeople did say mr preston admired her very much but she was so young can you introduce me asked the impatient young surgeon i should like to ask her to dance when miss hornblower returned from her greeting to her former acquaintance mrs gibson and had accomplished the introduction which mr roscoe had requested she began her little confidences to miss browning well to be sure how condescending we are i remember the time when mrs kirkpatrick wore old black silks and was thankful and civil as became her place as a schoolmistress and as having to earn her bread and now she is in a satin and she speaks to me as if she just could recollect who i was if she tried very hard it isnt so long ago since mrs dempster came to consult me as to whether mrs kirkpatrick would be offended if she sent her a new breadth for her lilac silkgown in place of one that had been spoilt by mrs dempsters servant spilling the coffee over it the night before and she took it and was thankful for all shes dressed in pearlgrey satin now and she would have been glad enough to marry mr preston in those days i thought you said he admired her daughter put in miss browning to her irritated friend well perhaps i did and perhaps it was so im sure i cant tell he was a great deal at the house miss dixon keeps a school in the same house now and im sure she does it a great deal better the earl and the countess are very fond of mrs gibson said miss browning i know for lady harriet told us when she came to drink tea with us last autumn and they desired mr preston to be very attentive to her when she lived at ashcombe for goodness sake dont go and repeat what ive been saying about mr preston and mrs kirkpatrick to her ladyship one may be mistaken and you know i only said people talked about it miss hornblower was evidently alarmed lest her gossip should be repeated to the lady harriet who appeared to be on such an intimate footing with her hollingford friends nor did miss browning dissipate the illusion lady harriet had drunk tea with them and might do it again and at any rate the little fright she had put her friend into was not a bad return for that praise of mr roscoe which had offended miss brownings loyalty to mr gibson meanwhile miss piper and miss phoebe who had not the character of espritforts to maintain talked of the dresses of the people present beginning by complimenting each other what a lovely turban you have got on miss piper if i may be allowed to say so so becoming to your complexion do you think so said miss piper with illconcealed gratification it was something to have a complexion at fortyfive i got it at browns at somerton for this very ball i thought i must have something to set off my gown which isnt quite so new as it once was and i have no handsome jewellery like youlooking with admiring eyes at a large miniature set round with pearls which served as a shield to miss phoebes breast it is handsome that lady replied it is a likeness of my dear mother dorothy has got my father on the miniatures were both taken at the same time and just about then my uncle died and left us each a legacy of fifty pounds which we agreed to spend on the setting of our miniatures but because they are so valuable dorothy always keeps them locked up with the best silver and hides the box somewhere she never will tell me where because she says ive such weak nerves and that if a burglar with a loaded pistol at my head were to ask me where we kept our plate and jewels i should be sure to tell him and she says for her part she would never think of revealing under any circumstances im sure i hope she wont be tried but thats the reason i dont wear it often its only the second time ive had it on and i cant even get at it and look at it which i should like to do i shouldnt have had it on tonight but that dorothy gave it out to me saying it was but a proper compliment to pay to the duchess of menteith who is to be here in all her diamonds dearahme is she really do you know i never saw a duchess before and miss piper drew herself up and craned her neck as if resolved to behave herself properly as she had been taught to do at boardingschool thirty years before in the presence of her grace byandby she said to miss phoebe with a sudden jerk out of positionlook look thats our mr cholmley the magistrate he was the great man of coreham and thats mrs cholmley in red satin and mr george and mr harry from oxford i do declare and miss cholmley and pretty miss sophy i should like to go and speak to them but then its so formidable crossing a room without a gentleman and there is coxe the butcher and his wife why all coreham seems to be here and how mrs coxe can afford such a gown i cant make out for one for i know coxe had some difficulty in paying for the last sheep he bought of my brother just at this moment the band consisting of two violins a harp and an occasional clarionet having finished their tuning and brought themselves as nearly into accord as was possible struck up a brisk countrydance and partners quickly took their places mrs gibson was secretly a little annoyed at cynthias being one of those to stand up in this early dance the performers in which were principally the punctual plebeians of hollingford who when a ball was fixed to begin at eight had no notion of being later and so losing part of the amusement for which they had paid their money she imparted some of her feelings to molly sitting by her longing to dance and beating time to the spirited music with one of her pretty little feet your dear papa is always so very punctual tonight it seems almost a pity for we really are here before there is any one come that we know oh i see so many people here that i know there are mr and mrs smeaton and that nice goodtempered daughter oh booksellers and butchers if you will papa has found a great many friends to talk to patients my dearhardly friends there are some nicelooking people here catching her eye on the cholmleys but i daresay they have driven over from the neighbourhood of ashcombe or coreham and have hardly calculated how soon they would get here i wonder when the towers party will come ah theres mr ashton and mr preston come the room is beginning to fill so it was for this was to be a very good ball people said and a large party from the towers was coming and a duchess in diamonds among the number every great house in the district was expected to be full of guests on these occasions but at this early hour the townspeople had the floor almost entirely to themselves the county magnates came dropping in later and chiefest among them all was the lordlieutenant from the towers but tonight they were unusually late and the aristocratic ozone being absent from the atmosphere there was a flatness about the dancing of all those who considered themselves above the plebeian ranks of the tradespeople they however enjoyed themselves thoroughly and sprang and bounded till their eyes sparkled and their cheeks glowed with exercise and excitement some of the more prudent parents mindful of the next days duties began to consider at what hour they ought to go home but with all there was an expressed or unexpressed curiosity to see the duchess and her diamonds for the menteith diamonds were famous in higher circles than that now assembled and their fame had trickled down to it through the medium of ladiesmaids and housekeepers mr gibson had had to leave the ballroom for a time as he had anticipated but he was to return to his wife as soon as his duties were accomplished and in his absence mrs gibson kept herself a little aloof from the miss brownings and those of her acquaintance who would willingly have entered into conversation with her with the view of attaching herself to the skirts of the towers party when they should make their appearance if cynthia would not be so very ready in engaging herself to every possible partner who asked her to dance there were sure to be young men staying at the towers who would be on the lookout for pretty girls and who could tell to what a dance might lead molly too though not so good a dancer as cynthia and from her timidity less graceful and easy was becoming engaged pretty deeply and it must be confessed she was longing to dance every dance no matter with whom even she might not be available for the more aristocratic partners mrs gibson anticipated she was feeling very much annoyed with the whole proceedings of the evening when she was aware of some one standing by her and turning a little to one side she saw mr preston keeping guard as it were over the seats which molly and cynthia had just quitted he was looking so black that if their eyes had not met mrs gibson would have preferred not speaking to him as it was she thought it unavoidable the rooms are not welllighted tonight are they mr preston no said he but who could light such dingy old paint as this loaded with evergreens too which always darken a room and the company too i always think that freshness and brilliancy of dress go as far as anything to brighten up a room look what a set of people are here the greater part of the women are dressed in dark silks really only fit for a morning the place will be quite different byandby when the county families are in a little more force mr preston made no reply he had put his glass in his eye apparently for the purpose of watching the dancers if its exact direction could have been ascertained it would have been found that he was looking intently and angrily at a flying figure in pink muslin many a one was gazing at cynthia with intentness besides himself but no one in anger mrs gibson was not so fine an observer as to read all this but here was a gentlemanly and handsome young man to whom she could prattle instead of either joining herself on to objectionable people or sitting all forlorn until the towers party came so she went on with her small remarks you are not dancing mr preston no the partner i had engaged has made some mistake i am waiting to have an explanation with her mrs gibson was silent an uncomfortable tide of recollections appeared to come over her she like mr preston watched cynthia the dance was ended and she was walking round the room in easy unconcern as to what might await her presently her partner mr harry cholmley brought her back to her seat she took that vacant next to mr preston leaving the one by her mother for mollys occupation the latter returned a moment afterwards to her place cynthia seemed entirely unconscious of mr prestons neighbourhood mrs gibson leaned forwards and said to her daughter your last partner was a gentleman my dear you are improving in your selection i really was ashamed of you before figuring away with that attorneys clerk molly do you know whom you have been dancing with i have found out he is the coreham bookseller that accounts for his being so well up in all the books ive been wanting to hear about said molly eagerly but with a spice of malice in her mind he really was very pleasant mamma she added and he looks quite a gentleman and dances beautifully very well but remember if you go on this way you will have to shake hands over the counter tomorrow morning with some of your partners of tonight said mrs gibson coldly but i really dont know how to refuse when people are introduced to me and ask me and i am longing to dance you know tonight it is a charity ball and papa said everybody danced with everybody said molly in a pleading tone of voice for she could not quite thoroughly enjoy herself if she was out of harmony with any one what reply mrs gibson would have made to this speech cannot now be ascertained for before she could answer mr preston stepped a little forwards and said in a tone which he meant to be icily indifferent but which trembled with anger if miss gibson finds any difficulty in refusing a partner she has only to apply to miss kirkpatrick for instructions cynthia lifted up her beautiful eyes and fixing them on mr prestons face said very quietly as if only stating a matter of fact you forget i think mr preston miss gibson implied that she wished to dance with the person who asked herthat makes all the difference i cant instruct her how to act in that difficulty and to the rest of this little conversation cynthia appeared to lend no ear and she was almost directly claimed by her next partner mr preston took the seat now left empty much to mollys annoyance at first she feared lest he might be going to ask her to dance but instead he put out his hand for cynthias nosegay which she had left on rising entrusted to molly it had suffered considerably from the heat of the room and was no longer full and fresh not so much so as mollys which had not in the first instance been pulled to pieces in picking out the scarlet flowers which now adorned mollys hair and which had since been cherished with more care enough however remained of cynthias to show very distinctly that it was not the one mr preston had sent and it was perhaps to convince himself of this that he rudely asked to examine it but molly faithful to what she imagined would be cynthias wish refused to allow him to touch it she only held it a little nearer miss kirkpatrick has not done me the honour of wearing the bouquet i sent her i see she received it i suppose and my note yes said molly rather intimidated by the tone in which this was said but we had already accepted these two nosegays mrs gibson was just the person to come to the rescue with her honeyed words on such an occasion as the present she evidently was rather afraid of mr preston and wished to keep at peace with him oh yes we were so sorry of course i dont mean to say we could be sorry for any ones kindness but two such lovely nosegays had been sent from hamley hallyou may see how beautiful from what molly holds in her handand they had come before yours mr preston i should have felt honoured if you had accepted of mine since the young ladies were so well provided for i was at some pains in selecting the flowers at greens i think i may say it was rather more recherch than that of miss kirkpatricks which miss gibson holds so tenderly and securely in her hand oh because cynthia would take out the most effective flowers to put in my hair exclaimed molly eagerly did she said mr preston with a certain accent of pleasure in his voice as though he were glad she set so little store by the nosegay and he walked off to stand behind cynthia in the quadrille that was being danced and molly saw him making her reply to himagainst her will molly was sure but somehow his face and manner implied power over her she looked grave deaf indifferent indignant defiant but after a halfwhispered speech to cynthia at the conclusion of the dance she evidently threw him an impatient consent to what he was asking for he walked off with a disagreeable smile of satisfaction on his handsome face all this time the murmurs were spreading at the lateness of the party from the towers and person after person came up to mrs gibson as if she were the accredited authority as to the earl and countesss plans in one sense this was flattering but then the acknowledgment of common ignorance and wonder reduced her to the level of the inquirers mrs goodenough felt herself particularly aggrieved she had had her spectacles on for the last hour and a half in order to be ready for the sight the very first minute any one from the towers appeared at the door i had a headache she complained and i should have sent my money and never stirred out o doors tonight for ive seen a many of these here balls and my lord and my lady too when they were better worth looking at nor they are now but every one was talking of the duchess and the duchess and her diamonds and i thought i shouldnt like to be behindhand and never ha seen neither the duchess nor her diamonds so im here and coal and candlelight wasting away at home for i told sally to sit up for me and above everything i cannot abide waste i took it from my mother who was such a one against waste as you never see nowadays she was a manager if ever there was a one and brought up nine children on less than any one else could do ill be bound why she wouldnt let us be extravagantnot even in the matter of colds whenever any on us had got a pretty bad cold she took the opportunity and cut our hair for she said said she it was of no use having two colds when one would doand cutting of our hair was sure to give us a cold but for all that i wish the duchess would come ah but fancy what it is to me sighed out mrs gibson so long as i have been without seeing the dear familyand seeing so little of them the other day when i was at the towers for the duchess would have my opinion on lady alices trousseau and kept asking me so many questions it took up all the timeand lady harriets last words were a happy anticipation of our meeting tonight its nearly twelve oclock every one of any pretensions to gentility was painfully affected by the absence of the family from the towers the very fiddlers seemed unwilling to begin playing a dance that might be interrupted by the entrance of the great folks miss phoebe browning had apologized for themmiss browning had blamed them with calm dignity it was only the butchers and bakers and candlestickmakers who rather enjoyed the absence of restraint and were happy and hilarious at last there was a rumbling and a rushing and a whispering and the music stopped so the dancers were obliged to do so too and in came lord cumnor in his state dress with a fat middleaged woman on his arm she was dressed almost like a girlin a sprigged muslin with natural flowers in her hair but not a vestige of a jewel or a diamond yet it must be the duchess but what was a duchess without diamondsand in a dress which farmer hudsons daughter might have worn was it the duchess could it be the duchess the little crowd of inquirers around mrs gibson thickened to hear her confirm their disappointing surmise after the duchess came lady cumnor looking like lady macbeth in black velveta cloud upon her brow made more conspicuous by the lines of age rapidly gathering on her handsome face and lady harriet and other ladies amongst whom there was one dressed so like the duchess as to suggest the idea of a sister rather than a daughter as far as dress went there was lord hollingford plain in face awkward in person gentlemanly in manner and halfadozen younger men lord albert monson captain james and others of their age and standing who came in looking anything if not critical this longexpected party swept up to the seats reserved for them at the head of the room apparently regardless of the interruption they caused for the dancers stood aside and almost dispersed back to their seats and when moneymusk struck up again not half the former set of people stood up to finish the dance lady harriet who was rather different to miss piper and no more minded crossing the room alone than if the lookerson were so many cabbages spied the gibson party pretty quickly out and came across to them here we are at last how dye do dear why little one to molly how nice youre looking arent we shamefully late oh its only just past twelve said mrs gibson and i daresay you dined very late it wasnt that it was that illmannered woman who went to her own room after we came out from dinner and she and lady alice stayed there invisible till we thought they were putting on some splendid attireas they ought to have doneand at halfpast ten when mamma sent up to them to say the carriages were at the door the duchess sent down for some beeftea and at last appeared lenfant as you see her mamma is so angry with her and some of the others are annoyed at not coming earlier and one or two are giving themselves airs about coming at all papa is the only one who is not affected by it then turning to molly lady harriet asked have you been dancing much miss gibson yes not every dance but nearly all it was a simple question enough but lady harriets speaking at all to molly had become to mrs gibson almost like shaking a red rag at a bull it was the one thing sure to put her out of temper but she would not have shown this to lady harriet for the world only she contrived to baffle any endeavours at further conversation between the two by placing herself betwixt lady harriet and molly whom the former asked to sit down in the absent cynthias room i wont go back to those people i am so mad with them and besides i hardly saw you the other day and i must have some gossip with you so she sat down by mrs gibson and as mrs goodenough afterwards expressed it looked like anybody else mrs goodenough said this to excuse herself for a little misadventure she fell into she had taken a deliberate survey of the grandees at the upper end of the room spectacles on nose and had inquired in no very measured voice who everybody was from mr sheepshanks my lords agent and her very good neighbour who in vain tried to check her loud ardour for information by replying to her in whispers but she was rather deaf as well as blind so his low tones only brought upon him fresh inquiries now satisfied as far as she could be and on her way to departure and the extinguishing of fire and candlelight she stopped opposite to mrs gibson and thus addressed her by way of renewal of their former subject of conversation such a shabby thing for a duchess i never saw not a bit of a diamond near her theyre none of em worth looking at except the countess and shes always a personable woman and not so lusty as she was but theyre not worth waiting up for till this time o night there was a moments pause then lady harriet put her hand out and said you dont remember me but i know you from having seen you at the towers lady cumnor is a good deal thinner than she was but we hope her health is better for it its lady harriet said mrs gibson to mrs goodenough in reproachful dismay deary me your ladyship i hope ive given no offence but you seethat is to say your ladyship sees that its late hours for such folks as me and i only stayed out of my bed to see the duchess and i thought shed come in diamonds and a coronet and it puts one out at my age to be disappointed in the only chance im like to have of so fine a sight im put out too said lady harriet i wanted to have come early and here we are as late as this im so cross and illtempered i should be glad to hide myself in bed as soon as you will do she said this so sweetly that mrs goodenough relaxed into a smile and her crabbedness into a compliment i dont believe as ever your ladyship can be cross and illtempered with that pretty face im an old woman so you must let me say so lady harriet stood up and made a low curtsey then holding out her hand she said i wont keep you up any longer but ill promise one thing in return for your pretty speech if ever i am a duchess ill come and show myself to you in all my robes and gewgaws good night madam there i knew how it would be said she not resuming her seat and on the eve of a county election too oh you must not take old mrs goodenough as a specimen dear lady harriet she is always a grumbler i am sure no one else would complain of your all being as late as you liked said mrs gibson what do you say molly said lady harriet suddenly turning her eyes on mollys face dont you think weve lost some of our popularitywhich at this time means votesby coming so late come answer me you used to be a famous little truthteller i dont know about popularity or votes said molly rather unwillingly but i think many people were sorry you did not come sooner and isnt that rather a proof of popularity she added thats a very neat and diplomatic answer said lady harriet smiling and tapping mollys cheek with her fan molly knows nothing about it said mrs gibson a little off her guard it would be very impertinent if she or any one else questioned lady cumnors perfect right to come when she chose well all i know is i must go back to mamma now but i shall make another raid into these regions byandby and you must keep a place for me ah there aremiss brownings you see i dont forget my lesson miss gibson molly i cannot have you speaking so to lady harriet said mrs gibson as soon as she was left alone with her stepdaughter you would never have known her at all if it had not been for me and dont be always putting yourself into our conversation but i must speak if she asks me questions pleaded molly well if you must you must i acknowledge im candid about that at any rate but theres no need for you to set up to have an opinion at your age i dont know how to help it said molly shes such a whimsical person look there if shes not talking to miss phoebe and miss phoebe is so weak shell be easily led away into fancying she is hand and glove with lady harriet if there is one thing i hate more than another it is the trying to make out an intimacy with great people molly felt innocent enough so she offered no justification of herself and made no reply indeed she was more occupied in watching cynthia she could not understand the change that seemed to have come over her she was dancing it was true with the same lightness and grace as before but the smooth bounding motion as of a feather blown onwards by the wind was gone she was conversing with her partner but without the soft animation that usually shone out upon her countenance and when she was brought back to her seat molly noticed her changed colour and her dreamily abstracted eyes what is the matter cynthia asked she in a very low voice nothing said cynthia suddenly looking up and in an accent of what in her was sharpness why should there be i dont know but you look different to what you didtired or something theres nothing the matter or if there is dont talk about it its all your fancy this was a rather contradictory speech to be interpreted by intuition rather than by logic molly understood that cynthia wished for quietness and silence but what was her surprise after the speeches that had passed before and the implication of cynthias whole manner to mr preston to see him come up to her and without a word offer his arm and lead her away to dance it appeared to strike mrs gibson as something remarkable for forgetting her late passage at arms with molly she asked wonderingly as if almost distrusting the evidence of her senses is cynthia going to dance with mr preston molly had scarcely time to answer before she herself was led off by her partner she could hardly attend to him or to the figures of the quadrille for watching for cynthia among the moving forms once she caught a glimpse of her standing stilldowncastlistening to mr prestons eager speech again she was walking languidly among the dancers almost as if she took no notice of those around her when she and molly joined each other again the shade on cynthias face had deepened to gloom but at the same time if a physiognomist had studied her expression he would have read in it defiance and anger and perhaps also a little perplexity while this quadrille had been going on lady harriet had been speaking to her brother hollingford she said laying her hand on his arm and drawing him a little apart from the wellborn crowd amid which he stood silent and abstracted you dont know how these good people here have been hurt and disappointed with our being so late and with the duchesss ridiculous simplicity of dress why should they mind it asked he taking advantage of her being out of breath with eagerness oh dont be so wise and stupid dont you see were a show and a spectacleits like having a pantomime with harlequin and columbine in plain clothes i dont understand how he began then take it upon trust they really are a little disappointed whether they are logical or not in being so and we must try and make it up to them for one thing because i cant bear our vassals to look dissatisfied and disloyal and then theres the election in june i really would as soon be out of the house as in it nonsense it would grieve papa beyond measurebut theres no time to talk about that now you must go and dance with some of the townspeople and ill ask sheepshanks to introduce me to a respectable young farmer cant you get captain james to make himself useful there he goes with lady alice if i dont get him introduced to the ugliest tailors daughter i can find for the next dance she put her arm in her brothers as she spoke as if to lead him to some partner he resisted howeverresisted piteously pray dont harriet you know i cant dance i hate it i always did i dont know how to get through a quadrille its a country dance said she resolutely its all the same and what shall i say to my partner i havent a notion i shall have no subject in common speak of being disappointed theyll be ten times more disappointed when they find i can neither dance nor talk ill be merciful dont be so cowardly in their eyes a lord may dance like a bearas some lords not very far from me areif he likes and theyll take it for grace and you shall begin with molly gibson your friend the doctors daughter shes a good simple intelligent little girl which youll think a great deal more of i suppose than of the frivolous fact of her being very pretty clare will you allow me to introduce my brother to miss gibson he hopes to engage her for this dance lord hollingford miss gibson poor lord hollingford there was nothing for it but for him to follow his sisters very explicit lead and molly and he walked off to their places each heartily wishing their dance together well over lady harriet flew off to mr sheepshanks to secure her respectable young farmer and mrs gibson remained alone wishing that lady cumnor would send one of her attendant gentlemen for her it would be so much more agreeable to be sitting even at the fagend of nobility than here on a bench with everybody hoping that everybody would see molly dancing away with a lord yet vexed that the chance had so befallen that molly instead of cynthia was the young lady singled out wondering if simplicity of dress was now become the highest fashion and pondering on the possibility of cleverly inducing lady harriet to introduce lord albert monson to her own beautiful daughter cynthia molly found lord hollingford the wise and learned lord hollingford strangely stupid in understanding the mystery of cross hands and back again down the middle and up again he was constantly getting hold of the wrong hands and as constantly stopping when he had returned to his place quite unaware that the duties of society and the laws of the dance required that he should go on capering till he had arrived at the bottom of the room he perceived that he had performed his part very badly and apologized to molly when once they had arrived at that haven of comparative peace and he expressed his regret so simply and heartily that she felt at her ease with him at once especially when he confided to her his reluctance at having to dance at all and his only doing it under his sisters compulsion to molly he was an elderly widower almost as old as her father and byandby they got into very pleasant conversation she learnt from him that roger hamley had just been publishing a paper in some scientific periodical which had excited considerable attention as it was intended to confute some theory of a great french physiologist and rogers article proved the writer to be possessed of a most unusual amount of knowledge on the subject this piece of news was of great interest to molly and in her questions she herself evinced so much intelligence and a mind so well prepared for the reception of information that lord hollingford at any rate would have felt his quest of popularity a very easy affair indeed if he might have gone on talking quietly to molly during the rest of the evening when he took her back to her place he found mr gibson there and fell into talk with him until lady harriet once more came to stir him up to his duties before very long however he returned to mr gibsons side and began telling him of this paper of roger hamleys of which mr gibson had not yet heard in the midst of their conversation as they stood close by mrs gibson lord hollingford saw molly in the distance and interrupted himself to say what a charming little lady that daughter of yours is most girls of her age are so difficult to talk to but she is intelligent and full of interest in all sorts of sensible things well read tooshe was up in le rgne animaland very pretty mr gibson bowed much pleased at such a compliment from such a man were he lord or not it is very likely that if molly had been a stupid listener lord hollingford would not have discovered her beauty or the converse might be assertedif she had not been young and pretty he would not have exerted himself to talk on scientific subjects in a manner which she could understand but in whatever way molly had won his approbation and admiration there was no doubt that she had earned it somehow and when she next returned to her place mrs gibson greeted her with soft words and a gracious smile for it does not require much reasoning power to discover that if it is a very fine thing to be motherinlaw to a very magnificent threetailed bashaw it presupposes that the wife who makes the connection between the two parties is in harmony with her mother and so far had mrs gibsons thoughts wandered into futurity she only wished that the happy chance had fallen to cynthias instead of to mollys lot but molly was a docile sweet creature very pretty and remarkably intelligent as my lord had said it was a pity that cynthia preferred making millinery to reading but perhaps that could be rectified and there was lord cumnor coming to speak to her and lady cumnor nodding to her and indicating a place by her side it was not an unsatisfactory ball upon the whole to mrs gibson although she paid the usual penalty for sitting up beyond her ordinary hour in perpetual glare and movement the next morning she awoke irritable and fatigued and a little of the same feeling oppressed both cynthia and molly the former was lounging in the windowseat holding a threedaysold newspaper in her hand which she was making a pretence of reading when she was startled by her mothers saying cynthia cant you take up a book and improve yourself i am sure your conversation will never be worth listening to unless you read something better than newspapers why dont you keep up your french there was some french book that molly was readingle rgne animal i think no i never read it said molly blushing mr roger hamley sometimes read pieces out of it when i was first at the hall and told me what it was about oh well then i suppose i was mistaken but it comes to all the same thing cynthia you really must learn to settle yourself to some improving reading every morning rather to mollys surprise cynthia did not reply a word but dutifully went and brought down from among her boulogne schoolbooks le sicle de louis xiv but after a while molly saw that this improving reading was just as much a mere excuse for cynthias thinking her own thoughts as the newspaper had been chapter xxvii father and sons illustration untitled things were not going on any better at hamley hall nothing had occurred to change the state of dissatisfied feeling into which the squire and his eldest son had respectively fallen and the long continuance merely of dissatisfaction is sure of itself to deepen the feeling roger did all in his power to bring the father and son together but sometimes wondered if it would not have been better to leave them alone for they were falling into the habit of each making him their confidant and so defining emotions and opinions which would have had less distinctness if they had been unexpressed there was little enough relief in the daily life at the hall to help them all to shake off the gloom and it even told on the health of both the squire and osborne the squire became thinner his skin as well as his clothes began to hang loose about him and the freshness of his colour turned to red streaks till his cheeks looked like eardiston pippins instead of resembling a katherine pear on the side thats next the sun roger thought that his father sate indoors and smoked in his study more than was good for him but it had become difficult to get him far afield he was too much afraid of coming across some sign of the discontinued drainage works or being irritated afresh by the sight of his depreciated timber osborne was wrapt up in the idea of arranging his poems for the press and so working out his wish for independence what with daily writing to his wifetaking his letters himself to a distant postoffice and receiving hers theretouching up his sonnets c with fastidious careand occasionally giving himself the pleasure of a visit to the gibsons and enjoying the society of the two pleasant girls there he found little time for being with his father indeed osborne was too selfindulgent or sensitive as he termed it to bear well with the squires gloomy fits or too frequent querulousness the consciousness of his secret too made osborne uncomfortable in his fathers presence it was very well for all parties that roger was not sensitive for if he had been there were times when it would have been hard to bear little spurts of domestic tyranny by which his father strove to assert his power over both his sons one of these occurred very soon after the night of the hollingford charityball roger had induced his father to come out with him and the squire had on his sons suggestion taken with him his long unused spud the two had wandered far afield perhaps the elder man had found the unwonted length of exercise too much for him for as he approached the house on his return he became what nurses call in children fractious and ready to turn on his companion for every remark he made roger understood the case by instinct as it were and bore it all with his usual sweetness of temper they entered the house by the front door it lay straight on their line of march on the old cracked yellowmarble slab there lay a card with lord hollingfords name on it which robinson evidently on the watch for their return hastened out of his pantry to deliver to roger his lordship was very sorry not to see you mr roger and his lordship left a note for you mr osborne took it i think when he passed through i asked his lordship if he would like to see mr osborne who was indoors as i thought but his lordship said he was pressed for time and told me to make his excuses didnt he ask for me growled the squire no sir i cant say as his lordship did he would never have thought of mr osborne sir if i hadnt named him it was mr roger he seemed so keen after very odd said the squire roger said nothing although he naturally felt some curiosity he went into the drawingroom not quite aware that his father was following him osborne sate at a table near the fire pen in hand looking over one of his poems and dotting the is crossing the ts and now and then pausing over the alteration of a word oh roger he said as his brother came in heres been lord hollingford wanting to see you i know replied roger and hes left a note for you robinson tried to persuade him it was for my father so hes added a junior roger hamley esq junior in pencil the squire was in the room by this time and what he had overheard rubbed him up still more the wrong way roger took his unopened note and read it what does he say asked the squire roger handed him the note it contained an invitation to dinner to meet m geoffroi st h whose views on certain subjects roger had been advocating in the article lord hollingford had spoken about to molly when he danced with her at the hollingford ball m geoffroi st h was in england now and was expected to pay a visit at the towers in the course of the following week he had expressed a wish to meet the author of the paper which had already attracted the attention of the french comparative anatomists and lord hollingford added a few words as to his own desire to make the acquaintance of a neighbour whose tastes were so similar to his own and then followed a civil message from lord and lady cumnor lord hollingfords hand was cramped and rather illegible the squire could not read it all at once and was enough put out to decline any assistance in deciphering it at last he made it out so my lord lieutenant is taking some notice of the hamleys at last the election is coming on is it but i can tell him were not to be got so easily i suppose this trap is set for you osborne whats this youve been writing that the french mounseer is so taken with it is not me sir said osborne both note and call are for roger i dont understand it said the squire these whig fellows have never done their duty by me not that i want it of them the duke of debenham used to pay the hamleys a respect due to emthe oldest landowners in the countybut since he died and this shabby whig lord has succeeded him ive never dined at the lord lieutenantsno not once but i think sir ive heard you say lord cumnor used to invite youonly you did not choose to go said roger yes what dye mean by that do you suppose i was going to desert the principles of my family and curry favour with the whigs no leave that to them they can ask the heir of the hamleys fast enough when a county election is coming on i tell you sir said osborne in the irritable tone he sometimes used when his father was particularly unreasonable it is not me lord hollingford is inviting it is roger roger is making himself known for what he is a firstrate fellow continued osbornea sting of selfreproach mingling with his generous pride in his brotherand hes getting himself a name hes been writing about these new french theories and discoveries and this foreign savant very naturally wants to make his acquaintance and so lord hollingford asks him to dine its as clear as can be lowering his tone and addressing himself to roger it has nothing to do with politics if my father would but see it of course the squire heard this little aside with the unlucky uncertainty of hearing which is a characteristic of the beginning of deafness and its effect on him was perceptible in the increased acrimony of his next speech you young men think you know everything i tell you its a palpable whig trick and what business has rogerif it is roger the man wantsto go currying favour with the french in my day we were content to hate em and to lick em but its just like your conceit osborne setting yourself up to say its your younger brother theyre asking and not you i tell you its you they think the eldest son was sure to be called after his father rogerroger hamley junior its as plain as a pikestaff they know they cant catch me with chaff but theyve got up this french dodge what business had you to go writing about the french roger i should have thought you were too sensible to take any notice of their fancies and theories but if it is you theyve asked ill not have you going and meeting these foreigners at a whig house they ought to have asked osborne hes the representative of the hamleys if im not and they cant get me let em try ever so besides osborne has got a bit of the mounseer about him which he caught with being so fond of going off to the continent instead of coming back to his good old english home he went on repeating much of what he had said before till he left the room osborne had kept on replying to his unreasonable grumblings which had only added to his anger and as soon as the squire was fairly gone osborne turned to roger and said of course youll go roger ten to one hell be in another mind tomorrow no said roger bluntly enoughfor he was extremely disappointed i wont run the chance of vexing him i shall refuse dont be such a fool exclaimed osborne really my father is too unreasonable you heard how he kept contradicting himself and such a man as you to be kept under like a child by dont let us talk any more about it osborne said roger writing away fast when the note was written and sent off he came and put his hand caressingly on osbornes shoulder as he sate pretending to read but in reality vexed with both his father and his brother though on very different grounds how go the poems old fellow i hope theyre nearly ready to bring out no theyre not and if it werent for the money i shouldnt care if they were never published whats the use of fame if one maynt reap the fruits of it come now well have no more of that lets talk about the money i shall be going up for my fellowship examination next week and then well have a purse in common for theyll never think of not giving me a fellowship now im senior wrangler im short enough myself at present and i dont like to bother my father but when im fellow you shall take me down to winchester and introduce me to the little wife it will be a month next monday since i left her said osborne laying down his papers and gazing into the fire as if by so doing he could call up her image in her letter this morning she bids me give you such a pretty message it wont bear translating into english you must read it for yourself continued he pointing out a line or two in a letter he drew from his pocket roger suspected that one or two of the words were wrongly spelt but their purport was so gentle and loving and had such a touch of simple respectful gratitude in them that he could not help being drawn afresh to the little unseen sisterinlaw whose acquaintance osborne had made by helping her to look for some missing article of the childrens whom she was taking for their daily walk in hyde park for mrs osborne hamley had been nothing more than a french bonne very pretty very graceful and very much tyrannized over by the rough little boys and girls she had in charge she was a little orphan girl who had charmed the heads of a travelling english family as she had brought madame some articles of lingerie at an hotel and she had been hastily engaged by them as bonne to their children partly as a pet and plaything herself partly because it would be so good for the children to learn french from a native of alsace byandby her mistress ceased to take any particular notice of aime in the bustle of london and london gaiety but though feeling more and more forlorn in a strange land every day the french girl strove hard to do her duty one touch of kindness however was enough to set the fountain gushing and she and osborne naturally fell into an ideal state of love to be rudely disturbed by the indignation of the mother when accident discovered to her the attachment existing between her childrens bonne and a young man of an entirely different class aime answered truly to all her mistresss questions but no worldly wisdom nor any lesson to be learnt from anothers experience could in the least disturb her entire faith in her lover perhaps mrs townshend did no more than her duty in immediately sending aime back to metz where she had first met with her and where such relations as remained to the girl might be supposed to be residing but altogether she knew so little of the kind of people or life to which she was consigning her deposed protge that osborne after listening with impatient indignation to the lecture which mrs townshend gave him when he insisted on seeing her in order to learn what had become of his love that the young man set off straight for metz in hot haste and did not let the grass grow under his feet until he had made aime his wife all this had occurred the previous autumn and roger did not know of the step his brother had taken until it was irrevocable then came the mothers death which besides the simplicity of its own overwhelming sorrow brought with it the loss of the kind tender mediatrix who could always soften and turn his fathers heart it is doubtful however if even she could have succeeded in this for the squire looked high and over high for the wife of his heir he detested all foreigners and overmore held all roman catholics in dread and abomination something akin to our ancestors hatred of witchcraft all these prejudices were strengthened by his grief argument would always have glanced harmless away off his shield of utter unreason but a loving impulse in a happy moment might have softened his heart to what he most detested in the former days but the happy moments came not now and the loving impulses were trodden down by the bitterness of his frequent remorse not less than by his growing irritability so aime lived solitary in the little cottage near winchester in which osborne had installed her when she first came to england as his wife and in the dainty furnishing of which he had run himself so deeply into debt for osborne consulted his own fastidious taste in his purchases rather than her simple childlike wishes and wants and looked upon the little frenchwoman rather as the future mistress of hamley hall than as the wife of a man who was wholly dependent on others at present he had chosen a southern county as being far removed from those midland shires where the name of hamley of hamley was well and widely known for he did not wish his wife to assume if only for a time a name which was not justly and legally her own in all these arrangements he had willingly striven to do his full duty by her and she repaid him with passionate devotion and admiring reverence if his vanity had met with a check or his worthy desires for college honours had been disappointed he knew where to go for a comforter one who poured out praise till her words were choked in her throat by the rapidity of her thoughts and who poured out the small vials of her indignation on every one who did not acknowledge and bow down to her husbands merits if she ever wished to go to the chteauthat was his homeand to be introduced to his family aime never hinted a word of it to him only she did yearn and she did plead for a little more of her husbands company and the good reasons which had convinced her of the necessity of his being so much away when he was present to urge them failed in their efficacy when she tried to reproduce them to herself in his absence the afternoon of the day on which lord hollingford called roger was going upstairs three steps at a time when at a turn on the landing he encountered his father it was the first time he had seen him since their conversation about the towers invitation to dinner the squire stopped his son by standing right in the middle of the passage thourt going to meet the mounseer my lad said he half as affirmation half as question no sir i sent off james almost immediately with a note declining it i dont care about itthats to say not to signify why did you take me up so sharp roger said his father pettishly you all take me up so hastily nowadays i think its hard when a man mustnt be allowed a bit of crossness when hes tired and heavy at heartthat i do but father i should never like to go to a house where they had slighted you nay nay lad said the squire brightening up a little i think i slighted them they asked me to dinner after my lord was made lieutenant time after time but i never would go near em i call that my slighting them and no more was said at the time but the next day the squire again stopped roger ive been making jem try on his liverycoat that he hasnt worn this three or four yearshes got too stout for it now well he neednt wear it need he and morgans lad will be glad enough of ithes sadly in want of clothes ay ay but whos to go with you when you call at the towers its but polite to call after lord whatshisname has taken the trouble to come here and i shouldnt like you to go without a groom my dear father i shouldnt know what to do with a man riding at my back i can find my way to the stableyard for myself or therell be some man about to take my horse dont trouble yourself about that well youre not osborne to be sure perhaps it wont strike em as strange for you but you must look up and hold your own and remember youre one of the hamleys whove been on the same land for hundreds of years while theyre but trumpery whig folk who only came into the county in queen annes time chapter xxviii rivalry for some days after the ball cynthia seemed languid and was very silent molly who had promised herself fully as much enjoyment in talking over the past gaiety with cynthia as in the evening itself was disappointed when she found that all conversation on the subject was rather evaded than encouraged mrs gibson it is true was ready to go over the ground as many times as any one liked but her words were always like readymade clothes and never fitted individual thoughts anybody might have used them and with a change of proper names they might have served to describe any ball she repeatedly used the same language in speaking about it till molly knew the sentences and their sequence even to irritation ah mr osborne you should have been there i said to myself many a time how you really should have been thereyou and your brother of course i thought of you very often during the evening did you now that i call very kind of you cynthia darling do you hear what mr osborne hamley was saying as cynthia came into the room just then he thought of us all on the evening of the ball he did better than merely remember us then said cynthia with her soft slow smile we owe him thanks for those beautiful flowers mamma oh said osborne you must not thank me exclusively i believe it was my thought but roger took all the trouble of it i consider the thought as everything said mrs gibson thought is spiritual while action is merely material this fine sentence took the speaker herself by surprise and in such conversation as was then going on it is not necessary to accurately define the meaning of everything that is said im afraid the flowers were too late to be of much use though continued osborne i met preston the next morning and of course we talked about the ball i was sorry to find he had been beforehand with us he only sent one nosegay and that was for cynthia said molly looking up from her work and it did not come till after we had received the flowers from hamley molly caught a sight of cynthias face before she bent down again to her sewing it was scarlet in colour and there was a flash of anger in her eyes both she and her mother hastened to speak as soon as molly had finished but cynthias voice was choked with passion and mrs gibson had the word mr prestons bouquet was just one of those formal affairs any one can buy at a nurserygarden which always strike me as having no sentiment in them i would far rather have two or three lilies of the valley gathered for me by a person i like than the most expensive bouquet that could be bought mr preston had no business to speak as if he had forestalled you said cynthia it came just as we were ready to go and i put it into the fire directly cynthia my dear love said mrs gibson who had never heard of the fate of the flowers until now what an idea of yourself you will give to mr osborne hamley but to be sure i can quite understand it you inherit my feelingmy prejudicesentimental i grant against bought flowers cynthia was silent for a moment then she said i used some of your flowers mr hamley to dress mollys hair it was a great temptation for the colour so exactly matched her coral ornaments but i believe she thought it treacherous to disturb the arrangement so i ought to take all the blame on myself the arrangement was my brothers as i told you but i am sure he would have preferred seeing them in miss gibsons hair rather than in the blazing fire mr preston comes far the worst off osborne was rather amused at the whole affair and would have liked to probe cynthias motives a little farther he did not hear molly saying in as soft a voice as if she were talking to herself i wore mine just as they were sent for mrs gibson came in with a total change of subject speaking of lilies of the valley is it true that they grow wild in hurst wood it is not the season for them to be in flower yet but when it is i think we must take a walk therewith our luncheon in a basketa little picnic in fact youll join us wont you turning to osborne i think its a charming plan you could ride to hollingford and put up your horse here and we could have a long day in the woods and all come home to dinnerdinner with a basket of lilies in the middle of the table i should like it very much said osborne but i may not be at home roger is more likely to be here i believe at that timea month hence he was thinking of the visit to london to sell his poems and the run down to winchester which he anticipated afterwardsthe end of may had been the period fixed for this pleasure for some time not merely in his own mind but in writing to his wife oh but you must be with us we must wait for mr osborne hamley must not we cynthia im afraid the lilies wont wait replied cynthia well then we must put it off till dogrose and honeysuckle time you will be at home then wont you or does the london season present too many attractions i dont exactly know when dogroses are in flower not know and you a poet dont you remember the lines it was the time of roses we plucked them as we passed yes but that doesnt specify the time of year that is the time of roses and i believe my movements are guided more by the lunar calendar than the floral you had better take my brother for your companion he is practical in his love of flowers i am only theoretical does that fine word theoretical imply that you are ignorant asked cynthia of course we shall be happy to see your brother but why cant we have you too i confess to a little timidity in the presence of one so deep and learned as your brother is from all accounts give me a little charming ignorance if we must call it by that hard word osborne bowed it was very pleasant to him to be petted and flattered even though he knew all the time that it was only flattery it was an agreeable contrast to the home that was so dismal to him to come to this house where the society of two agreeable girls and the soothing syrup of their mothers speeches awaited him whenever he liked to come to say nothing of the difference that struck upon his senses poetical though he might esteem himself of a sittingroom full of flowers and tokens of womens presence where all the chairs were easy and all the tables well covered with pretty things to the great drawingroom at home where the draperies were threadbare and the seats uncomfortable and no sign of feminine presence ever now lent a grace to the stiff arrangement of the furniture then the meals light and wellcooked suited his taste and delicate appetite so much better than the rich and heavy viands prepared by the servants at the hall osborne was becoming a little afraid of falling into the habit of paying too frequent visits to the gibsons and that not because he feared the consequences of his intercourse with the two young ladies for he never thought of them excepting as friendsthe fact of his marriage was constantly present to his mind and aime too securely enthroned in his heart for him to remember that he might be looked upon by others in the light of a possible husband but the reflection forced itself upon him occasionally whether he was not trespassing too often on hospitality which he had at present no means of returning but mrs gibson in her ignorance of the true state of affairs was secretly exultant in the attraction which made him come so often and lounge away the hours in her house and garden she had no doubt that it was cynthia who drew him thither and if the latter had been a little more amenable to reason her mother would have made more frequent allusions than she did to the crisis which she thought was approaching but she was restrained by the intuitive conviction that if her daughter became conscious of what was impending and was made aware of mrs gibsons cautious and quiet efforts to forward the catastrophe the wilful girl would oppose herself to it with all her skill and power as it was mrs gibson trusted that cynthias affections would become engaged before she knew where she was and that in that case she would not attempt to frustrate her mothers delicate scheming even though she did perceive it but cynthia had come across too many varieties of flirtation admiration and even passionate love to be for a moment at fault as to the quiet friendly nature of osbornes attentions she received him always as a sister might a brother it was different when roger returned from his election as fellow of trinity the trembling diffidence the hardly suppressed ardour of his manner made cynthia understand before long with what kind of love she had now to deal she did not put it into so many wordsno not even in her secret heartbut she recognized the difference between rogers relation to her and osbornes long before mrs gibson found it out molly was however the first to discover the nature of rogers attention the first time they saw him after the ball it came out to her observant eyes cynthia had not been looking well since that evening she went slowly about the house pale and heavyeyed and fond as she usually was of exercise and the free fresh air there was hardly any persuading her now to go out for a walk molly watched this fading with tender anxiety but to all her questions as to whether she had felt overfatigued with her dancing whether anything had occurred to annoy her and all such inquiries she replied in languid negatives once molly touched on mr prestons name and found that this was a subject on which cynthia was raw now cynthias face lighted up with spirit and her whole body showed her illrepressed agitation but she only said a few sharp words expressive of anything but kindly feeling towards the gentleman and then bade molly never name his name to her again still the latter could not imagine that he was more than intensely distasteful to her friend as well as to herself he could not be the cause of cynthias present indisposition but this indisposition lasted so many days without change or modification that even mrs gibson noticed it and molly became positively uneasy mrs gibson considered cynthias quietness and languor as the natural consequence of dancing with everybody who asked her at the ball partners whose names were in the red book would not have produced half the amount of fatigue according to mrs gibsons judgment apparently and if cynthia had been quite well very probably she would have hit the blot in her mothers speech with one of her touches of sarcasm then again when cynthia did not rally mrs gibson grew impatient and accused her of being fanciful and lazy at length and partly at mollys instance there came an appeal to mr gibson and a professional examination of the supposed invalid which cynthia hated more than anything especially when the verdict was that there was nothing very much the matter only a general lowness of tone and depression of health and spirits which would soon be remedied by tonics and meanwhile she was not to be roused to exertion if there is one thing i dislike said cynthia to mr gibson after he had pronounced tonics to be the cure for her present state it is the way doctors have of giving tablespoonfuls of nauseous mixtures as a certain remedy for sorrows and cares she laughed up in his face as she spoke she had always a pretty word and smile for him even in the midst of her loss of spirits come you acknowledge you have sorrows by that speech well make a bargain if youll tell me your sorrows and cares ill try and find some other remedy for them than giving you what you are pleased to term my nauseous mixtures no said cynthia colouring i never said i had sorrows and cares i spoke generally what should i have a sorrow aboutyou and molly are only too kind to me her eyes filling with tears well well well not talk of such gloomy things and you shall have some sweet emulsion to disguise the taste of the bitters i shall be obliged to fall back upon please dont if you but knew how i dislike emulsions and disguises i do want bittersand if i sometimesif im obliged toif im not truthful myself i do like truth in othersat least sometimes she ended her sentence with another smile but it was rather faint and watery now the first person out of the house to notice cynthias change of look and manner was roger hamleyand yet he did not see her until under the influence of the nauseous mixture she was beginning to recover but his eyes were scarcely off her during the first five minutes he was in the room all the time he was trying to talk to mrs gibson in reply to her civil platitudes he was studying cynthia and at the first convenient pause he came and stood before molly so as to interpose his person between her and the rest of the room for some visitors had come in subsequent to his entrance molly how ill your sister is looking what is it has she had advice you must forgive me but so often those who live together in the same house dont observe the first approaches of illness now mollys love for cynthia was fast and unwavering but if anything tried it it was the habit roger had fallen into of always calling cynthia mollys sister in speaking to the latter from any one else it would have been a matter of indifference to her and hardly to be noticed it vexed both ear and heart when roger used the expression and there was a curtness of manner as well as of words in her reply oh she was overtired by the ball papa has seen her and says she will be all right very soon i wonder if she wants change of air said roger meditatively i wishi do wish we could have her at the hall you and your mother too of course but i dont see how it would be possibleor else how charming it would be molly felt as if a visit to the hall under such circumstances would be altogether so different an affair to all her former ones that she could hardly tell if she should like it or not roger went on you got our flowers in time did you not ah you dont know how often i thought of you that evening and you enjoyed it too didnt youyou had plenty of agreeable partners and all that makes a first ball delightful i heard that your sister danced every dance it was very pleasant said molly quietly but after all im not sure if i want to go to another just yet there seems to be so much trouble connected with a ball ah you are thinking of your sister and her not being well no i was not said molly rather bluntly i was thinking of the dress and the dressing and the weariness the next day he might think her unfeeling if he liked she felt as if she had only too much feeling just then for it was bringing on her a strange contraction of heart but he was too inherently good himself to put any harsh construction on her speech just before he went away while he was ostensibly holding her hand and wishing her goodby he said to her in a voice too low to be generally heard is there anything i could do for your sister we have plenty of books as you know if she cares for reading then receiving no affirmative look or word from molly in reply to this suggestion he went onor flowers she likes flowers oh and our forced strawberries are just readyi will bring some over tomorrow i am sure she will like them said molly for some reason or other unknown to the gibsons a longer interval than usual occurred between osbornes visits while roger came almost every day always with some fresh offering by which he openly sought to relieve cynthias indisposition as far as it lay in his power her manner to him was so gentle and gracious that mrs gibson became alarmed lest in spite of his uncouthness as she was pleased to term it he might come to be preferred to osborne who was so strangely neglecting his own interests in mrs gibsons opinion in her quiet way she contrived to pass many slights upon roger but the darts rebounded from his generous nature that could not have imagined her motives and fastened themselves on molly she had often been called naughty and passionate when she was a child and she thought now that she began to understand that she really had a violent temper what seemed neither to hurt roger nor annoy cynthia made mollys blood boil and now she had once discovered mrs gibsons wish to make rogers visits shorter and less frequent she was always on the watch for indications of this desire she read her stepmothers heart when the latter made allusions to the squires loneliness now that osborne was absent from the hall and that roger was so often away amongst his friends during the day mr gibson and i should be so delighted if you could have stopped to dinner but of course we cannot be so selfish as to ask you to stay when we remember how your father would be left alone we were saying yesterday we wondered how he bore his solitude poor old gentleman or as soon as roger came with his bunch of early roses it was desirable for cynthia to go and rest in her own room while molly had to accompany mrs gibson on some improvised errand or call still roger whose object was to give pleasure to cynthia and who had from his boyhood been always certain of mr gibsons friendly regard was slow to perceive that he was not wanted if he did not see cynthia that was his loss at any rate he heard how she was and left her some little thing which he believed she would like and was willing to risk the chance of his own gratification by calling four or five times in the hope of seeing her once at last there came a day when mrs gibson went beyond her usual negative snubbiness and when in some unwonted fit of crossness for she was a very placidtempered person in general she was guilty of positive rudeness cynthia was very much better tonics had ministered to a mind diseased though she hated to acknowledge it her pretty bloom and much of her lightheartedness had come back and there was no cause remaining for anxiety mrs gibson was sitting at her embroidery in the drawingroom and the two girls were at the window cynthia laughing at mollys earnest endeavours to imitate the french accent in which the former had been reading a page of voltaire for the duty or the farce of settling to improving reading in the mornings was still kept up although lord hollingford the unconscious suggestor of the idea had gone back to town without making any of the efforts to see molly again that mrs gibson had anticipated on the night of the ball that alnaschar vision had fallen to the ground it was as yet early morning a delicious fresh lovely june day the air redolent with the scents of flowergrowth and bloom and half the time the girls had been ostensibly employed in the french reading they had been leaning out of the open window trying to reach a cluster of climbing roses they had secured them at last and the buds lay on cynthias lap but many of the petals had fallen off so though the perfume lingered about the windowseat the full beauty of the flowers had passed away mrs gibson had once or twice reproved them for the merry noise they were making which hindered her in the business of counting the stitches in her pattern and she had set herself a certain quantity to do that morning before going out and was of that nature which attaches infinite importance to fulfilling small resolutions made about indifferent trifles without any reason whatever mr roger hamley was announced so tiresome said mrs gibson almost in his hearing as she pushed away her embroidery frame she put out her cold motionless hand to him with a halfmurmured word of welcome still eyeing her lost embroidery he took no apparent notice and passed on to the window how delicious said he no need for any more hamley roses now yours are out i agree with you said mrs gibson replying to him before either cynthia or molly could speak though he addressed his words to them you have been very kind in bringing us flowers so long but now our own are out we need not trouble you any more he looked at her with a little surprise clouding his honest face it was perhaps more at the tone than the words mrs gibson however had been bold enough to strike the first blow and she determined to go on as opportunity offered molly would perhaps have been more pained if she had not seen cynthias colour rise she waited for her to speak if need were for she knew that rogers defence if defence were required might be safely entrusted to cynthias ready wit he put out his hand for the shattered cluster of roses that lay in cynthias lap at any rate said he my troubleif mrs gibson considers it has been a trouble to mewill be overpaid if i may have this old lamps for new said cynthia smiling as she gave it to him i wish one could always buy nosegays such as you have brought us as cheaply you forget the waste of time that i think we must reckon as part of the payment said her mother really mr hamley we must learn to shut our doors on you if you come so often and at such early hours i settle myself to my own employment regularly after breakfast till lunchtime and it is my wish to keep cynthia and molly to a course of improving reading and studyso desirable for young people of their age if they are ever to become intelligent companionable women but with early visitors it is quite impossible to observe any regularity of habits all this was said in that sweet false tone which of late had gone through molly like the scraping of a slatepencil on a slate rogers face changed his ruddy colour grew paler for a moment and he looked grave and not pleased in another moment the wonted frankness of expression returned why should not he he asked himself believe her it was early to call it did interrupt regular occupation so he spoke and said i believe i have been very thoughtlessill not come so early again but i had some excuse today my brother told me you had made a plan for going to see hurst wood when the roses were out and they are earlier than usual this yearive been round to see he spoke of a long day there going before lunch the plan was made with mr osborne hamley i could not think of going without him said mrs gibson coldly i had a letter from him this morning in which he named your wish and he says he fears he cannot be at home till they are out of flower i daresay they are not much to see in reality but the day is so lovely i thought that the plan of going to hurst wood would be a charming excuse for being out of doors thank you how kind you are and so good too in sacrificing your natural desire to be with your father as much as possible im glad to say my father is so much better than he was in the winter that he spends much of his time out of doors in his fields he has been accustomed to go about alone and iwe think that as great a return to his former habits as he can be induced to make is the best for him and when do you return to cambridge there was some hesitation in rogers manner as he replied it is uncertain you probably know that i am a fellow of trinity now i hardly yet know what my future plans may be i am thinking of going up to london soon ah london is the true place for a young man said mrs gibson with decision as if she had reflected a good deal on the question if it were not that we really are so busy this morning i should have been tempted to make an exception to our general rule one more exception for your early visits have made us make too many already perhaps however we may see you again before you go certainly i shall come replied he rising to take his leave and still holding the demolished roses in his hand then addressing himself more especially to cynthia he added my stay in london will not exceed a fortnight or sois there anything i can do for youor you turning a little to molly no thank you very much said cynthia very sweetly and then acting on a sudden impulse she leant out of the window and gathered him some halfopened roses you deserve these do throw that poor shabby bunch away his eyes brightened his cheeks glowed he took the offered buds but did not throw away the other bunch at any rate i may come after lunch is over and the afternoons and evenings will be the most delicious time of day a month hence he said this to both molly and cynthia but in his heart he addressed it to the latter mrs gibson affected not to hear what he was saying but held out her limp hand once more to him i suppose we shall see you when you return and pray tell your brother how we are longing to have a visit from him again when he had left the room mollys heart was quite full she had watched his face and read something of his feelings his disappointment at their nonacquiescence in his plan of a days pleasure in hurst wood the delayed conviction that his presence was not welcome to the wife of his old friend which had come so slowly upon himperhaps after all these things touched molly more keenly than they did him his bright look when cynthia gave him the rosebuds indicated a gush of sudden delight more vivid than the pain he had shown by his previous increase of gravity i cant think why he will come at such untimely hours said mrs gibson as soon as she heard him fairly out of the house its different from osborne we are so much more intimate with him he came and made friends with us all the time this stupid brother of his was muddling his brains with mathematics at cambridge fellow of trinity indeed i wish he would learn to stay there and not come intruding here and assuming that because i asked osborne to join in a picnic it was all the same to me which brother came in short mamma one man may steal a horse but another must not look over the hedge said cynthia pouting a little and the two brothers have always been treated so exactly alike by their friends and there has been such a strong friendship between them that it is no wonder roger thinks he may be welcome where osborne is allowed to come at all hours continued molly in high dudgeon rogers muddled brains indeed roger stupid oh very well my dears when i was young it wouldnt have been thought becoming for girls of your age to fly out because a little restraint was exercised as to the hours at which they should receive the young mens calls and they would have supposed that there might be good reasons why their parents disapproved of the visits of certain gentlemen even while they were proud and pleased to see some members of the same family but that was what i said mamma said cynthia looking at her mother with an expression of innocent bewilderment on her face one man may be quiet child all proverbs are vulgar and i do believe that is the vulgarest of all you are really catching roger hamleys coarseness cynthia mamma said cynthia roused to anger i dont mind your abusing me but mr roger hamley has been very kind to me while ive not been well i cant bear to hear him disparaged if hes coarse ive no objection to be coarse as well for it seems to me it must mean kindliness and pleasantness and the bringing of pretty flowers and presents mollys tears were brimming over at these words she could have kissed cynthia for her warm partisanship but afraid of betraying emotion and making a scene as mrs gibson called any signs of warm feeling she laid down her book hastily and ran upstairs to her room and locked the door in order to breathe freely there were traces of tears upon her face when she returned into the drawingroom halfanhour afterwards walking straight and demurely up to her former place where cynthia still sate and gazed idly out of the window pouting and displeased mrs gibson meanwhile counting her stitches aloud with great distinctness and vigour chapter xxix bushfighting during all the months that had elapsed since mrs hamleys death molly had wondered many a time about the secret she had so unwittingly become possessed of that last day in the hall library it seemed so utterly strange and unheardof a thing to her inexperienced mind that a man should be married and yet not live with his wifethat a son should have entered into the holy state of matrimony without his fathers knowledge and without being recognized as the husband of some one known or unknown by all those with whom he came in daily contact that she felt occasionally as if that little ten minutes of revelation must have been a vision in a dream roger had only slightly referred to it once and osborne had kept entire silence on the subject ever since not even a look or a pause betrayed any allusion to it it even seemed to have passed out of their thoughts there had been the great sad event of their mothers death to fill their minds on the next occasion of their meeting molly and since then long pauses of intercourse had taken place so that she sometimes felt as if both the brothers must have forgotten how she had come to know their important secret she even found herself often entirely forgetting it but perhaps the consciousness of it was present to her unawares and enabled her to comprehend the real nature of osbornes feelings towards cynthia at any rate she never for a moment had supposed that his gentle kind manner towards cynthia was anything but the courtesy of a friend strange to say in these latter days molly had looked upon osbornes relation to herself as pretty much the same as that in which at one time she had regarded rogers and she thought of the former as of some one as nearly a brother both to cynthia and herself as any young man could well be whom they had not known in childhood and who was in nowise related to them she thought that he was very much improved in manner and probably in character by his mothers death he was no longer sarcastic or fastidious or vain or selfconfident she did not know how often all these styles of talk or of behaviour were put on to conceal shyness or consciousness and to veil the real self from strangers osbornes conversation and ways might very possibly have been just the same as before had he been thrown amongst new people but molly only saw him in their own circle in which he was on terms of decided intimacy still there was no doubt that he was really improved though perhaps not to the extent for which molly gave him credit and this exaggeration on her part arose very naturally from the fact that he perceiving rogers warm admiration for cynthia withdrew a little out of his brothers way and used to go and talk to molly in order not to intrude himself between roger and cynthia of the two perhaps osborne preferred molly to her he needed not to talk if the mood was not on himthey were on those happy terms where silence is permissible and where efforts to act against the prevailing mood of the mind are not required sometimes indeed when osborne was in the humour to be critical and fastidious as of yore he used to vex roger by insisting upon it that molly was prettier than cynthia you mark my words roger five years hence the beautiful cynthias red and white will have become just a little coarse and her figure will have thickened while mollys will only have developed into more perfect grace i dont believe the girl has done growing yet im sure shes taller than when i first saw her last summer miss kirkpatricks eyes must always be perfection i cannot fancy any could come up to them soft grave appealing tender and such a heavenly colouri often try to find something in nature to compare them to they are not like violetsthat blue in the eyes is too like physical weakness of sight they are not like the skythat colour has something of cruelty in it come dont go on trying to match her eyes as if you were a draper and they a bit of ribbon say at once her eyes are loadstars and have done with it i set up mollys grey eyes and curling black lashes long odds above the other young womans but of course its all a matter of taste and now both osborne and roger had left the neighbourhood in spite of all that mrs gibson had said about rogers visits being illtimed and intrusive she began to feel as if they had been a very pleasant variety now that they had ceased altogether he brought in a whiff of a new atmosphere from that of hollingford he and his brother had been always ready to do numberless little things which only a man can do for women small services which mr gibson was always too busy to render for the good doctors business grew upon him he thought that this increase was owing to his greater skill and experience and he would probably have been mortified if he could have known how many of his patients were solely biassed in sending for him by the fact that he was employed at the towers something of this sort must have been contemplated in the low scale of payment adopted long ago by the cumnor family of itself the money he received for going to the towers would hardly have paid him for horseflesh but then as lady cumnor in her younger days had worded it it is such a thing for a man just setting up in practice for himself to be able to say he attends at this house so the prestige was tacitly sold and paid for but neither buyer nor seller defined the nature of the bargain on the whole it was as well that mr gibson spent so much of his time from home he sometimes thought so himself when he heard his wifes plaintive fret or pretty babble over totally indifferent things and perceived of how flimsy a nature were all her fine sentiments still he did not allow himself to repine over the step he had taken he wilfully shut his eyes and waxed up his ears to many small things that he knew would have irritated him if he had attended to them and in his solitary rides he forced himself to dwell on the positive advantages that had accrued to him and his through his marriage he had obtained an unexceptionable chaperone if not a tender mother for his little girl a skilful manager of his previous disorderly household a woman who was graceful and pleasant to look at for the head of his table moreover cynthia reckoned for something on the favourable side of the balance she was a capital companion for molly and the two were evidently very fond of each other the feminine companionship of the mother and daughter was agreeable to him as well as to his childwhen mrs gibson was moderately sensible and not oversentimental he mentally added and then he checked himself for he would not allow himself to become more aware of her faults and foibles by defining them at any rate she was harmless and wonderfully just to molly for a stepmother she piqued herself upon this indeed and would often call attention to the fact of her being unlike other women in this respect just then sudden tears came into mr gibsons eyes as he remembered how quiet and undemonstrative his little molly had become in her general behaviour to him but how once or twice when they had met upon the stairs or were otherwise unwitnessed she had caught him and kissed himhand or cheekin a sad passionateness of affection but in a moment he began to whistle an old scotch air he had heard in his childhood and which had never recurred to his memory since and five minutes afterwards he was too busily treating a case of white swelling in the knee of a little boy and thinking how to relieve the poor mother who went out charring all day and had to listen to the moans of her child all night to have any thought for his own cares which if they really existed were of so trifling a nature compared to the hard reality of this hopeless woe osborne came home first he returned in fact not long after roger had gone away but he was languid and unwell and though he did not complain he felt unequal to any exertion thus a week or more elapsed before any of the gibsons knew that he was at the hall and then it was only by chance that they became aware of it mr gibson met him in one of the lanes near hamley the acute surgeon noticed the gait of the man as he came near before he recognized who it was when he overtook him he said why osborne is it you i thought it was an old man of fifty loitering before me i didnt know you had come back illustration why osborne is it you yes said osborne ive been at home nearly ten days i daresay i ought to have called on your people for i made a half promise to mrs gibson to let her know as soon as i returned but the fact is im feeling very goodfornothingthis air oppresses me i could hardly breathe in the house and yet im already tired with this short walk youd better get home at once and ill call and see you as i come back from rowes no you mustnt on any account said osborne hastily my father is annoyed enough about my going from home so often he says though i hadnt been from it for six weeks he puts down all my languor to my having been awayhe keeps the pursestrings you know he added with a faint smile and im in the unlucky position of a penniless heir and ive been brought up soin fact i must leave home from time to time and if my father gets confirmed in this notion of his that my health is worse for my absences hell stop the supplies altogether may i ask where you do spend your time when you are not at hamley hall asked mr gibson with some hesitation in his manner no replied osborne reluctantly i will tell you thisi stay with friends in the country i lead a life which ought to be conducive to health because it is thoroughly simple rational and happy and now ive told you more about it than my father himself knows he never asks me where ive been and i shouldnt tell him if he didat least i think not mr gibson rode on by osbornes side not speaking for a moment or two osborne whatever scrapes you may have got into i should advise your telling your father boldly out i know him and i know hell be angry enough at first but hell come round take my word for it and somehow or another hell find money to pay your debts and set you free if its that kind of difficulty and if its any other kind of entanglement why still hes your best friend its this estrangement from your father thats telling on your health ill be bound no said osborne i beg your pardon but its not that i am really out of order i daresay my unwillingness to encounter any displeasure from my father is the consequence of my indisposition but ill answer for it it is not the cause of it my instinct tells me there is something really the matter with me come dont be setting up your instinct against the profession said mr gibson cheerily he dismounted and throwing the reins of his horse round his arm he looked at osbornes tongue and felt his pulse asking him various questions at the end he said well soon bring you about though i should like a little more quiet talk with you without this tugging brute for a third if youll manage to ride over and lunch with us tomorrow dr nicholls will be with us hes coming over to see old rowe and you shall have the benefit of the advice of two doctors instead of one go home now youve had enough exercise for the middle of a day as hot as this is and dont mope in the house listening to the maunderings of your stupid instinct what else have i to do said osborne my father and i are not companions one cant read and write for ever especially when theres no end to be gained by it i dont mind telling youbut in confidence recollectthat ive been trying to get some of my poems published but theres no one like a publisher for taking the conceit out of one not a man among them would have them as a gift oho so thats it is it master osborne i thought there was some mental cause for this depression of health i wouldnt trouble my head about it if i were you though thats always very easily said i know try your hand at prose if you cant manage to please the publishers with poetry but at any rate dont go on fretting over spilt milk but i mustnt lose my time here come over to us tomorrow as i said and what with the wisdom of two doctors and the wit and folly of three women i think we shall cheer you up a bit so saying mr gibson remounted and rode away at the long slinging trot so well known to the country people as the doctors pace i dont like his looks thought mr gibson to himself at night as over his daybooks he reviewed the events of the day and then his pulse but how often were all mistaken and ten to one my own hidden enemy lies closer to me than his does to himeven taking the worse view of the case osborne made his appearance a considerable time before luncheon the next morning and no one objected to the earliness of his call he was feeling better there were few signs of the invalid about him and what few there were disappeared under the bright pleasant influence of such a welcome as he received from all molly and cynthia had much to tell him of the small proceedings since he went away or to relate the conclusions of halfaccomplished projects cynthia was often on the point of some gay careless inquiry as to where he had been and what he had been doing but molly who conjectured the truth as often interfered to spare him the pain of equivocationa pain that her tender conscience would have felt for him much more than he would have felt it for himself mrs gibsons talk was desultory complimentary and sentimental after her usual fashion but still on the whole though osborne smiled to himself at much that she said it was soothing and agreeable presently dr nicholls and mr gibson came in the former had had some conference with the latter on the subject of osbornes health and from time to time the skilful old physicians sharp and observant eyes gave a comprehensive look at osborne then there was lunch when every one was merry and hungry excepting the hostess who was trying to train her midday appetite into the genteelest of all ways and thought falsely enough that dr nicholls was a good person to practise the semblance of illhealth upon and that he would give her the proper civil amount of commiseration for her ailments which every guest ought to bestow upon a hostess who complains of her delicacy of health the old doctor was too cunning a man to fall into this trap he would keep recommending her to try the coarsest viands on the table and at last he told her if she could not fancy the cold beef to try a little with pickled onions there was a twinkle in his eye as he said this that would have betrayed his humour to any observer but mr gibson cynthia and molly were all attacking osborne on the subject of some literary preference he had expressed and dr nicholls had mrs gibson quite at his mercy she was not sorry when luncheon was over to leave the room to the three gentlemen and ever afterwards she spoke of dr nicholls as that bear presently osborne came upstairs and after his old fashion began to take up new books and to question the girls as to their music mrs gibson had to go out and pay some calls so she left the three together and after a while they adjourned into the garden osborne lounging on a chair while molly employed herself busily in tying up carnations and cynthia gathered flowers in her careless graceful way i hope you notice the difference in our occupations mr hamley molly you see devotes herself to the useful and i to the ornamental please under what head do you class what you are doing i think you might help one of us instead of looking on like the grand seigneur i dont know what i can do said he rather plaintively i should like to be useful but i dont know how and my day is past for purely ornamental work you must let me be im afraid besides im really rather exhausted by being questioned and pulled about by those good doctors why you dont mean to say they have been attacking you since lunch exclaimed molly yes indeed they have and they might have gone on till now if mrs gibson had not come in opportunely i thought mamma had gone out some time ago said cynthia catching wafts of the conversation as she flitted hither and thither among the flowers she came into the diningroom not five minutes ago do you want her for i see her crossing the hall at this very moment and osborne half rose oh not at all said cynthia only she seemed to be in such a hurry to go out i fancied she had set off long ago she had some errand to do for lady cumnor and she thought she could manage to catch the housekeeper who is always in the town on thursday are the family coming to the towers this autumn i believe so but i dont know and i dont much care they dont take kindly to me continued cynthia and so i suppose im not generous enough to take kindly to them i should have thought that such a very unusual blot in their discrimination would have interested you in them as extraordinary people said osborne with a little air of conscious gallantry isnt that a compliment said cynthia after a pause of mock meditation if any one pays me a compliment please let it be short and clear im very stupid at finding out hidden meanings then such speeches as you are very pretty or you have charming manners are what you prefer now i pique myself on wrapping up my sugarplums delicately then would you please to write them down and at my leisure ill parse them no it would be too much trouble ill meet you halfway and study clearness next time what are you two talking about said molly resting on her light spade its only a discussion on the best way of administering compliments said cynthia taking up her flowerbasket again but not going out of the reach of the conversation i dont like them at all in any way said molly but perhaps its rather sour grapes with me she added nonsense said osborne shall i tell you what i heard of you at the ball or shall i provoke mr preston said cynthia to begin upon you its like turning a tap such a stream of pretty speeches flows out at the moment her lip curled with scorn for you perhaps said molly but not for me for any woman its his notion of making himself agreeable if you dare me molly ill try the experiment and youll see with what success no dont pray said molly in a hurry i do so dislike him why said osborne roused to a little curiosity by her vehemence oh i dont know he never seems to know what one is feeling he wouldnt care if he did know said cynthia and he might know he is not wanted if he chooses to stay he cares little whether he is wanted or not come this is very interesting said osborne it is like the strophe and antistrophe in a greek chorus pray go on dont you know him asked molly yes by sight and i think we were once introduced but you know we are much farther from ashcombe at hamley than you are here at hollingford oh but hes coming to take mr sheepshanks place and then hell live here altogether said molly molly who told you that said cynthia in quite a different tone of voice from that in which she had been speaking hitherto papadidnt you hear him oh no it was before you were down this morning papa met mr sheepshanks yesterday and he told him it was all settled you know we heard a rumour about it in the spring cynthia was very silent after this presently she said that she had gathered all the flowers she wanted and that the heat was so great she would go indoors and then osborne went away but molly had set herself a task to dig up such roots as had already flowered and to put down some beddingout plants in their stead tired and heated as she was she finished it and then went upstairs to rest and change her dress according to her wont she sought for cynthia there was no reply to her soft knock at the bedroomdoor opposite to her own and thinking that cynthia might have fallen asleep and be lying uncovered in the draught of the open window she went in softly cynthia was lying upon the bed as if she had thrown herself down on it without caring for the ease or comfort of her position she was very still and molly took a shawl and was going to place it over her when she opened her eyes and spoke is that you dear dont go i like to know that you are there she shut her eyes again and remained quite quiet for a few minutes longer then she started up into a sitting posture pushed her hair away from her forehead and burning eyes and gazed intently at molly do you know what ive been thinking dear said she i think ive been long enough here and that i had better go out as a governess cynthia what do you mean asked molly aghast youve been asleepyouve been dreaming youre overtired continued she sitting down on the bed and taking cynthias passive hand and stroking it softlya mode of caressing that had come down to her from her motherwhether as an hereditary instinct or as a lingering remembrance of the tender ways of the dead woman mr gibson often wondered within himself when he observed it oh how good you are molly i wonder if i had been brought up like you whether i should have been as good but ive been tossed about so then dont go and be tossed about any more said molly softly oh dear i had better go but you see no one ever loved me like you and i think your fatherdoesnt he molly and its hard to be driven out cynthia i am sure youre not well or else youre not half awake cynthia sate with her arms encircling her knees and looking at vacancy well said she at last heaving a great sigh but then smiling as she caught mollys anxious face i suppose theres no escaping ones doom and anywhere else i should be much more forlorn and unprotected what do you mean by your doom ah thats telling little one said cynthia who seemed now to have recovered her usual manner i dont mean to have one though i think that though i am an arrant coward at heart i can show fight with whom asked molly really anxious to probe the mysteryif indeed there was oneto the bottom in the hope of some remedy being found for the distress cynthia was in when first molly entered again cynthia was lost in thought then catching the echo of mollys last words in her mind she said with whomoh show fight with whomwhy my doom to be sure am not i a grand young lady to have a doom why molly child how pale and grave you look said she kissing her all of a sudden you ought not to care so much for me im not good enough for you to worry yourself about me ive given myself up a long time ago as a heartless baggage nonsense i wish you wouldnt talk so cynthia and i wish you wouldnt always take me at the foot of the letter as an english girl at school used to translate it oh how hot it is is it never going to get cool again my child what dirty hands youve got and face too and ive been kissing youi daresay im dirty with it too now isnt that like one of mammas speeches but for all that you look more like a delving adam than a spinning eve this had the effect that cynthia intended the daintily clean molly became conscious of her soiled condition which she had forgotten while she had been attending to cynthia and she hastily withdrew to her own room when she had gone cynthia noiselessly locked the door and taking her purse out of her desk she began to count over her money she counted it onceshe counted it twice as if desirous of finding out some mistake which should prove it to be more than it was but the end of it all was a sigh what a foolwhat a fool i was said she at length but even if i dont go out as a governess i shall make it up in time some weeks after the time he had anticipated when he had spoken of his departure to the gibsons roger returned back to the hall one morning when he called osborne told them that his brother had been at home for two or three days and why has he not come here then said mrs gibson it is not kind of him not to come and see us as soon as he can tell him i say sopray do osborne had gained one or two ideas as to her treatment of roger the last time he had called roger had not complained of it or even mentioned it till that very morning when osborne was on the point of starting and had urged roger to accompany him the latter had told him something of what mrs gibson had said he spoke rather as if he was more amused than annoyed but osborne could read that he was chagrined at those restrictions placed upon calls which were the greatest pleasure of his life neither of them let out the suspicion which had entered both their mindsthe wellgrounded suspicion arising from the fact that osbornes visits be they paid early or late had never yet been met with a repulse osborne now reproached himself with having done mrs gibson injustice she was evidently a weak but probably a disinterested woman and it was only a little bit of illtemper on her part which had caused her to speak to roger as she had done i daresay it was rather impertinent of me to call at such an untimely hour said roger not at all i call at all hours and nothing is ever said about it it was just because she was put out that morning ill answer for it shes sorry now and im sure you may go there at any time you like in the future still roger did not choose to go again for two or three weeks and the consequence was that the next time he called the ladies were out once again he had the same illluck and then he received a little pretty threecornered note from mrs gibson my dear sir how is it that you are become so formal all on a sudden leaving cards instead of awaiting our return fie for shame if you had seen the faces of disappointment that i did when the horrid little bits of pasteboard were displayed to our view you would not have borne malice against me so long for it is really punishing others as well as my naughty self if you will come tomorrowas early as you likeand lunch with us ill own i was cross and acknowledge myself a penitentyours ever hyacinth c k gibson there was no resisting this even if there had not been strong inclination to back up the pretty words roger went and mrs gibson caressed and petted him in her sweetest silkiest manner cynthia looked lovelier than ever to him for the slight restriction that had been laid for a time on their intercourse she might be gay and sparkling with osborne with roger she was soft and grave instinctively she knew her men she saw that osborne was only interested in her because of her position in a family with whom he was intimate that his friendship was without the least touch of sentiment and that his admiration was only the warm criticism of an artist for unusual beauty but she felt how different rogers relation to her was to him she was the one alone peerless if his love was prohibited it would be long years before he could sink down into tepid friendship and to him her personal loveliness was only one of the many charms that made him tremble into passion cynthia was not capable of returning such feelings she had had too little true love in her life and perhaps too much admiration to do so but she appreciated this honest ardour this loyal worship that was new to her experience such appreciation and such respect for his true and affectionate nature gave a serious tenderness to her manner to roger which allured him with a fresh and separate grace molly sate by and wondered how it would all end or rather how soon it would all end for she thought that no girl could resist such reverent passion and on rogers side there could be no doubtalas there could be no doubt an older spectator might have looked far ahead and thought of the question of pounds shillings and pence where was the necessary income for a marriage to come from roger had his fellowship now it is true but the income of that would be lost if he married he had no profession and the life interest of the two or three thousand pounds that he inherited from his mother belonged to his father this older spectator might have been a little surprised at the empressement of mrs gibsons manner to a younger son always supposing this said spectator to have read to the depths of her worldly heart never had she tried to be more agreeable to osborne and though her attempt was a great failure when practised upon roger and he did not know what to say in reply to the delicate flatteries which he felt to be insincere he saw that she intended him to consider himself henceforward free of the house and he was too glad to avail himself of this privilege to examine overclosely into what might be her motives for her change of manner he shut his eyes and chose to believe that she was now desirous of making up for her little burst of temper on his previous visit the result of osbornes conference with the two doctors had been certain prescriptions which appeared to have done him much good and which would in all probability have done him yet more could he have been free of the recollection of the little patient wife in her solitude near winchester he went to her whenever he could and thanks to roger money was far more plentiful with him now than it had been but he still shrank and perhaps even more and more from telling his father of his marriage some bodily instinct made him dread all agitation inexpressibly if he had not had this money from roger he might have been compelled to tell his father all and to ask for the necessary funds to provide for the wife and the coming child but with enough in hand and a secret though remorseful conviction that as long as roger had a penny his brother was sure to have half of it made him more reluctant than ever to irritate his father by a revelation of his secret not just yet not just at present he kept saying both to roger and to himself byandby if we have a boy i will call it rogerand then visions of poetical and romantic reconciliations brought about between father and son through the medium of a child the offspring of a forbidden marriage became still more vividly possible to him and at any rate it was a stavingoff of an unpleasant thing he atoned to himself for taking so much of rogers fellowship money by reflecting that if roger married he would lose this source of revenue yet osborne was throwing no impediment in the way of this event rather forwarding it by promoting every possible means of his brothers seeing the lady of his love osborne ended his reflections by convincing himself of his own generosity chapter xxx old ways and new ways illustration untitled mr preston was now installed in his new house at hollingford mr sheepshanks having entered into dignified idleness at the house of his married daughter who lived in the county town his successor had plunged with energy into all manner of improvements and among others he fell to draining a piece of outlying waste and unreclaimed land of lord cumnors which was close to squire hamleys propertythat very piece for which he had had the government grant but which now lay neglected and only half drained with stacks of mossy tiles and lines of upturned furrows telling of abortive plans it was not often that the squire rode in this direction nowadays but the cottage of a man who had been the squires gamekeeper in those more prosperous days when the hamleys could afford to preserve was close to the rushgrown ground this old servant and tenant was ill and had sent a message up to the hall asking to see the squire not to reveal any secret or to say anything particular but only from the feudal loyalty which made it seem to the dying man as if it would be a comfort to shake the hand and look once more into the eyes of the lord and master whom he had served and whose ancestors his own forbears had served for so many generations and the squire was as fully alive as old silas to the claims of the tie that existed between them though he hated the thought and still more should hate the sight of the piece of land on the side of which silass cottage stood the squire ordered his horse and rode off within halfanhour of receiving the message as he drew near the spot he thought he heard the sound of tools and the hum of many voices just as he used to hear them a year or two before he listened with surprise yes instead of the still solitude he had expected there was the clink of iron the heavy gradual thud of the fall of barrowsful of soilthe cry and shout of labourers but not on his landbetter worth expense and trouble by far than the reedy clay common on which the men were in fact employed he knew it was lord cumnors property and he knew lord cumnor and his family had gone up in the world the whig rascals both in wealth and in station as the hamleys had gone down but all the samein spite of long known facts and in spite of reasonthe squires ready anger rose high at the sight of his neighbour doing what he had been unable to do and he a whig and his family only in the county since queen annes time he went so far as to wonder whether they might notthe labourers he meantavail themselves of his tiles lying so conveniently close to hand all these thoughts regrets and wonders were in his mind as he rode up to the cottage he was bound to and gave his horse in charge to a little lad who had hitherto found his mornings business and amusement in playing at houses with a still younger sister with some of the squires neglected tiles but he was old silass grandson and he might have battered the rude red earthenware to piecesa whole stackone by one and the squire would have said little or nothing it was only that he would not spare one to a labourer of lord cumnors no not one old silas lay in a sort of closet opening out of the family livingroom the small window that gave it light looked right on to the moor as it was called and by day the check curtain was drawn aside so that he might watch the progress of the labour everything about the old man was clean if coarse and with death the leveller so close at hand it was the labourer who made the first advances and put out his horny hand to the squire i thought youd come squire your father came for to see my father as he lay adying come come my man said the squire easily affected as he always was dont talk of dying we shall soon have you out never fear theyve sent you up some soup from the hall as i bade em havent they ay ay ive had all as i could want for to eat and to drink the young squire and master roger was here yesterday yes i know but im a deal nearer heaven today i am i should like you to look after th covers in th west spinney squire them gorse you know where th old fox had her holeher as give em so many a run youll mind it squire though you was but a lad i could laugh to think on her tricks yet and with a weak attempt at a laugh he got himself into a violent fit of coughing which alarmed the squire who thought he would never get his breath again his daughterinlaw came in at the sound and told the squire that he had these coughingbouts very frequently and that she thought he would go off in one of them before long this opinion of hers was spoken simply out before the old man who now lay gasping and exhausted upon his pillow poor people acknowledge the inevitableness and the approach of death in a much more straightforward manner than is customary among more educated folk the squire was shocked at her hardheartedness as he considered it but the old man himself had received much tender kindness from his daughterinlaw and what she had just said was no more news to him than the fact that the sun would rise tomorrow he was more anxious to go on with his story them navviesi call em navvies because some on em is strangers though some on em is th men as was turned off your own works squire when there came orders to stop em last falltheyre apulling up gorse and brush to light their fire for warming up their messes its a long way off to their homes and they mostly dine here and therell be nothing of a cover left if you dont see after em i thought i should like to tell ye afore i died parsons been here but i did na tell him hes all for the earls folk and hed not ha heeded its the earl as put him into his church i reckon for he said what a fine thing it were for to see so much employment agiven to the poor and he never said nought o th sort when your works were agait squire this long speech had been interrupted by many a cough and gasp for breath and having delivered himself of what was on his mind he turned his face to the wall and appeared to be going to sleep presently he roused himself with a start i know i flogged him well i did but he were after pheasants eggs and i didnt know he were an orphan lord forgive me hes thinking on david morton the cripple as used to go about trapping vermin whispered the woman why he died long agotwenty year i should think replied the squire ay but when grandfather goes off i this way to sleep after a bout of talking he seems to be dreaming on old times hell not waken up yet sir youd best sit down if youd like to stay she continued as she went into the houseplace and dusted a chair with her apron he was very particular in bidding me wake him if he were asleep and you or mr roger was to call mr roger said hed be coming again this morningbut hell likely sleep an hour or more if hes let alone i wish id said goodby i should like to have done that he drops off so sudden said the woman but if youd be better pleased to have said it squire ill waken him up a bit no no the squire called out as the woman was going to be as good as her word ill come again perhaps tomorrow and tell him i was sorry for i am indeed and be sure and send to the hall for anything you want mr roger is coming is he hell bring me word how he is later on i should like to have bidden him goodby so giving sixpence to the child who had held his horse the squire mounted he sate still a moment looking at the busy work going on before him and then at his own halfcompleted drainage it was a bitter pill he had objected to borrowing from government in the first instance and then his wife had persuaded him to the step and after it was once taken he was as proud as could be of the only concession to the spirit of progress he ever made in his life he had read and studied the subject pretty thoroughly if also very slowly during the time his wife had been influencing him he was tolerably well up in agriculture if in nothing else and at one time he had taken the lead among the neighbouring landowners when he first began tiledrainage in those days people used to speak of squire hamleys hobby and at market ordinaries or county dinners they rather dreaded setting him off on long repetitions of arguments from the different pamphlets on the subject which he had read and now the proprietors all around him were drainingdraining his interest to government was running on all the same though his works were stopped and his tiles deteriorating in value it was not a soothing consideration and the squire was almost ready to quarrel with his shadow he wanted a vent for his illhumour and suddenly remembering the devastations on his covers which he had heard about not a quarter of an hour before he rode towards the men busy at work on lord cumnors land just before he got up to them he encountered mr preston also on horseback come to overlook his labourers the squire did not know him personally but from the agents manner of speaking and the deference that was evidently paid to him mr hamley saw that he was a responsible person so he addressed the agenti beg your pardon i suppose you are the manager of these works mr preston repliedcertainly i am that and many other things besides at your service i have succeeded mr sheepshanks in the management of my lords property mr hamley of hamley i believe the squire bowed stiffly he did not like his name to be asked or presumed upon in that manner an equal might conjecture who he was or recognize him but till he announced himself an inferior had no right to do more than address him respectfully as sir that was the squires code of etiquette i am mr hamley of hamley i suppose you are as yet ignorant of the boundary of lord cumnors land and so i will inform you that my property begins at the pond yonderjust where you see the rise in the ground i am perfectly acquainted with that fact mr hamley said mr preston a little annoyed at the ignorance attributed to him but may i inquire why my attention is called to it just now the squire was beginning to boil over but he tried to keep his temper in the effort was very much to be respected for it was a great one there was something in the handsome and welldressed agents tone and manner inexpressibly irritating to the squire and it was not lessened by an involuntary comparison of the capital roadster on which mr preston was mounted with his own illgroomed and aged cob i have been told that your men out yonder do not respect these boundaries but are in the habit of plucking up gorse from my covers to light their fires it is possible they may said mr preston lifting his eyebrows his manner being more nonchalant than his words i daresay they think no great harm of it however ill inquire do you doubt my word sir said the squire fretting his mare till she began to dance about i tell you ive heard it only within this last halfhour i dont mean to doubt your word mr hamley its the last thing i should think of doing but you must excuse my saying that the argument which you have twice brought up for the authenticity of your statement that you have heard it within the last halfhour is not quite so forcible as to preclude the possibility of a mistake i wish youd only say in plain language that you doubt my word said the squire clenching and slightly raising his horsewhip i cant make out what you meanyou use so many words pray dont lose your temper sir i said i should inquire you have not seen the men pulling up gorse yourself or you would have named it i surely may doubt the correctness of your information until i have made some inquiry at any rate that is the course i shall pursue and if it gives you offence i shall be sorry but i shall do it just the same when i am convinced that harm has been done to your property i shall take steps to prevent it for the future and of course in my lords name i shall pay you compensationit may probably amount to halfacrown he added these last words in a lower tone as if to himself with a slight contemptuous smile on his face quiet mare quiet said the squire totally unaware that he was the cause of her impatient movements by the way he was perpetually tightening her reins and also perhaps he unconsciously addressed the injunction to himself neither of them saw roger hamley who was just then approaching them with long steady steps he had seen his father from the door of old silass cottage and as the poor fellow was still asleep he was coming to speak to his father and was near enough now to hear the next words i dont know who you are but ive known landagents who were gentlemen and ive known some who were not you belong to this last set young man said the squire that you do i should like to try my horsewhip on you for your insolence pray mr hamley replied mr preston coolly curb your temper a little and reflect i really feel sorry to see a man of your age in such a passionmoving a little farther off however but really more with a desire to save the irritated man from carrying his threat into execution out of a dislike to the slander and excitement it would cause than from any personal dread just at this moment roger hamley came close up he was panting a little and his eyes were very stern and dark but he spoke quietly enough mr preston i can hardly understand what you mean by your last words but remember my father is a gentleman of age and position and not accustomed to receive advice as to the management of his temper from young men like you illustration the burning of the gorse i desired him to keep his men off my land said the squire to his sonhis wish to stand well in rogers opinion restraining his temper a little but though his words might be a little calmer there were all other signs of passion presentthe discoloured complexion the trembling hands the fiery cloud in his eyes he refused and doubted my word mr preston turned to roger as if appealing from philip drunk to philip sober and spoke in a tone of cool explanation which though not insolent in words was excessively irritating in manner your father has misunderstood meperhaps it is no wonder trying to convey by a look of intelligence at the son his opinion that the father was in no state to hear reason i never refused to do what was just and right i only required further evidence as to the past wrongdoing your father took offence at this and then he shrugged his shoulders and lifted his eyebrows in a manner he had formerly learnt in france at any rate sir i can scarcely reconcile the manner and words to my father which i heard you use when i first came up with the deference you ought to have shown to a man of his age and position as to the fact of the trespass they are pulling up all the gorse rogertherell be no cover whatever for game soon put in the squire roger bowed to his father but took up his speech at the point it was at before the interruption i will inquire into it myself at a cooler moment and if i find that such trespass or damage has been committed of course i shall expect that you will see it put a stop to come father i am going to see old silasperhaps you dont know that he is very ill so he endeavoured to wile the squire away to prevent further words he was not entirely successful mr preston was enraged by rogers calm and dignified manner and threw after them this parting shaft in the shape of a loud soliloquy position indeed what are we to think of the position of a man who begins works like these without counting the cost and comes to a standstill and has to turn off his labourers just at the beginning of winter leaving they were too far off to hear the rest the squire was on the point of turning back before this but roger took hold of the reins of the old mare and led her over some of the boggy ground as if to guide her into sure footing but in reality because he was determined to prevent the renewal of the quarrel it was well that the cob knew him and was indeed old enough to prefer quietness to dancing for mr hamley plucked hard at the reins and at last broke out with an oathdamn it roger im not a child i wont be treated as such leave go i say roger let go they were now on firm ground and he did not wish any watchers to think that he was exercising any constraint over his father and this quiet obedience to his impatient commands did more to soothe the squire than anything else could have effected just then i know i turned them offwhat could i do id no more money for their weekly wages its a loss to me as you know he doesnt know no one knows but i think your mother would how it cut me to turn em off just before winter set in i lay awake many a night thinking of it and i gave them what i hadi did indeed i hadnt got money to pay em but i had three barren cows fattened and gave every scrap of meat to the men and i let em go into the woods and gather what was fallen and i winked at their breaking off old branches and now to have it cast up against me by that curthat servant but ill go on with the works by i will if only to spite him ill show him who i am my position indeed a hamley of hamley takes a higher position than his master ill go on with the works see if i dont im paying between one and two hundred a year interest on government money ill raise some more if i go to the jews osborne has shown me the way and osborne shall pay for ithe shall ill not put up with insults you shouldnt have stopped me roger i wish to heaven id horsewhipped the fellow he was lashing himself again into an impotent rage painful to a son to witness but just then the little grandchild of old silas who had held the squires horse during his visit to the sick man came running up breathless please sir please squire mammy has sent me grandfather has wakened up sudden and mammy says hes dying and would you please come she says hed take it as a kind compliment shes sure so they went to the cottage the squire speaking never a word but suddenly feeling as if lifted out of a whirlwind and set down in a still and awful place chapter xxxi a passive coquette it is not to be supposed that such an encounter as mr preston had just had with roger hamley sweetened the regards in which the two young men henceforward held each other they had barely spoken to one another before and but seldom met for the landagents employment had hitherto lain at ashcombe some sixteen or seventeen miles from hamley he was older than roger by several years but during the time he had been in the county osborne and roger had been at school and at college mr preston was prepared to dislike the hamleys for many unreasonable reasons cynthia and molly had both spoken of the brothers with familiar regard implying considerable intimacy their flowers had been preferred to his on the occasion of the ball most people spoke well of them and mr preston had an animals instinctive jealousy and combativeness against all popular young men their positionpoor as the hamleys might bewas far higher than his own in the county and moreover he was agent to the great whig lord whose political interests were diametrically opposed to those of the old tory squire not that lord cumnor troubled himself much about his political interests his family had obtained property and title from the whigs at the time of the hanoverian succession and so traditionally he was a whig and had belonged in his youth to whig clubs where he had lost considerable sums of money to whig gamblers all this was satisfactory and consistent enough and if lord hollingford had not been returned for the county on the whig interestas his father had been before him until he had succeeded to the titleit is quite probable lord cumnor would have considered the british constitution in danger and the patriotism of his ancestors ungratefully ignored but excepting at elections he had no notion of making whig and tory a party cry he had lived too much in london and was of too sociable a nature to exclude any man who jumped with his humour from the hospitality he was always ready to offer be the agreeable acquaintance whig tory or radical but in the county of which he was lordlieutenant the old party distinction was still a shibboleth by which men were tested as to their fitness for social intercourse as well as on the hustings if by any chance a whig found himself at a tory dinnertableor vice versthe food was hard of digestion and wine and viands were criticized rather than enjoyed a marriage between the young people of the separate parties was almost as unheardof and prohibited an alliance as that of romeo and juliets and of course mr preston was not a man in whose breast such prejudices would die away they were an excitement to him for one thing and called out all his talent for intrigue on behalf of the party to which he was allied moreover he considered it as loyalty to his employer to scatter his enemies by any means in his power he had always hated and despised the tories in general and after that interview on the marshy common in front of silass cottage he hated the hamleys and roger especially with a very choice and particular hatred that prig as hereafter he always designated rogerhe shall pay for it yet he said to himself by way of consolation after the father and son had left him what a lout it iswatching the receding figures the old chap has twice as much spunk as the squire tugged at his bridle reins the old mare could make her way better without being led my fine fellow but i see through your dodge youre afraid of your old father turning back and getting into another rage position indeed a beggarly squirea man who did turn off his men just before winter to rot or starve for all he caredits just like a brutal old tory and under the cover of sympathy with the dismissed labourers mr preston indulged his own private pique very pleasantly mr preston had many causes for rejoicing he might have forgotten this discomfiture as he chose to feel it in the remembrance of an increase of income and in the popularity he enjoyed in his new abode all hollingford came forward to do the earls new agent honour mr sheepshanks had been a crabbed crusty old bachelor frequenting innparlours on market days not unwilling to give dinners to three or four chosen friends and familiars with whom in return he dined from time to time and with whom also he kept up an amicable rivalry in the matter of wines but he did not appreciate female society as miss browning elegantly worded his unwillingness to accept the invitations of the hollingford ladies he was even unrefined enough to speak of these invitations to his intimate friends aforesaid as those old womens worrying but of course they never heard of this little quarterofsheet notes without any envelopesthat invention was unknown in those daysbut sealed in the corners when folded up instead of gummed as they are fastened at presentoccasionally passed between mr sheepshanks and the miss brownings mrs goodenough or others from the firstmentioned ladies the form ran as followsmiss browning and her sister miss phoebe browning present their respectful compliments to mr sheepshanks and beg to inform him that a few friends have kindly consented to favour them with their company at tea on thursday next miss browning and miss phoebe will take it very kindly if mr sheepshanks will join their little circle now for mrs goodenough mrs goodenoughs respects to mr sheepshanks and hopes he is in good health she would be very glad if he would favour her with his company to tea on monday my daughter in combermere has sent me a couple of guineafowls and mrs goodenough hopes mr sheepshanks will stay and take a bit of supper no need for the dates of the days of the month the good ladies would have thought that the world was coming to an end if the invitation had been sent out a week before the party therein named but not even guineafowls for supper could tempt mr sheepshanks he remembered the madewines he had tasted in former days at hollingford parties and shuddered breadandcheese with a glass of bitterbeer or a little brandyandwater partaken of in his old clothes which had worn into shapes of loose comfort and smelt strongly of tobacco he liked better than roast guineafowl and birchwine even without throwing into the balance the stiff uneasy coat and the tight neckcloth and tighter shoes so the exagent had been seldom if ever seen at the hollingford teaparties he might have had his form of refusal stereotyped it was so invariably the same mr sheepshanks duty to miss browning and her sister to mrs goodenough or to others as the case might be business of importance prevents him from availing himself of their polite invitation for which he begs to return his best thanks but now that mr preston had succeeded and come to live in hollingford things were changed he accepted every civility right and left and won golden opinions accordingly parties were made in his honour just as if he had been a bride miss phoebe browning said and to all of them he went whats the man after said mr sheepshanks to himself when he heard of his successors affability and sociability and amiability and a variety of other agreeable ilities from the friends whom the old steward still retained at hollingford prestons not a man to put himself out for nothing hes deep hell be after something solider than popularity the sagacious old bachelor was right mr preston was after something more than mere popularity he went wherever he had a chance of meeting cynthia kirkpatrick it might be that mollys spirits were more depressed at this time than they were in general or that cynthia was exultant unawares to herself in the amount of attention and admiration she was receiving from roger by day from mr preston in the evening but the two girls seemed to have parted company in cheerfulness molly was always gentle but very grave and silent cynthia on the contrary was merry full of pretty mockeries and hardly ever silent when first she came to hollingford one of her great charms had been that she was such a gracious listener now her excitement by whatever caused made her too restless to hold her tongue yet what she said was too pretty too witty not to be a winning and sparkling interruption eagerly welcomed by those who were under her sway mr gibson was the only one who observed this change and reasoned upon it shes in a mental fever of some kind thought he to himself shes very fascinating but i dont quite understand her if molly had not been so entirely loyal to her friend she might have thought this constant brilliancy a little tiresome when brought into everyday life it was not the sunshiny rest of a placid lake it was rather the glitter of the pieces of a broken mirror which confuses and bewilders cynthia would not talk quietly about anything now subjects of thought or conversation seemed to have lost their relative value there were exceptions to this mood of hers when she sank into deep fits of silence that would have been gloomy had it not been for the never varying sweetness of her temper if there was a little kindness to be done to either mr gibson or molly cynthia was just as ready as ever to do it nor did she refuse to do anything her mother wished however fidgety might be the humour that prompted the wish but in this latter case cynthias eyes were not quickened by her heart molly was dejected she knew not why cynthia had drifted a little apart that was not it her stepmother had whimsical moods and if cynthia displeased her she would oppress molly with small kindnesses and pseudoaffection or else everything was wrong the world was out of joint and molly had failed in her mission to set it right and was to be blamed accordingly but molly was of too steady a disposition to be much moved by the changeableness of an unreasonable person she might be annoyed or irritated but she was not depressed that was not it the real cause was certainly this as long as roger was drawn to cynthia and sought her of his own accord it had been a sore pain and bewilderment to mollys heart but it was a straightforward attraction and one which molly acknowledged in her humility and great power of loving to be the most natural thing in the world she would look at cynthias beauty and grace and feel as if no one could resist it and when she witnessed all the small signs of honest devotion which roger was at no pains to conceal she thought with a sigh that surely no girl could help relinquishing her heart to such tender strong keeping as rogers character ensured she would have been willing to cut off her right hand if need were to forward his attachment to cynthia and the selfsacrifice would have added a strange zest to a happy crisis she was indignant at what she considered to be mrs gibsons obtuseness to so much goodness and worth and when she called roger a country lout or any other depreciative epithet molly would pinch herself in order to keep silent but after all those were peaceful days compared to the present when she seeing the wrong side of the tapestry after the wont of those who dwell in the same house with a plotter became aware that mrs gibson had totally changed her behaviour to roger from some cause unknown to molly but he was always exactly the same steady as old time as mrs gibson called him with her usual originality a rock of strength under whose very shadow there is rest as mrs hamley had once spoken of him so the cause of mrs gibsons altered manner lay not in him yet now he was sure of a welcome let him come at any hour he would he was playfully reproved for having taken mrs gibsons words too literally and for never coming before lunch but he said he considered her reasons for such words to be valid and should respect them and this was done out of his simplicity and from no tinge of malice then in their family conversations at home mrs gibson was constantly making projects for throwing roger and cynthia together with so evident a betrayal of her wish to bring about an engagement that molly chafed at the net spread so evidently and at rogers blindness in coming so willingly to be entrapped she forgot his previous willingness his former evidences of manly fondness for the beautiful cynthia she only saw plots of which he was the victim and cynthia the conscious if passive bait she felt as if she could not have acted as cynthia did no not even to gain rogers love cynthia heard and saw as much of the domestic background as she did and yet she submitted to the rle assigned to her to be sure this rle would have been played by her unconsciously the things prescribed were what she would naturally have done but because they were prescribedby implication only it is truemolly would have resisted have gone out for instance when she was expected to stay at home or have lingered in the garden when a long country walk was planned at lastfor she could not help loving cynthia come what wouldshe determined to believe that cynthia was entirely unaware of all but it was with an effort that she brought herself to believe it it may be all very pleasant to sport with amaryllis in the shade or with the tangles of neras hair but young men at the outset of their independent life have many other cares in this prosaic england to occupy their time and their thoughts roger was fellow of trinity to be sure and from the outside it certainly appeared as if his position as long as he chose to keep unmarried was a very easy one his was not a nature however to sink down into inglorious ease even had his fellowship income been at his disposal he looked forward to an active life in what direction he had not yet determined he knew what were his talents and his tastes and did not wish the former to lie buried nor the latter which he regarded as gifts fitting him for some peculiar work to be disregarded or thwarted he rather liked awaiting an object secure in his own energy to force his way to it when once he saw it clearly he reserved enough of money for his own personal needs which were small and for the ready furtherance of any project he might see fit to undertake the rest of his income was osbornes given and accepted in the spirit which made the bond between these two brothers so rarely perfect it was only the thought of cynthia that threw roger off his balance a strong man in everything else about her he was as a child he knew that he could not marry and retain his fellowship his intention was to hold himself loose from any employment or profession until he had found one to his mind so there was no immediate prospectno prospect for many years indeed that he would be able to marry yet he went on seeking cynthias sweet company listening to the music of her voice basking in her sunshine and feeding his passion in every possible way just like an unreasoning child he knew that it was follyand yet he did it and it was perhaps this that made him so sympathetic with osborne roger racked his brains about osbornes affairs much more frequently than osborne troubled himself indeed he had become so ailing and languid of late that even the squire made only very faint objections to his desire for frequent change of scene though formerly he used to grumble so much at the necessary expenditure it involved after all it doesnt cost much the squire said to roger one day choose how he does it he does it cheaply he used to come and ask me for twenty where now he does it for five but he and i have lost each others language thats what we have and my dictionary only he called it dixonary has all got wrong because of those confounded debtswhich he will never explain to me or talk abouthe always holds me off at arms length when i begin upon ithe does rogerme his old dad as was his primest favourite of all when he was a little bit of a chap the squire dwelt so much upon osbornes reserved behaviour to himself that brooding over this one subject perpetually he became more morose and gloomy than ever in his manner to osborne resenting the want of the confidence and affection that he thus repelled so much so that roger who desired to avoid being made the receptacle of his fathers complaints against osborneand rogers passive listening was the sedative his father always soughthad often to have recourse to the discussion of the drainage works as a counterirritant the squire had felt mr prestons speech about the dismissal of his workpeople very keenly it fell in with the reproaches of his own conscience though as he would repeat to roger over and over againi couldnt help ithow could ii was drained dry of ready moneyi wish the land was drained as dry as i am said he with a touch of humour that came out before he was aware and at which he smiled sadly enough what was i to do i ask you roger i know i was in a rageive had a deal to make me soand maybe i didnt think as much about consequences as i should ha done when i gave orders for em to be sent off but i couldnt have done otherwise if id ha thought for a twelvemonth in cool blood consequences i hate consequences theyve always been against me they have im so tied up i cant cut down a stick more and thats a consequence of having the property so deucedly well settled i wish id never had any ancestors ay laugh lad it does me good to see thee laugh a bit after osbornes long face which always grows longer at sight o me look here father said roger suddenly ill manage somehow about the money for the works you trust to me give me two months to turn myself in and you shall have some money at any rate to begin with the squire looked at him and his face brightened as a childs does at the promise of a pleasure made to him by some one on whom he can rely he became a little graver however as he saidbut how will you get it its hard enough work never mind ill get ita hundred or so at firsti dont yet know howbut remember father im a senior wrangler and a very promising young writer as that review called me oh you dont know what a fine fellow youve got for a son you should have read that review to know all my wonderful merits i did roger i heard gibson speaking of it and i made him get it for me i should have understood it better if they could have called the animals by their english names and not put so much of their french jingo into it but it was an answer to an article by a french writer pleaded roger id ha let him alone said the squire earnestly we had to beat em and we did it at waterloo but id not demean myself by answering any of their lies if i was you but i got through the review for all their latin and frenchi did and if you doubt me you just look at the end of the great ledger turn it upside down and youll find ive copied out all the fine words they said of you careful observer strong nervous english rising philosopher oh i can nearly say it all off by heart for many a time when im frabbed by bad debts or osbornes bills or moidered with accounts i turn the ledger wrong way up and smoke a pipe over it while i read those pieces out of the review which speak about you lad chapter xxxii coming events roger had turned over many plans in his mind by which he thought that he could obtain sufficient money for the purpose he desired to accomplish his careful grandfather who had been a merchant in the city had so tied up the few thousands he had left to his daughter that although in case of her death before her husbands the latter might enjoy the lifeinterest thereof yet in case of both their deaths their second son did not succeed to the property until he was fiveandtwenty and if he died before that age the money that would then have been his went to one of his cousins on the maternal side in short the old merchant had taken as many precautions about his legacy as if it had been for tens instead of units of thousands of course roger might have slipped through all these meshes by insuring his life until the specified age and probably if he had consulted any lawyer this course would have been suggested to him but he disliked taking any one into his confidence on the subject of his fathers want of ready money he had obtained a copy of his grandfathers will at doctors commons and he imagined that all the contingencies involved in it would be patent to the light of nature and common sense he was a little mistaken in this but not the less resolved that money in some way he would have in order to fulfil his promise to his father and for the ulterior purpose of giving the squire some daily interest to distract his thoughts from the regrets and cares that were almost weakening his mind it was roger hamley senior wrangler and fellow of trinity to the highest bidder no matter what honest employment and presently it came down to any bidder at all another perplexity and distress at this time weighed upon roger osborne heir to the estate was going to have a child the hamley property was entailed on heirs male born in lawful wedlock was the wedlock lawful osborne never seemed to doubt that it wasnever seemed in fact to think twice about it and if he the husband did not how much less did aime the trustful wife yet who could tell how much misery any shadows of illegality might cast into the future one evening roger sitting by the languid careless dilettante osborne began to question him as to the details of the marriage osborne knew instinctively at what roger was aiming it was not that he did not desire perfect legality in justice to his wife it was that he was so indisposed at the time that he hated to be bothered it was something like the refrain of grays scandinavian prophetess leave me leave me to repose but do try and tell me how you managed it how tiresome you are roger put in osborne well i daresay i am go on ive told you morrison married us you remember old morrison at trinity yes as good and blunderheaded a fellow as ever lived well hes taken orders and the examination for priests orders fatigued him so much that he got his father to give him a hundred or two for a tour on the continent he meant to get to rome because he heard that there were such pleasant winters there so he turned up at metz in august i dont see why no more did he he never was great in geography you know and somehow he thought that metz pronounced french fashion must be on the road to rome some one had told him so in fun however it was very well for me that i met with him there for i was determined to be married and that without loss of time but aime is a catholic thats true but you see i am not you dont suppose i would do her any wrong roger asked osborne sitting up in his loungingchair and speaking rather indignantly to roger his face suddenly flushing red no im sure you would not mean it but you see theres a child coming and this estate is entailed on heirsmale now i want to know if the marriage is legal or not and it seems to me its a ticklish question oh said osborne falling back into repose if thats all i suppose youre next heirmale and i can trust you as i can myself you know my marriage is bon fide in intention and i believe it to be legal in fact we went over to strasbourg aime picked up a frienda good middleaged frenchwomanwho served half as bridesmaid half as chaperone and then we went before the mayorprfetwhat do you call them i think morrison rather enjoyed the spree i signed all manner of papers in the prefecture i did not read them over for fear lest i could not sign them conscientiously it was the safest plan aime kept trembling so i thought she would faint and then we went off to the nearest english chaplaincy carlsruhe and the chaplain was away so morrison easily got the loan of the chapel and we were married the next day but surely some registration or certificate was necessary morrison said he would undertake all those forms and he ought to know his own business i know i tipped him pretty well for the job you must be married again said roger after a pause and that before the child is born have you got a certificate of the marriage i daresay morrison has got it somewhere but i believe im legally married according to the laws both of england and france i really do old fellow ive got the prfets papers somewhere never mind you shall be married again in england aime goes to the roman catholic chapel at prestham doesnt she yes she is so good i wouldnt disturb her in her religion for the world then you shall be married both there and at the church of the parish in which she lives as well said roger decidedly its a great deal of trouble unnecessary trouble and unnecessary expense i should say said osborne why cant you leave well alone neither aime nor i are of the sort of stuff to turn scoundrels and deny the legality of our marriage and if the child is a boy and my father dies and i die why im sure youll do him justice as sure as i am of myself old fellow but if i die into the bargain make a hecatomb of the present hamleys all at once while you are about it who succeeds as heirmale osborne thought for a moment one of the irish hamleys i suppose i fancy they are needy chaps perhaps youre right but what need to have such gloomy forebodings the law makes one have foresight in such affairs said roger so ill go down to aime next week when im in town and ill make all necessary arrangements before you come i think youll be happier if it is all done i shall be happier if ive a chance of seeing the little woman that i grant you but what is taking you up to town i wish id money to run about like you instead of being shut up for ever in this dull old house osborne was apt occasionally to contrast his position with rogers in a tone of complaint forgetting that both were the results of character and also that out of his income roger gave up so large a portion for the maintenance of his brothers wife but if this ungenerous thought of osbornes had been set clearly before his conscience he would have smote his breast and cried mea culpa with the best of them it was only that he was too indolent to keep an unassisted conscience i shouldnt have thought of going up said roger reddening as if he had been accused of spending anothers money instead of his own if i hadnt had to go up on business lord hollingford has written for me he knows my great wish for employment and has heard of something which he considers suitable theres his letter if you care to read it but it does not tell anything definitely osborne read the letter and returned it to roger after a moment or two of silence he saidwhy do you want money are we taking too much from you its a great shame of me but what can i do only suggest a career for me and ill follow it tomorrow he spoke as if roger had been reproaching him my dear fellow dont get those notions into your head i must do something for myself sometimes and ive been on the lookout besides i want my father to go on with his drainage it would do good both to his health and his spirits if i can advance any part of the money requisite he and you shall pay me interest until you can return the capital roger youre the providence of the family exclaimed osborne suddenly struck by admiration at his brothers conduct and forgetting to contrast it with his own so roger went up to london and osborne followed him and for two or three weeks the gibsons saw nothing of the brothers but as wave succeeds to wave so interest succeeds to interest the family as they were called came down for their autumn sojourn at the towers and again the house was full of visitors and the towers servants and carriages and liveries were seen in the two streets of hollingford just as they might have been seen for scores of autumns past so runs the round of life from day to day mrs gibson found the chances of intercourse with the towers rather more personally exciting than rogers visits or the rarer calls of osborne hamley cynthia had an old antipathy to the great family who had made so much of her mother and so little of her and whom she considered as in some measure the cause why she had seen so little of her mother in the days when the little girl had craved for love and found none moreover cynthia missed her slave although she did not care for roger one thousandth part of what he did for her yet she had found it not unpleasant to have a man whom she thoroughly respected and whom men in general respected the subject of her eye the glad ministrant to each scarcespoken wish a person in whose sight all her words were pearls or diamonds all her actions heavenly graciousness and in whose thoughts she reigned supreme she had no modest unconsciousness about her and yet she was not vain she knew of all this worship and when from circumstances she no longer received it she missed it the earl and the countess lord hollingford and lady harriet lords and ladies in general liveries dresses bags of game and rumours of riding parties were as nothing to her compared to rogers absence and yet she did not love him no she did not love him molly knew that cynthia did not love him molly grew angry with her many and many a time as the conviction of this fact was forced upon her molly did not know her own feelings roger had no overwhelming interest in what they might be while his very lifebreath seemed to depend on what cynthia felt and thought therefore molly had keen insight into her sisters heart and she knew that cynthia did not love roger molly could have cried with passionate regret at the thought of the unvalued treasure lying at cynthias feet and it would have been a merely unselfish regret it was the old fervid tenderness do not wish for the moon o my darling for i cannot give it thee cynthias love was the moon roger yearned for and molly saw that it was far away and out of reach else would she have strained her heartcords to give it to roger i am his sister she would say to herself that old bond is not done away with though he is too much absorbed by cynthia to speak about it just now his mother called me fanny it was almost like an adoption i must wait and watch and see if i can do anything for my brother one day lady harriet came to call on the gibsons or rather on mrs gibson for the latter retained her old jealousy if any one else in hollingford was supposed to be on intimate terms at the great house or in the least acquainted with their plans mr gibson might possibly know as much but then he was professionally bound to secrecy out of the house she considered mr preston as her rival and he was aware that she did so and delighted in teasing her by affecting a knowledge of family plans and details of affairs of which she was ignorant indoors she was jealous of the fancy lady harriet had evidently taken for her stepdaughter and she contrived to place quiet obstacles in the way of a too frequent intercourse between the two these obstacles were not unlike the shield of the knight in the old story only instead of the two sides presented to the two travellers approaching it from opposite quarters one of which was silver and one of which was gold lady harriet saw the smooth and shining yellow radiance while poor molly only perceived a dull and heavy lead to lady harriet it was molly is gone out she will be so sorry to miss you but she was obliged to go to see some old friends of her mothers whom she ought not to neglect as i said to her constancy is everything it is sterne i think who says thine own and thy mothers friends forsake not but dear lady harriet youll stop till she comes home wont you i know how fond you are of her in fact with a little surface playfulness i sometimes say you come more to see her than your poor old clare to molly it had previously been lady harriet is coming here this morning i cant have any one else coming in tell maria to say im not at home lady harriet has always so much to tell me dear lady harriet ive known all her secrets since she was twelve years old you two girls must keep out of the way of course shell ask for you out of common civility but you would only interrupt us if you came in as you did the other daynow addressing mollyi hardly like to say so but i thought it was very forward maria told me she had asked for me put in molly simply very forward indeed continued mrs gibson taking no further notice of the interruption except to strengthen the words to which mollys little speech had been intended as a correction i think this time i must secure her ladyship from the chances of such an intrusion by taking care that you are out of the house molly you had better go to the holly farm and speak about those damsons i ordered and which have never been sent ill go said cynthia its far too long a walk for molly shes had a bad cold and isnt as strong as she was a fortnight ago i delight in long walks if you want molly out of the way mamma send her to the miss browningsthey are always glad to see her i never said i wanted molly out of the way cynthia replied mrs gibson you always put things in such an exaggeratedi should almost say so coarse a manner i am sure molly my love you could never have so misunderstood me it is only on lady harriets account i dont think i can walk as far as the holly farm papa would take the message cynthia need not go well im the last person in the world to tax any ones strength id sooner never see damson preserve again suppose you do go and see miss browning you can pay her a nice long call you know she likes that and ask after miss phoebes cold from me you know they were friends of your mothers my dear and i would not have you break off old friendships for the world constancy above everything is my motto as you know and the memory of the dead ought always to be cherished now mamma where am i to go asked cynthia though lady harriet doesnt care for me as much as she does for mollyindeed quite the contrary i should sayyet she might ask after me and i had better be safely out of the way true said mrs gibson meditatively yet unconscious of any satire in cynthias speech she is much less likely to ask for you my dear i almost think you might remain in the house or you might go to the holly farm i really do want the damsons or you might stay here in the diningroom you know so as to be ready to arrange lunch prettily if she does take a fancy to stay for it she is very fanciful is dear lady harriet i would not like her to think we made any difference in our meals because she stayed simple elegance as i tell her always is what we aim at but still you could put out the best service and arrange some flowers and ask cook what there is for dinner that she could send us for lunch and make it all look pretty and impromptu and natural i think you had better stay at home cynthia and then you could fetch molly from miss brownings in the afternoon you know and you two could take a walk together after lady harriet was fairly gone i understand mamma off with you molly make haste or lady harriet may come and ask for you as well as mamma ill take care and forget where you are going to so that no one shall learn from me where you are and ill answer for mammas loss of memory child what nonsense you talk you quite confuse me with being so silly said mrs gibson fluttered and annoyed as she usually was with the lilliputian darts cynthia flung at her she had recourse to her accustomed feckless piece of retaliationbestowing some favour on molly and this did not hurt cynthia one whit molly darling theres a very cold wind though it looks so fine you had better put on my indian shawl and it will look so pretty too on your grey gownscarlet and grey its not everybody i would lend it to but youre so careful thank you said molly and she left mrs gibson in careless uncertainty as to whether her offer would be accepted or not lady harriet was sorry to miss molly as she was fond of the girl but as she perfectly agreed with mrs gibsons truism about constancy and old friends she saw no occasion for saying any more about the affair but sat down in a little low chair with her feet on the fender this said fender was made of bright bright steel and was strictly tabooed to all household and plebeian feet indeed the position if they assumed it was considered lowbred and vulgar thats right dear lady harriet you cant think what a pleasure it is to me to welcome you at my own fireside into my humble home humble now clare thats a little bit of nonsense begging your pardon i dont call this pretty little drawingroom a bit of a humble home its as full of comforts and of pretty things too as any room of its size can be ah how small you must feel it even i had to reconcile myself to it at first well perhaps your schoolroom was larger but remember how bare it was how empty of anything but deal tables and forms and mats oh indeed clare i quite agree with mamma who always says you have done very well for yourself and mr gibson too what an agreeable wellinformed man yes he is said his wife slowly as if she did not like to relinquish her rle of a victim to circumstances quite immediately he is very agreeable very only we see so little of him and of course he comes home tired and hungry and not inclined to talk to his own family and apt to go to sleep come come said lady harriet im going to have my turn now weve had the complaint of a doctors wife now hear the moans of a peers daughter our house is so overrun with visitors and literally today i have come to you for a little solitude solitude exclaimed mrs gibson would you rather be alone slightly aggrieved no you dear silly woman my solitude requires a listener to whom i may say how sweet is solitude but i am tired of the responsibility of entertaining papa is so openhearted he asks every friend he meets with to come and pay us a visit mamma is really a great invalid but she does not choose to give up her reputation for good health having always considered illness a want of selfcontrol so she gets wearied and worried by a crowd of people who are all of them openmouthed for amusement of some kind just like a brood of fledglings in a nest so i have to be parentbird and pop morsels into their yellow leathery bills to find them swallowed down before i can think of where to find the next oh its entertaining in the largest literalist dreariest sense of the word so i have told a few lies this morning and come off here for quietness and the comfort of complaining lady harriet threw herself back in her chair and yawned mrs gibson took one of her ladyships hands in a soft sympathizing manner and murmured poor lady harriet and then she purred affectionately after a pause lady harriet started up and saidi used to take you as my arbiter of morals when i was a little girl tell me do you think it wrong to tell lies oh my dear how can you ask such questionsof course it is very wrongvery wicked indeed i think i may say but i know you were only joking when you said you had told lies no indeed i wasnt i told as plump fat lies as you would wish to hear i said i was obliged to go into hollingford on business when the truth was there was no obligation in the matter only an insupportable desire of being free from my visitors for an hour or two and my only business was to come here and yawn and complain and lounge at my leisure i really think im unhappy at having told a story as children express it but my dear lady harriet said mrs gibson a little puzzled as to the exact meaning of the words that were trembling on her tongue i am sure you thought that you meant what you said when you said it no i didnt put in lady harriet and besides if you didnt it was the fault of the tiresome people who drove you into such straitsyes it was certainly their fault not yoursand then you know the conventions of societyah what trammels they are lady harriet was silent for a minute or two then she saidtell me clare youve told lies sometimes havent you lady harriet i think you might have known me better but i know you dont mean it dear yes i do you must have told white lies at any rate how did you feel after them i should have been miserable if i ever had i should have died of selfreproach the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth has always seemed to me such a fine passage but then i have so much that is unbending in my nature and in our sphere of life there are so few temptations if we are humble we are also simple and unshackled by etiquette then you blame me very much if somebody else will blame me i shant be so unhappy at what i said this morning i am sure i never blamed you not in my innermost heart dear lady harriet blame you indeed that would be presumption in me i think i shall set up a confessor and it shant be you clare for you have always been only too indulgent to me after a pause she saidcan you give me some lunch clare i dont mean to go home till three my business will take me till then as the people at the towers are duly informed certainly i shall be delighted but you know we are very simple in our habits oh i only want a little breadandbutter and perhaps a slice of cold meatyou must not give yourself any trouble clareperhaps you dine now let me sit down just like one of your family yes you shall i wont make any alterationit will be so pleasant to have you sharing our family meal dear lady harriet but we dine late we only lunch now how low the fire is getting i really am forgetting everything in the pleasure of this ttette so she rang twice with great distinctness and with a long pause between the rings maria brought in coals but the signal was as well understood by cynthia as the hall of apollo was by the servants of lucullus the brace of partridges that were to have been for the late dinner were instantly put down to the fire and the prettiest china brought out and the table decked with flowers and fruit arranged with all cynthias usual dexterity and taste so that when the meal was announced and lady harriet entered the room she could not but think her hostesss apologies had been quite unnecessary and be more and more convinced that clare had done very well for herself cynthia now joined the party pretty and elegant as she always was but somehow she did not take lady harriets fancy she only noticed her on account of her being her mothers daughter her presence made the conversation more general and lady harriet gave out several pieces of news none of them of any great importance to her but as what had been talked about by the circle of visitors assembled at the towers lord hollingford ought to have been with us she said amongst other things but he is obliged or fancies himself obliged which is all the same thing to stay in town about this crichton legacy a legacy to lord hollingford i am so glad dont be in a hurry to be glad its nothing for him but trouble didnt you hear of that rich eccentric mr crichton who died some time ago andfired by the example of lord bridgewater i supposeleft a sum of money in the hands of trustees of whom my brother is one to send out a man with a thousand fine qualifications to make a scientific voyage with a view to bringing back specimens of the fauna of distant lands and so forming the nucleus of a museum which is to be called the crichton museum and so perpetuate the founders name such various forms does mans vanity take sometimes it stimulates philanthropy sometimes a love of science it seems to me a very laudable and useful object i am sure said mrs gibson safely i daresay it is taking it from the publicgood view but its rather tiresome to us privately for it keeps hollingford in townor between it and cambridgeand each place as dull and empty as can be just when we want him down at the towers the thing ought to have been decided long ago and theres some danger of the legacy lapsing the two other trustees have run away to the continent feeling as they say the utmost confidence in him but in reality shirking their responsibilities however i believe he likes it so i ought not to grumble he thinks he is going to be very successful in the choice of his manand he belongs to this county tooyoung hamley of hamley if he can only get his college to let him go for he is a fellow of trinity senior wrangler or something and theyre not so foolish as to send their crack man to be eaten up by lions and tigers it must be roger hamley exclaimed cynthia her eyes brightening and her cheeks flushing hes not the eldest son he can scarcely be called hamley of hamley said mrs gibson hollingfords man is a fellow of trinity as i said before then it is mr roger hamley said cynthia and hes up in london about some business what news for molly when she comes home why what has molly to do with it asked lady harriet is and she looked into mrs gibsons face for an answer mrs gibson in reply gave an intelligent and very expressive glance at cynthia who however did not perceive it oh no not at alland mrs gibson nodded a little at her daughter as much as to say if any one that lady harriet began to look at the pretty miss kirkpatrick with fresh interest her brother had spoken in such a manner of this young mr hamley that every one connected with the phoenix was worthy of observation then as if the mention of mollys name had brought her afresh into her mind lady harriet saidand where is molly all this time i should like to see my little mentor i hear she is very much grown since those days oh when she once gets gossiping with the miss brownings she never knows when to come home said mrs gibson the miss brownings oh im so glad you named them im very fond of them pecksy and flapsy i may call them so in mollys absence ill go and see them before i go home and then perhaps i shall see my dear little molly too do you know clare ive quite taken a fancy to that girl so mrs gibson after all her precautions had to submit to lady harriets leaving her halfanhour earlier than she otherwise would have done in order to make herself common as mrs gibson expressed it by calling on the miss brownings but molly had left before lady harriet arrived molly went the long walk to the holly farm to order the damsons out of a kind of penitence she had felt conscious of anger at being sent out of the house by such a palpable manoeuvre as that which her stepmother had employed of course she did not meet cynthia so she went alone along the pretty lanes with grassy sides and high hedgebanks not at all in the style of modern agriculture at first she made herself uncomfortable with questioning herself as to how far it was right to leave unnoticed the small domestic failingsthe webs the distortions of truth which had prevailed in their household ever since her fathers second marriage she knew that very often she longed to protest but did not do it from the desire of sparing her father any discord and she saw by his face that he too was occasionally aware of certain things that gave him pain as showing that his wifes standard of conduct was not as high as he would have liked it was a wonder to molly whether this silence was right or wrong with a girls want of toleration and want of experience to teach her the force of circumstances and of temptation she had often been on the point of telling her stepmother some forcible home truths but possibly her fathers example of silence and often some piece of kindness on mrs gibsons part for after her way and when in a good temper she was very kind to molly made her hold her tongue that night at dinner mrs gibson recounted the conversation between herself and lady harriet giving it a very strong individual colouring as was her wont and telling nearly the whole of what had passed although implying that there was a great deal said which was so purely confidential that she was bound in honour not to repeat it her three auditors listened to her without interrupting her muchindeed without bestowing extreme attention on what she was saying until she came to the fact of lord hollingfords absence in london and the reason for it roger hamley going off on a scientific expedition exclaimed mr gibson suddenly awakened into vivacity yes at least it is not settled finally but as lord hollingford is the only trustee who takes any interestand being lord cumnors sonit is next to certain i think i must have a voice in the matter said mr gibson and he relapsed into silence keeping his ears open however henceforward how long will he be away asked cynthia we shall miss him sadly mollys lips formed an acquiescing yes to this remark but no sound was heard there was a buzzing in her ears as if the others were going on with the conversation but the words they uttered seemed indistinct and blurred they were merely conjectures and did not interfere with the one great piece of news to the rest of the party she appeared to be eating her dinner as usual and if she were silent there was one listener the more to mrs gibsons stream of prattle and mr gibsons and cynthias remarks chapter xxxiii brightening prospects illustration untitled it was a day or two afterwards that mr gibson made time to ride round by hamley desirous to learn more exact particulars of this scheme for roger than he could obtain from any extraneous source and rather puzzled to know whether he should interfere in the project or not the state of the case was thisosbornes symptoms were in mr gibsons opinion signs of his having a fatal disease dr nicholls had differed from him on this head and mr gibson knew that the old physician had had long experience and was considered very skilful in the profession still he believed that he himself was right and if so the complaint was one which might continue for years in the same state as at present or might end the young mans life in an houra minute supposing that mr gibson was right would it be well for roger to be away where no sudden calls for his presence could reach himaway for two years yet if the affair was concluded the interference of a medical man might accelerate the very evil to be feared and after all dr nicholls might be right and the symptoms might proceed from some other cause might yes probably did no mr gibson could not bring himself to say yes to this latter form of sentence so he rode on meditating his reins slack his head a little bent it was one of those still and lovely autumn days when the red and yellow leaves are hangingpegs to dewy brilliant gossamerwebs when the hedges are full of trailing brambles loaded with ripe blackberries when the air is full of the farewell whistles and pipes of birds clear and shortnot the long fullthroated warbles of spring when the whirr of the partridges wings is heard in the stubblefields as the sharp hoofblows fall on the paved lanes when here and there a leaf floats and flutters down to the ground although there is not a single breath of wind the country surgeon felt the beauty of the seasons perhaps more than most men he saw more of it by day by night in storm and sunshine or in the still soft cloudy weather he never spoke about what he felt on the subject indeed he did not put his feelings into words even to himself but if his mood ever approached to the sentimental it was on such days as this he rode into the stableyard gave his horse to a man and went into the house by a side entrance in the passage he met the squire thats capital gibson what good wind blew you here youll have some lunch its on the table i only just this minute left the room and he kept shaking mr gibsons hand all the time till he had placed him nothing loth at the wellcovered diningtable whats this i hear about roger said mr gibson plunging at once into the subject aha so youve heard have you its famous isnt it hes a boy to be proud of is old roger steady roger we used to think him slow but it seems to me that slow and sure wins the race but tell me what have you heard how much is known nay you must have a glass full its old ale such as we dont brew nowadays its as old as osborne we brewed it that autumn and we called it the young squires ale i thought to have tapped it on his marriage but i dont know when that will come to pass so weve tapped it now in rogers honour the old squire had evidently been enjoying the young squires ale to the verge of prudence it was indeed as he said as strong as brandy and mr gibson had to sip it very carefully as he ate his cold roast beef well and what have you heard theres a deal to hear and all good news though i shall miss the lad i know that i did not know it was settled i only heard that it was in progress well it was only in progress as you call it till last tuesday he never let me know anything about it though he says he thought i might be fidgety with thinking of the pros and cons so i never knew a word ont till i had a letter from my lord hollingfordwhere is it pulling out a great black leathern receptacle for all manner of papers and putting on his spectacles he read aloud their headings measurement of timber new railings drench for cows from farmer hayes dobsons accountsum umhere it is now read that letter handing it to mr gibson it was a manly feeling sensible letter explaining to the old father in very simple language the services which were demanded by the terms of the will to which he and two or three others were trustees the liberal allowance for expenses the still more liberal reward for performance which had tempted several men of considerable renown to offer themselves as candidates for the appointment lord hollingford then went on to say that having seen a good deal of roger lately since the publication of his article in reply to the french osteologist he had had reason to think that in him the trustees would find united the various qualities required in a greater measure than in any of the applicants who had at that time presented themselves roger had deep interest in the subject much acquired knowledge and at the same time great natural powers of comparison and classification of facts he had shown himself to be an observer of a fine and accurate kind he was of the right age in the very prime of health and strength and unshackled by any family ties here mr gibson paused for consideration he hardly cared to ascertain by what steps the result had been arrived athe already knew what that result was but his mind was again arrested as his eye caught on the remuneration offered which was indeed most liberal and then he read with attention the high praise bestowed on the son in this letter to the father the squire had been watching mr gibsonwaiting till he came to this partand he rubbed his hands together as he said ay youve come to it at last its the best part of the whole isnt it god bless the boy and from a whig mind you which makes it the more handsome and theres more to come still i say gibson i think my luck is turning at last passing him on yet another letter to read that only came this morning but ive acted on it already i sent for the foreman of the drainage works at once i did and tomorrow please god theyll be at work again mr gibson read the second letter from roger to a certain degree it was a modest repetition of what lord hollingford had said with an explanation of how he had come to take so decided a step in life without consulting his father he did not wish him to be in suspense for one reason another was that he felt as no one else could feel for him that by accepting this offer he entered upon the kind of life for which he knew himself to be most fitted and then he merged the whole into business he said that he knew well the suffering his father had gone through when he had had to give up his drainage works for want of money that he roger had been enabled at once to raise money upon the remuneration he was to receive on the accomplishment of his two years work and that he had also insured his life in order to provide for the repayment of the money he had raised in case he did not live to return to england he said that the sum he had borrowed on this security would at once be forwarded to his father mr gibson laid down the letter without speaking a word for some time then he saidhell have to pay a pretty sum for insuring his life beyond seas hes got his fellowship money said the squire a little depressed at mr gibsons remark yes thats true and hes a strong young fellow as i know i wish i could tell his mother said the squire in an undertone it seems all settled now said mr gibson more in reply to his own thoughts than to the squires remark yes said the squire and theyre not going to let the grass grow under his feet hes to be off as soon as he can get his scientific traps ready i almost wish he wasnt to go you dont seem quite to like it doctor yes i do said mr gibson in a more cheerful tone than before it cant be helped now without doing a mischief thought he to himself why squire i think it a great honour to have such a son i envy you thats what i do heres a lad of three or four and twenty distinguishing himself in more ways than one and as simple and affectionate at home as any fellow need to benot a bit set up ay ay hes twice as much a son to me as osborne who has been all his life set up on nothing at all as one may say come squire i mustnt hear anything against osborne we may praise one without hitting at the other osborne hasnt had the strong health which has enabled roger to work as he has done i met a man who knew his tutor at trinity the other day and of course we began cracking about rogerits not every day that one can reckon a senior wrangler amongst ones friends and im nearly as proud of the lad as you are this mr mason told me the tutor said that only half of rogers success was owing to his mental powers the other half was owing to his perfect health which enabled him to work harder and more continuously than most men without suffering he said that in all his experience he had never known any one with an equal capacity for mental labour and that he could come again with a fresh appetite to his studies after shorter intervals of rest than most now i being a doctor trace a good deal of his superiority to the material cause of a thoroughly good constitution which osborne hasnt got osborne might have if he got out o doors more said the squire moodily but except when he can loaf into hollingford he doesnt care to go out at all i hope he continued with a glance of sudden suspicion at mr gibson hes not after one of your girls i dont mean any offence you know but hell have the estate and it wont be free and he must marry money i dont think i could allow it in roger but osbornes the eldest son you know mr gibson reddened he was offended for a moment then the partial truth of what the squire said was presented to his mind and he remembered their old friendship so he spoke quietly if shortly i dont believe theres anything of the kind going on im not much at home you know but ive never heard or seen anything that should make me suppose that there is when i do ill let you know now gibson dont go and be offended im glad for the boys to have a pleasant house to go to and i thank you and mrs gibson for making it pleasant only keep off love it can come to no good thats all i dont believe osborne will ever earn a farthing to keep a wife during my life and if i were to die tomorrow she would have to bring some money to clear the estate and if i do speak as i shouldnt have done formerlya little sharp or sowhy its because ive been worried by many a care no one knows anything of im not going to take offence said mr gibson but let us understand each other clearly if you dont want your sons to come as much to my house as they do tell them so yourself i like the lads and am glad to see them but if they do come you must take the consequences whatever they are and not blame me or them either for what may happen from the frequent intercourse between two young men and two young women and what is more though as i said i see nothing whatever of the kind you fear at present and have promised to tell you of the first symptoms i do see yet farther than that i wont go if theres an attachment at any future time i wont interfere i shouldnt so much mind if roger fell in love with your molly he can fight for himself you see and shes an uncommon nice girl my poor wife was so fond of her answered the squire its osborne and the estate im thinking of well then tell him not to come near us i shall be sorry but you will be safe ill think about it but hes difficult to manage ive always to get my blood well up before i can speak my mind to him mr gibson was leaving the room but at these words he turned and laid his hand on the squires arm take my advice squire as i said theres no harm done as yet as far as i know prevention is better than cure speak out but speak gently to osborne and do it at once i shall understand how it is if he doesnt show his face for some months in my house if you speak gently to him hell take the advice as from a friend if he can assure you theres no danger of course hell come just as usual when he likes it was all very fine giving the squire this good advice but as osborne had already formed the very kind of marriage his father most deprecated it did not act quite as well as mr gibson had hoped the squire began the conversation with unusual selfcontrol but he grew irritated when osborne denied his fathers right to interfere in any marriage he might contemplate denied it with a certain degree of doggedness and weariness of the subject that drove the squire into one of his passions and although on after reflection he remembered that he had his sons promise and solemn word not to think of either cynthia or molly for his wife yet the father and son had passed through one of those altercations which help to estrange men for life each had said bitter things to the other and if the brotherly affection had not been so true between osborne and roger they too might have become alienated in consequence of the squires exaggerated and injudicious comparison of their characters and deeds but as roger in his boyhood had loved osborne too well to be jealous of the praise and love which the eldest son the beautiful brilliant lad had received to the disparagement of his own plain awkwardness and slowness so now osborne strove against any feeling of envy or jealousy with all his might but his efforts were conscious rogers had been the simple consequence of affection and the end to poor osborne was that he became moody and depressed in mind and body but both father and son concealed their feelings in rogers presence when he came home just before sailing busy and happy the squire caught his infectious energy and osborne looked up and was cheerful there was no time to be lost he was bound to a hot climate and must take all advantage possible of the winter months he was to go first to paris to have interviews with some of the scientific men there some of his outfit instruments c were to follow him to havre from which port he was to embark after transacting his business in paris the squire learnt all his arrangements and plans and even tried in afterdinner conversations to penetrate into the questions involved in the researches his son was about to make but rogers visit home could not be prolonged beyond two days the last day he rode into hollingford earlier than he needed to have done to catch the london coach in order to bid the gibsons goodby he had been too actively busy for some time to have leisure to bestow much thought on cynthia but there was no need for fresh meditation on that subject her image as a prize to be worked for to be served for seven years and seven years more was safe and sacred in his heart it was very bad this going away and wishing her goodby for two long years and he wondered much during his ride how far he should be justified in telling her mother perhaps in telling her own sweet self what his feelings were without expecting nay indeed reprobating any answer on her part then she would know at any rate how dearly she was beloved by one who was absent how in all difficulties or dangers the thought of her would be a polar star high up in the heavens and so on and so on for with all a lovers quickness of imagination and triteness of fancy he called her a star a flower a nymph a witch an angel or a mermaid a nightingale a siren as one or another of her attributes rose up before him chapter xxxiv a lovers mistake it was afternoon molly had gone out for a walk mrs gibson had been paying some calls lazy cynthia had declined accompanying either a daily walk was not a necessity to her as it was to molly on a lovely day or with an agreeable object or when the fancy took her she could go as far as any one but these were exceptional cases in general she was not disposed to disturb herself from her indoor occupations indeed not one of the ladies would have left the house had they been aware that roger was in the neighbourhood for they were aware that he was to come down but once before his departure and that his stay at home then would be but for a short time and they were all anxious to wish him goodby before his long absence but they had understood that he was not coming to the hall until the following week and therefore they had felt themselves at full liberty this afternoon to follow their own devices molly chose a walk that had been a favourite with her ever since she was a child something or other had happened just before she left home that made her begin wondering how far it was right for the sake of domestic peace to pass over without comment the little deviations from right that people perceive in those whom they live with or whether as they are placed in families for distinct purposes not by chance merely there are not duties involved in this aspect of their lot in lifewhether by continually passing over failings their own standard is not loweredthe practical application of these thoughts being a dismal sort of perplexity on mollys part as to whether her father was quite aware of her stepmothers perpetual lapses from truth and whether his blindness was wilful or not then she felt bitterly enough that although she was sure as could be that there was no real estrangement between her and her father yet there were perpetual obstacles thrown in the way of their intercourse and she thought with a sigh that if he would but come in with authority he might cut his way clear to the old intimacy with his daughter and that they might have all the former walks and talks and quips and cranks and glimpses of real confidence once again things that her stepmother did not value yet which she like the dog in the manger prevented mollys enjoying but after all molly was a girl not so far removed from childhood and in the middle of her grave regrets and perplexities her eye was caught by the sight of some fine ripe blackberries flourishing away high up on the hedgebank among scarlet hips and green and russet leaves she did not care much for blackberries herself but she had heard cynthia say that she liked them and besides there was the charm of scrambling and gathering them so she forgot all about her troubles and went climbing up the banks and clutching at her almost inaccessible prizes and slipping down again triumphant to carry them back to the large leaf which was to serve her as a basket one or two of them she tasted but they were as vapid to her palate as ever the skirt of her pretty print gown was torn out of the gathers and even with the fruit she had eaten her pretty lips with blackberries were all besmeared and dyed when having gathered as many and more than she could possibly carry she set off home hoping to escape into her room and mend her gown before it had offended mrs gibsons neat eye the front door was easily opened from the outside and molly was out of the clear light of the open air and in the shadow of the hall when she saw a face peep out of the diningroom before she quite recognized whose it was and then mrs gibson came softly out sufficiently at least to beckon her into the room when molly had entered mrs gibson closed the door poor molly expected a reprimand for her torn gown and untidy appearance but was soon relieved by the expression of mrs gibsons facemysterious and radiant ive been watching for you dear dont go upstairs into the drawingroom love it might be a little interruption just now roger hamley is there with cynthia and ive reason to thinkin fact i did open the door unawares but i shut it again softly and i dont think they heard me isnt it charming young love you know ah how sweet it is do you mean that roger has proposed to cynthia asked molly not exactly that but i dont know of course i know nothing only i did hear him say that he had meant to leave england without speaking of his love but that the temptation of seeing her alone had been too great for him it was symptomatic was it not my dear and all i wanted was to let it come to a crisis without interruption so ive been watching for you to prevent your going in and disturbing them but i may go to my own room maynt i pleaded molly of course said mrs gibson a little testily only i had expected sympathy from you at such an interesting moment but molly did not hear these last words she had escaped upstairs and shut her door instinctively she had carried her leaf full of blackberrieswhat would blackberries be to cynthia now she felt as if she could not understand it all but as for that matter what could she understand nothing for a few minutes her brain seemed in too great a whirl to comprehend anything but that she was being carried on in earths diurnal course with rocks and stones and trees with as little volition on her part as if she were dead then the room grew stifling and instinctively she went to the open casement window and leant out gasping for breath gradually the consciousness of the soft peaceful landscape stole into her mind and stilled the buzzing confusion there bathed in the almost level rays of the autumn sunlight lay the landscape she had known and loved from childhood as quiet as full of low humming life as it had been at this hour for many generations the autumn flowers blazed out in the garden below the lazy cows were in the meadow beyond chewing their cud in the green aftermath the evening fires had just been made up in the cottages beyond in preparation for the husbands homecoming and were sending up soft curls of blue smoke into the still air the children let loose from school were shouting merrily in the distance and she just then she heard nearer sounds an opened door steps on the lower flight of stairs he could not have gone without even seeing her he never never would have done so cruel a thingnever would have forgotten poor little molly however happy he might be no there were steps and voices and the drawingroom door was opened and shut once more she laid down her head on her arms that rested upon the windowsill and criedshe had been so distrustful as to have let the idea enter her mind that he could go without wishing her goodbyher whom his mother had so loved and called by the name of his little dead sister and as she thought of the tender love mrs hamley had borne her she cried the more for the vanishing of such love for her off the face of the earth suddenly the drawingroom door opened and some one was heard coming upstairs it was cynthias step molly hastily wiped her eyes and stood up and tried to look unconcerned it was all she had time to do before cynthia after a little pause at the closed door had knocked and on an answer being given had said without opening the doormolly mr roger hamley is here and wants to wish you goodby before he goes then she went downstairs again as if anxious just at that moment to avoid even so short a ttette with molly with a gulp and a fit of resolution as a child makes up its mind to swallow a nauseous dose of medicine molly went instantly downstairs roger was talking earnestly to mrs gibson in the bow of the window when molly entered cynthia was standing near listening but taking no part in the conversation her eyes were downcast and she did not look up as molly drew shyly near roger was sayingi could never forgive myself if i had accepted a pledge from her she shall be free until my return but the hope the words her sweet goodness have made me happy beyond description oh molly suddenly becoming aware of her presence and turning to her and taking her hand in both of hisi think you have long guessed my secret have you not i once thought of speaking to you before i left and confiding it all to you but the temptation has been too greati have told cynthia how fondly i love her as far as words can tell and she says then he looked at cynthia with passionate delight and seemed to forget in that gaze that he had left his sentence to molly half finished cynthia did not seem inclined to repeat her saying whatever it was but her mother spoke for her my dear sweet girl values your love as it ought to be valued i am sure and i believe looking at cynthia and roger with intelligent archness i could tell tales as to the cause of her indisposition in the spring mother said cynthia suddenly you know it was no such thing pray dont invent stories about me i have engaged myself to mr roger hamley and that is enough enough more than enough said roger i will not accept your pledge i am bound but you are free i like to feel bound it makes me happy and at peace but with all the chances involved in the next two years you must not shackle yourself by promises cynthia did not speak at once she was evidently revolving something in her own mind mrs gibson took up the word you are very generous i am sure perhaps it will be better not to mention it i would much rather have it kept a secret said cynthia interrupting certainly my dear love that was just what i was going to say i once knew a young lady who heard of the death of a young man in america whom she had known pretty well and she immediately said she had been engaged to him and even went so far as to put on weeds and it was a false report for he came back well and merry and declared to everybody he had never so much as thought about her so it was very awkward for her these things had much better be kept secret until the proper time has come for divulging them even then and there cynthia could not resist the temptation of sayingmamma i will promise you i wont put on weeds whatever reports come of mr roger hamley roger please he put in in a tender whisper and you will all be witnesses that he has professed to think of me if he is tempted afterwards to deny the fact but at the same time i wish it to be kept a secret until his returnand i am sure you will all be so kind as to attend to my wish please roger please molly mamma i must especially beg it of you roger would have granted anything when she asked him by that name and in that tone he took her hand in silent pledge of his reply molly felt as if she could never bring herself to name the affair as a common piece of news so it was only mrs gibson that answered aloud my dear child why especially to poor me you know im the most trustworthy person alive the little pendule on the chimneypiece struck the halfhour i must go said roger in dismay i had no idea it was so late i shall write from paris the coach will be at the george by this time and will only stay five minutes dearest cynthia he took her hand and then as if the temptation was irresistible he drew her to him and kissed her only remember you are free said he as he released her and passed on to mrs gibson if i had considered myself free said cynthia blushing a little but ready with her repartee to the lastif i had thought myself free do you think i would have allowed that then mollys turn came and the old brotherly tenderness came back into his look his voice his bearing molly you wont forget me i know i shall never forget you nor your goodness toher his voice began to quiver and it was best to be gone mrs gibson was pouring out unheard and unheeded words of farewell cynthia was rearranging some flowers in a vase on the table the defects in which had caught her artistic eye without the consciousness penetrating to her mind molly stood numb to the heart neither glad nor sorry nor anything but stunned she felt the slackened touch of the warm grasping hand she looked upfor till now her eyes had been downcast as if there were heavy weights to their lidsand the place was empty where he had been his quick step was heard on the stair the front door was opened and shut and then as quick as lightning molly ran up to the front atticthe lumberroom whose window commanded the street down which he must pass the windowclasp was unused and stiff molly tugged at itunless it was open and her head put out that last chance would be gone i must see him again i must i must she wailed out as she was pulling there he was running hard to catch the london coach his luggage had been left at the george before he came up to wish the gibsons goodby in all his hurry molly saw him turn round and shade his eyes from the level rays of the westering sun and rake the house with his glancesin hopes she knew of catching one more glimpse of cynthia but apparently he saw no one not even molly at the attic casement for she had drawn back when he had turned and kept herself in shadow for she had no right to put herself forward as the one to watch and yearn for farewell signs none cameanother momenthe was out of sight for years illustration the last turning she shut the window softly and shivered all over she left the attic and went to her own room but she did not begin to take off her outofdoor things till she heard cynthias foot on the stairs then she hastily went to the toilettable and began to untie her bonnetstrings but they were in a knot and took time to undo cynthias step stopped at mollys door she opened it a little and saidmay i come in molly certainly said molly longing to be able to say no all the time molly did not turn to meet her so cynthia came up behind her and putting her two hands round mollys waist peeped over her shoulder putting out her lips to be kissed molly could not resist the actionthe mute entreaty for a caress but in the moment before she had caught the reflection of the two faces in the glass her own redeyed pale with lips dyed with blackberry juice her curls tangled her bonnet pulled awry her gown tornand contrasted it with cynthias brightness and bloom and the trim elegance of her dress oh it is no wonder thought poor molly as she turned round and put her arms round cynthia and laid her head for an instant on her shoulderthe weary aching head that sought a loving pillow in that supreme moment the next she had raised herself and taken cynthias two hands and was holding her off a little the better to read her face illustration oh it is no wonder cynthia you do love him dearly dont you cynthia winced a little aside from the penetrating steadiness of those eyes you speak with all the solemnity of an adjuration molly said she laughing a little at first to cover her nervousness and then looking up at molly dont you think ive given a proof of it but you know ive often told you ive not the gift of loving i said pretty much the same thing to him i can respect and i fancy i can admire and i can like but i never feel carried off my feet by love for any one not even for you little molly and im sure i love you more than no dont said molly putting her hand before cynthias mouth in almost a passion of impatience dont donti wont hear youi ought not to have asked youit makes you tell lies why molly said cynthia in her turn seeking to read mollys face whats the matter with you one might think you cared for him yourself i said molly all the blood rushing to her heart suddenly then it returned and she had courage to speak and she spoke the truth as she believed it though not the real actual truth i do care for him i think you have won the love of a prince amongst men why i am proud to remember that he has been to me as a brother and i love him as a sister and i love you doubly because he has honoured you with his love come thats not complimentary said cynthia laughing but not illpleased to hear her lovers praises and even willing to depreciate him a little in order to hear more hes well enough i daresay and a great deal too learned and clever for a stupid girl like me but even you must acknowledge hes very plain and awkward and i like pretty things and pretty people cynthia i wont talk to you about him you know you dont mean what you are saying and you only say it out of contradiction because i praise him he shant be run down by you even in joke well then we wont talk of him at all i was so surprised when he began to speakso and cynthia looked very lovely blushing and dimpling up as she remembered his words and looks suddenly she recalled herself to the present time and her eye caught on the leaf full of blackberriesthe broad green leaf so fresh and crisp when molly had gathered it an hour or so ago but now soft and flabby and dying molly saw it too and felt a strange kind of sympathetic pity for the poor inanimate leaf oh what blackberries youve gathered them for me i know said cynthia sitting down and beginning to feed herself daintily touching them lightly with the ends of her taper fingers and dropping each ripe berry into her open mouth when she had eaten about half she stopped suddenly short how i should like to have gone as far as paris with him she exclaimed i suppose it wouldnt have been proper but how pleasant it would have been i remember at boulogne another blackberry how i used to envy the english who were going to paris it seemed to me then as if nobody stopped at boulogne but dull stupid schoolgirls when will he be there asked molly on wednesday he said im to write to him there at any rate hes going to write to me molly went about the adjustment of her dress in a quiet businesslike manner not speaking much cynthia although sitting still seemed very restless oh how much molly wished that she would go perhaps after all said cynthia after a pause of apparent meditation we shall never be married why do you say that said molly almost bitterly you have nothing to make you think so i wonder how you can bear to think you wont even for a moment oh said cynthia you mustnt go and take me au grand srieux i daresay i dont mean what i say but you see everything seems a dream at present still i think the chances are equalthe chances for and against our marriage i mean two years its a long time he may change his mind or i may or some one else may turn up and i may get engaged to him what should you think of that molly im putting such a gloomy thing as death quite on one side you see yet in two years how much may happen dont talk so cynthia please dont said molly piteously one would think you didnt care for him and he cares so much for you why did i say i didnt care for him i was only calculating chances im sure i hope nothing will happen to prevent the marriage only you know it may and i thought i was taking a step in wisdom in looking forward to all the evils that might befall im sure all the wise people ive ever known thought it a virtue to have gloomy prognostics of the future but youre not in a mood for wisdom or virtue i see so ill go and get ready for dinner and leave you to your vanities of dress she took mollys face in both her hands before molly was aware of her intention and kissed it playfully then she left molly to herself chapter xxxv the mothers manoeuvre mr gibson was not at home at dinnerdetained by some patient most probably this was not an unusual occurrence but it was rather an unusual occurrence for mrs gibson to go down into the diningroom and sit with him as he ate his deferred meal when he came in an hour or two later in general she preferred her easychair or her corner of the sofa upstairs in the drawingroom though it was very rarely that she would allow molly to avail herself of her stepmothers neglected privilege molly would fain have gone down and kept her father company every night that he had these solitary meals but for peace and quietness she gave up her own wishes on the matter mrs gibson took a seat by the fire in the diningroom and patiently waited for the auspicious moment when mr gibson having satisfied his healthy appetite turned from the table and took his place by her side she got up and with unaccustomed attention moved the wine and glasses so that he could help himself without moving from his chair there now are you comfortable for i have a great piece of news to tell you said she when all was arranged i thought there was something on hand said he smiling now for it roger hamley has been here this afternoon to bid us goodby goodby is he gone i didnt know he was going so soon exclaimed mr gibson yes never mind thats not it but tell me has he left this neighbourhood i wanted to have seen him yes yes he left love and regret and all that sort of thing for you now let me get on with my story he found cynthia alone proposed to her and was accepted cynthia roger proposed to her and she accepted him repeated mr gibson slowly yes to be sure why not you speak as if it was something so very surprising did i but i am surprised hes a very fine young fellow and i wish cynthia joy but do you like it it will have to be a very long engagement perhaps said she in a knowing manner at any rate he will be away for two years said mr gibson a great deal may happen in two years she replied yes he will have to run many risks and go into many dangers and will come back no nearer to the power of maintaining a wife than when he went out i dont know that she replied still in the arch manner of one possessing superior knowledge a little bird did tell me that osbornes life is not so very secure and thenwhat will roger be heir to the estate who told you that about osborne said he facing round upon her and frightening her with his sudden sternness of voice and manner it seemed as if absolute fire came out of his long dark sombre eyes who told you i say she made a faint rally back into her former playfulness why can you deny it is it not the truth i ask you again hyacinth who told you that osborne hamleys life is in more danger than mineor yours oh dont speak in that frightening way my life is not in danger im sure nor yours either love i hope he gave an impatient movement and knocked a wineglass off the table for the moment she felt grateful for the diversion and busied herself in picking up the fragments bits of glass were so dangerous she said but she was startled by a voice of command such as she had never yet heard from her husband never mind the glass i ask you again hyacinth who told you anything about osborne hamleys state of health i am sure i wish no harm to him and i daresay he is in very good health as you say whispered she at last who told began he again sterner than ever well if you will know and will make such a fuss about it said she driven to extremity it was you yourselfyou or dr nicholls i am sure i forget which i never spoke to you on the subject and i dont believe nicholls did youd better tell me at once what youre alluding to for im resolved ill have it out before we leave this room i wish id never married again she said now fairly crying and looking round the room as if in vain search for a mousehole in which to hide herself then as if the sight of the door into the storeroom gave her courage she turned and faced him you should not talk your medical secrets so loud then if you dont want people to hear them i had to go into the storeroom that day dr nicholls was here cook wanted a jar of preserve and stopped me just as i was going outi am sure it was for no pleasure of mine for i was sadly afraid of stickying my glovesit was all that you might have a comfortable dinner she looked as if she was going to cry again but he gravely motioned her to go on merely saying well you overheard our conversation i suppose not much she answered eagerly almost relieved by being thus helped out in her forced confession only a sentence or two what were they he asked why you had just been saying something and dr nicholls said if he has got aneurism of the aorta his days are numbered well anything more yes you said i hope to god i may be mistaken but there is a pretty clear indication of symptoms in my opinion how do you know we were speaking of osborne hamley he asked perhaps in hopes of throwing her off the scent but as soon as she perceived that he was descending to her level of subterfuge she took courage and said in quite a different tone to the cowed one which she had been using oh i know i heard his name mentioned by you both before i began to listen then you own you did listen yes said she hesitating a little now and pray how do you come to remember so exactly the name of the disease spoken of because i wentnow dont be angry i really cant see any harm in what i did then dont deprecate anger you went into the surgery and looked it out why might not i mr gibson did not answerdid not look at her his face was very pale and both forehead and lips were contracted at length he roused himself sighed and said well i suppose as one brews one must bake i dont understand what you mean pouted she perhaps not he replied i suppose that it was what you heard on that occasion that made you change your behaviour to roger hamley ive noticed how much more civil you were to him of late if you mean that i have ever got to like him as much as osborne you are very much mistaken no not even though he has offered to cynthia and is to be my soninlaw let me know the whole affair you overheardi will own that it was osborne about whom we were speaking though i shall have something to say about that presentlyand then if i understand you rightly you changed your behaviour to roger and made him more welcome to this house than you had ever done before regarding him as proximate heir to the hamley estates i dont know what you mean by proximate go into the surgery and look into the dictionary then said he losing his temper for the first time during the conversation i knew said she through sobs and tears that roger had taken a fancy to cynthia any one might see that and as long as roger was only a younger son with no profession and nothing but his fellowship i thought it right to discourage him as any one would who had a grain of common sense in them for a clumsier more common awkward stupid fellow i never sawto be called county i mean take care youll have to eat your words presently when you come to fancy hell have hamley some day no i shant said she not perceiving his exact drift you are vexed now because it is not molly hes in love with and i call it very unjust and unfair to my poor fatherless girl i am sure i have always tried to further mollys interests as if she was my own daughter mr gibson was too indifferent to this accusation to take any notice of it he returned to what was of far more importance to him the point i want to be clear about is this did you or did you not alter your behaviour to roger in consequence of what you overheard of my professional conversation with dr nicholls have you not favoured his suit to cynthia since then on the understanding gathered from that conversation that he stood a good chance of inheriting hamley i suppose i did said she sulkily and if i did i cant see any harm in it that i should be questioned as if i were in a witnessbox he was in love with cynthia long before that conversation and she liked him so much it was not for me to cross the path of true love i dont see how you would have a mother show her love for her child if she may not turn accidental circumstances to her advantage perhaps cynthia might have died if she had been crossed in love her poor father was consumptive dont you know that all professional conversations are confidential that it would be the most dishonourable thing possible for me to betray secrets which i learn in the exercise of my profession yes of course you well and are not you and i one in all these respects you cannot do a dishonourable act without my being inculpated in the disgrace if it would be a deep disgrace for me to betray a professional secret what would it be for me to trade on that knowledge he was trying hard to be patient but the offence was of that class which galled him insupportably i dont know what you mean by trading trading in a daughters affections is the last thing i should do and i should have thought you would be rather glad than otherwise to get cynthia well married and off your hands mr gibson got up and walked about the room his hands in his pockets once or twice he began to speak but he stopped impatiently short without going on i dont know what to say to you he said at length you either cant or wont see what i mean im glad enough to have cynthia here i have given her a true welcome and i sincerely hope she will find this house as much a home as my own daughter does but for the future i must look out of my doors and doublelock the approaches if i am so foolish as to however thats past and gone and it remains with me to prevent its recurrence as far as i can for the future now let us hear the present state of affairs i dont think i ought to tell you anything about it it is a secret just as much as your mysteries are very well you have told me enough for me to act upon which i most certainly shall do it was only the other day i promised the squire to let him know if i suspected anythingany love affair or entanglement much less an engagement between either of his sons and our girls but this is not an engagement he would not let it be so if you would only listen to me i could tell you all only i do hope you wont go and tell the squire and everybody cynthia did so beg that it might not be known it is only my unfortunate frankness that has led me into this scrape i never could keep a secret from those whom i love i must tell the squire i shall not mention it to any one else and do you quite think it was consistent with your general frankness to have overheard what you did and never to have mentioned it to me i could have told you then that dr nicholls opinion was decidedly opposed to mine and that he believed that the disturbance about which i consulted him on osbornes behalf was merely temporary dr nicholls would tell you that osborne is as likely as any man to live and marry and beget children if there was any skill used by mr gibson so to word this speech as to conceal his own opinion mrs gibson was not sharp enough to find it out she was dismayed and mr gibson enjoyed her dismay it restored him to something like his usual frame of mind let us review this misfortune for i see you consider it as such said he no not quite a misfortune said she but certainly if i had known dr nicholls opinion she hesitated you see the advantage of always consulting me he continued gravely here is cynthia engaged not engaged i told you before he would not allow it to be considered an engagement on her part well entangled in a loveaffair with a lad of threeandtwenty with nothing beyond his fellowship and a chance of inheriting an encumbered estate no profession even abroad for two years and i must go and tell his father all about it tomorrow oh dear pray say that if he dislikes it he has only to express his opinion i dont think you can act without cynthia in the affair and if i am not mistaken cynthia will have a pretty stout will of her own on the subject oh i dont think she cares for him very much she is not one to be always falling in love and she does not take things very deeply to heart but of course one would not do anything abruptly two years absence gives one plenty of time to turn oneself in but a little while ago we were threatened with consumption and an early death if cynthias affections were thwarted oh you dear creature how you remember all my silly words it might be you know poor dear mr kirkpatrick was consumptive and cynthia may have inherited it and a great sorrow might bring out the latent seeds at times i am so fearful but i daresay it is not probable for i dont think she takes things very deeply to heart then im quite at liberty to give up the affair acting as cynthias proxy if the squire disapproves of it poor mrs gibson was in a strait at this question no she said at last we cannot give it up i am sure cynthia would not especially if she thought others were acting for her and he really is very much in love i wish he were in osbornes place shall i tell you what i should do said mr gibson in real earnest however it may have been brought about here are two young people in love with each other one is as fine a young fellow as ever breathed the other a very pretty lively agreeable girl the father of the young man must be told and it is most likely he will bluster and oppose for there is no doubt it is an imprudent affair as far as money goes but let them be steady and patient and a better lot need await no young woman i only wish it were mollys good fortune to meet with such another i will try for her i will indeed said mrs gibson relieved by his change of tone no dont thats one thing i forbid ill have no trying for molly well dont be angry dear do you know i was quite afraid you were going to lose your temper at one time it would have been of no use said he gloomily getting up as if to close the sitting his wife was only too glad to make her escape the conjugal interview had not been satisfactory to either mr gibson had been compelled to face and acknowledge the fact that the wife he had chosen had a very different standard of conduct from that which he had upheld all his life and had hoped to have seen inculcated in his daughter he was more irritated than he chose to show for there was so much of selfreproach in his irritation that he kept it to himself brooded over it and allowed a feeling of suspicious dissatisfaction with his wife to grow up in his mind which extended itself byandby to the innocent cynthia and caused his manner to both mother and daughter to assume a certain curt severity which took the latter at any rate with extreme surprise but on the present occasion he followed his wife up to the drawingroom and gravely congratulated the astonished cynthia has mamma told you said she shooting an indignant glance at her mother it is hardly an engagement and we all pledged ourselves to keep it a secret mamma among the rest but my dearest cynthia you could not expectyou could not have wished me to keep a secret from my husband pleaded mrs gibson no perhaps not at any rate sir said cynthia turning towards him with graceful frankness i am glad you should know it you have always been a most kind friend to me and i daresay i should have told you myself but i did not want it named if you please it must still be a secret in fact it is hardly an engagementhe she blushed and sparkled a little at the euphuism which implied that there was but one he present in her thoughts at the moment would not allow me to bind myself by any promise until his return mr gibson looked gravely at her irresponsive to her winning looks which at the moment reminded him too forcibly of her mothers ways then he took her hand and said seriously enoughi hope you are worthy of him cynthia for you have indeed drawn a prize i have never known a truer or warmer heart than rogers and i have known him boy and man molly felt as if she could have thanked her father aloud for this testimony to the value of him who was gone away but cynthia pouted a little before she smiled up in his face you are not complimentary are you mr gibson said she he thinks me worthy i suppose and if you have so high an opinion of him you ought to respect his judgment of me if she hoped to provoke a compliment she was disappointed for mr gibson let go her hand in an absent manner and sate down in an easy chair by the fire gazing at the wood embers as if hoping to read the future in them molly saw cynthias eyes fill with tears and followed her to the other end of the room where she had gone to seek some working materials dear cynthia was all she said but she pressed her hand while trying to assist in the search oh molly i am so fond of your father what makes him speak so to me tonight i dont know said molly perhaps hes tired they were recalled from further conversation by mr gibson he had roused himself from his reverie and was now addressing cynthia i hope you will not consider it a breach of confidence cynthia but i must tell the squire ofof what has taken place today between you and his son i have bound myself by a promise to him he was afraidits as well to tell you the truthhe was afraid an emphasis on this last word of something of this kind between his sons and one of you two girls it was only the other day i assured him there was nothing of the kind on foot and i told him then i would inform him at once if i saw any symptoms cynthia looked extremely annoyed it was the one thing i stipulated forsecrecy but why said mr gibson i can understand your not wishing to have it made public under the present circumstances but the nearest friends on both sides surely you can have no objection to that yes i have said cynthia i would not have had any one know if i could have helped it im almost certain roger will tell his father no he wont said cynthia i made him promise and i think he is one to respect a promisewith a glance at her mother who feeling herself in disgrace with both husband and child was keeping a judicious silence well at any rate the story would come with so much better a grace from him that i shall give him the chance i wont go over to the hall till the end of the week he may have written and told his father before then cynthia held her tongue for a little while then she said with tearful pettishness a mans promise is to override a womans wish then is it i dont see any reason why it should not will you trust in my reasons when i tell you it will cause me a great deal of distress if it gets known she said this in so pleading a voice that if mr gibson had not been thoroughly displeased and annoyed by his previous conversation with her mother he must have yielded to her as it was he said coldlytelling rogers father is not making it public i dont like this exaggerated desire for such secrecy cynthia it seems to me as if something more than is apparent was concealed behind it come molly said cynthia suddenly let us sing that duet ive been teaching you its better than talking as we are doing it was a little lively french duet molly sang it carelessly with heaviness at her heart but cynthia sang it with spirit and apparent merriment only she broke down in hysterics at last and flew upstairs to her own room molly heeding nothing elseneither her father nor mrs gibsons wordsfollowed her and found the door of her bedroom locked and for all reply to her entreaties to be allowed to come in she heard cynthia sobbing and crying it was more than a week after the incidents just recorded before mr gibson found himself at liberty to call on the squire and he heartily hoped that long before then rogers letter might have arrived from paris telling his father the whole story but he saw at the first glance that the squire had heard nothing unusual to disturb his equanimity he was looking better than he had done for months past the light of hope was in his eyes his face seemed of a healthy ruddy colour gained partly by his resumption of outdoor employment in the superintendence of the works and partly because the happiness he had lately had through rogers means caused his blood to flow with regular vigour he had felt rogers going away it is true but whenever the sorrow of parting with him pressed too heavily upon him he filled his pipe and smoked it out over a long slow deliberate reperusal of lord hollingfords letter every word of which he knew by heart but expressions in which he made a pretence to himself of doubting that he might have an excuse for looking at his sons praises once again the first greetings over mr gibson plunged into his subject any news from roger yet oh yes heres his letter said the squire producing his black leather case in which rogers missive had been placed along with the other very heterogeneous contents mr gibson read it hardly seeing the words after he had by one rapid glance assured himself that there was no mention of cynthia in it hum i see he doesnt name one very important event that has befallen him since he left you said mr gibson seizing on the first words that came i believe im committing a breach of confidence on one side but im going to keep the promise i made the last time i was here i find there is somethingsomething of the kind you apprehendedyou understandbetween him and my stepdaughter cynthia kirkpatrick he called at our house to wish us goodby while waiting for the london coach found her alone and spoke to her they dont call it an engagement but of course it is one give me back the letter said the squire in a constrained kind of voice then he read it again as if he had not previously mastered its contents and as if there might be some sentence or sentences he had overlooked no he said at last with a sigh he tells me nothing about it lads may play at confidences with their fathers but they keep a deal back the squire appeared more disappointed at not having heard of this straight from roger than displeased at the fact itself mr gibson thought but he let him take his time hes not the eldest son continued the squire talking as it were to himself but its not the match i should have planned for him how came you sir said he firing round on mr gibson suddenlyto say when you were last here that there was nothing between my sons and either of your girls why this must have been going on all the time im afraid it was but i was as ignorant about it as the babe unborn i only heard of it on the evening of the day of rogers departure and thats a week ago sir whats kept you quiet ever since i thought that roger would tell you himself that shows youve no sons more than half their life is unknown to their fathers why osborne there we live togetherthats to say we have our meals together and we sleep under the same roofand yetwell well life is as god has made it you say its not an engagement yet but i wonder what im doing hoping for my lads disappointment in the folly hes set his heart onand just when hes been helping me is it a folly or is it not i ask you gibson for you must know this girl she hasnt much money i suppose about thirty pounds a year at my pleasure during her mothers life whew its well hes not osborne theyll have to wait what family is she of none of em in trade i reckon from her being so poor i believe her father was grandson of a certain sir gerald kirkpatrick her mother tells me it is an old baronetcy i know nothing of such things thats something i do know something of such things as you are pleased to call them i like honourable blood mr gibson could not help saying but im afraid that only oneeighth of cynthias blood is honourable i know nothing further of her relations excepting the fact that her father was a curate professional thats a step above trade at any rate how old is she eighteen or nineteen pretty yes i think so most people do but its all a matter of taste come squire judge for yourself ride over and take lunch with us any day you like i may not be in but her mother will be there and you can make acquaintance with your sons future wife this was going too fast however presuming too much on the quietness with which the squire had been questioning him mr hamley drew back within his shell and spoke in a surly manner as he replied rogers future wife hell be wiser by the time he comes home two years among the black folk will have put more sense in him possible but not probable i should say replied mr gibson black folk are not remarkable for their powers of reasoning i believe so that they havent much chance of altering his opinion by argument even if they understood each others language and certainly if he shares my taste their peculiarity of complexion will only make him appreciate white skins the more but you said it was no engagement growled the squire if he thinks better of it you wont keep him to it will you if he wishes to break it off i shall certainly advise cynthia to be equally willing thats all i can say and i see no reason for discussing the affair further at present ive told you how matters stand because i promised you i would if i saw anything of this kind going on but in the present condition of things we can neither make nor mar we can only wait and he took up his hat to go but the squire was discontented dont go gibson dont take offence at what ive said though im sure i dont know why you should whats the girl like in herself i dont know what you mean said mr gibson but he did only he was vexed and did not choose to understand is shewell is she like your mollysweettempered and sensiblewith her gloves always mended and neat about the feet and ready to do anything one asks her just as if doing it was the very thing she liked best in the world mr gibsons face relaxed now and he could understand all the squires broken sentences and unexplained meanings she is much prettier than molly to begin with and has very winning ways shes always welldressed and smartlooking and i know she hasnt much to spend on her clothes and always does what shes asked to do and is ready enough with her pretty lively answers i dont think i ever saw her out of temper but then im not sure if she takes things keenly to heart and a certain obtuseness of feeling goes a great way towards a character for good temper ive observed altogether i think cynthia is one in a hundred the squire meditated a little your molly is one in a thousand to my mind but then you see she comes of no family at alland i dont suppose shell have a chance of much money this he said as if he were thinking aloud and without reference to mr gibson but it nettled the latter and he replied somewhat impatiently well but as theres no question of molly in this business i dont see the use of bringing her name in and considering either her family or her fortune no to be sure not said the squire rousing up my wits had gone far afield and ill own i was only thinking what a pity it was she wouldnt do for osborne but of course its out of the questionout of the question yes said mr gibson and if you will excuse me squire i really must go now and then youll be at liberty to send your wits afield uninterrupted this time he was at the door before the squire called him back he stood impatiently hitting his topboots with his ridingwhip waiting for the interminable last words i say gibson were old friends and youre a fool if you take anything i say as an offence madam your wife and i didnt hit it off the only time i ever saw her i wont say she was silly but i think one of us was silly and it wasnt me however well pass that over suppose you bring her and this girl cynthia which is as outlandish a christian name as id wish to hear and little molly out here to lunch some dayim more at my ease in my own houseand im more sure to be civil too we need say nothing about rogerneither the lass nor meand you keep your wifes tongue quiet if you can it will only be like a compliment to you on your marriage you knowand no one must take it for anything more mind no allusion or mention of roger and this piece of folly i shall see the girl then and i can judge her for myself for as you say that will be the best plan osborne will be here too and hes always in his element talking to women i sometimes think hes half a woman himself he spends so much money and is so unreasonable the squire was pleased with his own speech and his own thought and smiled a little as he finished speaking mr gibson was both pleased and amused and he smiled too anxious as he was to be gone the next thursday was soon fixed upon as the day on which mr gibson was to bring his womenkind out to the hall he thought that on the whole the interview had gone off a good deal better than he had expected and felt rather proud of the invitation of which he was the bearer therefore mrs gibsons manner of receiving it was an annoyance to him she meanwhile had been considering herself as an injured woman ever since the evening of the day of rogers departure what business had any one had to speak as if the chances of osbornes life being prolonged were infinitely small if in fact the matter was uncertain she liked osborne extremely much better than roger and would gladly have schemed to secure him for cynthia if she had not shrunk from the notion of her daughters becoming a widow for if mrs gibson had ever felt anything acutely it was the death of mr kirkpatrick and amiably callous as she was in most things she recoiled from exposing her daughter wilfully to the same kind of suffering which she herself had experienced but if she had only known dr nicholls opinion she would never have favoured rogers suit never and then mr gibson himself why was he so cold and reserved in his treatment of her since that night of explanation she had done nothing wrong yet she was treated as though she were in disgrace and everything about the house was flat just now she even missed the little excitement of rogers visits and the watching of his attentions to cynthia cynthia too was silent enough and as for molly she was absolutely dull and out of spirits a state of mind so annoying to mrs gibson just now that she vented some of her discontent upon the poor girl from whom she feared neither complaint nor repartee chapter xxxvi domestic diplomacy the evening of the day on which mr gibson had been to see the squire the three women were alone in the drawingroom for mr gibson had had a long round and was not as yet come in they had had to wait dinner for him and for some time after his return there was nothing done or said but what related to the necessary business of eating mr gibson was perhaps as well satisfied with his days work as any of the four for this visit to the squire had been weighing on his mind ever since he had heard of the state of things between roger and cynthia he did not like the having to go and tell of a loveaffair so soon after he had declared his belief that no such thing existed it was a confession of fallibility which is distasteful to most men if the squire had not been of so unsuspicious and simple a nature he might have drawn his own conclusions from the apparent concealment of facts and felt doubtful of mr gibsons perfect honesty in the business but being what he was there was no danger of such unjust misapprehension still mr gibson knew the hot hasty temper he had to deal with and had expected more violence of language than he really encountered and the last arrangement by which cynthia her mother and mollywho as mr gibson thought to himself and smiled at the thought was sure to be a peacemaker and a sweetener of intercoursewere to go to the hall and make acquaintance with the squire appeared like a great success to mr gibson for achieving which he took not a little credit to himself altogether he was more cheerful and bland than he had been for many days and when he came up into the drawingroom for a few minutes after dinner before going out again to see his town patients he whistled a little under his breath as he stood with his back to the fire looking at cynthia and thinking that he had not done her justice when describing her to the squire now this soft almost tuneless whistling was to mr gibson what purring is to a cat he could no more have done it with an anxious case on his mind or when he was annoyed by human folly or when he was hungry than he could have flown through the air molly knew all this by instinct and was happy without being aware of it as soon as she heard the low whistle which was no music after all but mrs gibson did not like this trick of her husbands it was not refined she thought not even artistic if she could have called it by this fine word it would have compensated her for the want of refinement tonight it was particularly irritating to her nerves but since her conversation with mr gibson about cynthias engagement she had not felt herself in a sufficiently good position to complain mr gibson beganwell cynthia ive seen the squire today and made a clean breast of it cynthia looked up quickly questioning with her eyes molly stopped her netting to listen no one spoke youre all to go there on thursday to lunch he asked you all and i promised for you still no reply natural perhaps but very flat youll be glad of that cynthia shant you asked mr gibson it may be a little formidable but i hope it will be the beginning of a good understanding between you thank you said she with an effort butbut wont it make it public i do so wish not to have it known or talked about not till he comes back or close upon the marriage i dont see how it should make it public said mr gibson my wife goes to lunch with my friend and takes her daughters with hertheres nothing in that is there i am not sure that i shall go put in mrs gibson she did not know why she said it for she fully intended to go all the time but having said it she was bound to stick to it for a little while and with such a husband as hers the hard necessity was sure to fall upon her of having to find a reason for her saying then it came quick and sharp why not said he turning round upon her oh becausebecause i think he ought to have called on cynthia first ive that sort of sensitiveness i cant bear to think of her being slighted because she is poor nonsense said mr gibson i do assure you no slight whatever was intended he does not wish to speak about the engagement to any onenot even to osbornethats your wish too isnt it cynthia nor does he intend to mention it to any of you when you go there but naturally enough he wants to make acquaintance with his future daughterinlaw if he deviated so much from his usual course as to come calling here i am sure i dont want him to come calling here said mrs gibson interrupting he was not so very agreeable the only time he did come but i am that sort of a character that i cannot put up with any neglect of persons i love just because they are not smiled upon by fortune she sighed a little ostentatiously as she ended her sentence well then you wont go said mr gibson provoked but not wishing to have a long discussion especially as he felt his temper going do you wish it cynthia said mrs gibson anxious for an excuse to yield but her daughter was quite aware of this motive for the question and replied quietlynot particularly mamma i am quite willing to refuse the invitation it is already accepted said mr gibson almost ready to vow that he would never again meddle in any affair in which women were concerned which would effectually shut him out from all loveaffairs for the future he had been touched by the squires relenting pleased with what he had thought would give others pleasure and this was the end of it oh do go cynthia said molly pleading with her eyes as well as her words do i am sure you will like the squire and it is such a pretty place and hell be so much disappointed i should not like to give up my dignity said cynthia demurely and you heard what mamma said it was very malicious of her she fully intended to go and was equally sure that her mother was already planning her dress for the occasion in her own mind mr gibson however who surgeon though he was had never learnt to anatomize a womans heart took it all literally and was excessively angry both with cynthia and her mother so angry that he did not dare to trust himself to speak he went quickly to the door intending to leave the room but his wifes voice arrested him she said my dear do you wish me to go if you do i will put my own feelings on one side of course i do he said short and stern and left the room then ill go said she in the voice of a victimthose words were meant for him but he hardly heard them and well have a fly from the george and get a liverycoat for thomas which ive long been wanting only dear mr gibson did not like it but on an occasion like this im sure he wont mind and thomas shall go on the box and but mamma ive my feelings too said cynthia nonsense child when all is so nicely arranged too so they went on the day appointed mr gibson was aware of the change of plans and that they were going after all but he was so much annoyed by the manner in which his wife had received an invitation that appeared to him so much kinder than he had expected from his previous knowledge of the squire and his wishes on the subject of his sons marriage that mrs gibson heard neither interest nor curiosity expressed by her husband as to the visit itself or the reception they met with cynthias indifference as to whether the invitation was accepted or not had displeased mr gibson he was not up to her ways with her mother and did not understand how much of this said indifference had been assumed in order to countervent mrs gibsons affectation and false sentiment but for all his annoyance on the subject he was in fact very curious to know how the visit had gone off and took the first opportunity of being alone with molly to question her about the lunch of the day before at hamley hall and so you went to hamley yesterday after all yes i thought you would have come the squire seemed quite to expect you i thought of going there at first but i changed my mind like other people i dont see why women are to have a monopoly of changeableness well how did it go off pleasantly i suppose for both your mother and cynthia were in high spirits last night yes the dear old squire was in his best dress and on his best behaviour and was so prettily attentive to cynthia and she looked so lovely walking about with him and listening to all his talk about the garden and farm mamma was tired and stopped indoors so they got on very well and saw a great deal of each other and my little girl trotted behind oh yes you know i was almost at home and besidesof course molly went very red and left the sentence unfinished do you think shes worthy of him asked her father just as if she had completed her speech of roger papa oh who is but she is very sweet and very very charming very charming if you will but somehow i dont quite understand her why does she want all this secrecy why was she not more eager to go and pay her duty to rogers father she took it as coolly as if id asked her to go to church i dont think she did take it coolly i believe i dont quite understand her either but i love her dearly all the same umph i like to understand people thoroughly but i know its not necessary to women dye really think shes worthy of him oh papa said molly and then she stopped she wanted to speak in favour of cynthia but somehow she could form no reply that pleased her to this repeated inquiry he did not seem much to care whether he got an answer or not for he went on with his own thoughts and the result was that he asked molly if cynthia had heard from roger yes on wednesday morning did she show it to you but of course not besides i read the squires letter which told all about him now cynthia rather to mollys surprise had told her that she might read the letter if she liked and molly had shrunk from availing herself of the permission for rogers sake she thought that he would probably have poured out his heart to the one sole person and that it was not fair to listen as it were to his confidences was osborne at home asked mr gibson the squire said he did not think he would have come back but the young fellow is so uncertain no he was still from home then molly blushed all over crimson for it suddenly struck her that osborne was probably with his wifethat mysterious wife of whose existence she was cognizant but of whom she knew so little and of whom her father knew nothing mr gibson noticed the blush with anxiety what did it mean it was troublesome enough to find that one of the squires precious sons had fallen in love within the prohibited ranks and what would not have to be said and done if anything fresh were to come out between osborne and molly he spoke out at once to relieve himself of this new apprehension molly i was taken by surprise by this affair between cynthia and roger hamleyif theres anything more on the tapis let me know at once honestly and openly i know its an awkward question for you to reply to but i wouldnt ask it unless i had good reasons he took her hand as he spoke she looked up at him with clear truthful eyes which filled with tears as she spoke she did not know why the tears came perhaps it was because she was not so strong as formerly if you mean that youre afraid that osborne thinks of me as roger thinks of cynthia papa you are quite mistaken osborne and i are friends and nothing more and never can be anything more thats all i can tell you its quite enough little one its a great relief i dont want to have my molly carried off by any young man just yet i should miss her sadly he could not help saying this in the fulness of his heart just then but he was surprised at the effect these few tender words produced molly threw her arms round his neck and began to sob bitterly her head lying on his shoulder there there said he patting her on the back and leading her to the sofa that will do i get quite enough of tears in the day shed for real causes not to want them at home where i hope they are shed for no cause at all theres nothing really the matter is there my dear he continued holding her a little away from him that he might look in her face she smiled at him through her tears and he did not see the look of sadness which returned to her face after he had left her nothing dear dear papanothing now it is such a comfort to have you all to myselfit makes me happy mr gibson knew all implied in these words and felt that there was no effectual help for the state of things which had arisen from his own act it was better for them both that they should not speak out more fully so he kissed her and said thats right dear i can leave you in comfort now and indeed ive stayed too long already gossiping go out and have a walktake cynthia with you if you like i must be off goodby little one his commonplace words acted like an astringent on mollys relaxed feelings he intended that they should do so it was the truest kindness to her but he walked away from her with a sharp pang at his heart which he stunned into numbness as soon as he could by throwing himself violently into the affairs and cares of others chapter xxxvii a fluke and what came of it illustration untitled the honour and glory of having a lover of her own was soon to fall to mollys share though to be sure it was a little deduction from the honour that the man who came with the full intention of proposing to her ended by making cynthia an offer it was mr coxe who came back to hollingford to follow out the purpose he had announced to mr gibson nearly two years before of inducing molly to become his wife as soon as he should have succeeded to his uncles estate he was now a rich though still a redhaired young man he came to the george inn bringing his horses and his groom not that he was going to ride much but that he thought such outward signs of his riches might help on his suit and he was so justly modest in his estimation of himself that he believed that he needed all extraneous aid he piqued himself on his constancy and indeed considering that he had been so much restrained by his duty his affection and his expectations to his crabbed old uncle that he had not been able to go much into society and very rarely indeed into the company of young ladies such fidelity to molly was very meritorious at least in his own eyes mr gibson too was touched by it and made it a point of honour to give him a fair field all the time sincerely hoping that molly would not be such a goose as to lend a willing ear to a youth who could never remember the difference between apophysis and epiphysis he thought it as well not to tell his wife more of mr coxes antecedents than that he had been a former pupil who had relinquished all that he knew of understood the medical profession because an old uncle had left him enough of money to be idle mrs gibson who felt that she had somehow lost her place in her husbands favour took it into her head that she could reinstate herself if she was successful in finding a good match for his daughter molly she knew that her husband had forbidden her to try for this end as distinctly as words could express a meaning but her own words so seldom expressed her meaning or if they did she held to her opinions so loosely that she had no idea but that it was the same with other people accordingly she gave mr coxe a very sweet and gracious welcome it is such a pleasure to me to make acquaintance with the former pupils of my husband he has spoken to me so often of you that i quite feel as if you were one of the family as indeed i am sure that mr gibson considers you mr coxe felt much flattered and took the words as a happy omen for his loveaffair is miss gibson in asked he blushing violently i knew her formerlythat is to say i lived in the same house with her for more than two years and it would be a great pleasure toto certainly i am sure she will be so glad to see you i sent her and cynthiayou dont know my daughter cynthia i think mr coxe she and molly are such great friendsout for a brisk walk this frosty day but i think they will soon come back she went on saying agreeable nothings to the young man who received her attentions with a certain complacency but was all the time much more engaged in listening to the wellremembered click at the front doorthe shutting it to again with household care and the sound of the familiar bounding footstep on the stair at last they came cynthia entered first bright and blooming fresh colour in her cheeks and lips fresh brilliance in her eyes she looked startled at the sight of a stranger and for an instant she stopped short at the door as if taken by surprise then in came molly softly behind her smiling happy dimpled but not such a glowing beauty as cynthia oh mr coxe is it you said she going up to him with an outstretched hand and greeting him with simple friendliness yes it seems such a long time since i saw you you are so much grownso muchwell i suppose i mustnt say what he replied speaking hurriedly and holding her hand all the time rather to her discomfiture then mrs gibson introduced her daughter and the two girls spoke of the enjoyment of their walk mr coxe marred his cause in that very first interview if indeed he ever could have had any chance by his precipitancy in showing his feelings and mrs gibson helped him to mar it by trying to assist him molly lost her open friendliness of manner and began to shrink away from him in a way which he thought was a very ungrateful return for all his faithfulness to her these two years past and after all she was not the wonderful beauty his fancy or his love had painted her that miss kirkpatrick was far more beautiful and much easier of access for cynthia put on all her pretty airsher look of intent interest in what any one was saying to her let the subject be what it would as if it was the thing she cared most about in the whole world her unspoken deference in short all the unconscious ways she possessed by instinct of tickling the vanity of men so while molly quietly repelled him cynthia drew him to her by her soft attractive ways and his constancy fell before her charms he was thankful that he had not gone too far with molly and grateful to mr gibson for having prohibited all declarations two years ago for cynthia and cynthia alone could make him happy after a fortnights time during which he had entirely veered round in his allegiance he thought it desirable to speak to mr gibson he did so with a certain sense of exultation in his own correct behaviour in the affair but at the same time feeling rather ashamed of the confession of his own changeableness which was naturally involved now it had so happened that mr gibson had been unusually little at home during the fortnight that mr coxe had ostensibly lodged at the george but in reality had spent the greater part of his time at mr gibsons houseso that he had seen very little of his former pupil and on the whole he had thought him improved especially after mollys manner had made her father pretty sure that mr coxe stood no chance in that quarter but mr gibson was quite ignorant of the attraction which cynthia had had for the young man if he had perceived it he would have nipped it in the bud pretty quickly for he had no notion of any girl even though only partially engaged to one man receiving offers from others if a little plain speaking could prevent it mr coxe had asked for a private interview they were sitting in the old surgery now called the consultingroom but still retaining so much of its former self as to be the last place in which mr coxe could feel himself at ease he was red up to the very roots of his red hair and kept turning his glossy new hat round and round in his fingers unable to find out the proper way of beginning his sentence so at length he plunged in grammar or no grammar mr gibson i daresay youll be surprised im sure i am atat what i want to say but i think its the part of an honourable man as you said yourself sir a year or two ago toto speak to the father first and as you sir stand in the place of a father to miss kirkpatrick i should like to express my feelings my hopes or perhaps i should say wishes in short miss kirkpatrick said mr gibson a good deal surprised yes sir continued mr coxe rushing on now he had got so far i know it may appear inconstant and changeable but i do assure you i came here with a heart as faithful to your daughter as ever beat in a mans bosom i most fully intended to offer myself and all that i had to her acceptance before i left but really sir if you had seen her manner to me every time i endeavoured to press my suit a littleit was more than coy it was absolutely repellent there could be no mistaking itwhile miss kirkpatrick he looked modestly down and smoothed the nap of his hat smiling a little while he did so while miss kirkpatrick repeated mr gibson in such a stern voice that mr coxe landed esquire as he was now felt as much discomfited as he used to do when he was an apprentice and mr gibson had spoken to him in a similar manner i was only going to say sir that so far as one can judge from manner and willingness to listen and apparent pleasure in my visitsaltogether i think i may venture to hope that miss kirkpatrick is not quite indifferent to meand i would waityou have no objection have you sir to my speaking to her i mean said mr coxe a little anxious at the expression on mr gibsons face i do assure you i havent a chance with miss gibson he continued not knowing what to say and fancying that his inconstancy was rankling in mr gibsons mind no i dont suppose you have dont go and fancy it is that which is annoying me youre mistaken about miss kirkpatrick however i dont believe she could ever have meant to give you encouragement mr coxes face grew perceptibly paler his feelings if evanescent were evidently strong i think sir if you could have seen heri dont consider myself vain and manner is so difficult to describe at any rate you can have no objection to my taking my chance and speaking to her of course if you wont be convinced otherwise i can have no objection but if youll take my advice you will spare yourself the pain of a refusal i may perhaps be trenching on confidence but i think i ought to tell you that her affections are otherwise engaged it cannot be said mr coxe mr gibson there must be some mistake i have gone as far as i dared in expressing my feelings and her manner has been most gracious i dont think she could have misunderstood my meaning perhaps she has changed her mind it is possible that after consideration she has learnt to prefer another is it not by another you mean yourself i suppose i can believe in such inconstancy he could not help in his own mind giving a slight sneer at the instance before him but i should be very sorry to think that miss kirkpatrick could be guilty of it but she mayit is a chance will you allow me to see her certainly my poor fellowfor intermingled with a little contempt was a good deal of respect for the simplicity the unworldliness the strength of feeling even though the feeling was evanescenti will send her to you directly thank you sir god bless you for a kind friend mr gibson went upstairs to the drawingroom where he was pretty sure he should find cynthia there she was as bright and careless as usual making up a bonnet for her mother and chattering to molly as she worked cynthia you will oblige me by going down into my consultingroom at once mr coxe wants to speak to you mr coxe said cynthia what can he want with me evidently she answered her own question as soon as it was asked for she coloured and avoided meeting mr gibsons severe uncompromising look as soon as she had left the room mr gibson sat down and took up a new edinburgh lying on the table as an excuse for conversation was there anything in the article that made him say after a minute or two to molly who sat silent and wonderingmolly you must never trifle with the love of an honest man you dont know what pain you may give presently cynthia came back into the drawingroom looking very much confused most likely she would not have returned if she had known that mr gibson was still there but it was such an unheardof thing for him to be sitting in that room in the middle of the day reading or making pretence to read that she had never thought of his remaining he looked up at her the moment she came in so there was nothing for it but putting a bold face on it and going back to her work is mr coxe still downstairs asked mr gibson no he is gone he asked me to give you both his kind regards i believe he is leaving this afternoon cynthia tried to make her manner as commonplace as possible but she did not look up and her voice trembled a little mr gibson went on looking at his book for a few minutes but cynthia felt that more was coming and only wished it would come quickly for the severe silence was very hard to bear it came at last i trust this will never occur again cynthia said he in grave displeasure i should not feel satisfied with the conduct of any girl however free who could receive marked attentions from a young man with complacency and so lead him on to make an offer which she never meant to accept but what must i think of a young woman in your position engagedyet accepting most graciously for that was the way coxe expressed itthe overtures of another man do you consider what unnecessary pain you have given him by your thoughtless behaviour i call it thoughtless but its the mildest epithet i can apply to it i beg that such a thing may not occur again or i shall be obliged to characterize it more severely illustration i trust this will never occur again cynthia molly could not imagine what more severely could be for her fathers manner appeared to her almost cruel in its sternness cynthia coloured up extremely then went pale and at length raised her beautiful appealing eyes full of tears to mr gibson he was touched by that look but he resolved immediately not to be mollified by any of her physical charms of expression but to keep to his sober judgment of her conduct please mr gibson hear my side of the story before you speak so hardly to me i did not mean toto flirt i merely meant to make myself agreeablei cant help doing thatand that goose of a mr coxe seems to have fancied i meant to give him encouragement do you mean that you were not aware that he was falling in love with you mr gibson was melting into a readiness to be convinced by that sweet voice and pleading face well i suppose i must speak truly cynthia blushed and smiledever so littlebut it was a smile and it hardened mr gibsons heart again i did think once or twice that he was becoming a little more complimentary than the occasion required but i hate throwing cold water on people and i never thought he could take it into his silly head to fancy himself seriously in love and to make such a fuss at the last after only a fortnights acquaintance you seem to have been pretty well aware of his silliness i should rather call it simplicity dont you think you should have remembered that it might lead him to exaggerate what you were doing and saying into encouragement perhaps i daresay im all wrong and that he is all right said cynthia piqued and pouting we used to say in france that les absens ont toujours tort but really it seems as if here she stopped she was unwilling to be impertinent to a man whom she respected and liked she took up another point of her defence and rather made matters worse besides roger would not allow me to consider myself as finally engaged to him i would willingly have done it but he would not let me nonsense dont let us go on talking about it cynthia ive said all that i mean to say i believe that you were only thoughtless as i told you before but dont let it happen again he left the room at once to put a stop to the conversation the continuance of which would serve no useful purpose and perhaps end by irritating him not guilty but we recommend the prisoner not to do it again its pretty much that isnt it molly said cynthia letting her tears downfall even while she smiled i do believe your father might make a good woman of me yet if he would only take the pains and wasnt quite so severe and to think of that stupid little fellow making all this mischief he pretended to take it to heart as if he had loved me for years instead of only for days i daresay only for hours if the truth were told i was afraid he was becoming very fond of you said molly at least it struck me once or twice but i knew he could not stay long and i thought it would only make you uncomfortable if i said anything about it but now i wish i had it wouldnt have made a bit of difference replied cynthia i knew he liked me and i like to be liked its born in me to try to make every one i come near fond of me but then they shouldnt carry it too far for it becomes very troublesome if they do i shall hate redhaired people for the rest of my life to think of such a man as that being the cause of your fathers displeasure with me molly had a question at her tongues end that she longed to put she knew it was indiscreet but at last out it came almost against her will shall you tell roger about it cynthia replied ive not thought about itno i dont think i shalltheres no need perhaps if we are ever married ever married said molly under her breath but cynthia took no notice of the exclamation until she had finished the sentence which it interrupted and i can see his face and know his mood i may tell it him then but not in writing and when he is absent it might annoy him i am afraid it would make him uncomfortable said molly simply and yet it must be so pleasant to be able to tell him everythingall your difficulties and troubles yes only i dont worry him with these things its better to write him merry letters and cheer him up among the black folk you repeated ever married a little while ago do you know molly i dont think i ever shall be married to him i dont know why but i have a strong presentiment so its just as well not to tell him all my secrets for it would be awkward for him to know them if it never came off molly dropped her work and sat silent looking into the future at length she said i think it would break his heart cynthia nonsense why im sure that mr coxe came here with the intention of falling in love with youyou neednt blush so violently im sure you saw it as plainly as i did only you made yourself disagreeable and i took pity on him and consoled his wounded vanity can youdo you dare to compare roger hamley to mr coxe asked molly indignantly no no i dont said cynthia in a moment they are as different as men can be dont be so dreadfully serious over everything molly you look as oppressed with sad reproach as if i had been passing on to you the scolding your father gave me because i dont think you value roger as you ought cynthia said molly stoutly for it required a good deal of courage to force herself to say this although she could not tell why she shrank so from speaking yes i do its not in my nature to go into ecstasies and i dont suppose i shall ever be what people call in love but i am glad he loves me and i like to make him happy and i think him the best and most agreeable man i know always excepting your father when he isnt angry with me what can i say more molly would you like me to say i think him handsome i know most people think him plain but well im of the opinion of most people then and small blame to them but i like his faceoh ten thousand times better than mr prestons handsomeness for the first time during the conversation cynthia seemed thoroughly in earnest why mr preston was introduced neither she nor molly knew it came up and out by a sudden impulse but a fierce look came into the eyes and the soft lips contracted themselves as cynthia named his name molly had noticed this look before always at the mention of this one person cynthia what makes you dislike mr preston so much dont you why do you ask me and yet molly said she suddenly relaxing into depression not merely in tone and look but in the droop of her limbsmolly what should you think of me if i married him after all married him has he ever asked you but cynthia instead of replying to this question went on uttering her own thoughtsmore unlikely things have happened have you never heard of strong wills mesmerizing weaker ones into submission one of the girls at madame lefevres went out as a governess to a russian family who lived near moscow i sometimes think ill write to her to find me a situation in russia just to get out of the daily chance of seeing that man but sometimes you seem quite intimate with him and talk to him how can i help it said cynthia impatiently then recovering herself she added we knew him so well at ashcombe and hes not a man to be easily thrown off i can tell you i must be civil to him its not from liking and he knows its not for ive told him so however we wont talk about him i dont know how we came to do it im sure the mere fact of his existence and of his being within half a mile of us is bad enough oh i wish roger was at home and rich and could marry me at once and carry me away from that man if id thought of it i really believe i would have taken poor redhaired mr coxe i dont understand it at all said molly i dislike mr preston but i should never think of taking such violent steps as you speak of to get away from the neighbourhood in which he lives no because you are a reasonable little darling said cynthia resuming her usual manner and coming up to molly and kissing her at least youll acknowledge im a good hater yes but still i dont understand it oh never mind there are old complications with our affairs at ashcombe money matters are at the root of it all horrid povertydo let us talk of something else or better still let me go and finish my letter to roger or i shall be too late for the african mail isnt it gone oh i ought to have reminded you it will be too late did you not see the notice at the postoffice that letters ought to be in london on the morning of the th instead of the evening oh i am so sorry so am i but it cant be helped it is to be hoped it will be the greater treat when he does get it ive a far greater weight on my heart because your father seems so displeased with me i was fond of him and now he is making me quite a coward you see molly continued she a little piteously ive never lived with people with such a high standard of conduct before and i dont quite know how to behave you must learn said molly tenderly youll find roger quite as strict in his notions of right and wrong ah but hes in love with me said cynthia with a pretty consciousness of her power molly turned away her head and was silent it was of no use combating the truth and she tried rather not to feel itnot to feel poor girl that she too had a great weight on her heart into the cause of which she shrank from examining that whole winter long she had felt as if her sun was all shrouded over with grey mist and could no longer shine brightly for her she wakened up in the morning with a dull sense of something being wrong the world was out of joint and if she were born to set it right she did not know how to do it blind herself as she would she could not help perceiving that her father was not satisfied with the wife he had chosen for a long time molly had been surprised at his apparent contentment sometimes she had been unselfish enough to be glad that he was satisfied but still more frequently nature would have its way and she was almost irritated at what she considered his blindness something however had changed him now something that had arisen at the time of cynthias engagement he had become nervously sensitive to his wifes failings and his whole manner had grown dry and sarcastic not merely to her but sometimes to cynthiaand evenbut this very rarely to molly herself he was not a man to go into passions or ebullitions of feeling they would have relieved him even while degrading him in his own eyes but he became hard and occasionally bitter in his speeches and ways molly now learnt to long after the vanished blindness in which her father had passed the first year of his marriage yet there were no outrageous infractions of domestic peace some people might say that mr gibson accepted the inevitable he told himself in more homely phrase that it was no use crying over spilt milk and he from principle avoided all actual dissensions with his wife preferring to cut short a discussion by a sarcasm or by leaving the room moreover mrs gibson had a very tolerable temper of her own and her catlike nature purred and delighted in smooth ways and pleasant quietness she had no great facility for understanding sarcasm it is true it disturbed her but as she was not quick at deciphering any depth of meaning and felt it unpleasant to think about it she forgot it as soon as possible yet she saw she was often in some kind of disfavour with her husband and it made her uneasy she resembled cynthia in this she liked to be liked and she wanted to regain the esteem which she did not perceive she had lost for ever molly sometimes took her stepmothers part in secret she felt as if she herself could never have borne her fathers hard speeches so patiently they would have cut her to the heart and she must either have demanded an explanation and probed the sore to the bottom or sat down despairing and miserable instead of which mrs gibson after her husband had left the room on these occasions would say in a manner more bewildered than hurt i think dear papa seems a little put out today we must see that he has a dinner that he likes when he comes home i have often perceived that everything depends on making a man comfortable in his own house and thus she went on groping about to find the means of reinstating herself in his good gracesreally trying according to her lights till molly was often compelled to pity her in spite of herself and although she saw that her stepmother was the cause of her fathers increased astringency of disposition for indeed he had got into that kind of exaggerated susceptibility with regard to his wifes faults which may be best typified by the state of bodily irritation that is produced by the constant recurrence of any particular noise those who are brought within hearing of it are apt to be always on the watch for the repetition if they are once made to notice it and are in an irritable state of nerves so that poor molly had not passed a cheerful winter independently of any private sorrows that she might have in her own heart she did not look well either she was gradually falling into low health rather than bad health her heart beat more feebly and slower the vivifying stimulant of hopeeven unacknowledged hopewas gone out of her life it seemed as if there was not and never could be in this world any help for the dumb discordancy between her father and his wife day after day month after month year after year would molly have to sympathize with her father and pity her stepmother feeling acutely for both and certainly more than mrs gibson felt for herself molly could not imagine how she had at one time wished for her fathers eyes to be opened and how she could ever have fancied that if they were he would be able to change things in mrs gibsons character it was all hopeless and the only attempt at a remedy was to think about it as little as possible then cynthias ways and manners about roger gave molly a great deal of uneasiness she did not believe that cynthia cared enough for him at any rate not with the sort of love that she herself would have bestowed if she had been so happyno that was not itif she had been in cynthias place she felt as if she should have gone to him both hands held out full and brimming over with tenderness and been grateful for every word of precious confidence bestowed on her yet cynthia received his letters with a kind of carelessness and read them with a strange indifference while molly sat at her feet so to speak looking up with eyes as wistful as a dogs waiting for crumbs and such chance beneficences she tried to be patient on these occasions but at last she must askwhere is he cynthia what does he say by this time cynthia had put down the letter on the table by her smiling a little from time to time as she remembered the loving compliments it contained where oh i didnt look exactlysomewhere in abyssiniahuon i cant read the word and it doesnt much signify for it would give me no idea is he well asked greedy molly yes now he has had a slight touch of fever he says but its all over now and he hopes he is getting acclimatized of feverand who took care of him he would want nursingand so far from home oh cynthia oh i dont fancy he had any nursing poor fellow one doesnt expect nursing and hospitals and doctors in abyssinia but he had plenty of quinine with him and i suppose that is the best specific at any rate he says he is quite well now molly sat silent for a minute or two what is the date of the letter cynthia i didnt look december thedecember the th thats nearly two months ago said molly yes but i determined i wouldnt worry myself with useless anxiety when he went away if anything didgo wrong you know said cynthia using a euphuism for death as most people do it is an ugly word to speak plain out in the midst of life it would be all over before i even heard of his illness and i could be of no use to himcould i molly no i daresay it is all very true only i should think the squire could not take it so easily i always write him a little note when i hear from roger but i dont think ill name this touch of fevershall i molly i dont know said molly people say one ought but i almost wish i hadnt heard it please does he say anything else that i may hear oh lovers letters are so silly and i think this is sillier than usual said cynthia looking over her letter again heres a piece you may read from that line to that indicating two places i havent read it myself for it looked dullishall about aristotle and plinyand i want to get this bonnetcap made up before we go out to pay our calls molly took the letter the thought crossing her mind that he had touched it had had his hands upon it in those far distant desert lands where he might be lost to sight and to any human knowledge of his fate even now her pretty brown fingers almost caressed the flimsy paper with their delicacy of touch as she read she saw references made to books which with a little trouble would be accessible to her here in hollingford perhaps the details and the references would make the letter dull and dry to some people but not to her thanks to his former teaching and the interest he had excited in her for his pursuits but as he said in apology what had he to write about in that savage land but his love and his researches and travels there was no society no gaiety no new books to write about no gossip in abyssinian wilds molly was not in strong health and perhaps this made her a little fanciful but certain it is that her thoughts by day and her dreams by night were haunted by the idea of roger lying ill and untended in those savage lands her constant prayer o my lord give her the living child and in no wise slay it came from a heart as true as that of the real mother in king solomons judgment let him live let him live even though i may never set eyes upon him again have pity upon his father grant that he may come home safe and live happily with her whom he loves so tenderlyso tenderly o god and then she would burst into tears and drop asleep at last sobbing chapter xxxviii mr kirkpatrick qc cynthia was always the same with molly kind sweettempered ready to help professing a great deal of love for her and probably feeling as much as she did for any one in the world but molly had reached to this superficial depth of affection and intimacy in the first few weeks of cynthias residence in her fathers house and if she had been of a nature prone to analyse the character of one whom she loved dearly she might have perceived that with all cynthias apparent frankness there were certain limits beyond which her confidence did not go where her reserve began and her real self was shrouded in mystery for instance her relations with mr preston were often very puzzling to molly she was sure that there had been a much greater intimacy between them formerly at ashcombe and that the remembrance of this was often very galling and irritating to cynthia who was as evidently desirous of forgetting it as he was anxious to make her remember it but why this intimacy had ceased why cynthia disliked him so extremely now and many other unexplained circumstances connected with these two facts were cynthias secrets and she effectually baffled all mollys innocent attempts during the first glow of her friendship for cynthia to learn the girlish antecedents of her companions life every now and then molly came to a dead wall beyond which she could not passat least with the delicate instruments which were all she chose to use perhaps cynthia might have told all there was to tell to a more forcible curiosity which knew how to improve every slip of the tongue and every fit of temper to its own gratification but mollys was the interest of affection not the coarser desire of knowing everything for a little excitement and as soon as she saw that cynthia did not wish to tell her anything about that period of her life molly left off referring to it but if cynthia had preserved a sweet tranquillity of manner and an unvarying kindness for molly during the winter of which there is question at present she was the only person to whom the beautys ways were unchanged mr gibsons influence had been good for her as long as she saw that he liked her she had tried to keep as high a place in his good opinion as she could and had curbed many a little sarcasm against her mother and many a twisting of the absolute truth when he was by now there was a constant uneasiness about her which made her more cowardly than before and even her partisan molly could not help being aware of the distinct equivocations she occasionally used when anything in mr gibsons words or behaviour pressed her too hard her repartees to her mother were less frequent than they had been but there was often the unusual phenomenon of pettishness in her behaviour to her these changes in humour and disposition here described all at once were in themselves a series of delicate alterations of relative conduct spread over many monthsmany winter months of long evenings and bad weather which bring out discords of character as a dash of cold water brings out the fading colours of an old fresco during much of this time mr preston had been at ashcombe for lord cumnor had not been able to find an agent whom he liked to replace mr preston and while the inferior situation remained vacant mr preston had undertaken to do the duties of both mrs goodenough had had a serious illness and the little society at hollingford did not care to meet while one of their habitual set was scarcely out of danger so there had been very little visiting and though miss browning said that the absence of the temptations of society was very agreeable to cultivated minds after the dissipations of the previous autumn when there were parties every week to welcome mr preston yet miss phoebe let out in confidence that she and her sister had fallen into the habit of going to bed at nine oclock for they found cribbage night after night from five oclock till ten rather too much of a good thing to tell the truth that winter if peaceful was monotonous in hollingford and the whole circle of gentility there was delighted to be stirred up in march by the intelligence that mr kirkpatrick the newlymade qc was coming on a visit for a couple of days to his sisterinlaw mrs gibson mrs goodenoughs room was the very centre of gossip gossip had been her daily bread through her life gossip was meat and wine to her now dearahme said the old lady rousing herself so as to sit upright in her easychair and propping herself with her hands on the arms who would ha thought shed such grand relations why mr ashton told me once that a queens counsel was as like to be a judge as a kitten is like to be a cat and to think of her being as good as a sister to a judge i saw one oncst and i know i thought as i shouldnt wish for a better wintercloak than his old robes would make me if i could only find out where i could get em secondhand and i know shed her silk gowns turned and dyed and cleaned and for aught i know turned again while she lived at ashcombe keeping a school too and so near akin to this queens counsel all the time well to be sure it wasnt much of a schoolonly ten young ladies at the best o times so perhaps he never heard of it ive been wondering what theyll give him to dinner said miss browning it is an unlucky time for visitors no game to be had and lamb so late this year and chicken hardly to be had for love or money hell have to put up with calfs head that he will said mrs goodenough solemnly if id ha got my usual health id copy out a receipt of my grandmothers for a rolled calfs head and send it to mrs gibsonthe doctor has been very kind to me all through this illnessi wish my daughter in combermere would send me some autumn chickensid pass em on to the doctor that i would but shes been akilling of em all and asending of them to me and the last she sent she wrote me word was the last i wonder if theyll give a party for him suggested miss phoebe i should like to see a queens counsel for once in my life i have seen javelinmen but thats the greatest thing in the legal line i ever came across theyll ask mr ashton of course said miss browning the three black graces law physic and divinity as the song calls them whenever theres a second course theres always the clergyman of the parish invited in any family of gentility i wonder if hes married said mrs goodenough miss phoebe had been feeling the same wonder but had not thought it maidenly to express it even to her sister who was the source of knowledge having met mrs gibson in the street on her way to mrs goodenoughs yes hes married and must have several children for mrs gibson said that cynthia kirkpatrick had paid them a visit in london to have lessons with her cousins and she said that his wife was a most accomplished woman and of good family though she brought him no fortune its a very creditable connection im sure its only a wonder to me as how weve heard so little talk of it before said mrs goodenough at the first look of the thing i shouldnt ha thought mrs gibson was one to hide away her fine relations under a bushel indeed for that matter were all of us fond o turning the best breadth o the gown to the front i remember speaking o breadths how ive undone my skirts many a time and oft to put a stain or a greasespot next to poor mr goodenough hed a soft kind of heart when first we was married and he said says he patty link thy right arm into my left one then thoult be nearer to my heart and so we kept up the habit when poor man hed a deal more to think on than romancing on which side his heart lay so as i said i always put my damaged breadths on the right hand and when we walked arm in arm as we always did no one was never the wiser i should not be surprised if he invited cynthia to pay him another visit in london said miss browning if he did it when he was poor hes twenty times more likely to do it now hes a queens counsel ay work it by the rule o three and she stands a good chance i only hope it wont turn her head going up visiting in london at her age why i was fifty before ever i went but she has been in france shes quite a travelled young lady said miss phoebe mrs goodenough shook her head for a whole minute before she gave vent to her opinion its a risk said she a great risk i dont like saying so to the doctor but i shouldnt like having my daughter if i was him so cheekbyjowl with a girl as was brought up in the country where robespierre and bonyparte was born but buonaparte was a corsican said miss browning who was much farther advanced both in knowledge and in liberality of opinions than mrs goodenough and theres a great opportunity for cultivation of the mind afforded by intercourse with foreign countries i always admire cynthias grace of manner never too shy to speak yet never putting herself forwards shes quite a help to a party and if she has a few airs and graces why theyre natural at her age now as for dear molly theres a kind of awkwardness about hershe broke one of our best china cups last time she was at a party at our house and spilt the coffee on the new carpet and then she got so confused that she hardly did anything but sit in a corner and hold her tongue all the rest of the evening she was so sorry for what shed done sister said miss phoebe in a gentle tone of reproach she was always faithful to molly well and did i say she wasnt but was there any need for her to be stupid all the evening after but you were rather sharprather displeased and i think it my duty to be sharp ay and cross too when i see young folks careless and when i see my duty clear i do it im not one to shrink from it and they ought to be grateful to me its not every one that will take the trouble of reproving them as mrs goodenough knows im very fond of molly gibson very for her own sake and for her mothers too im not sure if i dont think shes worth halfadozen cynthias but for all that she shouldnt break my best china teacup and then sit doing nothing for her livelihood all the rest of the evening by this time mrs goodenough gave evident signs of being tired mollys misdemeanors and miss brownings broken teacup were not as exciting subjects of conversation as mrs gibsons newlydiscovered good luck in having a successful london lawyer for a relation mr kirkpatrick had been like many other men struggling on in his profession and encumbered with a large family of his own he was ready to do a good turn for his connections if it occasioned him no loss of time and if which was perhaps a primary condition he remembered their existence cynthias visit to doughty street nine or ten years ago had not made much impression upon him after he had once suggested its feasibility to his goodnatured wife he was even rather startled every now and then by the appearance of a pretty little girl amongst his own children as they trooped in to dessert and had to remind himself who she was but as it was his custom to leave the table almost immediately and to retreat into a small backroom called his study to immerse himself in papers for the rest of the evening the child had not made much impression upon him and probably the next time he remembered her existence was when mrs kirkpatrick wrote to him to beg him to receive cynthia for a night on her way to school at boulogne the same request was repeated on her return but it so happened that he had not seen her either time and only dimly remembered some remarks which his wife had made on one of these occasions that it seemed to her rather hazardous to send so young a girl so long a journey without making more provision for her safety than mrs kirkpatrick had done he knew that his wife would fill up all deficiencies in this respect as if cynthia had been her own daughter and thought no more about her until he received an invitation to attend mrs kirkpatricks wedding with mr gibson the highlyesteemed surgeon of hollingford c can attention which irritated instead of pleasing him does the woman think i have nothing to do but run about the country in search of brides and bridegrooms when this great case of houghton v houghton is coming on and i havent a moment to spare he asked of his wife perhaps she never heard of it suggested mrs kirkpatrick nonsense the case has been in the papers for days but she maynt know you are engaged in it she maynt said he meditativelysuch ignorance was possible but now the great case of houghton v houghton was a thing of the past the hard struggle was over the comparative tableland of q cdom gained and mr kirkpatrick had leisure for family feeling and recollection one day in the easter vacation he found himself near hollingford he had a sunday to spare and he wrote to offer himself as a visitor to the gibsons from friday till monday expressing strongly what he really felt in a less degree his wish to make mr gibsons acquaintance mr gibson though often overwhelmed with professional business was always hospitable and moreover it was always a pleasure to him to get out of the somewhat confined mental atmosphere which he had breathed over and over again and have a whiff of fresh air a glimpse of what was passing in the great world beyond his daily limits of thought and action so he was ready to give a cordial welcome to his unknown relation mrs gibson was in a flutter of sentimental delight which she fancied was family affection but which might not have been quite so effervescent if mr kirkpatrick had remained in his former position of struggling lawyer with seven children living in doughty street when the two gentlemen met they were attracted towards each other by a similarity of character with just enough difference in their opinions to make the experience of each on which such opinions were based valuable to the other to mrs gibson although the bond between them counted for very little in their intercourse mr kirkpatrick paid very polite attention and was in fact very glad that she had done so well for herself as to marry a sensible and agreeable man who was able to keep her in comfort and to behave to her daughter in so liberal a manner molly struck him as a delicatelooking girl who might be very pretty if she had a greater look of health and animation indeed looking at her critically there were beautiful points about her facelong soft grey eyes black curling eyelashes rarelyshowing dimples perfect teeth but there was a languor over all a slow depression of manner which contrasted unfavourably with the brightlycoloured cynthia sparkling quick graceful and witty as mr kirkpatrick expressed it afterwards to his wife he was quite in love with that girl and cynthia as ready to captivate strangers as any little girl of three or four rose to the occasion forgot all her cares and despondencies remembered no longer her regret at having lost something of mr gibsons good opinion and listened eagerly and made soft replies intermixed with nave sallies of droll humour till mr kirkpatrick was quite captivated he left hollingford almost surprised to have performed a duty and found it a pleasure for mrs gibson and molly he had a general friendly feeling but he did not care if he never saw them again but for mr gibson he had a warm respect a strong personal liking which he should be glad to have ripen into a friendship if there was time for it in this bustling world and he fully resolved to see more of cynthia his wife must know her they must have her up to stay with them in london and show her something of the world but on returning home mr kirkpatrick found so much work awaiting him that he had to lock up embryo friendships and kindly plans in some safe closet of his mind and give himself up body and soul to the immediate work of his profession but in may he found time to take his wife to the academy exhibition and some portrait there striking him as being like cynthia he told his wife more about her and his visit to hollingford than he had ever had leisure to do before and the result was that on the next day a letter was sent off to mrs gibson inviting cynthia to pay a visit to her cousins in london and reminding her of many little circumstances that had occurred when she was with them as a child so as to carry on the clue of friendship from that time to the present on its receipt this letter was greeted in various ways by the four people who sate round the breakfasttable mrs gibson read it to herself first then without telling what its contents were so that her auditors were quite in the dark as to what her remarks applied she said i think they might have remembered that i am a generation nearer to them than she is but nobody thinks of family affection nowa days and i liked him so much and bought a new cookerybook all to make it pleasant and agreeable and what he was used to she said all this in a plaintive aggrieved tone of voice but as no one knew to what she was referring it was difficult to offer her consolation her husband was the first to speak if you want us to sympathize with you tell us what is the nature of your woe why i daresay its what he means as a very kind attention only i think i ought to have been asked before cynthia said she reading the letter over again whos he and whats meant for a kind attention mr kirkpatrick to be sure this letter is from him and he wants cynthia to go and pay them a visit and never says anything about you or me my dear and im sure we did our best to make it pleasant and he should have asked us first i think as i couldnt possibly have gone it makes very little difference to me but i could have gone and at any rate he should have paid us the compliment its only a proper mark of respect you know so ungrateful too when i gave up my dressingroom on purpose for him and i dressed for dinner every day he was here if we are each to recapitulate all our sacrifices on his behalf but for all that i didnt expect to be invited to his house i shall be only too glad if he will come again to mine ive a great mind not to let cynthia go said mrs gibson reflectively i cant go mamma said cynthia colouring my gowns are all so shabby and my old bonnet must do for the summer well but you can buy a new one and im sure it is high time you should get yourself another silk gown you must have been saving up a great deal for i dont know when youve had any new clothes cynthia began to say something but stopped short she went on buttering her toast but she held it in her hand without eating it without looking up either as after a minute or two of silence she spoke again i cannot go i should like it very much but i really cannot go please mamma write at once and refuse it nonsense child when a man in mr kirkpatricks position comes forward to offer a favour it does not do to decline it without giving a sufficient reason so kind of him as it is too suppose you offer to go instead of me proposed cynthia no no that wont do said mr gibson decidedly you cant transfer invitations in that way but really this excuse about your clothes does appear to be very trivial cynthia if you have no other reason to give it is a real true reason to me said cynthia looking up at him as she spoke you must let me judge for myself it would not do to go there in a state of shabbiness for even in doughty street i remember my aunt was very particular about dress and now that margaret and helen are grown up and they visit so muchpray dont say anything more about it for i know it would not do what have you done with all your money i wonder said mrs gibson youve twenty pounds a year thanks to mr gibson and me and im sure you havent spent more than ten i hadnt many things when i came back from france said cynthia in a low voice and evidently troubled by all this questioning pray let it be decided at once i cant go and theres an end of it she got up and left the room rather suddenly i dont understand it at all said mrs gibson do you molly no i know she doesnt like spending money on her dress and is very careful molly said this much and then was afraid she had made mischief but then she must have got the money somewhere it always has struck me that if you have not extravagant habits and do not live up to your income you must have a certain sum to lay by at the end of the year have i not often said so mr gibson probably well then apply the same reasoning to cynthias case and then i ask what has become of the money i cannot tell said molly seeing that she was appealed to she may have given it away to some one who wants it mr gibson put down his newspaper its very clear that she has neither got the dress nor the money necessary for this london visit and that she doesnt want any more inquiries to be made on the subject she likes mysteries in fact and i detest them still i think its a desirable thing for her to keep up the acquaintance or friendship or whatever it is to be called with her fathers family and i shall gladly give her ten pounds and if thats not enough why either you must help her out or she must do without some superfluous article of dress or another im sure there never was such a kind dear generous man as you are mr gibson said his wife to think of your being a stepfather and so good to my poor fatherless girl but molly my dear i think youll acknowledge that you too are very fortunate in your stepmother are not you love and what happy ttettes we shall have together when cynthia goes to london im not sure if i dont get on better with you even than with her though she is my own child for as dear papa says so truly there is a love of mystery about her and if i hate anything it is the slightest concealment or reserve ten pounds why it will quite set her up buy her a couple of gowns and a new bonnet and i dont know what all dear mr gibson how generous you are something very like pshaw was growled out from behind the newspaper may i go and tell her said molly rising up yes do love tell her it would be so ungrateful to refuse and tell her that your father wishes her to go and tell her too that it would be quite wrong not to avail herself of an opening which may byandby be extended to the rest of the family i am sure if they ask mewhich certainly they ought to doi wont say before they asked cynthia because i never think of myself and am really the most forgiving person in the world in forgiving slightsbut when they do ask me which they are sure to do i shall never be content till by putting in a little hint here and a little hint there ive induced them to send you an invitation a month or two in london would do you so much good molly molly had left the room before this speech was ended and mr gibson was occupied with his newspaper but mrs gibson finished it to herself very much to her own satisfaction for after all it was better to have some one of the family going on the visit though she might not be the right person than to refuse it altogether and never to have the opportunity of saying anything about it as mr gibson was so kind to cynthia she too would be kind to molly and dress her becomingly and invite young men to the house do all the things in fact which molly and her father did not want to have done and throw the old stumblingblocks in the way of their unrestrained intercourse which was the one thing they desired to have free and open and without the constant dread of her jealousy chapter xxxix secret thoughts ooze out molly found cynthia in the drawingroom standing in the bowwindow looking out on the garden she started as molly came up to her oh molly said she putting her arms out towards her i am always so glad to have you with me it was outbursts of affection such as these that always called molly back if she had been ever so unconsciously wavering in her allegiance to cynthia she had been wishing downstairs that cynthia would be less reserved and not have so many secrets but now it seemed almost like treason to have wanted her to be anything but what she was never had any one more than cynthia the power spoken of by goldsmith when he wrote he threw off his friends like a huntsman his pack for he knew when he liked he could whistle them back do you know i think youll be glad to hear what ive got to tell you said molly i think you would really like to go to london shouldnt you yes but its of no use liking said cynthia dont you begin about it molly for the thing is settled and i cant tell you why but i cant go it is only the money dear and papa has been so kind about it he wants you to go he thinks you ought to keep up relationships and he is going to give you ten pounds how kind he is said cynthia but i ought not to take it i wish i had known you years ago i should have been different to what i am never mind that we like you as you are we dont want you different youll really hurt papa if you dont take it why do you hesitate do you think roger wont like it roger no i wasnt thinking about him why should he care i shall be there and back again before he even hears about it then you will go said molly cynthia thought for a minute or two yes i will said she at length i daresay its not wise but it will be pleasant and ill go where is mr gibson i want to thank him oh how kind he is molly youre a lucky girl i said molly quite startled at being told this for she had been feeling as if so many things were going wrong almost as if they would never go right again there he is said cynthia i hear him in the hall and down she flew and laying her hands on mr gibsons arm she thanked him with such warm impulsiveness and in so pretty and caressing a manner that something of his old feeling of personal liking for her returned and he forgot for a time the causes of disapproval he had against her there there said he thats enough my dear its quite right you should keep up with your relations theres nothing more to be said about it i do think your father is the most charming man i know said cynthia on her return to molly and its that which always makes me so afraid of losing his good opinion and fret so when i think he is displeased with me and now let us think all about this london visit it will be delightful wont it i can make ten pounds go ever so far and in some ways it will be such a comfort to get out of hollingford will it said molly rather wistfully oh yes you know i dont mean that it will be a comfort to leave you that will be anything but a comfort but after all a country town is a country town and london is london you need not smile at my truisms ive always had a sympathy with m de la palisse m de la palisse est mort en perdant sa vie un quart dheure avant sa mort il tait en vie sang she in so gay a manner that she puzzled molly as she often did by her change of mood from the gloomy decision with which she had refused to accept the invitation only half an hour ago she suddenly took molly round the waist and began waltzing round the room with her to the imminent danger of the various little tables loaded with objets dart as mrs gibson delighted to call them with which the drawingroom was crowded she avoided them however with her usual skill but they both stood still at last surprised at mrs gibsons surprise as she stood at the door looking at the whirl going on before her upon my word i only hope you are not going crazy both of you whats all this about pray only because im so glad im going to london mamma said cynthia demurely im not sure if its quite the thing for an engaged young lady to be so much beside herself at the prospect of gaiety in my time our great pleasure in our lovers absence was in thinking about them i should have thought that would have given you pain because you would have had to remember that they were away which ought to have made you unhappy now to tell you the truth just at the moment i had forgotten all about roger i hope it wasnt very wrong osborne looks as if he did all my share as well as his own of the fretting after roger how ill he looked yesterday yes said molly i didnt know if any one besides me had noticed it i was quite shocked ah said mrs gibson im afraid that young man wont live longvery much afraid and she shook her head ominously oh what will happen if he dies exclaimed molly suddenly sitting down and thinking of that strange mysterious wife who never made her appearance whose very existence was never spoken aboutand roger away too well it would be very sad of course and we should all feel it very much ive no doubt for ive always been very fond of osborne in fact before roger became as it were my own flesh and blood i liked osborne better but we must not forget the living dear molly for mollys eyes were filling with tears at the dismal thoughts presented to her our dear good roger would i am sure do all in his power to fill osbornes place in every way and his marriage need not be so long delayed dont speak of that in the same breath as osbornes life mamma said cynthia hastily why my dear it is a very natural thought for poor rogers sake you know one wishes it not to be so very very long an engagement and i was only answering mollys question after all one cant help following out ones thoughts people must die you knowyoung as well as old if i ever suspected roger of following out his thoughts in a similar way said cynthia id never speak to him again as if he would said molly warm in her turn you know he never would and you shouldnt suppose it of him cynthiano not even for a moment i cant see the great harm of it all for my part said mrs gibson plaintively a young man strikes us all as looking very illand im sure im sorry for it but illness very often leads to death surely you agree with me there and whats the harm of saying so then molly asks what will happen if he dies and i try to answer her question i dont like talking or thinking of death any more than any one else but i should think myself wanting in strength of mind if i could not look forward to the consequences of death i really think were commanded to do so somewhere in the bible or the prayerbook do you look forward to the consequences of my death mamma asked cynthia you really are the most unfeeling girl i ever met with said mrs gibson really hurt i wish i could give you a little of my own sensitiveness for i have too much for my happiness dont let us speak of osbornes looks again ten to one it was only some temporary overfatigue or some anxiety about roger or perhaps a little fit of indigestion i was very foolish to attribute it to anything more serious and dear papa might be displeased if he knew i had done so medical men dont like other people to be making conjectures about health they consider it as trenching on their own particular province and very proper im sure now let us consider about your dress cynthia i could not understand how you had spent your money and made so little show with it mamma it may sound very cross but i must tell molly and you and everybody once for all that as i dont want and didnt ask for more than my allowance im not going to answer any questions about what i do with it she did not say this with any want of respect but she said it with quiet determination which subdued her mother for the time though often afterwards when mrs gibson and molly were alone the former would start the wonder as to what cynthia could possibly have done with her money and hunt each poor conjecture through woods and valleys of doubt till she was wearied out and the exciting sport was given up for the day at present however she confined herself to the practical matter in hand and the genius for millinery and dress inherent in both mother and daughter soon settled a great many knotty points of contrivance and taste and then they all three set to work to gar auld claes look amaist as weels the new cynthias relations with the squire had been very stationary ever since the visit she had paid to the hall the previous autumn he had received them all at that time with hospitable politeness and he had been more charmed with cynthia than he liked to acknowledge to himself when he thought the visit all over afterwards shes a pretty lass sure enough thought he and has pretty ways about her too and likes to learn from older people which is a good sign but somehow i dont like madam her mother but still she is her mother and the girls her daughter yet she spoke to her once or twice as i shouldnt ha liked our little fanny to have spoken if it had pleased god for her to ha lived no its not the right way and it may be a bit oldfashioned but i like the right way and then again she took possession o me as i may say and little molly had to run after us in the garden walks that are too narrow for three just like a little fourlegged doggie and the other was so full of listening to me she never turned round for to speak a word to molly i dont mean to say theyre not fond of each other and thats in rogers sweethearts favour and its very ungrateful in me to go and find fault with a lass who was so civil to me and had such a pretty way with her of hanging on every word that fell from my lips well a deal may come and go in two years and the lad says nothing to me about it ill be as deep as him and take no more notice of the affair till he comes home and tells me himself so although the squire was always delighted to receive the little notes which cynthia sent him every time she heard from roger and although this attention on her part was melting the heart he tried to harden he controlled himself into writing her the briefest acknowledgments his words were strong in meaning but formal in expression she herself did not think much about them being satisfied to do the kind actions that called them forth but her mother criticised them and pondered them she thought she had hit on the truth when she decided in her own mind that it was a very oldfashioned style and that he and his house and his furniture all wanted some of the brightening up and polishing which they were sure to receive whenshe never quite liked to finish the sentence definitely although she kept repeating to herself that there was no harm in it to return to the squire occupied as he now was he recovered his former health and something of his former cheerfulness if osborne had met him halfway it is probable that the old bond between father and son might have been renewed but osborne either was really an invalid or had sunk into invalid habits and made no effort to rally if his father urged him to go outnay once or twice he gulped down his pride and asked osborne to accompany himosborne would go to the window and find out some flaw or speck in the wind or weather and make that an excuse for stopping indoors over his books he would saunter out on the sunny side of the house in a manner that the squire considered as both indolent and unmanly yet if there was a prospect of his leaving home which he did pretty often about this time he was seized with a hectic energy the clouds in the sky the easterly wind the dampness of the air were nothing to him then and as the squire did not know the real secret cause of this anxiety to be gone he took it into his head that it arose from osbornes dislike to hamley and to the monotony of his fathers society it was a mistake thought the squire i see it now i was never great at making friends myself i always thought those oxford and cambridge men turned up their noses at me for a country booby and id get the start and have none o them but when the boys went to rugby and cambridge i should ha let them have had their own friends about em even though they might ha looked down on me it was the worst they could ha done to me and now what few friends i had have fallen off from me by death or somehow and it is but dreary work for a young man i grant it but he might try not to show it so plain to me as he does im getting casehardened but it does cut me to the quick sometimesit does and he so fond of his dad as he was once if i can but get the land drained ill make him an allowance and let him go to london or where he likes maybe hell do better this time or maybe hell go to the dogs altogether but perhaps it will make him think a bit kindly of the old father at homei should like him to do that i should it is possible that osborne might have been induced to tell his father of his marriage during their long solitary intercourse if the squire in an unlucky moment had not given him his confidence about rogers engagement with cynthia it was on one wet sunday afternoon when the father and son were sitting together in the large empty drawingroom osborne had not been to church in the morning the squire had and he was now trying hard to read one of blairs sermons they had dined early they always did on sundays and either that or the sermon or the hopeless wetness of the day made the afternoon seem interminably long to the squire he had certain unwritten rules for the regulation of his conduct on sundays cold meat sermonreading no smoking till after evening prayers as little thought as possible as to the state of the land and the condition of the crops and as much respectable sitting indoors in his best clothes as was consistent with going to church twice a day and saying the responses louder than the clerk today it had rained so unceasingly that he had remitted the afternoon church but oh even with the luxury of a nap how long it seemed before he saw the hall servants trudging homewards along the fieldpath a covey of umbrellas he had been standing at the window for the last halfhour his hands in his pockets and his mouth often contracting itself into the traditional sin of a whistle but as often checked into sudden gravityending nine times out of ten in a yawn he looked askance at osborne who was sitting near the fire absorbed in a book the poor squire was something like the little boy in the childs story who asks all sorts of birds and beasts to come and play with him and in every case receives the sober answer that they are too busy to have leisure for trivial amusements the father wanted the son to put down his book and talk to him it was so wet so dull and a little conversation would so wile away the time but osborne with his back to the window where his father was standing saw nothing of all this and went on reading he had assented to his fathers remark that it was a very wet afternoon but had not carried on the subject into all the varieties of truisms of which it was susceptible something more rousing must be started and this the squire felt the recollection of the affair between roger and cynthia came into his head and without giving it a moments consideration he began osborne do you know anything about thisthis attachment of rogers quite successful osborne laid down his book in a moment and turned round to his father roger an attachment no i never heard of iti can hardly believe itthat is to say i suppose it is to and then he stopped for he thought he had no right to betray his own conjecture that the object was cynthia kirkpatrick yes he is though can you guess who to nobody that i particularly likenot a connection to my mindyet shes a very pretty girl and i suppose i was to blame in the first instance is it its no use beating about the bush ive gone so far i may as well tell you all its miss kirkpatrick gibsons stepdaughter but its not an engagement mind you im very gladi hope she likes roger back again likeits only too good a connection for her not to like it if roger is of the same mind when he comes home ill be bound shell be only too happy i wonder roger never told me said osborne a little hurt now he began to consider himself he never told me either said the squire it was gibson who came here and made a clean breast of it like a man of honour id been saying to him i couldnt have either of you two lads taking up with his lasses ill own it was you i was afraid ofits bad enough with roger and maybe will come to nothing after all but if it had been you id ha broken with gibson and every mothers son of em sooner than have let it go on and so i told gibson i beg your pardon for interrupting you but once for all i claim the right of choosing my wife for myself subject to no mans interference said osborne hotly then youll keep your wife with no mans interference thats all for neer a penny will you get from me my lad unless you marry to please me a little as well as yourself a great deal thats all i ask of you im not particular as to beauty or as to cleverness and pianoplaying and that sort of thing if roger marries this girl we shall have enough of that in the family i shouldnt much mind her being a bit older than you but she must be wellborn and the more money she brings the better for the old place i say again father i choose my wife for myself and i dont admit any mans right of dictation well well said the squire getting a little angry in his turn if im not to be father in this matter thou shant be son go against me in what ive set my heart on and youll find theres the devil to pay thats all but dont let us get angry its sunday afternoon for one thing and its a sin and besides that ive not finished my story for osborne had taken up his book again and under pretence of reading was fuming to himself he hardly put it away even at his fathers request as i was saying gibson said when first we spoke about it that there was nothing on foot between any of you four and that if there was he would let me know so byandby he comes and tells me of this of whati dont understand how far it has gone there was a tone in osbornes voice the squire did not quite like and he began answering rather angrily of this to be sureof what im telling youof roger going and making love to this girl that day he left after he had gone away from here and was waiting for the umpire in hollingford one would think you quite stupid at times osborne i can only say that these details are quite new to me you never mentioned them before i assure you well never mind whether i did or not im sure i said roger was attached to miss kirkpatrick and be hanged to her and you might have understood all the rest as a matter of course possibly said osborne politely may i ask if miss kirkpatrick who appeared to me to be a very nice girl responds to rogers affection fast enough ill be bound said the squire sulkily a hamley of hamley isnt to be had every day now ill tell you what osborne youre the only marriageable one left in the market and i want to hoist the old family up again dont go against me in this it really will break my heart if you do father dont talk so said osborne ill do anything i can to oblige you except except the only thing ive set my heart on your doing well well let it alone for the present theres no question of my marrying just at this moment im out of health and im not up to going into society and meeting young ladies and all that sort of thing even if i had an opening into fitting society you should have an opening fast enough therell be more money coming in in a year or two please god and as for your health why whats to make you well if you cower over the fire all day and shudder away from a good honest tankard as if it were poison so it is to me said osborne languidly playing with his book as if he wanted to end the conversation and take it up again the squire saw the movements and understood them well said he ill go and have a talk with will about poor old black bess its sunday work enough asking after a dumb animals aches and pains but after his father had left the room osborne did not take up his book again he laid it down on the table by him leant back in his chair and covered his eyes with his hand he was in a state of health which made him despondent about many things though least of all about what was most in danger the long concealment of his marriage from his father made the disclosure of it far far more difficult than it would have been at first unsupported by roger how could he explain it all to one so passionate as the squire how tell of the temptation the stolen marriage the consequent happiness and alas the consequent sufferingfor osborne had suffered and did suffer greatly in the untoward circumstances in which he had placed himself he saw no way out of it all excepting by the one strong stroke of which he felt himself incapable so with a heavy heart he addressed himself to his book again everything seemed to come in his way and he was not strong enough in character to overcome obstacles the only overt step he took in consequence of what he had heard from his father was to ride over to hollingford the first fine day after he had received the news and go to see cynthia and the gibsons he had not been there for a long time bad weather and languor combined had prevented him he found them full of preparations and discussions about cynthias visit to london and she herself not at all in the sentimental mood proper to respond to his delicate intimations of how glad he was in his brothers joy indeed it was so long after the time that cynthia scarcely perceived that to him the intelligence was recent and that the first bloom of his emotions had not yet passed away with her head a little on one side she was contemplating the effect of a knot of ribbons when he began in a low whisper and leaning forward towards her as he spokecynthiai may call you cynthia now maynt iim so glad of this news ive only just heard of it but im so glad what news do you mean she had her suspicions but she was annoyed to think that from one person her secret was passing to another and another till in fact it was becoming no secret at all still cynthia could always conceal her annoyance when she chose why are you to begin calling me cynthia now she went on smiling the terrible word has slipped out from between your lips before do you know this light way of taking his tender congratulation did not quite please osborne who was in a sentimental mood and for a minute or so he remained silent then having finished making her bow of ribbon she turned to him and continued in a quick low voice anxious to take advantage of a conversation between her mother and molly i think i can guess why you made that pretty little speech just now but do you know you ought not to have been told and moreover things are not quite arrived at the solemnity ofofwellan engagement he would not have it so now i shant say any more and you must not pray remember you ought not to have known it is my own secret and i particularly wished it not to be spoken about and i dont like its being so talked about oh the leaking of water through one small hole and then she plunged into the talk of the other two making the conversation general osborne was rather discomfited at the nonsuccess of his congratulations he had pictured to himself the unbosoming of a lovesick girl full of rapture and glad of a sympathizing confidant he little knew cynthias nature the more she suspected that she was called upon for a display of emotion the less would she show and her emotions were generally under the control of her will he had made an effort to come and see her and now he leant back in his chair weary and a little dispirited you poor dear young man said mrs gibson coming up to him with her soft soothing manner how tired you look do take some of that eaudecologne and bathe your forehead this spring weather overcomes me too primavera i think the italians call it but it is very trying for delicate constitutions as much from its associations as from its variableness of temperature it makes me sigh perpetually but then i am so sensitive dear lady cumnor always used to say i was like a thermometer youve heard how ill she has been no said osborne not very much caring either oh yes she is better now but the anxiety about her has tried me so detained here by what are of course my duties but far away from all intelligence and not knowing what the next post might bring where was she then asked osborne becoming a little more sympathetic at spa such a distance off three days post cant you conceive the trial living with her as i did for years bound up in the family as i was but lady harriet said in her last letter that they hoped she would be stronger than she had been for years said molly innocently yeslady harrietof courseevery one who knows lady harriet knows that she is of too sanguine a temperament for her statements to be perfectly relied on altogetherstrangers are often deluded by lady harrietshe has an offhand manner which takes them in but she does not mean half she says we will hope she does in this instance said cynthia shortly theyre in london now and lady cumnor hasnt suffered from the journey they say so said mrs gibson shaking her head and laying an emphasis on the word say i am perhaps overanxious but i wishi wish i could see and judge for myself it would be the only way of calming my anxiety i almost think i shall go up with you cynthia for a day or two just to see her with my own eyes i dont quite like your travelling alone either we will think about it and you shall write to mr kirkpatrick and propose it if we determine upon it you can tell him of my anxiety and it will be only sharing your bed for a couple of nights chapter xl molly gibson breathes freely that was the way in which mrs gibson first broached her intention of accompanying cynthia up to london for a few days visit she had a trick of producing the first sketch of any new plan before an outsider to the family circle so that the first emotions of others if they disapproved of her projects had to be repressed until the idea had become familiar to them to molly it seemed too charming a proposal ever to come to pass she had never allowed herself to recognize the restraint she was under in her stepmothers presence but all at once she found it out when her heart danced at the idea of three whole daysfor that it would be at the leastof perfect freedom of intercourse with her father of old times come back again of meals without perpetual fidgetiness after details of ceremony and correctness of attendance well have breadandcheese for dinner and eat it on our knees well make up for having had to eat sloppy puddings with a fork instead of a spoon all this time by putting our knives in our mouths till we cut ourselves papa shall pour his tea into his saucer if hes in a hurry and if im thirsty ill take the slopbasin and oh if i could but get buy borrow or steal any kind of an old horse my grey skirt isnt new but it will dothat would be too delightful after all i think i can be happy again for months and months it has seemed as if i had got too old ever to feel pleasure much less happiness again so thought molly yet she blushed as if with guilt when cynthia reading her thoughts said to her one day molly youre very glad to get rid of us are not you not of you cynthia at least i dont think i am only if you but knew how i love papa and how i used to see a great deal more of him than i ever do now ah i often think what interlopers we must seem and are in fact i dont feel you as such you at any rate have been a new delight to mea sister and i never knew how charming such a relationship could be but mamma said cynthia halfsuspiciously halfsorrowfully she is papas wife said molly quietly i dont mean to say im not often very sorry to feel im no longer first with him but it wasthe violent colour flushed into her face till even her eyes burnt and she suddenly found herself on the point of crying the weeping ashtree the misery the slow dropping comfort and the comforter came all so vividly before herit was rogershe went on looking up at cynthia as she overcame her slight hesitation at mentioning his nameroger who told me how i ought to take papas marriage when i was first startled and grieved at the news oh cynthia what a great thing it is to be loved by him cynthia blushed and looked fluttered and pleased yes i suppose it is at the same time molly im afraid hell expect me to be always as good as he fancies me now and i shall have to walk on tiptoe all the rest of my life but you are good cynthia put in molly no im not youre just as much mistaken as he is and some day i shall go down in your opinions with a run just like the hall clock the other day when the spring broke i think hell love you just as much said molly could you would you be my friend ifif it turned out ever that i had done very wrong things would you remember how very difficult it has sometimes been to me to act rightly she took hold of mollys hand as she spoke we wont speak of mamma for your sake as much as mine or hers but you must see she isnt one to help a girl with much good advice or good oh molly you dont know how i was neglected just at a time when i wanted friends most mamma does not know it it is not in her to know what i might have been if i had only fallen into wise good hands but i know it and whats more continued she suddenly ashamed of her unusual exhibition of feeling i try not to care which i daresay is really the worst of all but i could worry myself to death if i once took to serious thinking i wish i could help you or even understand you said molly after a moment or two of sad perplexity you can help me said cynthia changing her manner abruptly i can trim bonnets and make headdresses but somehow my hands cant fold up gowns and collars like your deft little fingers please will you help me to pack thats a real tangible piece of kindness and not sentimental consolation for sentimental distresses which are perhaps imaginary after all in general it is the people that are left behind stationary who give way to low spirits at any parting the travellers however bitterly they may feel the separation find something in the change of scene to soften regret in the very first hour of separation but as molly walked home with her father from seeing mrs gibson and cynthia off to london by the umpire coach she almost danced along the street now papa said she im going to have you all to myself for a whole week you must be very obedient dont be tyrannical then youre walking me out of breath and were cutting mrs goodenough in our hurry so they crossed over the street to speak to mrs goodenough weve just been seeing my wife and her daughter off to london mrs gibson has gone up for a week deary deary to london and only for a week why i can remember its being a three days journey itll be very lonesome for you miss molly without your young companion yes said molly suddenly feeling as if she ought to have taken this view of the case i shall miss cynthia very much and you mr gibson why itll be like being a widower over again you must come and drink tea with me some evening we must try and cheer you up a bit amongst us shall it be tuesday in spite of the sharp pinch which molly gave to his arm mr gibson accepted the invitation much to the gratification of the old lady papa how could you go and waste one of our evenings we have but six in all and now but five and i had so reckoned on our doing all sorts of things together what sort of things oh i dont know everything that is unrefined and ungenteel added she slily looking up into her fathers face his eyes twinkled but the rest of his face was perfectly grave im not going to be corrupted with toil and labour ive reached a very fair height of refinement i wont be pulled down again yes you will papa well have breadandcheese for lunch this very day and you shall wear your slippers in the drawingroom every evening youll stay quietly at home and oh papa dont you think i could ride nora creina ive been looking out the old grey skirt and i think i could make myself tidy where is the sidesaddle to come from to be sure the old one wont fit that great irish mare but im not particular papa i think i could manage somehow thank you but im not quite going to return into barbarism it may be a depraved taste but i should like to see my daughter properly mounted think of riding together down the laneswhy the dogroses must be all out in flower and the honeysuckles and the hayhow i should like to see merrimans farm again papa do let me have one ride with you please do im sure we can manage it somehow and somehow it was managed somehow all mollys wishes came to pass there was only one little drawback to this week of holiday and happy intercourse with her father everybody would ask them out to tea they were quite like bride and bridegroom for the fact was that the late dinners which mrs gibson had introduced into her own house were a great inconvenience in the calculations of the small teadrinkings at hollingford how ask people to tea at six who dined at that hour how when they refused cake and sandwiches at halfpast eight how induce other people who were really hungry to commit a vulgarity before those calm and scornful eyes so there had been a great lull of invitations for the gibsons to hollingford teaparties mrs gibson whose object was to squeeze herself into county society had taken this being left out of the smaller festivities with great equanimity but molly missed the kind homeliness of the parties to which she had gone from time to time as long as she could remember and though as each threecornered note was brought in she grumbled a little over the loss of another charming evening with her father she really was glad to go again in the old way among old friends miss browning and miss phoebe were especially compassionate towards her in her loneliness if they had had their will she would have dined there every day and she had to call upon them very frequently in order to prevent their being hurt at her declining the dinners mrs gibson wrote twice during her weeks absence to her husband that piece of news was quite satisfactory to the miss brownings who had of late held themselves a great deal aloof from a house where they chose to suppose that their presence was not wanted in their winter evenings they had often talked over mr gibsons household and having little besides conjecture to go upon they found the subject interminable as they could vary the possibilities every day one of their wonders was how mr and mrs gibson really got on together another was whether mrs gibson was extravagant or not now two letters during the week of her absence showed what was in those days considered a very proper amount of conjugal affection yet not too muchat elevenpencehalfpenny postage a third letter would have been extravagant sister looked to sister with an approving nod as molly named the second letter which arrived in hollingford the very day before mrs gibson was to return they had settled between themselves that two letters would show the right amount of good feeling and proper understanding in the gibson family more would have been extravagant only one would have been a mere matter of duty there had been rather a question between miss browning and miss phoebe as to which person the second letter supposing it came was to be addressed to it would be very conjugal to write twice to mr gibson and yet it would be very pretty if molly came in for her share youve had another letter you say my dear asked miss browning i daresay mrs gibson has written to you this time it is a large sheet and cynthia has written on one half to me and all the rest is to papa a very nice arrangement im sure and what does cynthia say is she enjoying herself oh yes i think so theyve had a dinnerparty and one night when mamma was at lady cumnors cynthia went to the play with her cousins upon my word and all in one week i do call that dissipation why thursday would be taken up with the journey and friday with resting and sunday is sunday all the world over and they must have written on tuesday well i hope cynthia wont find hollingford dull thats all when she comes back i dont think its likely said miss phoebe with a little simper and a knowing look which sate oddly on her kindly innocent face you see a great deal of mr preston dont you molly mr preston said molly flushing up with surprise no not much hes been at ashcombe all winter you know he has but just come back to settle here what should make you think so oh a little bird told us said miss browning molly knew that little bird from her childhood and had always hated it and longed to wring its neck why could not people speak out and say that they did not mean to give up the name of their informant but it was a very favourite form of fiction with the miss brownings and to miss phoebe it was the very acme of wit the little bird was flying about one day in heath lane and it saw mr preston and a young ladywe wont say whowalking together in a very friendly manner that is to say he was on horseback but the path is raised above the road just where there is the little wooden bridge over the brook perhaps molly is in the secret and we ought not to ask her about it said miss phoebe seeing mollys extreme discomfiture and annoyance it can be no great secret said miss browning dropping the littlebird formula and assuming an air of dignified reproval at miss phoebes interruption for miss hornblower says mr preston owns to being engaged at any rate it isnt to cynthia that i know positively said molly with some vehemence and pray put a stop to any such reports you dont know what mischief they may do i do so hate that kind of chatter it was not very respectful of molly to speak in this way to be sure but she thought only of roger and the distress any such reports might cause should he ever hear of them in the centre of africa made her colour up scarlet with vexation heightyteighty miss molly dont you remember that i am old enough to be your mother and that it is not pretty behaviour to speak so to usto me chatter to be sure really molly i beg your pardon said molly only halfpenitent i daresay you did not mean to speak so to sister said miss phoebe trying to make peace molly did not answer all at once she wanted to explain how much mischief might be done by such reports but dont you see she went on still flushed by vexation how bad it is to talk of such things in such a way supposing one of them cared for some one else and that might happen you know mr preston for instance may be engaged to some one else molly i pity the woman indeed i do i have a very poor opinion of mr preston said miss browning in a warning tone of voice for a new idea had come into her head well but the woman or young lady would not like to hear such reports about mr preston perhaps not but for all that take my word for it hes a great flirt and young ladies had better not have much to do with him i daresay it was all accident their meeting in heath lane said miss phoebe i know nothing about it said molly and i daresay i have been impertinent only please dont talk about it any more i have my reasons for asking you she got up for by the striking of the church clock she had just found out that it was later than she had thought and she knew that her father would be at home by this time she bent down and kissed miss brownings grave and passive face how you are growing molly said miss phoebe anxious to cover over her sisters displeasure as tall and as straight as a poplartree as the old song says grow in grace molly as well as in good looks said miss browning watching her out of the room as soon as she was fairly gone miss browning got up and shut the door quite securely and then sitting down near her sister she said in a low voice phoebe it was molly herself that was with mr preston in heath lane that day when mrs goodenough saw them together gracious goodness me exclaimed miss phoebe receiving it at once as gospel how do you know by putting two and two together didnt you notice how red molly went and then pale and how she said she knew for a fact that mr preston and cynthia kirkpatrick were not engaged perhaps not engaged but mrs goodenough saw them loitering together all by their own two selves mrs goodenough only crossed heath lane at the shire oak as she was riding in her phaeton said miss browning sententiously we all know what a coward she is in a carriage so that most likely she had only half her wits about her and her eyes are none of the best when she is standing steady on the ground molly and cynthia have got their new plaid shawls just alike and they trim their bonnets alike and molly is grown as tall as cynthia since christmas i was always afraid shed be short and stumpy but shes now as tall and slender as anyone need be ill answer for it mrs goodenough saw molly and took her for cynthia when miss browning answered for it miss phoebe gave up doubting she sate some time in silence revolving her thoughts then she said it wouldnt be such a very bad match after all sister she spoke very meekly awaiting her sisters sanction to her opinion phoebe it would be a bad match for mary pearsons daughter if i had known what i know now wed never have had him to tea last september why what do you know asked miss phoebe miss hornblower told me many things some that i dont think you ought to hear phoebe he was engaged to a very pretty miss gregson at henwick where he comes from and her father made inquiries and heard so much that was bad about him that he made his daughter break off the match and shes dead since how shocking said miss phoebe duly impressed besides he plays at billiards and he bets at races and some people do say he keeps racehorses but isnt it strange that the earl keeps him on as his agent no perhaps not hes very clever about land and very sharp in all law affairs and my lord isnt bound to take noticeif indeed he knowsof the manner in which mr preston talks when he has taken too much wine taken too much wine oh sister is he a drunkard and we have had him to tea i didnt say he was a drunkard phoebe said miss browning pettishly a man may take too much wine occasionally without being a drunkard dont let me hear you using such coarse words phoebe miss phoebe was silent for a time after this rebuke presently she said i do hope it wasnt molly gibson you may hope as much as you like but im pretty sure it was however wed better say nothing about it to mrs goodenough she has got cynthia into her head and there let her rest time enough to set reports afloat about molly when we know theres some truth in them mr preston might do for cynthia whos been brought up in france though she has such pretty manners but it may have made her not particular he must not and he shall not have molly if i go into church and forbid the banns myself but im afraidim afraid theres something between her and him we must keep on the lookout phoebe ill be her guardian angel in spite of herself chapter xli gathering clouds illustration untitled mrs gibson came back full of rosecoloured accounts of london lady cumnor had been gracious and affectionate so touched by my going up to see her so soon after her return to england lady harriet charming and devoted to her old governess lord cumnor just like his dear usual hearty self and as for the kirkpatricks no lord chancellors house was ever grander than theirs and the silk gown of the qc had floated over housemaids and footmen cynthia too was so much admired and as for her dress mrs kirkpatrick had showered down balldresses and wreaths and pretty bonnets and mantles like a fairy godmother mr gibsons poor present of ten pounds shrank into very small dimensions compared with all this munificence and theyre so fond of her i dont know when we shall have her back was mrs gibsons windingup sentence and now molly what have you and papa been doing very gay you sounded in your letter i had not time to read it in london so i put it in my pocket and read it in the coach coming home but my dear child you do look so oldfashioned with your gown made all tight and your hair all tumbling about in curls curls are quite gone out we must do your hair differently she continued trying to smooth mollys black waves into straightness i sent cynthia an african letter said molly timidly did you hear anything of what was in it oh yes poor child it made her very uneasy i think she said she did not feel inclined to go to mr rawsons ball which was on that night and for which mrs kirkpatrick had given her the balldress but there was really nothing for her to fidget herself about roger only said he had had another touch of fever but was better when he wrote he says every european has to be acclimatized by fever in that part of abyssinia where he is and did she go asked molly yes to be sure it is not an engagement and if it were it is not acknowledged fancy her going and saying a young man that i know has been ill for a few days in africa two months ago therefore i dont want to go to the ball tonight it would have seemed like affectation of sentiment and if theres one thing i hate it is that she would hardly enjoy herself said molly oh yes but she did her dress was white gauze trimmed with lilacs and she really did looka mother may be allowed a little natural partialitymost lovely and she danced every dance although she was quite a stranger i am sure she enjoyed herself from her manner of talking about it next morning i wonder if the squire knows knows what oh yes to be sureyou mean about roger i daresay he doesnt and theres no need to tell him for ive no doubt it is all right now and she went out of the room to finish her unpacking molly let her work fall and sighed it will be a year the day after tomorrow since he came here to propose our going to hurst wood and mamma was so vexed at his calling before lunch i wonder if cynthia remembers it as well as i do and now perhaps oh roger roger i wishi pray that you were safe home again how could we all bear it if she covered her face with her hands and tried to stop thinking suddenly she got up as if stung by a venomous fancy i dont believe she loves him as she ought or she could notcould not have gone and danced what shall i do if she does not what shall i do i can bear anything but that but she found the long suspense as to his health hard enough to endure they were not likely to hear from him for a month at least and before that time had elapsed cynthia would be at home again molly learnt to long for her return before a fortnight of her absence was over she had had no idea that perpetual ttettes with mrs gibson could by any possibility be so tiresome as she found them perhaps mollys state of delicate health consequent upon her rapid growth during the last few months made her irritable but really often she had to get up and leave the room to calm herself down after listening to a long series of words more frequently plaintive or discontented in tone than cheerful and which at the end conveyed no distinct impression of either the speakers thought or feeling whenever anything had gone wrong whenever mr gibson had coolly persevered in anything to which she had objected whenever the cook had made a mistake about the dinner or the housemaid broken any little frangible article whenever mollys hair was not done to her liking or her dress did not become her or the smell of dinner pervaded the house or the wrong callers came or the right callers did not comein fact whenever anything went wrong poor mr kirkpatrick was regretted and mourned over nay almost blamed as if had he only given himself the trouble of living he could have helped it when i look back to those happy days it seems to me as if i had never valued them as i ought to be sureyouth lovewhat did we care for poverty i remember dear mr kirkpatrick walking five miles into stratford to buy me a muffin because i had such a fancy for one after cynthia was born i dont mean to complain of dear papabut i dont thinkbut perhaps i ought not to say it to you if mr kirkpatrick had but taken care of that cough of his but he was so obstinate men always are i think and it really was selfish of him only i daresay he did not consider the forlorn state in which i should be left it came harder upon me than upon most people because i always was of such an affectionate sensitive nature i remember a little poem of mr kirkpatricks in which he compared my heart to a harpstring vibrating to the slightest breeze i thought harpstrings required a pretty strong finger to make them sound said molly my dear child youve no more poetry in you than your father and as for your hair its worse than ever cant you drench it in water to take those untidy twists and twirls out of it it only makes it curl more and more when it gets dry said molly sudden tears coming into her eyes as a recollection came before her like a picture seen long ago and forgotten for yearsa young mother washing and dressing her little girl placing the halfnaked darling on her knee and twining the wet rings of dark hair fondly round her fingers and then in an ecstasy of fondness kissing the little curly head the receipt of cynthias letters made very agreeable events she did not write often but her letters were tolerably long when they did come and very sprightly in tone there was constant mention made of many new names which conveyed no idea to molly though mrs gibson would try and enlighten her by running commentaries like the following mrs green ah thats mr joness pretty cousin who lives in russell square with the fat husband they keep their carriage but im not sure if it is not mr green who is mrs joness cousin we can ask cynthia when she comes home mr henderson to be surea young man with black whiskers a pupil of mr kirkpatricks formerlyor was he a pupil of mr murrays i know they said he had read law with somebody ah yes they are the people who called the day after mr rawsons ball and who admired cynthia so much without knowing i was her mother she was very handsomely dressed indeed in black satin and the son had a glass eye but he was a young man of good property coleman yes that was the name no more news of roger until some time after cynthia had returned from her london visit she came back looking fresher and prettier than ever beautifully dressed thanks to her own good taste and her cousins generosity full of amusing details of the gay life she had been enjoying yet not at all out of spirits at having left it behind her she brought home all sorts of pretty and dainty devices for molly a neckribbon made up in the newest fashion a pattern for a tippet a delicate pair of light gloves embroidered as molly had never seen gloves embroidered before and many another little sign of remembrance during her absence yet somehow or other molly felt that cynthia was changed in her relation to her molly was aware that she had never had cynthias full confidence for with all her apparent frankness and navet of manner cynthia was extremely reserved and reticent she knew this much of herself and had often laughed about it to molly and the latter had by this time found out the truth of her friends assertion but molly did not trouble herself much about it she too knew that there were many thoughts and feelings that flitted through her mind which she should never think of telling to any one except perhapsif they were ever very much thrown togetherto her father she knew that cynthia withheld from her more than thoughts and feelingsthat she withheld facts but then as molly reflected these facts might involve details of struggle and sufferingmight relate to her mothers neglectand altogether be of so painful a character that it would be well if cynthia could forget her childhood altogether instead of fixing it in her mind by the relation of her grievances and troubles so it was not now by any want of confidence that molly felt distanced as it were it was because cynthia rather avoided than sought her companionship because her eyes shunned the straight serious loving look of mollys because there were certain subjects on which she evidently disliked speaking not particularly interesting things as far as molly could perceive but it almost seemed as if they lay on the road to points to be avoided molly felt a sort of sighing pleasure in noticing cynthias changed manner of talking about roger she spoke of him tenderly now poor roger as she called him and molly thought that she must be referring to the illness which he had mentioned in his last letter one morning in the first week after cynthias return home just as he was going out mr gibson ran up into the drawingroom hat on booted and spurred and hastily laid an open pamphlet down before her pointing out a particular passage with his finger but not speaking a word before he rapidly quitted the room his eyes were sparkling and had an amused as well as pleased expression all this molly noticed as well as cynthias flush of colour as she read what was thus pointed out to her then she pushed it a little on one side not closing the book however and went on with her work what is it may i see it asked molly stretching out her hand for the pamphlet which lay within her reach but she did not take it until cynthia had said certainly i dont suppose there are any great secrets in a scientific journal full of reports of meetings and she gave the book a little push towards molly oh cynthia said molly catching her breath as she read are you not proud for it was an account of an annual gathering of the geographical society and lord hollingford had read a letter he had received from roger hamley dated from arracuoba a district in africa hitherto unvisited by any intelligent european traveller and about which mr hamley sent many curious particulars the reading of this letter had been received with the greatest interest and several subsequent speakers had paid the writer very high compliments but molly might have known cynthia better than to expect an answer responsive to the feelings that prompted her question let cynthia be ever so proud ever so glad or so grateful or even indignant remorseful grieved or sorry the very fact that she was expected by another to entertain any of these emotions would have been enough to prevent her expressing them im afraid im not as much struck by the wonder of the thing as you are molly besides it is not news to me at least not entirely i heard about the meeting before i left london it was a good deal talked about in my uncles set to be sure i didnt hear all the fine things they say of him therebut then you know thats a mere fashion of speaking which means nothing somebody is bound to pay compliments when a lord takes the trouble to read one of his letters aloud nonsense said molly you know you dont believe what you are saying cynthia cynthia gave that pretty little jerk of her shoulders which was her equivalent for a french shrug but did not lift up her head from her sewing molly began to read the report over again why cynthia she said you might have been there ladies were there it says many ladies were present oh couldnt you have managed to go if your uncles set cared about these things wouldnt some of them have taken you perhaps if i had asked them but i think they would have been rather astonished at my sudden turn for science you might have told your uncle how matters really stood he wouldnt have talked about it if you had wished him not i am sure and he could have helped you once for all molly said cynthia now laying down her work and speaking with quick authority do learn to understand that it is and always has been my wish not to have the relation which roger and i bear to each other mentioned or talked about when the right time comes i will make it known to my uncle and to everybody whom it may concern but i am not going to make mischief and get myself into troubleeven for the sake of hearing compliments paid to himby letting it out before the time if im pushed to it id sooner break it off altogether at once and have done with it i cant be worse off than i am now her angry tone had changed into a kind of desponding complaint before she had ended her sentence molly looked at her with dismay i cant understand you cynthia she said at length no i daresay you cant said cynthia looking at her with tears in her eyes and very tenderly as if in atonement for her late vehemence i am afraidi hope you never will in a moment mollys arms were round her oh cynthia she murmured have i been plaguing you have i vexed you dont say youre afraid of my knowing you of course youve your faults everybody has but i think i love you the better for them i dont know that i am so very bad said cynthia smiling a little through the tears that mollys words and caresses had forced to overflow from her eyes but i have got into scrapes im in a scrape now i do sometimes believe i shall always be in scrapes and if they ever come to light i shall seem to be worse than i really am and i know your father will throw me off and ino i wont be afraid that you will molly im sure i wont are theydo you thinkhow would roger take it asked molly very timidly i dont know i hope he will never hear of it i dont see why he should for in a little while i shall be quite clear again it all came about without my ever thinking i was doing wrong ive a great mind to tell you all about it molly molly did not like to urge it though she longed to know and to see if she could not offer help but while cynthia was hesitating and perhaps to say the truth rather regretting that she had even made this slight advance towards bestowing her confidence mrs gibson came in full of some manner of altering a gown of hers so as to make it into the fashion of the day as she had seen it during her visit to london cynthia seemed to forget her tears and her troubles and to throw her whole soul into millinery cynthias correspondence went on pretty briskly with her london cousins according to the usual rate of correspondence in those days indeed mrs gibson was occasionally inclined to complain of the frequency of helen kirkpatricks letters for before the penny post came in the recipient had to pay the postage of letters and elevenpencehalfpenny three times a week came according to mrs gibsons mode of reckoning when annoyed to a sum between three and four shillings but these complaints were only for the family they saw the wrong side of the tapestry hollingford in general miss brownings in particular heard of dear helens enthusiastic friendship for cynthia and of the real pleasure it was to receive such constant newsrelays of news indeedfrom london it was almost as good as living there a great deal better i should think said miss browning with some severity for she had got many of her notions of the metropolis from the british essayists where town is so often represented as the centre of dissipation corrupting country wives and squires daughters and unfitting them for all their duties by the constant whirl of its not always innocent pleasures london was a sort of moral pitch which few could touch and not be defiled miss browning had been on the watch for the signs of deterioration in cynthias character ever since her return home but except in a greater number of pretty and becoming articles of dress there was no great change for the worse to be perceived cynthia had been in the world had beheld the glare and glitter and dazzling display of london yet had come back to hollingford as ready as ever to place a chair for miss browning or to gather flowers for a nosegay for miss phoebe or to mend her own clothes but all this was set down to the merits of cynthia not to the credit of londontown as far as i can judge of london said miss browning sententiously continuing her tirade against the place its no better than a pickpocket and a robber dressed up in the spoils of honest folk i should like to know where my lord hollingford was bred and mr roger hamley your good husband lent me that report of the meeting mrs gibson where so much was said about them both and he was as proud of their praises as if he had been akin to them and phoebe read it aloud to me for the print was too small for my eyes she was a good deal perplexed with all the new names of places but i said she had better skip them all for we had never heard of them before and probably should never hear of them again but she read out the fine things they said of my lord and mr roger and i put it to you where were they born and bred why within eight miles of hollingford it might have been molly there or me its all a chance and then they go and talk about the pleasures of intellectual society in london and the distinguished people up there that it is such an advantage to know and all the time i know its only shops and the play thats the real attraction but thats neither here nor there we all put our best foot foremost and if we have a reason to give that looks sensible we speak it out like men and never say anything about the silliness we are hugging to our hearts but i ask you again where does this fine society come from and these wise men and these distinguished travellers why out of country parishes like this london picks em all up and decks herself with them and then calls out loud to the folks shes robbed and says come and see how fine i am fine indeed ive no patience with london cynthia is much better out of it and im not sure if i were you mrs gibson if i wouldnt stop up those london letters theyll only be unsettling her but perhaps she may live in london some of these days miss browning simpered mrs gibson time enough then to be thinking of london i wish her an honest country husband with enough to live upon and a little to lay by and a good character to boot mind that molly said she firing round upon the startled molly i wish cynthia a husband with a good character but shes got a mother to look after her youve none and when your mother was alive she was a dear friend of mine so im not going to let you throw yourself away upon any one whose life isnt clear and aboveboard you may depend upon it this last speech fell like a bomb into the quiet little drawingroom it was delivered with such vehemence miss browning in her secret heart meant it as a warning against the intimacy she believed that molly had formed with mr preston but as it happened that molly had never dreamed of any such intimacy the girl could not imagine why such severity of speech should be addressed to her mrs gibson who always took up the points of every word or action where they touched her own self and called it sensitiveness broke the silence that followed miss brownings speech by saying plaintively im sure miss browning you are very much mistaken if you think that any mother could take more care of molly than i do i donti cant think there is any need for any one to interfere to protect her and i have not an idea why you have been talking in this way just as if we were all wrong and you were all right it hurts my feelings indeed it does for molly can tell you there is not a thing or a favour that cynthia has that she has not and as for not taking care of her why if she were to go up to london tomorrow i should make a point of going with her to see after her and i never did it for cynthia when she was at school in france and her bedroom is furnished just like cynthias and i let her wear my red shawl whenever she likesshe might have it oftener if she would i cant think what you mean miss browning i did not mean to offend you but i meant just to give molly a hint she understands what i mean im sure i dont said molly boldly i havent a notion what you meant if you were alluding to anything more than you said straight outthat you do not wish me to marry any one who hasnt a good character and that as you were a friend of mammas you would prevent my marrying a man with a bad character by every means in your power im not thinking of marrying i dont want to marry anybody at all but if i did and he were not a good man i should thank you for coming and warning me of it i shall not stand on warning you molly i shall forbid the banns in church if need be said miss browning half convinced of the clear transparent truth of what molly had saidblushing all over it is true but with her steady eyes fixed on miss brownings face while she spoke do said molly well well i wont say any more perhaps i was mistaken we wont say any more about it but remember what i have said molly theres no harm in that at any rate im sorry i hurt your feelings mrs gibson as stepmothers go i think you try and do your duty good morning goodby to you both and god bless you if miss browning thought that her final blessing would secure peace in the room she was leaving she was very much mistaken mrs gibson burst out with try and do my duty indeed i should be much obliged to you molly if you would take care not to behave in such a manner as to bring down upon me such impertinence as i have just been receiving from miss browning but i dont know what made her talk as she did mamma said molly im sure i dont know and i dont care either but i know that i never was spoken to as if i was trying to do my duty beforetrying indeed everybody always knew that i did it without talking about it before my face in that rude manner ive that deep feeling about duty that i think it ought only to be talked about in church and in such sacred places as that not to have a common caller startling one with it even though she was an early friend of your mothers and as if i didnt look after you quite as much as i look after cynthia why it was only yesterday i went up into cynthias room and found her reading a letter that she put away in a hurry as soon as i came in and i didnt even ask her who it was from and im sure i should have made you tell me very likely mrs gibson shrank from any conflicts with cynthia pretty sure that she would be worsted in the end while molly generally submitted sooner than have any struggle for her own will just then cynthia came in whats the matter said she quickly seeing that something was wrong why molly has been doing something which has set that impertinent miss browning off into lecturing me on trying to do my duty if your poor father had but lived cynthia i should never have been spoken to as i have been a stepmother trying to do her duty indeed that was miss brownings expression any allusion to her father took from cynthia all desire of irony she came forward and again asked molly what was the matter molly herself ruffled made answer miss browning seemed to think i was likely to marry some one whose character was objectionable you molly said cynthia yesshe once before spoke to mei suspect she has got some notion about mr preston in her head cynthia sate down quite suddenly molly went on and she spoke as if mamma did not look enough after mei think she was rather provoking not rather but veryvery impertinent said mrs gibson a little soothed by mollys recognition of her grievance what could have put it into her head said cynthia very quietly taking up her sewing as she spoke i dont know said her mother replying to the question after her own fashion im sure i dont always approve of mr preston but even if it was him she was thinking about hes far more agreeable than she is and i had much rather have him coming to call than an old maid like her any day i dont know that it was mr preston she was thinking about said molly it was only a guess when you were both in london she spoke about himi thought she had heard something about you and him cynthia unseen by her mother cynthia looked up at molly her eyes full of prohibition her cheeks full of angry colour molly stopped short suddenly after that look she was surprised at the quietness with which cynthia said almost immediately well after all it is only your fancy that she was alluding to mr preston so perhaps we had better not say any more about him and as for her advice to mamma to look after you better miss molly ill stand bail for your good behaviour for both mamma and i know youre the last person to do any foolish things in that way and now dont let us talk any more about it i was coming to tell you that hannah brands little boy has been badly burnt and his sister is downstairs asking for old linen mrs gibson was always kind to poor people and she immediately got up and went to her stores to search for the article wanted cynthia turned quietly round to molly molly pray dont ever allude to anything between me and mr prestonnot to mamma nor to any one never do ive a reason for itdont say anything more about it ever mrs gibson came back at this moment and molly had to stop short again on the brink of cynthias confidence uncertain indeed this time whether she would have been told anything more and only sure that she had annoyed cynthia a good deal but the time was approaching when she would know all chapter xlii the storm bursts the autumn drifted away through all its seasons the golden cornharvest the walks through the stubblefields and rambles into hazelcopses in search of nuts the stripping of the appleorchards of their ruddy fruit amid the joyous cries and shouts of watching children and the gorgeous tuliplike colouring of the later time had now come on with the shortening days there was comparative silence in the land excepting for the distant shots and the whirr of the partridges as they rose up from the field ever since miss brownings unlucky conversation things had been ajar in the gibsons house cynthia seemed to keep every one out at mental armslength and particularly avoided any private talks with molly mrs gibson still cherishing a grudge against miss browning for her implied accusation of not looking enough after molly chose to exercise a most wearying supervision over the poor girl it was where have you been child who did you see who was that letter from why were you so long out when you had only to go to soandso just as if molly had really been detected in carrying on some underhand intercourse she answered every question asked of her with the simple truthfulness of perfect innocence but the inquiries although she read their motive and knew that they arose from no especial suspicion of her conduct but only that mrs gibson might be able to say that she looked well after her stepdaughter chafed her inexpressibly very often she did not go out at all sooner than have to give a plan of her intended proceedings when perhaps she had no plan at allonly thought of wandering out at her own sweet will and of taking pleasure in the bright solemn fading of the year it was a very heavy time for mollyzest and life had fled and left so many of the old delights mere shells of seeming she thought it was that her youth had fled at nineteen cynthia was no longer the same somehow and perhaps cynthias change would injure her in the distant rogers opinion her stepmother seemed almost kind in comparison with cynthias withdrawal of her heart mrs gibson worried her to be sure with all these forms of watching over her but in all her other ways she at any rate was the same yet cynthia herself seemed anxious and careworn though she would not speak of her anxieties to molly and then the poor girl in her goodness would blame herself for feeling cynthias change of manner for as molly said to herself if it is hard work for me to help always fretting after roger and wondering where he is and how he is what must it be for her one day mr gibson came in bright and swift molly said he wheres cynthia gone out to do some errands well its a pitybut never mind put on your bonnet and cloak as fast as you can ive had to borrow old simpsons dogcartthere would have been room both for you and cynthia but as it is you must walk back alone ill drive you as far on the barford road as i can and then you must jump down i cant take you on to broadhursts i may be kept there for hours mrs gibson was out of the room out of the house it might be for all molly cared now she had her fathers leave and command her bonnet and cloak were on in two minutes and she was sitting by her fathers side the back seat shut up and the light weight going swiftly and merrily bumping over the stonepaved lanes oh this is charming said molly after a tossup on her seat from a tremendous bump for youth but not for crabbed age said mr gibson my bones are getting rheumatic and would rather go smoothly over macadamized streets thats treason to this lovely view and this fine pure air papa only i dont believe you thank you as you are so complimentary i think i shall put you down at the foot of this hill weve passed the second milestone from hollingford oh let me just go up to the top i know we can see the blue range of the malverns from it and dorrimer hall among the woods the horse will want a minutes rest and then i will get down without a word so she went up to the top of the hill and there they sate still a minute or two enjoying the view without much speaking the woods were golden the old house of purplered brick with its twisted chimneys rose up from among them facing on to green lawns and a placid lake beyond again were the malvern hills now jump down lassie and make the best of your way home before it gets dark youll find the cut over croston heath shorter than the road weve come by to get to croston heath molly had to go down a narrow lane overshadowed by trees with picturesque old cottages dotted here and there on the steep sandy banks and then there came a small wood and then there was a brook to be crossed on a plankbridge and up the steeper fields on the opposite side were cut steps in the turfy path these ended she was on croston heath a widestretching common skirted by labourers dwellings past which a near road to hollingford lay the loneliest part of the road was the firstthe lane the wood the little bridge and the clambering through the upland fields but molly cared little for loneliness she went along the lane under the overarching elmbranches from which here and there a yellow leaf came floating down upon her very dress past the last cottage where a little child had tumbled down the sloping bank and was publishing the accident with frightened cries molly stooped to pick it up and taking it in her arms in a manner which caused intense surprise to take the place of alarm in its little breast she carried it up the rough flag steps towards the cottage which she supposed to be its home the mother came running in from the garden behind the house still holding the late damsons she had been gathering in her apron but on seeing her the little creature held out its arms to go to her and she dropped her damsons all about as she took it and began to soothe it as it cried afresh interspersing her lulling with thanks to molly she called her by her name and on molly asking the woman how she came to know it she replied that before her marriage she had been a servant of mrs goodenough and so was bound to know dr gibsons daughter by sight after the exchange of two or three more words molly ran down into the lane and pursued her way stopping here and there to gather a nosegay of such leaves as struck her for their brilliant colouring she entered the wood as she turned a corner in the lonely path she heard a passionate voice of distress and in an instant she recognized cynthias tones she stood still and looked around there were some thick hollybushes shining out dark green in the midst of the amber and scarlet foliage if any one was there it must be behind these thick bushes so molly left the path and went straight plunging through the brown tangled growth of ferns and underwood and turned the holly bushes there stood mr preston and cynthia he holding her hands tight each looking as if just silenced in some vehement talk by the rustle of mollys footsteps illustration there stood mr preston and cynthia for an instant no one spoke then cynthia said oh molly molly come and judge between us mr preston let go cynthias hands slowly with a look that was more of a sneer than a smile and yet he too had been strongly agitated whatever was the subject in dispute molly came forward and took cynthias arm her eyes steadily fixed on mr prestons face it was fine to see the fearlessness of her perfect innocence he could not bear her look and said to cynthia the subject of our conversation does not well admit of a third persons presence as miss gibson seems to wish for your company now i must beg you to fix some other time and place where we can finish our discussion i will go if cynthia wishes me said molly no no stayi want you to stayi want you to hear it alli wish i had told you sooner you mean that you regret that she has not been made aware of our engagementthat you promised long ago to be my wife pray remember that it was you who made me promise secrecy not i you i dont believe him cynthia dont dont cry if you can help it i dont believe him cynthia said he suddenly changing his tone to fervid tenderness pray pray do not go on so you cant think how it distresses me he stepped forward to try and take her hand and soothe her but she shrank away from him and sobbed the more irrepressibly she felt mollys presence so much to be a protection that now she dared to let herself go and to weaken herself by giving way to her emotion go away said molly dont you see you make her worse but he did not stir he was looking at cynthia so intently that he did not seem even to hear her go said molly vehemently if it really distresses you to see her cry dont you see its you who are the cause of it i will go if cynthia tells me said he at length oh molly i dont know what to do said cynthia taking down her hands from her tearstained face and appealing to molly and sobbing worse than ever in fact she became hysterical and though she tried to speak coherently no intelligible words would come run to that cottage in the trees and fetch her a cup of water said molly he hesitated a little why dont you go said molly impatiently i have not done speaking to her you will not leave before i come back no dont you see she cant move in this state he went quickly if reluctantly cynthia was some time before she could check her sobs enough to speak at length she saidmolly i do hate him but what did he mean by saying you were engaged to him dont cry dear but tell me if i can help you i will but i cant imagine what it all really is its too long a story to tell now and im not strong enough look hes coming back as soon as i can let us get home with all my heart said molly he brought the water and cynthia drank and was restored to calmness now said molly we had better go home as fast as you can manage it its getting dark quickly if she hoped to carry cynthia off so easily she was mistaken mr preston was resolute on this point he said i think since miss gibson has made herself acquainted with this much we had better let her know the whole truththat you are engaged to marry me as soon as you are twenty otherwise your being here with me and by appointment too may appear strangeeven equivocal to her as i know that cynthia is engaged toanother man you can hardly expect me to believe what you say mr preston oh molly said cynthia trembling all over but trying to be calm i am not engagedneither to the person you mean nor to mr preston mr preston forced a smile i think i have some letters that would convince miss gibson of the truth of what i have said and which will convince mr osborne hamley if necessaryi conclude it is to him she is alluding i am quite puzzled by you both said molly the only thing i do know is that we ought not to be standing here at this time of evening and that cynthia and i shall go home directly if you want to talk to miss kirkpatrick mr preston why dont you come to my fathers house and ask to see her openly and like a gentleman i am perfectly willing said he i shall only be too glad to explain to mr gibson on what terms i stand in relation to her if i have not done it sooner it is because i have yielded to her wishes pray pray dont mollyyou dont know allyou dont know anything about it you mean well and kindly i know but you are only making mischief i am quite well enough to walk do let us go i will tell you all about it when we are at home she took mollys arm and tried to hasten her away but mr preston followed talking as he walked by their side i do not know what you will say at home but can you deny that you are my promised wife can you deny that it has only been at your earnest request that i have kept the engagement secret so long he was unwisecynthia stopped and turned at bay since you will have it outsince i must speak here i own that what you say is literally true that when i was a neglected girl of sixteen youwhom i believed to be a friend lent me money at my need and made me give you a promise of marriage made you said he laying an emphasis on the first word cynthia turned scarlet made is not the right word i confess i liked you thenyou were almost my only friendand if it had been a question of immediate marriage i daresay i should never have objected but i know you better now and you have persecuted me so of late that i tell you once for all as i have told you before till i am sick of the very words that nothing shall ever make me marry you nothing i see theres no chance of escaping exposure and i daresay losing my character and i know losing all the few friends i have never me said molly touched by the wailing tone of despair that cynthia was falling into it is hard said mr preston you may believe all the bad things you like about me cynthia but i dont think you can doubt my real passionate disinterested love for you i do doubt it said cynthia breaking out with fresh energy ah when i think of the selfdenying affection i have seeni have knownaffection that thought of others before itself mr preston broke in at the pause she made she was afraid of revealing too much to him you do not call it love which has been willing to wait for yearsto be silent while silence was desiredto suffer jealousy and to bear neglect relying on the solemn promise of a girl of sixteenfor solemn say flimsy when that girl grows older cynthia i have loved you and i do love you and i wont give you up if you will but keep your word and marry me ill swear ill make you love me in return oh i wishi wish id never borrowed that unlucky money it was the beginning of it all oh molly i have saved and scrimped to repay it and he wont take it now i thought if i could but repay it it would set me free you seem to imply you sold yourself for twenty pounds he said they were nearly on the common now close to the protection of the cottages in very hearing of their inmates if neither of the other two thought of this molly did and resolved in her mind to call in at one of them and ask for the labourers protection home at any rate his presence must put a stop to this miserable altercation i did not sell myself i liked you then but oh how i do hate you now cried cynthia unable to contain her words he bowed and turned back vanishing rapidly down the field staircase at any rate that was a relief yet the two girls hastened on as if he was still pursuing them once when molly said something to cynthia the latter replied molly if you pity meif you love medont say anything more just now we shall have to look as if nothing had happened when we get home come to my room when we go upstairs to bed and ill tell you all i know youll blame me terribly but i will tell you all so molly did not say another word till they reached home and then comparatively at ease inasmuch as no one perceived how late was their return to the house each of the girls went up into their separate rooms to rest and calm themselves before dressing for the necessary family gathering at dinner molly felt as if she were so miserably shaken that she could not have gone down at all if her own interests only had been at stake she sate by her dressingtable holding her head in her hands her candles unlighted and the room in soft darkness trying to still her beating heart and to recall all she had heard and what would be its bearing on the lives of those whom she loved roger oh rogerfar away in mysterious darkness of distanceloving as he did ah that was love that was the love to which cynthia had referred as worthy of the name and the object of his love claimed by anotherfalse to one she must be how could it be what would he think and feel if ever he came to know it it was of no use trying to imagine his painthat could do no good what lay before molly was to try and extricate cynthia if she could help her by thought or advice or action not to weaken herself by letting her fancy run into pictures of possible probable suffering when she went into the drawingroom before dinner she found cynthia and her mother by themselves there were candles in the room but they were not lighted for the woodfire blazed merrily if fitfully and they were awaiting mr gibsons return which might be expected at any minute cynthia sate in the shade so it was only by her sensitive ear that molly could judge of her state of composure mrs gibson was telling some of her days adventureswhom she had found at home in the calls she had been making who had been out and the small pieces of news she had heard to mollys quick sympathy cynthias voice sounded languid and weary but she made all the proper replies and expressed the proper interest at the right places and molly came to the rescue chiming in with an effort it is true but mrs gibson was not one to notice slight shades or differences in manner when mr gibson returned the relative positions of the parties were altered it was cynthia now who raised herself into liveliness partly from a consciousness that he would have noticed any depression and partly because cynthia was one of those natural coquettes who from their cradle to their grave instinctively bring out all their prettiest airs and graces in order to stand well with any man young or old who may happen to be present she listened to his remarks and stories with all the sweet intentness of happier days till molly silent and wondering could hardly believe that the cynthia before her was the same girl as she who was sobbing and crying as if her heart would break but two hours before it is true she looked pale and heavyeyed but that was the only sign she gave of her past trouble which yet must be a present care thought molly after dinner mr gibson went out to his town patients mrs gibson subsided into her armchair holding a sheet of the times before her behind which she took a quiet and ladylike doze cynthia had a book in one hand with the other she shaded her eyes from the light molly alone could neither read nor sleep nor work she sate in the seat in the bowwindow the blind was not drawn down for there was no danger of their being overlooked she gazed into the soft outer darkness and found herself striving to discern the outlines of objectsthe cottage at the end of the gardenthe great beechtree with the seat round itthe wire arches up which the summer roses had clambered each came out faint and dim against the dusky velvet of the atmosphere presently tea came and there was the usual nightly bustle the table was cleared mrs gibson roused herself and made the same remark about dear papa that she had done at the same hour for weeks past cynthia too did not look different from usual and yet what a hidden mystery did her calmness hide thought molly at length came bedtime and the customary little speeches both molly and cynthia went to their own rooms without exchanging a word when molly was in hers she had forgotten whether she was to go to cynthia or cynthia to come to her she took off her gown and put on her dressinggown and stood and waited and even sat down for a minute or two but cynthia did not come so molly went and knocked at the opposite door which to her surprise she found shut when she entered the room cynthia sate by her dressingtable just as she had come up from the drawingroom she had been leaning her head on her arms and seemed almost to have forgotten the tryst she had made with molly for she looked up as if startled and her face did seem full of worry and distress in her solitude she made no more exertion but gave way to thoughts of care chapter xliii cynthias confession you said i might come said molly and that you would tell me all you know all i think said cynthia heavily perhaps you dont know what excuses i have but at any rate you know what a scrape i am in ive been thinking a great deal said molly timidly and doubtfully and i cant help fancying if you told papa before she could go on cynthia had stood up no said she that i wont unless im to leave here at once and you know i have not another place to go towithout warning i mean i daresay my uncle would take me in hes a relation and would be bound to stand by me in whatever disgrace i might be or perhaps i might get a governesss situationa pretty governess i should be pray please cynthia dont go off into such wild talking i dont believe youve done so very wrong you say you have not and i believe you that horrid man has managed to get you involved in some way but i am sure papa could set it to rights if you would only make a friend of him and tell him all no molly said cynthia i cant and theres an end of it you may if you like only let me leave the house first give me that much time you know i would never tell anything you wished me not to tell cynthia said molly deeply hurt would you not darling said cynthia taking her hand will you promise me that quite a sacred promisefor it would be such a comfort to me to tell you all now you know so much yes ill promise not to tell you should not have doubted me said molly still a little sorrowfully very well i trust to you i know i may but do think of telling papa and getting him to help you persevered molly never said cynthia resolutely but more quietly than before do you think i forget what he said at the time of that wretched mr coxe how severe he was and how long i was in disgrace if indeed im out of it now i am one of those people as mamma says sometimesi cannot live with persons who dont think well of me it may be a weakness or a sinim sure i dont know and i dont care but i really cannot be happy in the same house with any one who knows my faults and thinks that they are greater than my merits now you know your father would do that i have often told you that he and you too molly had a higher standard than i had ever known oh i couldnt bear it if he were to know he would be so angry with mehe would never get over it and i have so liked him i do so like him well never mind dear he shall not know said molly for cynthia was again becoming hystericalat least well say no more about it now and youll never say any moreneverpromise me said cynthia taking her hand eagerly never till you give me leave now do let me see if i cannot help you lie down on the bed and ill sit by you and let us talk it over but cynthia sat down again in the chair by the dressingtable when did it all begin said molly after a long pause of silence long agofour or five years i was such a child to be left all to myself it was the holidays and mamma was away visiting and the donaldsons asked me to go with them to the worcester festival you cant fancy how pleasant it all sounded especially to me i had been shut up in that great dreary house at ashcombe where mamma had her school it belonged to lord cumnor and mr preston as his agent had to see it all painted and papered but besides that he was very intimate with us i believe mamma thoughtno im not sure about that and i have enough blame to lay at her door to prevent my telling you anything that may be only fancy then she paused and sate still for a minute or two recalling the past molly was struck by the aged and careworn expression which had taken temporary hold of the brilliant and beautiful face she could see from that how much cynthia must have suffered from this hidden trouble of hers well at any rate we were intimate with him and he came a great deal about the house and knew as much as any one of mammas affairs and all the ins and outs of her life im telling you this in order that you may understand how natural it was for me to answer his questions when he came one day and found me not crying for you know im not much given to that in spite of todays exposure of myself but fretting and fuming because though mamma had written word i might go with the donaldsons she had never said how i was to get any money for the journey much less for anything of dress and i had outgrown all my last years frocks and as for gloves and bootsin short i really had hardly clothes decent enough for church why didnt you write to her and tell her all this said molly half afraid of appearing to cast blame by her very natural question i wish i had her letter to show you you must have seen some of mammas letters though dont you know how she always seems to leave out just the important point of every fact in this case she descanted largely on the enjoyment she was having and the kindness she was receiving and her wish that i could have been with her and her gladness that i too was going to have some pleasure but the only thing that would have been of real use to me she left out and that was where she was going to next she mentioned that she was leaving the house she was stopping at the day after she wrote and that she should be at home by a certain date but i got the letter on a saturday and the festival began the next tuesday poor cynthia said molly still if you had written your letter might have been forwarded i dont mean to be hard only i do so dislike the thought of your ever having made a friend of that man ah said cynthia sighing how easy it is to judge rightly after one sees what evil comes from judging wrongly i was only a young girl hardly more than a child and he was a friend to us thenexcepting mamma the only friend i knew the donaldsons were only kind and goodnatured acquaintances i am sorry said molly humbly i have been so happy with papa i hardly can understand how different it must have been with you different i should think so the worry about money made me sick of my life we might not say we were poor it would have injured the school but i would have stinted and starved if mamma and i had got on as happily together as we might have doneas you and mr gibson do it was not the poverty it was that she never seemed to care to have me with her as soon as the holidays came round she was off to some great house or another and i daresay i was at a very awkward age to have me lounging about in the drawingroom when callers came girls at the age i was then are so terribly keen at scenting out motives and putting in their disagreeable questions as to the little twistings and twirlings and vanishings of conversation theyve no distinct notion of what are the truths and falsehoods of polite life at any rate i was very much in mammas way and i felt it mr preston seemed to feel it too for me and i was very grateful to him for kind words and sympathetic lookscrumbs of kindness which would have dropped under your table unnoticed so this day when he came to see how the workmen were getting on he found me in the deserted schoolroom looking at my faded summer bonnet and some old ribbons i had been sponging and halfwornout glovesa sort of ragfair spread out on the deal table i was in a regular passion with only looking at that shabbiness he said he was so glad to hear i was going to this festival with the donaldsons old betty our servant had told him the news i believe but i was so perplexed about money and my vanity was so put out about my shabby dress that i was in a pet and said i shouldnt go he sate down on the table and little by little he made me tell him all my troubles i do sometimes think he was very nice in those days somehow i never felt as if it was wrong or foolish or anything to accept his offer of money at the time he had twenty pounds in his pocket he said and really didnt know what to do with itshouldnt want it for months i could repay it or rather mamma could when it suited her she must have known i should want money and most likely thought i should apply to him twenty pounds wouldnt be too much i must take it all and so on i knewat least i thought i knewthat i should never spend twenty pounds but i thought i could give him back what i didnt want and sowell that was the beginning it doesnt sound so very wrong does it molly no said molly hesitatingly she did not wish to make herself into a hard judge and yet she did so dislike mr preston cynthia went on well what with boots and gloves and a bonnet and a mantle and a white muslin gown which was made for me before i left on tuesday and a silk gown that followed to the donaldsons and my journeys and all there was very little left of the twenty pounds especially when i found i must get a balldress in worcester for we were all to go to the ball mrs donaldson gave me my ticket but she rather looked grave at my idea of going to the ball in my white muslin which i had already worn two evenings at their house oh dear how pleasant it must be to be rich you know continued cynthia smiling a very little i cant help being aware that im pretty and that people admire me very much i found it out first at the donaldsons i began to think i did look pretty in my fine new clothes and i saw that other people thought so too i was certainly the belle of the house and it was very pleasant to feel my power the last day or two of that gay week mr preston joined our party the last time he had seen me was when i was dressed in shabby clothes too small for me halfcrying in my solitude neglected and penniless at the donaldsons i was a little queen and as i said fine feathers make fine birds and all the people were making much of me and at that ball which was the first night he came i had more partners than i knew what to do with i suppose he really did fall in love with me then i dont think he had done so before and then i began to feel how awkward it was to be in his debt i couldnt give myself airs to him as i did to others oh it was so awkward and uncomfortable but i liked him and felt him as a friend all the time the last day i was walking in the garden along with the others and i thought i would tell him how much i had enjoyed myself and how happy i had been all thanks to his twenty pounds i was beginning to feel like cinderella when the clock was striking twelve and to tell him it should be repaid to him as soon as possible though i turned sick at the thought of telling mamma and knew enough of our affairs to understand how very difficult it would be to muster up the money the end of our talk came very soon for almost to my terror he began to talk violent love to me and to beg me to promise to marry him i was so frightened that i ran away to the others but that night i got a letter from him apologizing for startling me renewing his offer his entreaties for a promise of marriage to be fulfilled at any date i would please to namein fact a most urgent loveletter and in it a reference to my unlucky debt which was to be a debt no longer only an advance of the money to be hereafter mine if only you can fancy it all molly better than i can remember it to tell it you and what did you say asked molly breathless i did not answer it at all until another letter came entreating for a reply by that time mamma had come home and the old daily pressure and plaint of poverty had come on mary donaldson wrote to me often singing the praises of mr preston as enthusiastically as if she had been bribed to do it i had seen him a very popular man in their set and i liked him well enough and felt grateful to him so i wrote and gave him my promise to marry him when i was twenty but it was to be a secret till then and i tried to forget i had ever borrowed money of him but somehow as soon as i felt pledged to him i began to hate him i couldnt endure his eagerness of greeting if ever he found me alone and mamma began to suspect i think i cannot tell you all the ins and outs in fact i didnt understand them at the time and i dont remember clearly how it all happened now but i know that lady cuxhaven sent mamma some money to be applied to my education as she called it and mamma seemed very much put out and in very low spirits and she and i didnt get on at all together so of course i never ventured to name the hateful twenty pounds to her but went on trying to think that if i was to marry mr preston it need never be paidvery mean and wicked i daresay but oh molly ive been punished for it for how i abhor that man but why when did you begin to dislike him you seem to have taken it very passively all this time i dont know it was growing upon me before i went to that school at boulogne he made me feel as if i was in his power and by too often reminding me of my engagement to him he made me critical of his words and ways there was an insolence in his manner to mamma too ah youre thinking that im not too respectful a daughterand perhaps not but i couldnt bear his covert sneers at her faults and i hated his way of showing what he called his love for me then after i had been a semestre at mdme lefevres a new english girl camea cousin of his who knew but little of me now molly you must forget as soon as ive told you what im going to say and she used to talk so much and perpetually about her cousin roberthe was the great man of the family evidentlyand how he was so handsome and every lady of the land in love with hima lady of title into the bargain lady harriet i daresay said molly indignantly i dont know said cynthia wearily i didnt care at the time and i dont care now for she went on to say there was a very pretty widow too who made desperate love to him he had often laughed with them at all her little advances which she thought he didnt see through and oh and this was the man i had promised to marry and gone into debt to and written loveletters to so now you understand it all molly no i dont yet what did you do on hearing how he had spoken about your mother there was but one thing to do i wrote and told him i hated him and would never never marry him and would pay him back his money and the interest on it as soon as ever i could well and mdme lefevre brought me back my letterunopened i will say and told me that she didnt allow letters to gentlemen to be sent by the pupils of her establishment unless she had previously seen their contents i told her he was a family friend the agent who managed mammas affairsi really could not stick at the truth but she wouldnt let it go and i had to see her burn it and to give her my promise i wouldnt write again before she would consent not to tell mamma so i had to calm down and wait till i came home but you didnt see him then at least not for some time no but i could write and i began to try and save up my money to pay him what did he say to your letter oh at first he pretended not to believe i could be in earnest he thought it was only pique or a temporary offence to be apologized for and covered over with passionate protestations and afterwards he condescended to threats and what is worse then i turned coward i couldnt bear to have it all known and talked about and my silly letters shownoh such letters i cannot bear to think of them beginning my dearest robert to that man but oh cynthia how could you go and engage yourself to roger asked molly why not said cynthia sharply turning round upon her i was freei am free it seemed a way of assuring myself that i was quite free and i did like rogerit was such a comfort to be brought into contact with people who could be relied upon and i was not a stock or a stone that i could fail to be touched with his tender unselfish love so different to mr prestons i know you dont think me good enough for him and of course if all this comes out he wont think me good enough either falling into a plaintive tone very touching to hear and sometimes i think ill give him up and go off to some fresh life amongst strangers and once or twice ive thought i would marry mr preston out of pure revenge and have him for ever in my poweronly i think i should have the worst of it for he is cruel in his very soultigerish with his beautiful striped skin and relentless heart i have so begged and begged him to let me go without exposure never mind the exposure said molly it will recoil far more on him than harm you cynthia went a little paler but i said things in those letters about mamma i was quickeyed enough to all her faults and hardly understood the force of her temptations and he says he will show those letters to your father unless i consent to acknowledge our engagement he shall not said molly rising up in her indignation and standing before cynthia almost as resolutely fierce as if she were in the very presence of mr preston himself i am not afraid of him he dare not insult me or if he does i dont care i will ask him for those letters and see if he will dare to refuse me you dont know him said cynthia shaking her head he has made many an appointment with me just as if he would take back the moneywhich has been sealed up ready for him this four months or as if he would give me back my letters poor poor roger how little he thinks of all this when i want to write words of love to him i pull myself up for i have written words as affectionate to that other man and if mr preston ever guessed that roger and i were engaged he would manage to be revenged on both him and me by giving us as much pain as he could with those unlucky letterswritten when i was not sixteen mollyonly seven of them they are like a mine under my feet which may blow up any day and down will come father and mother and all she ended bitterly enough though her words were so light how can i get them said molly thinking for get them i will with papa to back me he dare not refuse ah but thats just the thing he knows im afraid of your fathers hearing of it all more than of any one else and yet he thinks he loves you it is his way of loving he says often enough he doesnt care what he does so that he gets me to be his wife and that after that he is sure he can make me love him cynthia began to cry out of weariness of body and despair of mind mollys arms were round her in a minute and she pressed the beautiful head to her bosom and laid her own cheek upon it and hushed her up with lulling words just as if cynthia were a little child oh it is such a comfort to have told you all murmured cynthia and molly made replyi am sure we have right on our side and that makes me certain he must and shall give up the letters and take the money added cynthia lifting her head and looking eagerly into mollys face he must take the money oh molly you can never manage it all without its coming out to your father and i would far rather go out to russia as a governess i almost think i would ratherno not that said she shuddering away from what she was going to say but he must not knowplease molly he must not know i couldnt bear it i dont know what i might not do youll promise me never to tell himor mamma i never will you do not think i would for anything short of saving she was going to have said saving you and roger from pain but cynthia broke in for nothing no reason whatever must make you tell your father if you fail you fail and i will love you for ever for trying but i shall be no worse off than before better indeed for i shall have the comfort of your sympathy but promise me not to tell mr gibson i have promised once said molly but i promise again so now do go to bed and try and rest you are looking as white as a sheet youll be ill if you dont get some rest and its past two oclock and youre shivering with cold so they wished each other goodnight but when molly got into her room all her spirit left her and she threw herself down on her bed dressed as she was for she had no heart left for anything if roger ever heard of it all by any chance she felt how it would disturb his love for cynthia and yet was it right to conceal it from him she must try and persuade cynthia to tell it all straight out to him as soon as he returned to england a full confession on her part would wonderfully lessen any pain he might have on first hearing of it she lost herself in thoughts of rogerhow he would feel what he would say how that meeting would come to pass where he was at that very time and so on till she suddenly plucked herself up and recollected what she herself had offered and promised to do now that the first fervour was over she saw the difficulties clearly and the foremost of all was how she was to manage to have an interview with mr preston how had cynthia managed and the letters that had passed between them too unwillingly molly was compelled to perceive that there must have been a great deal of underhand work going on beneath cynthias apparent openness of behaviour and still more unwillingly she began to be afraid that she herself might be led into the practice but she would try and walk in a straight path and if she did wander out of it it should only be to save pain to those whom she loved chapter xliv molly gibson to the rescue it seemed curious enough after the storms of the night to meet in smooth tranquillity at breakfast cynthia was pale but she talked as quietly as usual about all manner of indifferent things while molly sate silent watching and wondering and becoming convinced that cynthia must have gone through a long experience of concealing her real thoughts and secret troubles before she could have been able to put on such a semblance of composure among the letters that came in that morning was one from the london kirkpatricks but not from helen cynthias own particular correspondent her sister wrote to apologize for helen who was not well she said had had the influenza which had left her very weak and poorly let her come down here for change of air said mr gibson the country at this time of the year is better than london except when the place is surrounded by trees now our house is well drained high up gravelsoil and ill undertake to doctor her for nothing it would be charming said mrs gibson rapidly revolving in her mind the changes necessary in her household economy before receiving a young lady accustomed to such a household as mr kirkpatrickscalculating the consequent inconveniences and weighing them against the probable advantages even while she spoke should not you like it cynthia and molly too you then dear would become acquainted with one of the girls and i have no doubt you would be asked back again which would be so very nice and i shouldnt let her go said mr gibson who had acquired an unfortunate facility of reading his wifes thoughts dear helen went on mrs gibson i should so like to nurse her we would make your consultingroom into her own private sittingroom my dearit is hardly necessary to say that the scales had been weighed down by the inconveniences of having a person behind the scenes for several weeks for with an invalid so much depends on tranquillity in the drawingroom for instance she might constantly be disturbed by callers and the diningroom is soso what shall i call it so dinnerythe smell of meals never seems to leave it it would have been different if dear papa had allowed me to throw out that window why cant she have the dressingroom for her bedroom and the little room opening out of the drawingroom for her sittingroom asked mr gibson the library for by this name mrs gibson chose to dignify what had formerly been called the bookclosetwhy it would hardly hold a sofa besides the books and the writingtable and there are draughts everywhere no my dear we had better not ask her at all her own home is comfortable at any rate well well said mr gibson seeing that he was to be worsted and not caring enough about the matter to show fight perhaps youre right its a case of luxury versus fresh air some people suffer more from want of the one than from want of the other you know i shall be glad to see her if she likes to come and take us as we are but i cant give up the consultingroom its a necessity our daily bread ill write and tell them how kind mr gibson is said his wife in high contentment as her husband left the room theyll be just as much obliged to him as if she had come whether it was helens illness or from some other cause after breakfast cynthia became very flat and absent and this lasted all day long molly understood now why her moods had been so changeable for many months and was tender and forbearing with her accordingly towards evening when the two girls were left alone cynthia came and stood over molly so that her face could not be seen molly said she will you do it will you do what you said last night ive been thinking of it all day and sometimes i believe he would give you back the letters if you asked him he might fancyat any rate its worth trying if you dont very much dislike it now it so happened that with every thought she had given to it molly disliked the idea of the proposed interview with mr preston more and more but it was after all her own offer and she neither could nor would draw back from it it might do good she did not see how it could possibly do harm so she gave her consent and tried to conceal her distaste which grew upon her more and more as cynthia hastily arranged the details you shall meet him in the avenue leading from the park lodge up to the towers he can come in one way from the towers where he has often businesshe has passkeys everywhereyou can go in as we have often done by the lodgeyou need not go far it did strike molly that cynthia must have had some experience in making all these arrangements and she ventured to ask how he was to be informed of all this cynthia only reddened and replied oh never mind he will only be too glad to come you heard him say he wished to discuss the affair more it is the first time the appointment has come from my side if i can but once be freeoh molly i will love you and be grateful to you all my life molly thought of roger and that thought prompted her next speech it must be horriblei think im very bravebut i dont think i could havecould have accepted even roger with a halfcancelled engagement hanging over me she blushed as she spoke you forget how i detest mr preston said cynthia it was that more than any excess of love for roger that made me thankful to be at least as securely pledged to some one else he did not want to call it an engagement but i did because it gave me the feeling of assurance that i was free from mr preston and so i am all but these letters oh if you can but make him take back his abominable money and get me my letters then we would bury it all in oblivion and he could marry somebody else and i would marry roger and no one would be the wiser after all it was only what people call youthful folly and you may tell mr preston that as soon as he makes my letters public shows them to your father or anything ill go away from hollingford and never come back loaded with many such messages which she felt that she should never deliver not really knowing what she should say hating the errand not satisfied with cynthias manner of speaking about her relations to roger oppressed with shame and complicity in conduct which appeared to her deceitful yet willing to bear all and brave all if she could once set cynthia in a straight pathin a clear space and almost more pitiful to her friends great distress and possible disgrace than able to give her that love which involves perfect sympathy molly set out on her walk towards the appointed place it was a cloudy blustering day and the noise of the blowing wind among the nearly leafless branches of the great trees filled her ears as she passed through the parkgates and entered the avenue she walked quickly instinctively wishing to get her blood up and have no time for thought but there was a bend in the avenue about a quarter of a mile from the lodge after that bend it was a straight line up to the great house now emptied of its inhabitants molly did not like going quite out of sight of the lodge and she stood facing it close by the trunk of one of the trees presently she heard a step coming over the grass it was mr preston he saw a womans figure halfbehind the trunk of a tree and made no doubt that it was cynthia but when he came nearer almost close the figure turned round and instead of the brilliantly coloured face of cynthia he met the pale resolved look of molly she did not speak to greet him but though he felt sure from the general aspect of pallor and timidity that she was afraid of him her steady gray eyes met his with courageous innocence is cynthia unable to come asked he perceiving that she expected him i did not know you thought that you should meet her said molly a little surprised in her simplicity she had believed that cynthia had named that it was she molly gibson who would meet mr preston at a given time and place but cynthia had been too worldlywise for that and had decoyed him thither by a vaguely worded note which while avoiding actual falsehood had led him to believe that she herself would give him the meeting she said she should be here said mr preston extremely annoyed at being entrapped as he now felt that he had been into an interview with miss gibson molly hesitated a little before she spoke he was determined not to break the silence as she had intruded herself into the affair she should find her situation as awkward as possible at any rate she sent me here to meet you said molly she has told me exactly how matters stand between you and her has she sneered he she is not always the most open or reliable person in the world molly reddened she perceived the impertinence of the tone and her temper was none of the coolest but she mastered herself and gained courage by so doing you should not speak so of the person you profess to wish to have for your wife but putting all that aside you have some letters of hers that she wishes to have back again i daresay and that you have no right to keep no legal or no moral right which do you mean i do not know simply you have no right at all as a gentleman to keep a girls letters when she asks for them back again much less to hold them over her as a threat i see you do know all miss gibson said he changing his manner to one of more respect at least she has told you her story from her point of view her side now you must hear mine she promised me as solemnly as ever woman she was not a woman she was only a girl barely sixteen old enough to know what she was doing but ill call her a girl if you like she promised me solemnly to be my wife making the one stipulation of secrecy and a certain period of waiting she wrote me letters repeating this promise and confidential enough to prove that she considered herself bound to me by such an implied relation i dont give in to humbugi dont set myself up as a saintand in most ways i can look after my own interests pretty keenly you know enough of her position as a penniless girl and at that time with no influential connections to take the place of wealth and help me on in the world it was as sincere and unworldly a passion as ever man felt she must say so herself i might have married two or three girls with plenty of money one of them was handsome enough and not at all reluctant molly interrupted him she was chafed at the conceit of his manner i beg your pardon but i do not want to hear accounts of young ladies whom you might have married i come here simply on behalf of cynthia who does not like you and who does not wish to marry you well then i must make her like me as you call it she did like me once and made promises which she will find it requires the consent of two people to break i dont despair of making her love me as much as ever she did according to her letters at least when we are married she will never marry you said molly firmly then if she ever honours any one else with her preference he shall be allowed the perusal of her letters to me molly almost could have laughed she was so secure and certain that roger would never read letters offered to him under these circumstances but then she thought that he would feel such pain at the whole affair and at the contact with mr preston especially if he had not heard of it from cynthia first and if she molly could save him pain she would before she could settle what to say mr preston spoke again you said the other day that cynthia was engaged may i ask whom to no said molly you may not you heard her say it was not an engagement it is not exactly and if it were a full engagement do you think after what you last said i should tell you to whom but you may be sure of this he would never read a line of your letters he is too no i wont speak of him before you you could never understand him it seems to me that this mysterious he is a very fortunate person to have such a warm defender in miss gibson to whom he is not at all engaged said mr preston with so disagreeable a look on his face that molly suddenly found herself on the point of bursting into tears but she rallied herself and worked onfor cynthia first and for roger as well no honourable man or woman will read your letters and if any people do read them they will be so much ashamed of it that they wont dare to speak of them what use can they be of to you they contain cynthias reiterated promises of marriage replied he she says she would rather leave hollingford for ever and go out to earn her bread than marry you his face fell a little he looked so bitterly mortified that molly was almost sorry for him does she say that to you in cold blood do you know you are telling me very hard truths miss gibson if they are truths that is to say he continued recovering himself a little young ladies are very fond of the words hate and detest ive known many who have applied them to men whom they were all the time hoping to marry i cannot tell about other people said molly i only know that cynthia does here she hesitated for a moment she felt for his pain and so she hesitated but then she brought it outdoes as nearly hate you as anybody like her ever does hate like her said he repeating the words almost unconsciously seizing on anything to try and hide his mortification i mean i should hate worse said molly in a low voice but he did not attend much to her answer he was working the point of his stick into the turf and his eyes were bent on it so now would you mind sending her back the letters by me i do assure you that you cannot make her marry you you are very simple miss gibson said he suddenly lifting up his head i suppose you dont know that there is any other feeling that can be gratified except love have you never heard of revenge cynthia has cajoled me with promises and little as you or she may believe mewell its no use speaking of that i dont mean to let her go unpunished you may tell her that i shall keep the letters and make use of them as i see fit when the occasion arises molly was miserably angry with herself for her mismanagement of the affair she had hoped to succeed she had only made matters worse what new argument could she use meanwhile he went on lashing himself up as he thought how the two girls must have talked him over bringing in wounded vanity to add to the rage of disappointed love mr osborne hamley may hear of their contents though he may be too honourable to read them nay even your father may hear whispers and if i remember them rightly miss cynthia kirkpatrick does not always speak in the most respectful terms of the lady who is now mrs gibson there are stop said molly i wont hear anything out of these letters written when she was almost without friends to you whom she looked upon as a friend but i have thought of what i will do next i give you fair warning if i had not been foolish i should have told my father but cynthia made me promise that i would not so i will tell it all from beginning to end to lady harriet and ask her to speak to her father i feel sure that she will do it and i dont think you will dare to refuse lord cumnor he felt at once that he should not dare that clever landagent as he was and high up in the earls favour on that account yet that the conduct of which he had been guilty in regard to the letters and the threats which he had held out respecting them were just what no gentleman no honourable man no manly man could put up with in any one about him he knew that much and he wondered how she the girl standing before him had been clever enough to find it out he forgot himself for an instant in admiration of her there she stood frightened yet brave not letting go her hold on what she meant to do even when things seemed most against her and besides there was something that struck him most of all perhaps and which shows the kind of man he washe perceived that molly was as unconscious that he was a young man and she a young woman as if she had been a pure angel of heaven though he felt that he would have to yield and give up the letters he was not going to do it at once and while he was thinking what to say so as still to evade making any concession till he had had time to think over it he with his quick senses all about him heard the trotting of a horse cranching quickly along over the gravel of the drive a moment afterwards mollys perception overtook his he could see the startled look overspread her face and in an instant she would have run away but before the first rush was made mr preston laid his hand firmly on her arm keep quiet you must be seen you at any rate have done nothing to be ashamed of as he spoke mr sheepshanks came round the bend of the road and was close upon them mr preston saw if molly did not the sudden look of intelligence that dawned upon the shrewd ruddy face of the old gentlemansaw but did not much heed he went forwards and spoke to mr sheepshanks who made a halt right before them miss gibson your servant rather a blustering day for a young lady to be outand cold i should say for standing still too long eh preston poking his whip at the latter in a knowing manner yes said mr preston and im afraid i have kept miss gibson too long standing molly did not know what to say or do so she only bowed a silent farewell and turned away to go home feeling very heavy at heart at the nonsuccess of her undertaking for she did not know how she had conquered in fact although mr preston might not as yet acknowledge it even to himself before she was out of hearing she heard mr sheepshanks say sorry to have disturbed your ttette preston but though she heard the words their implied sense did not sink into her mind she was only feeling how she had gone out glorious and confident and was coming back to cynthia defeated cynthia was on the watch for her return and rushing downstairs dragged molly into the diningroom well molly oh i see you havent got them after all i never expected it she sate down as if she could get over her disappointment better in that position and molly stood like a guilty person before her i am so sorry i did all i could we were interrupted at lastmr sheepshanks rode up provoking old man do you think you should have persuaded him to give up the letters if you had had more time i dont know i wish mr sheepshanks hadnt come up just then i didnt like his finding me standing talking to mr preston oh i daresay hed never think anything about it what did hemr prestonsay he seemed to think you were fully engaged to him and that these letters were the only proof he had i think he loves you in his way his way indeed said cynthia scornfully the more i think of it the more i see it would be better for papa to speak to him i did say i would tell it all to lady harriet and get lord cumnor to make him give up the letters but it would be very awkward very said cynthia gloomily but he would see it was only a threat but i will do it in a moment if you like i meant what i said only i feel that papa would manage it best of all and more privately ill tell you what mollyyoure bound by a promise you know and cannot tell mr gibson without breaking your solemn wordbut its just this ill leave hollingford and never come back again if ever your father hears of this affair there cynthia stood up now and began to fold up mollys shawl in her nervous excitement oh cynthiaroger was all that molly said yes i know you need not remind me of him but im not going to live in the house with any one who may be always casting up in his mind the things he had heard against methingsfaults perhapswhich sound so much worse than they really are i was so happy when i first came here you all liked me and admired me and thought well of me and now why molly i can see the difference in you already you carry your thoughts in your facei have read them there these two daysyouve been thinking how cynthia must have deceived me keeping up a correspondence all this timehaving halfengagements to two men youve been more full of that than of pity for me as a girl who has always been obliged to manage for herself without any friend to help her and protect her molly was silent there was a great deal of truth in what cynthia was saying and yet a great deal of falsehood for through all this long fortyeight hours molly had loved cynthia dearly and had been more weighed down by the position the latter was in than cynthia herself she also knewbut this was a second thought following on the otherthat she had suffered much pain in trying to do her best in this interview with mr preston she had been tried beyond her strength and the great tears welled up into her eyes and fell slowly down her cheeks oh what a brute i am said cynthia kissing them away i seei know it is the truth and i deserve itbut i need not reproach you you did not reproach me said molly trying to smile i have thought something of what you saidbut i do love you dearlydearly cynthiai should have done just the same as you did no you would not your grain is different somehow chapter xlv confidences all the rest of that day molly was depressed and not well having anything to conceal was so unusualalmost so unprecedented a circumstance with her that it preyed upon her in every way it was a nightmare that she could not shake off she did so wish to forget it all and yet every little occurrence seemed to remind her of it the next mornings post brought several letters one from roger for cynthia and molly letterless herself looked at cynthia as she read it with wistful sadness it appeared to molly as though cynthia should have no satisfaction in these letters until she had told him what was her exact position with mr preston yet cynthia was colouring and dimpling up as she always did at any pretty words of praise or admiration or love but mollys thoughts and cynthias reading were both interrupted by a little triumphant sound from mrs gibson as she pushed a letter she had just received to her husband with a there i must say i expected that then turning to cynthia she explainedit is a letter from uncle kirkpatrick love so kind wishing you to go and stay with them and help them to cheer up helen poor helen i am afraid she is very far from well but we could not have had her here without disturbing dear papa in his consultingroom and though i could have relinquished my dressingroomhewell so i said in my letter how you were grievedyou above all of us because you are such a friend of helens you knowand how you longed to be of useas i am sure you doand so now they want you to go up directly for helen has quite set her heart upon it cynthias eyes sparkled i shall like going said sheall but leaving you molly she added in a lower tone as if suddenly smitten with some compunction can you be ready to go by the bangup tonight said mr gibson for curiously enough after more than twenty years of quiet practice at hollingford i am summoned up today for the first time to a consultation in london tomorrow im afraid lady cumnor is worse my dear you dont say so poor dear lady what a shock it is to me im so glad ive had some breakfast i could not have eaten anything nay i only say she is worse with her complaint being worse may be only a preliminary to being better dont take my words for more than their literal meaning thank you how kind and reassuring dear papa always is about your gowns cynthia oh theyre all right mamma thank you i shall be quite ready by four oclock molly will you come with me and help me to pack i wanted to speak to you dear said she as soon as they had gone upstairs it is such a relief to get away from a place haunted by that man but im afraid you thought i was glad to leave you and indeed i am not there was a little flavour of protesting too much about this but molly did not perceive it she only said indeed i did not i know from my own feelings how you must dislike meeting a man in public in a different manner from what you have done in private i shall try not to see mr preston again for a long long time im sure but cynthia you havent told me one word out of rogers letter please how is he has he quite got over his attack of fever yes quite he writes in very good spirits a great deal about birds and beasts as usual habits of natives and things of that kind you may read from there indicating a place in the letter to there if you can and ill tell you what ill trust you with it molly while i pack and that shows my sense of your honournot but what you might read it all only youd find the lovemaking dull but make a little account of where he is and what he is doing date and that sort of thing and send it to his father molly took the letter down without a word and began to copy it at the writingtable often reading over what she was allowed to read often pausing her cheek on her hand her eyes on the letter and letting her imagination rove to the writer and all the scenes in which she had either seen him herself or in which her fancy had painted him she was startled from her meditations by cynthias sudden entrance into the drawingroom looking the picture of glowing delight no one here what a blessing ah miss molly you are more eloquent than you believe yourself look here holding up a large full envelope and then quickly replacing it in her pocket as if she was afraid of being seen whats the matter sweet one coming up and caressing molly is it worrying itself over that letter why dont you see these are my very own horrible letters that i am going to burn directly that mr preston has had the grace to send me thanks to you little mollycuishla ma chree pulse of my heartthe letters that have been hanging over my head like somebodys sword for these two years oh i am so glad said molly rousing up a little i never thought he would have sent them he is better than i believed him and now it is all over i am so glad you quite think he means to give up all claim over you by this dont you cynthia he may claim but i wont be claimed and he has no proofs now it is the most charming relief and i owe it all to you you precious little lady now theres only one thing more to be done and if you would but do it for me coaxing and caressing while she asked the question oh cynthia dont ask me i cannot do any more you dont know how sick i go when i think of yesterday and mr sheepshanks look it is only a very little thing i wont burden your conscience with telling you how i got my letters but it is not through a person i can trust with money and i must force him to take back his twentythree pounds odd shillings i have put it together at the rate of five per cent and its sealed up oh molly i should go off with such a light heart if you would only try to get it safely to him its the last thing there would be no immediate hurry you know you might meet him by chance in a shop in the street even at a partyand if you only had it with you in your pocket there would be nothing so easy molly was silent papa would give it to him there would be no harm in that i would tell him he must ask no questions as to what it was very well said cynthia have it your own way i think my way is the best for if any of this affair comes out but youve done a great deal for me already and i wont blame you now for declining to do any more i do so dislike having these underhand dealings with him pleaded molly underhand just simply giving him a letter from me if i left a note for miss browning should you dislike giving it to her you know thats very different i could do it openly and yet there might be writing in that and there wouldnt be a line with the money it would only be the windingupthe honourable honest windingup of an affair which has worried me for years but do as you like give it me said molly i will try theres a darling you can but try and if you cant give it to him in private without getting yourself into a scrape why keep it till i come back again he shall have it then whether he will or no molly looked forward to her two days alone with mrs gibson with very different anticipations from those with which she had welcomed the similar intercourse with her father in the first place there was no accompanying the travellers to the inn from which the coach started leavetaking in the marketplace was quite out of the bounds of mrs gibsons sense of propriety besides this it was a gloomy rainy evening and candles had to be brought in at an unusually early hour there would be no break for six hoursno music no reading but the two ladies would sit at their worsted work pattering away at smalltalk with not even the usual break of dinner for to suit the requirements of those who were leaving they had already dined early but mrs gibson really meant to make molly happy and tried to be an agreeable companion only molly was not well and was uneasy about many apprehended cares and troublesand at such hours of indisposition as she was then passing through apprehensions take the shape of certainties lying await in our paths molly would have given a good deal to have shaken off all these feelings unusual enough to her but the very house and furniture and rainblurred outer landscape seemed steeped with unpleasant associations most of them dating from the last few days you and i must go on the next journey i think my dear said mrs gibson almost chiming in with mollys wish that she could get away from hollingford into some new air and life for a week or two we have been stayathomes for a long time and variety of scene is so desirable for the young but i think the travellers will be wishing themselves at home by this nice bright fireside theres no place like home as the poet says mid pleasures and palaces although i may roam it begins and its both very pretty and very true its a great blessing to have such a dear little home as this is not it molly yes said molly rather drearily having something of the toujours perdrix feeling at the moment if she could but have gone away with her father just for two days how pleasant it would have been to be sure love it would be very nice for you and me to go a little journey all by ourselves you and i no one else if it were not such miserable weather we would have gone off on a little impromptu tour ive been longing for something of the kind for some weeks but we live such a restricted kind of life here i declare sometimes i get quite sick of the very sight of the chairs and tables that i know so well and one misses the others too it seems so flat and deserted without them yes we are very forlorn tonight but i think its partly owing to the weather nonsense dear i cant have you giving in to the silly fancy of being affected by weather poor dear mr kirkpatrick used to say a cheerful heart makes its own sunshine he would say it to me in his pretty way whenever i was a little lowfor i am a complete barometeryou may really judge of the state of the weather by my spirits i have always been such a sensitive creature it is well for cynthia that she does not inherit it i dont think her easily affected in any way do you molly thought for a minute or two and then repliedno she certainly is not easily affectednot deeply affected perhaps i should say many girls for instance would have been touched by the admiration she excitedi may say the attentions she received when she was at her uncles last summer at mr kirkpatricks yes there was mr henderson that young lawyer thats to say he is studying law but he has a good private fortune and is likely to have more so he can only be what i call playing at law mr henderson was over head and ears in love with her it is not my fancy although i grant mothers are partial both mr and mrs kirkpatrick noticed it and in one of mrs kirkpatricks letters she said that poor mr henderson was going into switzerland for the long vacation doubtless to try and forget cynthia but she really believed he would find it only dragging at each remove a lengthening chain i thought it such a refined quotation and altogether worded so prettily you must know aunt kirkpatrick some day molly my love she is what i call a woman of a truly elegant mind i cant help thinking it was a pity that cynthia did not tell them of her engagement it is not an engagement my dear how often must i tell you that but what am i to call it i dont see why you need to call it anything indeed i dont understand what you mean by it you should always try to express yourself intelligibly it really is one of the first principles of the english language in fact philosophers might ask what is language given us for at all if it is not that we may make our meaning understood but there is something between cynthia and roger they are more to each other than i am to osborne for instance what am i to call it you should not couple your name with that of any unmarried young man it is so difficult to teach you delicacy child perhaps one may say there is a peculiar relation between dear cynthia and roger but it is very difficult to characterize it i have no doubt that is the reason she shrinks from speaking about it for between ourselves molly i really sometimes think it will come to nothing he is so long away and privately speaking cynthia is not very very constant i once knew her very much taken beforethat little affair is quite gone by and she was very civil to mr henderson in her way i fancy she inherits it for when i was a girl i was beset by lovers and could never find in my heart to shake them off you have not heard dear papa say anything of the old squire or dear osborne have you it seems so long since we have heard or seen anything of osborne but he must be quite well i think or we should have heard of it i believe he is quite well some one said the other day that they had met him ridingit was mrs goodenough now i rememberand that he was looking stronger than he had done for years indeed i am truly glad to hear it i always was fond of osborne and do you know i never really took to roger i respected him and all that of course but to compare him with mr henderson mr henderson is so handsome and wellbred and gets all his gloves from houbigant it was true that they had not seen anything of osborne hamley for a long time but as it often happens just after they had been speaking about him he appeared it was on the day following mr gibsons departure that mrs gibson received one of the notes not so common now as formerly from the family in town asking her to go over to the towers and find a book or a manuscript or something or other that lady cumnor wanted with all an invalids impatience it was just the kind of employment she required for an amusement on a gloomy day and it put her into a good humour immediately there was a certain confidential importance about it and it was a variety and it gave her the pleasant drive in a fly up the noble avenue and the sense of being the temporary mistress of all the grand rooms once so familiar to her she asked molly to accompany her out of an access of kindness but was not at all sorry when molly excused herself and preferred stopping at home at eleven oclock mrs gibson was off all in her sunday best to use the servants expression which she herself would so have contemned welldressed in order to impose on the servants at the towers for there was no one else to see or to be seen by i shall not be at home until the afternoon my dear but i hope you will not find it dull i dont think you will for you are something like me my lovenever less alone than when alone as one of the great authors has justly expressed it molly enjoyed the house to herself fully as much as mrs gibson would enjoy having the towers to herself she ventured on having her lunch brought upon a tray into the drawingroom so that she might eat her sandwiches while she went on with her book in the middle mr osborne hamley was announced he came in looking wretchedly ill in spite of purblind mrs goodenoughs report of his healthy appearance this call is not on you molly said he after the first greetings were over i was in hopes i might have found your father at home i thought lunchtime was the best hour he had sate down as if thoroughly glad of the rest and fallen into a languid stooping position as if it had become so natural to him that no sense of what were considered good manners sufficed to restrain him now i hope you did not want to see him professionally said molly wondering if she was wise in alluding to his health yet urged to it by her real anxiety yes i did i suppose i may help myself to a biscuit and a glass of wine no dont ring for more i could not eat it if it was here but i just want a mouthful this is quite enough thank you when will your father be back he was summoned up to london lady cumnor is worse i fancy there is some operation going on but i dont know he will be back tomorrow night very well then i must wait perhaps i shall be better by that time i think its half fancy but i should like your father to tell me so he will laugh at me i daresay but i dont think i shall mind that he always is severe on fanciful patients isnt he molly molly thought that if he saw osbornes looks just then he would hardly think him fanciful or be inclined to be severe but she only saidpapa enjoys a joke at everything you know it is a relief after all the sorrow he sees very true there is a great deal of sorrow in the world i dont think its a very happy place after all so cynthia is gone to london he added after a pause i think i should like to have seen her again poor old roger he loves her very dearly molly he said molly hardly knew how to answer him in all this she was so struck by the change in both voice and manner mamma has gone to the towers she began at length lady cumnor wanted several things that mamma only can find she will be sorry to miss you we were speaking of you only yesterday and she said how long it was since we had seen you i think ive grown careless ive often felt so weary and ill that it was all i could do to keep up a brave face before my father why did you not come and see papa said molly or write to him i cannot tell i drifted on sometimes better and sometimes worse till today i mustered up pluck and came to hear what your father has got to tell me and all for no use it seems i am very sorry but it is only for two days he shall go and see you as soon as ever he returns he must not alarm my father remember molly said osborne lifting himself by the arms of his chair into an upright position and speaking eagerly for the moment i wish to god roger was at home said he falling back into the old posture i cant help understanding you said molly you think yourself very ill but isnt it that you are tired just now she was not sure if she ought to have understood what was passing in his mind but as she did she could not help speaking a true reply well sometimes i do think im very ill and then again i think its only the moping life sets me fancying and exaggerating he was silent for some time then as if he had taken a sudden resolution he spoke again you see there are others depending upon meupon my health you havent forgotten what you heard that day in the library at home no i know you havent i have seen the thought of it in your eyes often since then i didnt know you at that time i think i do now dont go on talking so fast said molly rest no one will interrupt us i will go on with my sewing when you want to say anything more i shall be listening for she was alarmed at the strange pallor that had come over his face thank you after a time he roused himself and began to speak very quietly as if on an indifferent matter of fact the name of my wife is aime aime hamley of course she lives at bishopsfield a village near winchester write it down but keep it to yourself she is a frenchwoman a roman catholic and was a servant she is a thoroughly good woman i must not say how dear she is to me i dare not i meant once to have told cynthia but she didnt seem quite to consider me as a brother perhaps she was shy of a new relation but youll give my love to her all the same it is a relief to think that some one else has my secret and you are like one of us molly i can trust you almost as i can trust roger i feel better already now i feel that some one else knows the whereabouts of my wife and child child said molly surprised but before he could reply maria had announced miss phoebe browning fold up that paper said he quickly putting something into her hands it is only for yourself chapter xlvi hollingford gossips illustration untitled my dear molly why didnt you come and dine with us i said to sister i would come and scold you well oh mr osborne hamley is that you and a look of mistaken intelligence at the ttette she had disturbed came so perceptibly over miss phoebes face that molly caught osbornes sympathetic eye and both smiled at the notion im sure iwell one must sometimesi see our dinner would have been then she recovered herself into a connected sentence we only just heard of mrs gibsons having a fly from the george because sister sent our nancy to pay for a couple of rabbits tom ostler had snared i hope we shant be taken up for poachers mr osbornesnaring doesnt require a licence i believe and she heard he was gone off with the fly to the towers with your dear mamma for coxe who drives the fly in general has sprained his ankle we had just finished dinner but when nancy said tom ostler would not be back till night i said why theres that poor dear girl left all alone by herself and her mother such a friend of ourswhen she was alive i mean but im sure im glad im mistaken osborne saidi came to speak to mr gibson not knowing he had gone to london and miss gibson kindly gave me some of her lunch i must go now oh dear i am so sorry fluttered out miss phoebe i disturbed you but it was with the best intentions i always was malpropos from a child but osborne was gone before she had finished her apologies as he left his eyes met mollys with a strange look of yearning farewell that struck her at the time and that she remembered strongly afterwards such a nice suitable thing and i came in the midst and spoilt it all i am sure youre very kind my dear considering considering what my dear miss phoebe if you are conjecturing a love affair between mr osborne hamley and me you never were more mistaken in your life i think i told you so once before please do believe me oh yes i remember and somehow sister got it into her head it was mr preston i recollect one guess is just as wrong as the other said molly smiling and trying to look perfectly indifferent but going extremely red at the mention of mr prestons name it was very difficult for her to keep up any conversation for her heart was full of osbornehis changed appearance his melancholy words of foreboding and his confidences about his wifefrench catholic servant molly could not help trying to piece these strange facts together by imaginations of her own and found it very hard work to attend to kind miss phoebes unceasing patter she came up to the point however when the voice ceased and could recall in a mechanical manner the echo of the last words which both from miss phoebes look and the dying accent that lingered in mollys ear she perceived to be a question miss phoebe was asking her if she would go out with her she was going to grinsteads the bookseller of hollingford who in addition to his regular business was the agent for the hollingford book society received their subscriptions kept their accounts ordered their books from london and on payment of a small salary allowed the society to keep their volumes on shelves in his shop it was the centre of news and the club as it were of the little town everybody who pretended to gentility in the place belonged to it it was a test of gentility indeed rather than of education or a love of literature no shopkeeper would have thought of offering himself as a member however great his general intelligence and love of reading while it boasted on its list of subscribers most of the county families in the neighbourhood some of whom subscribed to it as a sort of duty belonging to their station without often using their privilege of reading the books while there were residents in the little town such as mrs goodenough who privately thought reading a great waste of time that might be much better employed in sewing and knitting and pastrymaking but who nevertheless belonged to it as a mark of station just as these good motherly women would have thought it a terrible comedown in the world if they had not had a pretty young servantmaid to fetch them home from the teaparties at night at any rate grinsteads was a very convenient place for a lounge in that view of the book society every one agreed molly went upstairs to get ready to accompany miss phoebe and on opening one of her drawers she saw cynthias envelope containing the money she owed to mr preston carefully sealed up like a letter this was what molly had so unwillingly promised to deliverthe last final stroke to the affair molly took it up hating it for a time she had forgotten it and now it was here facing her and she must try and get rid of it she put it into her pocket for the chances of the walk and the day and fortune for once seemed to befriend her for on their entering grinsteads shop in which two or three people were now as always congregated making play of examining the books or business of writing down the titles of new works in the orderbook there was mr preston he bowed as they came in he could not help that but at the sight of molly he looked as illtempered and out of humour as a man well could do she was connected in his mind with defeat and mortification and besides the sight of her called up what he desired now above all things to forget namely the deep conviction received through mollys simple earnestness of cynthias dislike to him if miss phoebe had seen the scowl upon his handsome face she might have undeceived her sister in her suppositions about him and molly but miss phoebe who did not consider it quite maidenly to go and stand close to mr preston and survey the shelves of books in such close proximity to a gentleman found herself an errand at the other end of the shop and occupied herself in buying writingpaper molly fingered her valuable letter as it lay in her pocket did she dare to cross over to mr preston and give it to him or not while she was still undecided shrinking always just at the moment when she thought she had got her courage up for action miss phoebe having finished her purchase turned round and after looking a little pathetically at mr prestons back said to molly in a whisperi think well go to johnsons now and come back for the books in a little while so across the street to johnsons they went but no sooner had they entered the drapers shop than mollys conscience smote her for her cowardice and loss of a good opportunity ill be back directly said she as soon as miss phoebe was engaged with her purchases and molly ran across to grinsteads without looking either to the right or the left she had been watching the door and she knew that no mr preston had issued forth she ran in he was at the counter now talking to grinstead himself molly put the letter into his hand to his surprise and almost against his will and turned round to go back to miss phoebe at the door of the shop stood mrs goodenough arrested in the act of entering staring with her round eyes made still rounder and more owllike by spectacles to see molly gibson giving mr preston a letter which he conscious of being watched and favouring underhand practices habitually put quickly into his pocket unopened perhaps if he had had time for reflection he would not have scrupled to put molly to open shame by rejecting what she so eagerly forced upon him there was another long evening to be got through with mrs gibson but on this occasion there was the pleasant occupation of dinner which took up at least an hour for it was one of mrs gibsons fanciesone which molly chafed againstto have every ceremonial gone through in the same stately manner for two as for twenty so although molly knew full well and her stepmother knew full well and maria knew full well that neither mrs gibson nor molly touched dessert it was set on the table with as much form as if cynthia had been at home who delighted in almonds and raisins or mr gibson been there who never could resist dates though he always protested against persons in their station of life having a formal dessert set out before them every day and mrs gibson herself apologized as it were to molly today in the same words she had often used to mr gibsonits no extravagance for we need not eat iti never do but it looks well and makes maria understand what is required in the daily life of every family of position all through the evening mollys thoughts wandered far and wide though she managed to keep up a show of attention to what mrs gibson was saying she was thinking of osborne and his abrupt halffinished confidence and his illlooks she was wondering when roger would come home and longing for his return as much she said to herself for osbornes sake as for her own and then she checked herself what had she to do with roger why should she long for his return it was cynthia who was doing this only somehow he was such a true friend to molly that she could not help thinking of him as a staff and a stay in the troublous times which appeared to lie not far aheadthis evening then mr preston and her little adventure with him came uppermost how angry he looked how could cynthia have liked him even enough to get into this abominable scrape which was however all over now and so she ran on in her fancies and imaginations little dreaming that that very night much talk was going on not halfamile from where she sate sewing that would prove that the scrape as she called it in her girlish phraseology was not all over scandal sleeps in the summer comparatively speaking its nature is the reverse of that of the dormouse warm ambient air loiterings abroad gardenings flowers to talk about and preserves to make soothed the wicked imp to slumber in the parish of hollingford in summertime but when evenings grew short and people gathered round the fires and put their feet in a circlenot on the fenders that was not allowedthen was the time for confidential conversation or in the pauses allowed for the teatrays to circulate among the cardtableswhen those who were peaceably inclined tried to stop the warm discussions about the odd trick and the rather wearisome feminine way of shouldering the crutch and showing how fields were wonsmall crumbs and scraps of daily news came up to the surface such as martindale has raised the price of his best joints a halfpenny in the pound or its a shame of sir harry to order in another book on farriery into the book society phoebe and i tried to read it but really there is no general interest in it or i wonder what mr ashton will do now nancy is going to be married why shes been with him these seventeen years its a very foolish thing for a woman of her age to be thinking of matrimony and so i told her when i met her in the marketplace this morning so said miss browning on the night in question her hand of cards lying by her on the puce baizecovered table while she munched the rich poundcake of a certain mrs dawes lately come to inhabit hollingford matrimonys not so bad as you think for miss browning said mrs goodenough standing up for the holy estate into which she had twice entered if id ha seen nancy i should ha given her my mind very different its a great thing to be able to settle what youll have for dinner without never a one interfering with you if thats all said miss browning drawing herself up i can do that and perhaps better than a woman who has a husband to please no one can say as i didnt please my husbandsboth on em though jeremy was tickler in his tastes than poor harry beaver but as i used to say to em leave the victual to me its better for you than knowing whats to come beforehand the stomach likes to be taken by surprise and neither of em ever repented em of their confidence you may take my word for it beans and bacon will taste better and mr ashtons nancy in her own house than all the sweetbreads and spring chickens shes been adoing for him this seventeen years but if i chose i could tell you of something as would interest you all a deal more than old nancys marriage to a widower with nine childrenonly as the young folks themselves is meeting in private clandestinelike its perhaps not for me to tell their secrets im sure i dont want to hear of clandestine meetings between young men and young women said miss browning throwing up her head its disgrace enough to the people themselves i consider if they enter on a love affair without the proper sanction of parents i know public opinion has changed on the subject but when poor gratia was married to mr byerley he wrote to my father without ever having so much as paid her a compliment or said more than the most trivial and commonplace things to her and my father and mother sent for her into my fathers study and she said she was never so much frightened in her lifeand they said it was a very good offer and mr byerley was a very worthy man and they hoped she would behave properly to him when he came to supper that night and after that he was allowed to come twice a week till they were married my mother and i sate at our work in the bowwindow of the rectory drawingroom and gratia and mr byerley at the other end and my mother always called my attention to some flower or plant in the garden when it struck nine for that was his time for going without offence to the present company i am rather inclined to look upon matrimony as a weakness to which some very worthy people are prone but if they must be married let them make the best of it and go through the affair with dignity and propriety or if there are misdoings and clandestine meetings and such things at any rate never let me hear about them i think its you to play mrs dawes youll excuse my frankness on the subject of matrimony mrs goodenough there can tell you im a very outspoken person its not the outspeaking its what you say that goes against me miss browning said mrs goodenough affronted yet ready to play her card as soon as needed and as for mrs dawes she was too anxious to get into the genteelest of all hollingford society to object to whatever miss browning who in right of being a deceased rectors daughter rather represented the selectest circle of the little town advocated whether celibacy marriage bigamy or polygamy so the remainder of the evening passed over without any further reference to the secret mrs goodenough was burning to disclose unless a remark made propos de rien by miss browning during the silence of a deal could be supposed to have connection with the previous conversation she said suddenly and abruptly i dont know what i have done that any man should make me his slave if she was referring to any prospect of matrimonial danger she saw opening before her fancy she might have been comforted but it was a remark of which no one took any notice all being far too much engaged in the rubber only when miss browning took her early leave for miss phoebe had a cold and was an invalid at home mrs goodenough burst out with well now i may speak out my mind and say as how if there was a slave between us two when goodenough was alive it wasnt me and i dont think as it was pretty in miss browning to give herself such airs on her virginity when there was four widows in the roomwhove had six honest men among em for husbands no offence miss airy addressing an unfortunate little spinster who found herself the sole representative of celibacy now that miss browning was gone i could tell her of a girl as shes very fond on whos on the high road to matrimony and in as cunning a way as ever i heerd on going out at dusk to meet her sweetheart just as if she was my sally or your jenny and her name is molly toowhich as i have often thought shows a low taste in them as first called her soshe might as well be a scullerymaid at oncest not that shes picked up anybody common shes looked about her for a handsome fellow and a smart young man enough every one around the table looked curious and intent on the disclosures being made except the hostess mrs dawes who smiled intelligence with her eyes and knowingly pursed up her mouth until mrs goodenough had finished her tale then she said demurely i suppose you mean mr preston and miss gibson why who told you said mrs goodenough turning round upon her in surprise you cant say as i did theres many a molly in hollingford besides herthough none perhaps in such a genteel station in life i never named her im sure no but i know i could tell my tale too continued mrs dawes no could you really said mrs goodenough very curious and a little jealous yes my uncle sheepshanks came upon them in the park avenuehe startled em a good deal he said and when he taxed mr preston with being with his sweetheart he didnt deny it well now so much has come out ill tell you what i know only ladies i wouldnt wish to do the girl an unkind turnso you must keep what ive got to tell you a secret of course they promised that was easy my hannah as married tom oakes and lives in pearsons lane was agathering of damsons only a week ago and molly gibson was awalking fast down the lanequite in a hurry like to meet some oneand hannahs little annamaria fell down and molly whos a kindhearted lass enough picked her up so if hannah had had her doubts before she had none then but there was no one with her was there asked one of the ladies anxiously as mrs goodenough stopped to finish her piece of cake just at this crisis no i said she looked as if she was going to meet some oneand byandby comes mr preston running out of the wood just beyond hannahs and says he a cup of water please good woman for a lady has fainted or is sterical or something now though he didnt know hannah hannah knew him more folks know tom fool than tom fool knows asking mr prestons pardon for hes no fool whatever he be and i could tell you moreand what ive seed with my own eyes i seed her give him a letter in grinsteads shop only yesterday and he looked as black as thunder at her for he seed me if she didnt its a very suitable kind of thing said miss airy why do they make such a mystery of it some folks like it said mrs dawes it adds zest to it all to do their courting underhand ay its like salt to their victual put in mrs goodenough but i didnt think molly gibson was one of that sort i didnt the gibsons hold themselves very high cried mrs dawes more as an inquiry than an assertion mrs gibson has called upon me ay youre like to be a patient of the doctors put in mrs goodenough she seemed to me very affable though she is so intimate with the countess and the family at the towers and is quite the lady herself dines late ive heard and everything in style style very different style to what bob gibson her husband was used to when first he came hereglad of a muttonchop in his surgery for i doubt if hed a fire anywhere else we called him bob gibson then but none on us dare bob him now id as soon think o calling him sweep i think it looks very bad for miss gibson said one lady rather anxious to bring back the conversation to the more interesting present time but as soon as mrs goodenough heard this natural comment on the disclosures she had made she fired round on the speaker not at all bad and ill trouble you not to use such a word as that about molly gibson as ive known all her life its odd if you will i was odd myself as a girl i never could abide a plate of gathered gooseberries but i must needs go and skulk behind a bush and gather em for myself its some folks taste though it maynt be miss brownings whod have all the courting done under the nose of the family all as ever i said was that i was surprised at it in molly gibson and that id ha thought it was liker that pretty piece of a cynthia as they call her indeed at one time i was ready to swear as it was her mr preston was after and now ladies ill wish you a very good night i cannot abide waste and ill venture for it sallys letting the candle in the lantern run all to grease instead of putting it out as ive told her to do if ever shes got to wait for me so with formal dipping curtseys the ladies separated but not without thanking mrs dawes for the pleasant evening they had had a piece of oldfashioned courtesy always gone through in those days chapter xlvii scandal and its victims when mr gibson returned to hollingford he found an accumulation of business waiting for him and he was much inclined to complain of the consequences of the two days comparative holiday which had resulted in overwork for the week to come he had hardly time to speak to his family he had so immediately to rush off to pressing cases of illness but molly managed to arrest him in the hall standing there with his great coat held out ready for him to put on but whispering as she did so papa mr osborne hamley was here to see you yesterday he looks very ill and hes evidently frightened about himself mr gibson faced about and looked at her for a moment but all he said was ill go and see him dont tell your mother where im gone youve not mentioned this to her i hope no said molly for she had only told mrs gibson of osbornes call not of the occasion for it dont say anything about it theres no need now i think of it i cant possibly go todaybut i will go something in her fathers manner disheartened molly who had persuaded herself that osbornes evident illness was partly nervous by which she meant imaginary she had dwelt upon his looks of enjoyment at miss phoebes perplexity and thought that no one really believing himself to be in danger could have given the merry glances which he had done but after seeing the seriousness of her fathers face she recurred to the shock she had experienced on first seeing osbornes changed appearance all this time mrs gibson was busy reading a letter from cynthia which mr gibson had brought from london for every opportunity of private conveyance was seized upon when postage was so high and cynthia had forgotten so many things in her hurried packing that she now sent a list of the clothes which she required molly almost wondered that it had not come to her but she did not understand the sort of reserve that was springing up in cynthias mind towards her cynthia herself struggled with the feeling and tried to fight against it by calling herself ungrateful but the truth was she believed that she no longer held her former high place in mollys estimation and she could not help turning away from one who knew things to her discredit she was fully aware of mollys prompt decision and willing action where action was especially disagreeable on her behalf she knew that molly would never bring up the past errors and difficulties but still the consciousness that the good straightforward girl had learnt that cynthia had been guilty of so much underhand work cooled her regard and restrained her willingness of intercourse reproach herself with ingratitude as she would she could not help feeling glad to be away from molly it was awkward to speak to her as if nothing had happened it was awkward to write to her about forgotten ribbons and laces when their last conversation had been on such different subjects and had called out such vehement expressions of feeling so mrs gibson held the list in her hand and read out the small fragments of news that were intermixed with notices of cynthias requirements helen cannot be so very ill said molly at length or cynthia would not want her pink muslin and daisy wreath i dont see that that follows im sure replied mrs gibson rather sharply helen would never be so selfish as to tie cynthia to her side however ill she was indeed i should not have felt that it was my duty to let cynthia go to london at all if i had thought she was to be perpetually exposed to the depressing atmosphere of a sickroom besides it must be so good for helen to have cynthia coming in with bright pleasant accounts of the parties she has been toeven if cynthia disliked gaiety i should desire her to sacrifice herself and go out as much as she could for helens sake my idea of nursing is that one should not be always thinking of ones own feelings and wishes but doing those things which will most serve to beguile the weary hours of an invalid but then so few people have had to consider the subject so deeply as i have done mrs gibson here thought fit to sigh before going on with cynthias letter as far as molly could make any sense out of this rather incoherent epistle very incoherently read aloud to her cynthia was really pleased and glad to be of use and comfort to helen but at the same time very ready to be easily persuaded into the perpetual small gaieties which abounded in her uncles house in london even at this dead season of the year mrs gibson came upon mr hendersons name once and then went on with a running umumum to herself which sounded very mysterious but which might as well have been omitted as all that cynthia really said about him was mr hendersons mother has advised my aunt to consult a certain dr donaldson who is said to be very clever in such cases as helens but my uncle is not sufficiently sure of the professional etiquette c then there came a very affectionate carefully worded message to mollyimplying a good deal more than was said of loving gratitude for the trouble she had taken on cynthias behalf and that was all and molly went away a little depressed she knew not why the operation on lady cumnor had been successfully performed and in a few days they hoped to bring her down to the towers to recruit her strength in the fresh country air the case was one which interested mr gibson extremely and in which his opinion had been proved to be right in opposition to that of one or two great names in london the consequence was that he was frequently consulted and referred to during the progress of her recovery and as he had much to do in the immediate circle of his hollingford practice as well as to write thoughtful letters to his medical brethren in london he found it difficult to spare the three or four hours necessary to go over to hamley to see osborne he wrote to him however begging him to reply immediately and detail his symptoms and from the answer he received he did not imagine that the case was immediately pressing osborne too deprecated his coming over to hamley for the express purpose of seeing him so the visit was deferred to that more convenient season which is so often too late all these days the buzzing gossip about mollys meetings with mr preston her clandestine correspondence the secret interviews in lonely places had been gathering strength and assuming the positive form of scandal the simple innocent girl who walked through the quiet streets without a thought of being the object of mysterious implications became for a time the unconscious black sheep of the town servants heard part of what was said in their mistresses drawingrooms and exaggerated the sayings amongst themselves with the coarse strengthening of expression common with uneducated people mr preston himself became aware that her name was being coupled with his though hardly to the extent to which the love of excitement and gossip had carried peoples speeches he chuckled over the mistake but took no pains to correct it it serves her right said he to himself for meddling with other folks business and he felt himself avenged for the discomfiture which her menace of appealing to lady harriet had caused him and the mortification he had experienced in learning from her plainspeaking lips how he had been talked over by cynthia and herself with personal dislike on the one side and evident contempt on the other besides if any denial of mr prestons stirred up an examination as to the real truth more might come out of his baffled endeavours to compel cynthia to keep to her engagement to him than he cared to have known he was angry with himself for still loving cynthia loving her in his own fashion be it understood he told himself that many a woman of more position and wealth would be glad enough to have him some of them pretty women too and he asked himself why he was such a confounded fool as to go on hankering after a penniless girl who was as fickle as the wind the answer was silly enough logically but forcible in fact cynthia was cynthia and not venus herself could have been her substitute in this one thing mr preston was more really true than many worthy men who seeking to be married turn with careless facility from the unattainable to the attainable and keep their feelings and fancy tolerably loose till they find a woman who consents to be their wife but no one would ever be to mr preston what cynthia had been and was and yet he could have stabbed her in certain of his moods so molly who had come between him and the object of his desire was not likely to find favour in his sight or to obtain friendly actions from him there came a timenot very distant from the evening at mrs daweswhen molly felt that people looked askance at her mrs goodenough openly pulled her granddaughter away when the young girl stopped to speak to molly in the street and an engagement which the two had made for a long walk together was cut very short by a very trumpery excuse mrs goodenough explained her conduct in the following manner to some of her friends you see i dont think the worse of a girl for meeting her sweetheart here and there and everywhere till she gets talked about but then when she doesand molly gibsons name is in everybodys mouthi think its only fair to bessy who has trusted me with annabellanot to let her daughter be seen with a lass who has managed her matters so badly as to set folk talking about her my maxim is thisand its a very good working one you may depend ontwomen should mind what theyre about and never be talked of and if a womans talked of the less her friends have to do with her till the talk has died away the better so annabella is not to have anything to do with molly gibson this visit at any rate for a good while the miss brownings were kept in ignorance of the evil tongues that whispered hard words about molly miss browning was known to have a temper and by instinct every one who came in contact with her shrank from irritating that temper by uttering the slightest syllable against the smallest of those creatures over whom she spread the gis of her love she would and did reproach them herself she used to boast that she never spared them but no one else might touch them with the slightest slur of a passing word but miss phoebe inspired no such terror the great reason why she did not hear of the gossip against molly as early as any one was that although she was not the rose she lived near the rose besides she was of so tender a nature that even thickskinned mrs goodenough was unwilling to say what would give miss phoebe pain and it was the newcomer mrs dawes who in all ignorance alluded to the towns talk as to something of which miss phoebe must be aware then miss phoebe poured down her questions although she protested even with tears her total disbelief in all the answers she received it was a small act of heroism on her part to keep all that she then learnt a secret from her sister dorothy as she did for four or five days till miss browning attacked her one evening with the following speech phoebe either youve some reason for puffing yourself out with sighs or youve not if you have a reason its your duty to tell it me directly and if you havent a reason you must break yourself of a bad habit that is growing upon you oh sister do you think it is really my duty to tell you it would be such a comfort but then i thought i ought not it will distress you so nonsense i am so well prepared for misfortune by the frequent contemplation of its possibility that i believe i can receive any ill news with apparent equanimity and real resignation besides when you said yesterday at breakfasttime that you meant to give up the day to making your drawers tidy i was aware that some misfortune was impending though of course i could not judge of its magnitude is the highchester bank broken oh no sister said miss phoebe moving to a seat close to her sisters on the sofa have you really been thinking that i wish i had told you what i heard at the very first if youve been fancying that take warning phoebe and learn to have no concealments from me i did think we must be ruined from your ways of going on eating no meat at dinner and sighing continually and now what is it i hardly know how to tell you dorothy i really dont miss phoebe began to cry miss browning took hold of her arm and gave her a little sharp shake cry as much as you like when youve told me but dont cry now child when youre keeping me on the tenterhooks molly gibson has lost her character sister thats it molly gibson has done no such thing said miss browning indignantly how dare you repeat such stories about poor marys child never let me hear you say such things again i cant help it mrs dawes told me and she says its all over the town i told her i did not believe a word of it and i kept it from you and i think i should have been really ill if id kept it to myself any longer oh sister what are you going to do for miss browning had risen without speaking a word and was leaving the room in a stately and determined fashion im going to put on my bonnet and things and then i shall call upon mrs dawes and confront her with her lies oh dont call them lies sister its such a strong ugly word please call them tallydiddles for i dont believe she meant any harm besidesbesidesif they should turn out to be truth really sister thats the weight on my mind so many things sounded as if they might be true what things said miss browning still standing with judicial erectness of position in the middle of the floor whyone story was that molly had given him a letter whos him how am i to understand a story told in that silly way miss browning sat down on the nearest chair and made up her mind to be patient if she could him is mr preston and that must be true because i missed her from my side when i wanted to ask her if she thought blue would look green by candlelight as the young man said it would and she had run across the street and mrs goodenough was just going into the shop just as she said she was miss brownings distress was overcoming her anger so she only said phoebe i think youll drive me mad do tell me what you heard from mrs dawes in a sensible and coherent manner for once in your life im sure im trying with all my might to tell you everything just as it happened what did you hear from mrs dawes why that molly and mr preston were keeping company just as if she was a maidservant and he was a gardener meeting at all sorts of improper times and places and fainting away in his arms and out at night together and writing to each other and slipping their letters into each others hands and that was what i was talking about sister for i next door to saw that done once i saw her with my own eyes run across the street to grinsteads where he was for we had just left him there with a letter in her hand too which was not there when she came back all fluttered and blushing but i never thought anything of it at the time but now all the town is talking about it and crying shame and saying they ought to be married miss phoebe sank into sobbing again but was suddenly roused by a good box on her ear miss browning was standing over her almost trembling with passion phoebe if ever i hear you say such things again ill turn you out of the house that minute i only said what mrs dawes said and you asked me what it was replied miss phoebe humbly and meekly dorothy you should not have done that never mind whether i should or i shouldnt thats not the matter in hand what ive got to decide is how to put a stop to all these lies but dorothy they are not all liesif you will call them so im afraid some things are true though i stuck to their being false when mrs dawes told me of them if i go to mrs dawes and she repeats them to me i shall slap her face or box her ears im afraid for i couldnt stand tales being told of poor marys daughter as if they were just a stirring piece of news like james horrocks pig with two heads said miss browning meditating aloud that would do harm instead of good phoebe im really sorry i boxed your ears only i should do it again if you said the same things phoebe sate down by her sister and took hold of one of her withered hands and began caressing it which was her way of accepting her sisters expression of regret if i speak to molly the child will deny it if shes half as goodfornothing as they say and if shes not shell only worry herself to death no that wont do mrs goodenoughbut shes a donkey and if i convinced her she could never convince any one else no mrs dawes who told you shall tell me and ill tie my hands together inside my muff and bind myself over to keep the peace and when ive heard what is to be heard ill put the matter into mr gibsons hands thats what ill do so its no use your saying anything against it phoebe for i shant attend to you miss browning went to mrs dawes and began civilly enough to make inquiries concerning the reports current in hollingford about molly and mr preston and mrs dawes fell into the snare and told all the real and fictitious circumstances of the story in circulation quite unaware of the storm that was gathering and ready to fall upon her as soon as she stopped speaking but she had not the long habit of reverence for miss browning which would have kept so many hollingford ladies from justifying themselves if she found fault mrs dawes stood up for herself and her own veracity bringing out fresh scandal which she said she did not believe but that many did and adducing so much evidence as to the truth of what she had said and did believe that miss browning was almost quelled and sate silent and miserable at the end of mrs dawes justification of herself well she said at length rising up from her chair as she spoke im very sorry ive lived till this day its a blow to me just as if i had heard of such goingson in my own flesh and blood i suppose i ought to apologize to you mrs dawes for what i said but ive no heart to do it today i ought not to have spoken as i did but thats nothing to this affair you see i hope you do me the justice to perceive that i only repeated what i had heard on good authority miss browning said mrs dawes in reply my dear dont repeat evil on any authority unless you can do some good by speaking about it said miss browning laying her hand on mrs dawes shoulder im not a good woman but i know what is good and that advice is and now i think i can tell you that i beg your pardon for flying out upon you so but god knows what pain you were putting me to youll forgive me wont you my dear mrs dawes felt the hand trembling on her shoulder and saw the real distress of miss brownings mind so it was not difficult for her to grant the requested forgiveness then miss browning went home and said but a few words to phoebe who indeed saw well enough that her sister had heard the reports confirmed and needed no further explanation of the cause of scarcelytasted dinner and short replies and saddened looks presently miss browning sate down and wrote a short note then she rang the bell and told the little maiden who answered it to take it to mr gibson and if he was out to see that it was given to him as soon as ever he came home and then she went and put on her sunday cap and miss phoebe knew that her sister had written to ask mr gibson to come and be told of the rumours affecting his daughter miss browning was sadly disturbed at the information she had received and the task that lay before her she was miserably uncomfortable to herself and irritable to miss phoebe and the nettingcotton she was using kept continually snapping and breaking from the jerks of her nervous hands when the knock at the door was heardthe wellknown doctors knockmiss browning took off her spectacles and dropped them on the carpet breaking them as she did so and then she bade miss phoebe leave the room as if her presence had cast the evileye and caused the misfortune she wanted to look natural and was distressed at forgetting whether she usually received him sitting or standing well said he coming in cheerfully and rubbing his cold hands as he went straight to the fire and what is the matter with us its phoebe i suppose i hope none of those old spasms but after all a dose or two will set that to rights oh mr gibson i wish it was phoebe or me either said miss browning trembling more and more he sate down by her patiently when he saw her agitation and took her hand in a kind friendly manner dont hurry yourselftake your time i daresay its not so bad as you fancy but well see about it theres a great deal of help in the world much as we abuse it mr gibson said she its your molly im so grieved about its out now and god help us both and the poor child too for im sure shes been led astray and not gone wrong by her own free will molly said he fighting against her words whats my little molly been doing or saying oh mr gibson i dont know how to tell you i never would have named it if i had not been convinced sorely sorely against my will at any rate you can let me hear what youve heard said he putting his elbow on the table and screening his eyes with his hand not that im a bit afraid of anything you can hear about my girl continued he only in this little nest of gossip its as well to know what people are talking about they sayoh how shall i tell you go on cant you said he removing his hand from his blazing eyes im not going to believe it so dont be afraid but i fear you must believe it i would not if i could help it shes been carrying on a clandestine correspondence with mr preston mr preston exclaimed he and meeting him at all sorts of unseemly places and hours out of doorsin the darkfainting away in hishis arms if i must speak out all the town is talking of it mr gibsons hand was over his eyes again and he made no sign so miss browning went on adding touch to touch mr sheepshanks saw them together they have exchanged notes in grinsteads shop she ran after him there be quiet cant you said mr gibson taking his hand away and showing his grim set face ive heard enough dont go on i said i shouldnt believe it and i dont i suppose i must thank you for telling me but i cant yet i dont want your thanks said miss browning almost crying i thought you ought to know for though youre married again i cant forget you were dear marys husband once upon a time and mollys her child id rather not speak any more about it just at present said he not at all replying to miss brownings last speech i may not control myself as i ought i only wish i could meet preston and horsewhip him within an inch of his life i wish id the doctoring of these slanderous gossips id make their tongues lie still for a while my little girl what harm has she done them all that they should go and foul her fair name indeed mr gibson im afraid its all true i would not have sent for you if i hadnt examined into it do ascertain the truth before you do anything violent such as horsewhipping or poisoning with all the inconsquence of a man in a passion mr gibson laughed out what have i said about horsewhipping or poisoning do you think id have mollys name dragged about the streets in connection with any act of violence on my part let the report die away as it arose time will prove its falsehood but i dont think it will and thats the pity of it said miss browning you must do something but i dont know what i shall go home and ask molly herself whats the meaning of it all thats all i shall do its too ridiculousknowing molly as i do its perfectly ridiculous he got up and walked about the room with hasty steps laughing short unnatural laughs from time to time really what will they say next satan finds some mischief still for idle tongues to do dont talk of satan please in this house no one knows what may happen if hes lightly spoken about pleaded miss browning he went on without noticing her talking to himselfive a great mind to leave the placeand what food for scandal that piece of folly would give rise to then he was silent for a time his hands in his pockets his eyes on the ground as he continued his quarterdeck march suddenly he stopped close to miss brownings chair im thoroughly ungrateful to you for as true a mark of friendship as youve ever shown to me true or false it was right i should know the wretched scandal that was being circulated and it couldnt have been pleasant for you to tell it me thank you from the bottom of my heart indeed mr gibson if it was false i would never have named it but let it die away its not true though said he doggedly letting drop the hand he had taken in his effusion of gratitude she shook her head i shall always love molly for her mothers sake she said and it was a great concession from the correct miss browning but her father did not understand it as such you ought to love her for her own she has done nothing to disgrace herself i shall go straight home and probe into the truth as if the poor girl who has been led away into deceit already would scruple much at going on in falsehood was miss brownings remark on this last speech of mr gibsons but she had discretion enough not to make it until he was well out of hearing chapter xlviii an innocent culprit with his head bent downas if he were facing some keenblowing windand yet there was not a breath of air stirringmr gibson went swiftly to his own home he rang at the doorbell an unusual proceeding on his part maria opened the door go and tell miss molly shes wanted in the diningroom dont say who it is that wants her there was something in mr gibsons manner that made maria obey him to the letter in spite of mollys surprised question wants me who is it maria mr gibson went into the diningroom and shut the door for an instants solitude he went up to the chimneypiece took hold of it and laid his head on his hands and tried to still the beating of his heart the door opened he knew that molly stood there before he heard her tone of astonishment papa hush said he turning round sharply shut the door come here she came to him wondering what was amiss her thoughts went to the hamleys immediately is it osborne she asked breathless if mr gibson had not been too much agitated to judge calmly he might have deduced comfort from these three words but instead of allowing himself to seek for comfort from collateral evidence he saidmolly what is this i hear that you have been keeping up a clandestine intercourse with mr prestonmeeting him in outoftheway places exchanging letters with him in a stealthy way though he had professed to disbelieve all this and did disbelieve it at the bottom of his soul his voice was hard and stern his face was white and grim and his eyes fixed mollys with the terrible keenness of their research molly trembled all over but she did not attempt to evade his penetration if she was silent for a moment it was because she was rapidly reviewing her relation with regard to cynthia in the matter it was but a moments pause of silence but it seemed long minutes to one who was craving for a burst of indignant denial he had taken hold of her two arms just above her wrists as she had advanced towards him he was unconscious of this action but as his impatience for her words grew upon him he grasped her more and more tightly in his vicelike hands till she made a little involuntary sound of pain and then he let go and she looked at her soft bruised flesh with tears gathering fast to her eyes to think that he her father should have hurt her so at the instant it appeared to her stranger that he should inflict bodily pain upon his child than that he should have heard the trutheven in an exaggerated form with a childish gesture she held out her arm to him but if she expected pity she received none pooh said he as he just glanced at the mark that is nothingnothing answer my question have youhave you met that man in private yes papa i have but i dont think it was wrong he sate down now wrong he echoed bitterly not wrong well i must bear it somehow your mother is dead thats one comfort it is true then is it why i didnt believe itnot i i laughed in my sleeve at their credulity and i was the dupe all the time papa i cannot tell you all it is not my secret or you should know it directly indeed you will be sorry some timei have never deceived you yet have i trying to take one of his hands but he kept them tightly in his pockets his eyes fixed on the pattern of the carpet before him papa said she pleading again have i ever deceived you how can i tell i hear of this from the towns talk i dont know what next may come out the towns talk said molly in dismay what business is it of theirs every one makes it their business to cast dirt on a girls name who has disregarded the commonest rules of modesty and propriety papa you are very hard modesty disregarded i will tell you exactly what i have done i met mr preston oncethat evening when you put me down to walk over croston heathand there was another person with him i met him a second timeand that time by appointmentnobody but our two selvesin the towers park that is all papa you must trust me i cannot explain more you must trust me indeed he could not help relenting at her words there was such truth in the tone in which they were spoken but he neither spoke nor stirred for a minute or two then he raised his eyes to hers for the first time since she had acknowledged the external truth of what he charged her with her face was very white but it bore the impress of the final sincerity of death when the true expression prevails without the poor disguises of time the letters he saidbut almost as if he were ashamed to question that countenance any further i gave him one letterof which i did not write a wordwhich in fact i believe to have been merely an envelope without any writing whatever inside the giving that letterthe two interviews i have namedmake all the private intercourse i have had with mr preston oh papa what have they been saying that has grievedshocked you so much never mind as the world goes what you say you have done molly is ground enough you must tell me all i must be able to refute these rumours point by point how are they to be refuted when you say that the truth which i have acknowledged is ground enough for what people are saying you say you were not acting for yourself but for another if you tell me who the other wasif you tell me everything out fully i will do my utmost to screen herfor of course i guess it was cynthiawhile i am exonerating you no papa said molly after some little consideration i have told you all i can tell all that concerns myself and i have promised not to say one word more then your character will be impugned it must be unless the fullest explanation of these secret meetings is given ive a great mind to force the whole truth out of preston himself papa once again i beg you to trust me if you ask mr preston you will very likely hear the whole truth but that is just what i have been trying so hard to conceal for it will only make several people very unhappy if it is known and the whole affair is over and done with now not your share in it miss browning sent for me this evening to tell me how people were talking about you she implied that it was a complete loss of your good name you dont know molly how slight a thing may blacken a girls reputation for life id hard work to stand all she said even though i didnt believe a word of it at the time and now youve told me that much of it is true but i think you are a brave man papa and you believe me dont you we shall outlive these rumours never fear you dont know the power of illnatured tongues child said he oh now youve called me child again i dont care for anything dear dear papa im sure it is best and wisest to take no notice of these speeches after all they may not mean them illnaturedly i am sure miss browning would not byandby theyll quite forget how much they made out of so littleand even if they dont you would not have me break my solemn word would you perhaps not but i cannot easily forgive the person who by practising on your generosity led you into this scrape you are very young and look upon these things as merely temporary evils i have more experience still i dont see what i can do now papa perhaps ive been foolish but what i did i did of my own self it was not suggested to me and im sure it was not wrong in morals whatever it might be in judgment as i said its all over now what i did ended the affair i am thankful to say and it was with that object i did it if people choose to talk about me i must submit and so must you dear papa does your motherdoes mrs gibsonknow anything about it asked he with sudden anxiety no not a bit not a word pray dont name it to her that might lead to more mischief than anything else i have really told you everything i am at liberty to tell it was a great relief to mr gibson to find that his sudden fear that his wife might have been privy to it all was illfounded he had been seized by a sudden dread that she whom he had chosen to marry in order to have a protectress and guide for his daughter had been cognizant of this illadvised adventure with mr preston nay more that she might even have instigated it to save her own child for that cynthia was somehow or other at the bottom of it all he had no doubt whatever but now at any rate mrs gibson had not been playing a treacherous part that was all the comfort he could extract out of mollys mysterious admission that much mischief might result from mrs gibsons knowing anything about these meetings with mr preston then what is to be done said he these reports are abroadam i to do nothing to contradict them am i to go about smiling and content with all this talk about you passing from one idle gossip to another im afraid so im very sorry for i never meant you to have known anything about it and i can see now how it must distress you but surely when nothing more happens and nothing comes of what has happened the wonder and the gossip must die away i know you believe every word i have said and that you trust me papa please for my sake be patient with all this gossip and cackle it will try me hard molly said he for my sake papa i dont see what else i can do replied he moodily unless i get hold of preston that would be the worst of all that would make a talk and after all perhaps he was not so very much to blame yes he was but he behaved well to me as far as that goes said she suddenly recollecting his speech when mr sheepshanks came up in the towers parkdont stir you have done nothing to be ashamed of thats true a quarrel between men which drags a womans name into notice is to be avoided at any cost but sooner or later i must have it out with preston he shall find it not so pleasant to have placed my daughter in equivocal circumstances he didnt place me he didnt know i was coming didnt expect to meet me either time and would far rather not have taken the letter i gave him if he could have helped himself its all a mystery i hate to have you mixed up in mysteries i hate to be mixed up but what can i do i know of another mystery which im pledged not to speak about i cannot help myself well all i can say is never be the heroine of a mystery that you can avoid if you cant help being an accessory then i suppose i must yield to your wishes and let this scandal wear itself out without any notice from me what else can you do under the circumstances ay what else indeed how shall you bear it for an instant the quick hot tears sprang into her eyes to have everybodyall her world thinking evil of her did seem hard to the girl who had never thought or said an unkind thing of them but she smiled as she made answer its like toothdrawing it will be over some time it would be much worse if i really had been doing wrong cynthia shall beware he began but molly put her hand before his mouth papa cynthia must not be accused or suspected you will drive her out of your house if you do she is so proud and so unprotected except by you and rogerfor rogers sake you will never do or say anything to send cynthia away when he has trusted us all to take care of her and love her in his absence oh i think if she were really wicked and i did not love her at all i should feel bound to watch over her he loves her so dearly and she is really good at heart and i do love her dearly you must not vex or hurt cynthia paparemember she is dependent upon you i think the world would get on tolerably well if there were no women in it they plague the life out of one youve made me forget amongst youpoor old job houghton that i ought to have gone to see an hour ago molly put up her mouth to be kissed youre not angry with me now papa are you get out of my way kissing her all the same if im not angry with you i ought to be for youve caused a great deal of worry which wont be over yet awhile i can tell you for all mollys bravery at the time of this conversation it was she that suffered more than her father he kept out of the way of hearing gossip but she was perpetually thrown into the small society of the place mrs gibson herself had caught cold and moreover was not tempted by the quiet oldfashioned visiting which was going on just about this time provoked by the visit of two of mrs dawes pretty unrefined nieces who laughed and chattered and ate and would fain have flirted with mr ashton the vicar could he have been brought by any possibility to understand his share in the business mr preston did not accept the invitations to hollingford teadrinkings with the same eager gratitude as he had done a year before or else the shadow which hung over molly would have extended to him her copartner in the clandestine meetings which gave such umbrage to the feminine virtue of the town molly herself was invited because it would not do to pass any apparent slight on either mr or mrs gibson but there was a tacit and underhand protest against her being received on the old terms every one was civil to her but no one was cordial there was a very perceptible film of difference in their behaviour to her from what it was formerly nothing that had outlines and could be defined but molly for all her clear conscience and her brave heart felt acutely that she was only tolerated not welcomed she caught the buzzing whispers of the two miss oakess who when they first met the heroine of the prevailing scandal looked at her askance and criticised her pretensions to good looks with hardly an attempt at undertones molly tried to be thankful that her father was not in the mood for visiting she was even glad that her stepmother was too much of an invalid to come out when she felt thus slighted and as it were degraded from her place miss browning herself that true old friend spoke to her with chilling dignity and much reserve for she had never heard a word from mr gibson since the evening when she had put herself to so much pain to tell him of the disagreeable rumours affecting his daughter only miss phoebe would seek out molly with even more than her former tenderness and this tried mollys calmness more than all the slights put together the soft hand pressing hers under the tablethe continual appeals to her so as to bring her back into the conversation touched molly almost to shedding tears sometimes the poor girl wondered to herself whether this change in the behaviour of her acquaintances was not a mere fancy of hers whether if she had never had that conversation with her father in which she had borne herself so bravely at the time she should have discovered the difference in their treatment of her she never told her father how she felt these perpetual small slights she had chosen to bear the burden of her own free will nay more she had insisted on being allowed to do so and it was not for her to grieve him now by showing that she shrank from the consequences of her own act so she never even made an excuse for not going into the small gaieties or mingling with the society of hollingford only she suddenly let go the stretch of restraint she was living in when one evening her father told her that he was really anxious about mrs gibsons cough and should like molly to give up a party at mrs goodenoughs to which they were all three invited but to which molly alone was going mollys heart leaped up at the thought of stopping at home even though the next moment she had to blame herself for rejoicing at a reprieve that was purchased by anothers suffering however the remedies prescribed by her husband did mrs gibson good and she was particularly grateful and caressing to molly really dear said she stroking mollys head i think your hair is getting softer and losing that disagreeable crisp curly feeling then molly knew that her stepmother was in high goodhumour the smoothness or curliness of her hair was a sure test of the favour in which mrs gibson held her at the moment i am so sorry to be the cause of detaining you from this little party but dear papa is so overanxious about me i have always been a kind of pet with gentlemen and poor mr kirkpatrick never knew how to make enough of me but i think mr gibson is even more foolishly fond his last words were take care of yourself hyacinth and then he came back again to say if you dont attend to my directions i wont answer for the consequences i shook my forefinger at him and said dont be so anxious you silly man i hope we have done everything he told us to do said molly oh yes i feel so much better do you know late as it is i think you might go to mrs goodenoughs yet maria could take you and i should like to see you dressed when one has been wearing dull warm gowns for a week or two one gets quite a craving for bright colours and evening dress so go and get ready dear and then perhaps youll bring me back some news for really shut up as i have been with only papa and you for the last fortnight ive got quite moped and dismal and i cant bear to keep young people from the gaieties suitable to their age oh pray mamma i had so much rather not go very well very well only i think it is rather selfish of you when you see i am so willing to make the sacrifice for your sake but you say it is a sacrifice to you and i dont want to go very well did i not say you might stop at home only pray dont chop logic nothing is so fatiguing to a sick person then they were silent for some time mrs gibson broke the silence by saying in a languid voice cant you think of anything amusing to say molly molly pumped up from the depths of her mind a few little trivialities which she had nearly forgotten but she felt that they were anything but amusing and so mrs gibson seemed to feel them for presently she said i wish cynthia was at home and molly felt it as a reproach to her own dulness shall i write to her and ask her to come back well im not sure i wish i knew a great many things youve not heard anything of poor dear osborne hamley lately have you remembering her fathers charge not to speak of osbornes health molly made no reply nor was any needed for mrs gibson went on thinking aloud you see if mr henderson has been as attentive as he was in the springand the chances about rogeri shall be really grieved if anything happens to that young man uncouth as he is but it must be owned that africa is not merely an unhealthyit is a savageand even in some parts a cannibal country i often think of all ive read of it in geography books as i lie awake at night and if mr henderson is really becoming attached the future is hidden from us by infinite wisdom molly or else i should like to know it one would calculate ones behaviour at the present time so much better if one only knew what events were to come but i think on the whole we had better not alarm cynthia if we had only known in time we might have planned for her to have come down with lord cumnor and my lady are they coming is lady cumnor well enough to travel yes to be sure or else i should not have considered whether or no cynthia could have come down with them it would have sounded very wellmore than respectable and would have given her a position among that lawyer set in london then lady cumnor is better to be sure i should have thought papa would have mentioned it to you but to be sure he is always so scrupulously careful not to speak about his patients quite right tooquite right and delicate why he hardly ever tells me how they are going on yes the earl and the countess and lady harriet and lord and lady cuxhaven and lady agnes and ive ordered a new winter bonnet and a black satin cloak chapter xlix molly gibson finds a champion lady cumnor had so far recovered from the violence of her attack and from the consequent operation as to be able to be removed to the towers for change of air and accordingly she was brought thither by her whole family with all the pomp and state becoming an invalid peeress there was every probability that the family would make a longer residence at the towers than they had done for several years during which time they had been wanderers hither and thither in search of health somehow after all it was very pleasant and restful to come to the old ancestral home and every member of the family enjoyed it in his or her own way lord cumnor most especially his talent for gossip and his love of small details had scarcely fair play in the hurry of a london life and were much nipped in the bud during his continental sojournings as he neither spoke french fluently nor understood it easily when spoken besides he was a great proprietor and liked to know how his land was going on how his tenants were faring in the world he liked to hear of their births marriages and deaths and had something of a royal memory for faces in short if ever a peer was an old woman lord cumnor was that peer but he was a very goodnatured old woman and rode about on his stout old cob with his pockets full of halfpence for the children and little packets of snuff for the old people like an old woman too he enjoyed an afternoon cup of tea in his wifes sittingroom and over his gossips beverage he would repeat all that he had learnt in the day lady cumnor was exactly in that state of convalescence when such talk as her lords was extremely agreeable to her but she had contemned the habit of listening to gossip so severely all her life that she thought it due to consistency to listen first and enter a supercilious protest afterwards it had however come to be a family habit for all of them to gather together in lady cumnors room on their return from their daily walks or drives or rides and over the fire sipping their tea at her early meal to recount the morsels of local intelligence they had heard during the morning when they had said all that they had to say and not before they had always to listen to a short homily from her ladyship on the wellworn textsthe poorness of conversation about personsthe probable falsehood of all they had heard and the degradation of character implied by its repetition on one of these november evenings they were all assembled in lady cumnors room she was lyingall draped in white and covered up with an indian shawlon a sofa near the fire lady harriet sate on the rug close before the woodfire picking up fallen embers with a pair of dwarf tongs and piling them on the red and odorous heap in the centre of the hearth lady cuxhaven notable from girlhood was using the blind mans holiday to net fruitnets for the walls at cuxhaven park lady cumnors woman was trying to see to pour out tea by the light of one small waxcandle in the background for lady cumnor could not bear much light to her weakened eyes and the great leafless branches of the trees outside the house kept sweeping against the windows moved by the wind that was gathering it was always lady cumnors habit to snub those she loved best her husband was perpetually snubbed by her yet she missed him now that he was later than usual and professed not to want her tea but they all knew that it was only because he was not there to hand it to her and be found fault with for his invariable stupidity in forgetting that she liked to put sugar in before she took any cream at length he burst in i beg your pardon my ladyim later than i should have been i know why havent you had your tea yet he exclaimed bustling about to get the cup for his wife you know i never take cream before ive sweetened it said she with even more emphasis on the never than usual oh dear what a simpleton i am i think i might have remembered it by this time you see i met old sheepshanks and thats the reason of it of your handing me the cream before the sugar asked his wife it was one of her grim jokes no no ha ha youre better this evening i think my dear but as i was saying sheepshanks is such an eternal talker theres no getting away from him and i had no idea it was so late well i think the least you can do is to tell us something of mr sheepshanks conversation now you have torn yourself away from him conversation did i call it conversation i dont think i said much i listened he really has always a great deal to say more than preston for instance and by the way he was telling me something about prestonold sheepshanks thinks hell be married before longhe says theres a great deal of gossip going on about him and gibsons daughter theyve been caught meeting in the park and corresponding and all that kind of thing that is likely to end in a marriage i shall be very sorry said lady harriet i always liked that girl and i cant bear papas model landagent i daresay its not true said lady cumnor in a very audible aside to lady harriet papa picks up stories one day to contradict them the next ah but this did sound like truth sheepshanks said all the old ladies in the town had got hold of it and were making a great scandal out of it i dont think it does sound quite a nice story i wonder what clare could be doing to allow such goings on said lady cuxhaven i think it is much more likely that clares own daughterthat pretty pawky miss kirkpatrickis the real heroine of this story said lady harriet she always looks like a heroine of genteel comedy and those young ladies were capable of a good deal of innocent intriguing if i remember rightly now little molly gibson has a certain gaucherie about her which would disqualify her at once from any clandestine proceedings besides clandestine why the child is truth itself papa are you sure mr sheepshanks said it was miss gibson that was exciting hollingford scandal wasnt it miss kirkpatrick the notion of her and mr preston making a match of it doesnt sound so incongruous but if its my little friend molly ill go to church and forbid the banns really harriet i cant think what always makes you take such an interest in all these petty hollingford affairs mamma its only tit for tat they take the most lively interest in all our sayings and doings if i were going to be married they would want to know every possible particularwhen we first met what we first said to each other what i wore and whether he offered by letter or in person im sure those good miss brownings were wonderfully wellinformed as to marys methods of managing her nursery and educating her girls so its only a proper return of the compliment to want to know on our side how they are going on im quite of papas faction i like to hear all the local gossip especially when it is flavoured with a spice of scandal and impropriety as in this case said lady cumnor with the momentary bitterness of a convalescent invalid lady harriet coloured with annoyance but then she rallied her courage and said with more gravity than before i am really interested in this story about molly gibson i own i both like and respect her and i do not like to hear her name coupled with that of mr preston i cant help fancying papa has made some mistake no my dear im sure im repeating what i heard im sorry i said anything about it if it annoys you or my lady there sheepshanks did say miss gibson though and he went on to say it was a pity the girl had got herself so talked about for it was the way they had carried on that gave rise to all the chatter preston himself was a very fair match for her and nobody could have objected to it but ill try and find a more agreeable piece of news old margery at the lodge is dead and they dont know where to find some one to teach clearstarching at your school and robert hall made forty pounds last year by his apples so they drifted away from molly and her affairs only lady harriet kept turning what she had heard over in her own mind with interest and wonder i warned her against him the day of her fathers wedding and what a straightforward outspoken topic it was then i dont believe it its only one of old sheepshanks stories half invention and half deafness the next day lady harriet rode over to hollingford and for the settling of her curiosity she called on miss brownings and introduced the subject she would not have spoken about the rumour she had heard to any who were not warm friends of mollys if mr sheepshanks had chosen to allude to it when she had been riding with her father she would very soon have silenced him by one of the haughty looks she knew full well how to assume but she felt as if she must know the truth and accordingly she began thus abruptly to miss browning what is all this i hear about my little friend molly gibson and mr preston oh lady harriet have you heard of it we are so sorry sorry for what i think begging your ladyships pardon we had better not say any more till we know how much you know said miss browning nay replied lady harriet laughing a little i shant tell what i know till i am sure you know more then well make an exchange if you like im afraid its no laughing matter for poor molly said miss browning shaking her head people do say such things but i dont believe them indeed i dont burst in miss phoebe half crying no more will i then said lady harriet taking the good ladys hand its all very fine phoebe saying you dont believe them but i should like to know who it was that convinced me sadly against my will i am sure i only told you the facts as mrs goodenough told them me sister but im sure if you had seen poor patient molly as i have done sitting up in a corner of a room looking at the beauties of england and wales till she must have been sick of them and no one speaking to her and she as gentle and sweet as ever at the end of the evening though maybe a bit palefacts or no facts i wont believe anything against her so there sate miss phoebe in tearful defiance of facts and as i said before im quite of your opinion said lady harriet but how does your ladyship explain away her meetings with mr preston in all sorts of unlikely and openair places asked miss browningwho to do her justice would have been only too glad to join mollys partisans if she could have preserved her character for logical deduction at the same time i went so far as to send for her father and tell him all about it i thought at least he would have horsewhipped mr preston but he seems to have taken no notice of it then we may be quite sure he knows some way of explaining matters that we dont said lady harriet decisively after all there may be a hundred and fifty perfectly natural and justifiable explanations mr gibson knew of none when i thought it my duty to speak to him said miss browning why suppose that mr preston is engaged to miss kirkpatrick and molly is confidante and messenger i dont see that your ladyships supposition much alters the blame why if he is honourably engaged to cynthia kirkpatrick does he not visit her openly at her home in mr gibsons house why does molly lend herself to clandestine proceedings one cant account for everything said lady harriet a little impatiently for reason was going hard against her but i choose to have faith in molly gibson im sure shes not done anything very wrong ive a great mind to go and call on hermrs gibson is confined to her room with this horrid influenzaand take her with me on a round of calls through this little gossiping townon mrs goodenough or badenough who seems to have been propagating all these stories but ive not time today ive to meet papa at three and its three now only remember miss phoebe its you and i against the world in defence of a distressed damsel don quixote and sancho panza said she to herself as she ran lightly down miss brownings oldfashioned staircase now i dont think thats pretty of you phoebe said miss browning in some displeasure as soon as she was alone with her sister first you convince me against my will and make me very unhappy and i have to do unpleasant things all because youve made me believe that certain statements are true and then you turn round and cry and say you dont believe a word of it all making me out a regular ogre and backbiter no its of no use i shant listen to you so she left miss phoebe in tears and locked herself up in her own room lady harriet meanwhile was riding homewards by her fathers side apparently listening to all he chose to say but in reality turning over the probabilities and possibilities that might account for these strange interviews between molly and mr preston it was a case of parler de lne et lon en voit les oreilles at a turn in the road they saw mr preston a little way before them coming towards them on his good horse point device in his riding attire the earl in his threadbare coat and on his old brown cob called out cheerfully aha heres preston goodday to you i was just wanting to ask you about that slip of pastureland on the home farm john brickkill wants to plough it up and crop it its not two acres at the best while they were talking over this bit of land lady harriet came to her resolution as soon as her father had finished she saidmr preston perhaps you will allow me to ask you one or two questions to relieve my mind for i am in some little perplexity at present illustration lady harriet asks one or two questions certainly i shall only be too happy to give you any information in my power but the moment after he had made this polite speech he recollected mollys speechthat she would refer her case to lady harriet but the letters had been returned and the affair was now wound up she had come off conqueror he the vanquished surely she would never have been so ungenerous as to appeal after that there are reports about miss gibson and you current among the gossips of hollingford are we to congratulate you on your engagement to that young lady ah by the way preston we ought to have done it before interrupted lord cumnor in hasty goodwill but his daughter said quietly mr preston has not yet told us if the reports are well founded papa she looked at him with the air of a person expecting an answer and expecting a truthful answer i am not so fortunate replied he trying to make his horse appear fidgety without incurring observation then i may contradict that report asked lady harriet quickly or is there any reason for believing that in time it may come true i ask because such reports if unfounded do harm to young ladies keep other sweethearts off put in lord cumnor looking a good deal pleased at his own discernment lady harriet went on and i take a great interest in miss gibson mr preston saw from her manner that he was in for it as he expressed it to himself the question was how much or how little did she know i have no expectation or hope of ever having a nearer interest in miss gibson than i have at present i shall be glad if this straightforward answer relieves your ladyship from your perplexity he could not help the touch of insolence that accompanied these last words it was not in the words themselves nor in the tone in which they were spoken nor in the look which accompanied them it was in all it implied a doubt of lady harriets right to question him as she did and there was something of defiance in it as well but this touch of insolence put lady harriets mettle up and she was not one to check herself in any course for the opinion of an inferior then sir are you aware of the injury you may do to a young ladys reputation if you meet her and detain her in long conversations when she is walking by herself unaccompanied by any one you give riseyou have given rise to reports my dear harriet are not you going too far you dont knowmr preston may have intentionsunacknowledged intentions no my lord i have no intentions with regard to miss gibson she may be a very worthy young ladyi have no doubt she is lady harriet seems determined to push me into such a position that i cannot but acknowledge myself to beit is not enviablenot pleasant to ownbut i am in fact a jilted man jilted by miss kirkpatrick after a tolerably long engagement my interviews with miss gibson were not of the most agreeable kindas you may conclude when i tell you she was i believe the instigatorcertainly she was the agent in this last step of miss kirkpatricks is your ladyships curiosity with an emphasis on this last word satisfied with this rather mortifying confession of mine harriet my dear youve gone too farwe had no right to pry into mr prestons private affairs no more i had said lady harriet with a smile of winning frankness the first smile she had accorded to mr preston for many a long day ever since the time years ago when presuming on his handsomeness he had assumed a tone of gallant familiarity with lady harriet and paid her personal compliments as he would have done to an equal but he will excuse me i hope continued she still in that gracious manner which made him feel that he now held a much higher place in her esteem than he had had at the beginning of their interview when he learns that the busy tongues of the hollingford ladies have been speaking of my friend miss gibson in the most unwarrantable manner drawing unjustifiable inferences from the facts of that intercourse with mr preston the nature of which he has just conferred such a real obligation on me by explaining i think i need hardly request lady harriet to consider this explanation of mine as confidential said mr preston of course of course said the earl every one will understand that and he rode home and told his wife and lady cuxhaven the whole conversation between lady harriet and mr preston in the strictest confidence of course lady harriet had to stand a good many strictures on manners and proper dignity for a few days after this however she consoled herself by calling on the gibsons and finding that mrs gibson who was still an invalid was asleep at the time she experienced no difficulty in carrying off the unconscious molly for a walk which lady harriet so contrived that they twice passed through all the length of the principal street of the town loitered at grinsteads for half an hour and wound up by lady harriets calling on the miss brownings who to her regret were not at home perhaps its as well said she after a minutes consideration ill leave my card and put your name down underneath it molly molly was a little puzzled by the manner in which she had been taken possession of like an inanimate chattel for all the afternoon and exclaimedplease lady harrieti never leave cards i have not got any and on the miss brownings of all people why i am in and out whenever i like never mind little one today you shall do everything properly and according to full etiquette and now tell mrs gibson to come out to the towers for a long day we will send the carriage for her whenever she will let us know that she is strong enough to come indeed she had better come for a few days at this time of the year it doesnt do for an invalid to be out in the evenings even in a carriage so spoke lady harriet standing on the white doorsteps at miss brownings and holding mollys hand while she wished her goodby youll tell her dear that i came partly to see herbut that finding her asleep i ran off with you and dont forget about her coming to stay with us for change of airmamma will like it im sureand the carriage and all that and now goodby weve done a good days work and better than youre aware of continued she still addressing molly though the latter was quite out of hearing hollingford is not the place i take it to be if it doesnt veer round in miss gibsons favour after my todays trotting of that child about chapter l cynthia at bay mrs gibson was slow in recovering her strength after the influenza and before she was well enough to accept lady harriets invitation to the towers cynthia came home from london if molly had thought her manner of departure was scarcely as affectionate and considerate as it might have beenif such a thought had crossed mollys fancy for an instant she was repentant for it as soon as ever cynthia returned and the girls met together face to face with all the old familiar affection going upstairs to the drawingroom with their arms round each others waists and sitting there together hand in hand cynthias whole manner was more quiet than it had been when the weight of her unpleasant secret rested on her mind and made her alternately despondent or flighty after all said cynthia theres a look of home about these rooms which is very pleasant but i wish i could see you looking stronger mamma thats the only unpleasant thing molly why didnt you send for me i wanted to do began molly but i wouldnt let her said mrs gibson you were much better in london than here for you could have done me no good and your letters were very agreeable to read and now helen is better and im nearly well and youve come home just at the right time for everybody is full of the charity ball but we are not going this year mamma said cynthia decidedly its on the th isnt it and im sure youll never be well enough to take us you really seem determined to make me out worse than i am child said mrs gibson rather querulously she being one of those who when their malady is only trifling exaggerate it but when it is really of some consequence are unwilling to sacrifice any pleasures by acknowledging it it was well for her in this instance that her husband had wisdom and authority enough to forbid her going to this ball on which she had set her heart but the consequence of his prohibition was an increase of domestic plaintiveness and low spirits which seemed to tell on cynthiathe bright gay cynthia herselfand it was often hard work for molly to keep up the spirits of two other people as well as her own illhealth might account for mrs gibsons despondency but why was cynthia so silent not to say so sighing molly was puzzled to account for it and all the more perplexed because from time to time cynthia kept calling upon her for praise for some unknown and mysterious virtue that she had practised and molly was young enough to believe that after any exercise of virtue the spirits rose cheered up by an approving conscience such was not the case with cynthia however she sometimes said such things as these when she had been particularly inert and desponding ah molly you must let my goodness lie fallow for a while it has borne such a wonderful crop this year i have been so prettybehavedif you knew all or really molly my virtue must come down from the clouds it was strained to the utmost in londonand i find it is like a kiteafter soaring aloft for some time it suddenly comes down and gets tangled in all sorts of briars and brambles which things are an allegory unless you can bring yourself to believe in my extraordinary goodness while i was awaygiving me a sort of right to fall foul of all mammas briars and brambles now but molly had had some experience of cynthias whim of perpetually hinting at a mystery which she did not mean to reveal in the mr preston days and although she was occasionally piqued into curiosity cynthias allusions at something more in the background fell in general on rather deaf ears one day the mystery burst its shell and came out in the shape of an offer made to cynthia by mr hendersonand refused under all the circumstances molly could not appreciate the heroic goodness so often alluded to the revelation of the secret at last took place in this way mrs gibson breakfasted in bed she had done so ever since she had had the influenza and consequently her own private letters always went up on her breakfasttray one morning she came into the drawingroom earlier than usual with an open letter in her hand ive had a letter from aunt kirkpatrick cynthia she sends me my dividendsyour uncle is so busy but what does she mean by this cynthia holding out the letter to her with a certain paragraph indicated by her finger cynthia put her netting on one side and looked at the writing suddenly her face turned scarlet and then became of a deadly white she looked at molly as if to gain courage from the strong serene countenance it meansmamma i may as well tell you at oncemr henderson offered to me while i was in london and i refused him refused himand you never told me but let me hear it by chance really cynthia i think youre very unkind and pray what made you refuse mr henderson such a fine young manand such a gentleman your uncle told me he had a very good private fortune besides mamma do you forget that i have promised to marry roger hamley said cynthia quietly no of course i donthow can i with molly always dinning the word engagement into my ears but really when one considers all the uncertaintiesand after all it was not a distinct promisehe seemed almost as if he might have looked forward to something of this sort of what sort mamma said cynthia sharply why of a more eligible offer he must have known you might change your mind and meet with some one you liked better so little as you had seen of the world cynthia made an impatient movement as if to stop her mother i never said i liked him betterhow can you talk so mamma im going to marry roger and theres an end of it i will not be spoken to about it again she got up and left the room going to marry roger thats all very fine but who is to guarantee his coming back alive and if he does what have they to marry upon i should like to know i dont wish her to have accepted mr henderson though i am sure she liked him and true love ought to have its course and not be thwarted but she need not have quite finally refused him untilwell until we had seen how matters turn out such an invalid as i am too it has given me quite a palpitation at the heart i do call it quite unfeeling of cynthia certainly began molly but then she remembered that her stepmother was far from strong and unable to bear a protest in favour of the right course without irritation so she changed her speech into a suggestion of remedies for palpitation and curbed her impatience to speak out her indignation at the contemplated falsehood to roger but when they were alone and cynthia began upon the subject molly was less merciful cynthia said well molly and now you know all ive been longing to tell youand yet somehow i could not i suppose it was a repetition of mr coxe said molly gravely you were agreeableand he took it for something more i dont know sighed cynthia i mean i dont know if i was agreeable or not he was very kindvery pleasantbut i did not expect it all to end as it did however its of no use thinking of it no said molly simply for to her mind the pleasantest and kindest person in the world put in comparison with roger was as nothing he stood by himself cynthias next wordsand they did not come very soonwere on quite a different subject and spoken in rather a pettish tone nor did she allude again in jesting sadness to her late efforts at virtue in a little while mrs gibson was able to accept the oftenrepeated invitation from the towers to go and stay there for a day or two lady harriet told her that it would be a kindness to lady cumnor to come and bear her company in the life of seclusion the latter was still compelled to lead and mrs gibson was flattered and gratified with a dim unconscious sense of being really wanted not merely deluding herself into a pleasing fiction lady cumnor was in that state of convalescence common to many invalids the spring of life had begun again to flow and with the flow returned the old desires and projects and plans which had all become mere matters of indifference during the worst part of her illness but as yet her bodily strength was not sufficient to be an agent to her energetic mind and the difficulty of driving the illmatched pair of body and willthe one weak and languid the other strong and sternmade her ladyship often very irritable mrs gibson herself was not quite strong enough for a souffredouleur and the visit to the towers was not on the whole quite so happy a one as she had anticipated lady cuxhaven and lady harriet each aware of their mothers state of health and temper but only alluding to it as slightly as was absolutely necessary in their conversations with each other took care not to leave clare too long with lady cumnor but several times when one or the other went to relieve guard they found clare in tears and lady cumnor holding forth on some point on which she had been meditating during the silent hours of her illness and on which she seemed to consider herself born to set the world to rights mrs gibson was always apt to consider these remarks as addressed with a personal direction at some error of her own and defended the fault in question with a sense of property in it whatever it might happen to be the second and the last day of her stay at the towers lady harriet came in and found her mother haranguing in an excited tone of voice and clare looking submissive and miserable and oppressed whats the matter dear mamma are not you tiring yourself with talking no not at all i was only speaking of the folly of people dressing above their station i began by telling clare of the fashions of my grandmothers days when every class had a sort of costume of its ownand servants did not ape tradespeople nor tradespeople professional men and so onand what must the foolish woman do but begin to justify her own dress as if i had been accusing her or even thinking about her at all such nonsense really clare your husband has spoilt you sadly if you cant listen to any one without thinking they are alluding to you people may flatter themselves just as much by thinking that their faults are always present to other peoples minds as if they believe that the world is always contemplating their individual charms and virtues i was told lady cumnor that this silk was reduced in price i bought it at waterloo house after the season was over said mrs gibson touching the very handsome gown she wore in deprecation of lady cumnors angry voice and blundering on to the very source of irritation again clare how often must i tell you i had no thought of you or your gowns or whether they cost much or little your husband has to pay for them and it is his concern if you spend more on your dress than you ought to do it was only five guineas for the whole dress pleaded mrs gibson and very pretty it is said lady harriet stooping to examine it and so hoping to soothe the poor aggrieved woman but lady cumnor went on no you ought to have known me better by this time when i think a thing i say it out i dont beat about the bush i use straightforward language i will tell you where i think you have been in fault clare if you like to know like it or not the plainspeaking was coming now you have spoilt that girl of yours till she does not know her own mind she has behaved abominably to mr preston and it is all in consequence of the faults in her education you have much to answer for mamma mamma said lady harriet mr preston did not wish it spoken about and at the same moment mrs gibson exclaimed cynthiamr preston in such a tone of surprise that if lady cumnor had been in the habit of observing the revelations made by other peoples tones and voices she would have found out that mrs gibson was ignorant of the affair to which she was alluding as for mr prestons wishes i do not suppose i am bound to regard them when i feel it my duty to reprove error said lady cumnor loftily to lady harriet and clare do you mean to say that you are not aware that your daughter has been engaged to mr preston for some timeyears i believeand has at last chosen to break it offand has used the gibson girli forget her nameas a catspaw and made both her and herself the towns talkthe butt for all the gossip of hollingford i remember when i was young there was a girl called jilting jessy youll have to watch over your young lady or she will get some such name i speak to you like a friend clare when i tell you its my opinion that girl of yours will get herself into some more mischief yet before shes safely married not that i care one straw for mr prestons feelings i dont even know if hes got feelings or not but i know what is becoming in a young woman and jilting is not and now you may both go away and send bradley to me for im tired and want to have a little sleep indeed lady cumnorwill you believe mei do not think cynthia was ever engaged to mr preston there was an old flirtation i was afraid ring the bell for bradley said lady cumnor wearily her eyes closed lady harriet had too much experience of her mothers moods not to lead mrs gibson away almost by main force she protesting all the while that she did not think there was any truth in the statement though it was dear lady cumnor that said it once in her own room lady harriet said now clare ill tell you all about it and i think youll have to believe it for it was mr preston himself who told me i heard of a great commotion in hollingford about mr preston and i met him riding out and asked him what it was all about he didnt want to speak about it evidently no man does i suppose when hes been jilted and he made both papa and me promise not to tell but papa didand thats what mamma has for a foundation you see a really good one but cynthia is engaged to another manshe really is and anothera very good match indeedhas just been offering to her in london mr preston is always at the root of mischief nay i do think in this case it must be that pretty miss cynthia of yours who has drawn on one man to be engaged to hernot to say twoand another to make her an offer i cant endure mr preston but i think its rather hard to accuse him of having called up the rivals who are i suppose the occasion of his being jilted i dont know i always feel as if he owed me a grudge and men have so many ways of being spiteful you must acknowledge that if he had not met you i should not have had dear lady cumnor so angry with me she only wanted to warn you about cynthia mamma has always been very particular about her own daughters she has been very severe on the least approach to flirting and mary will be like her but cynthia will flirt and i cant help it she is not noisy or giggling she is always a ladythat everybody must own but she has a way of attracting men she must have inherited from me i think and here she smiled faintly and would not have rejected a confirmatory compliment but none came however i will speak to her i will get to the bottom of the whole affair pray tell lady cumnor that it has so fluttered me the way she spoke about my dress and all and it only cost five guineas after all reduced from eight well never mind now you are looking very much flushed quite feverish i left you too long in mammas hot room but do you know she is so much pleased to have you here and so lady cumnor really was in spite of the continual lectures which she gave clare and which poor mrs gibson turned under as helplessly as the typical worm still it was something to have a countess to scold her and that pleasure would endure when the worry was past and then lady harriet petted her more than usual to make up for what she had to go through in the convalescents room and lady cuxhaven talked sense to her with dashes of science and deep thought intermixed which was very flattering although generally unintelligible and lord cumnor goodnatured goodtempered kind and liberal was full of gratitude to her for her kindness in coming to see lady cumnor and his gratitude took the tangible shape of a haunch of venison to say nothing of lesser game when she looked back upon her visit as she drove home in the solitary grandeur of the towers carriage there had been but one great enduring rublady cumnors crossnessand she chose to consider cynthia as the cause of that instead of seeing the truth which had been so often set before her by the members of her ladyships family that it took its origin in her state of health mrs gibson did not exactly mean to visit this one discomfort upon cynthia nor did she quite mean to upbraid her daughter for conduct as yet unexplained and which might have some justification but finding her quietly sitting in the drawingroom she sate down despondingly in her own little easy chair and in reply to cynthias quick pleasant greeting of well mamma how are you we didnt expect you so early let me take off your bonnet and shawl she replied dolefully it has not been such a happy visit that i should wish to prolong it her eyes were fixed on the carpet and her face was as irresponsive to the welcome offered as she could make it what has been the matter asked cynthia in all good faith you cynthiayou i little thought when you were born how i should have to bear to hear you spoken about cynthia threw back her head and angry light came into her eyes what business have they with me how came they to talk about me in any way everybody is talking about you it is no wonder they are lord cumnor is sure to hear about everything always you should take more care about what you do cynthia if you dont like being talked about it rather depends upon what people say said cynthia affecting a lightness which she did not feel for she had a prevision of what was coming well i dont like it at any rate it is not pleasant to me to hear first of my daughters misdoings from lady cumnor and then to be lectured about her and her flirting and her jilting as if i had had anything to do with it i can assure you it has quite spoilt my visit no dont touch my shawl when i go to my room i can take it myself cynthia was brought to bay and sate down remaining with her mother who kept sighing ostentatiously from time to time would you mind telling me what they said if there are accusations abroad against me it is as well i should know what they are heres molly as the girl entered the room fresh from a mornings walk molly mamma has come back from the towers and my lord and my lady have been doing me the honour to talk over my crimes and misdemeanors and i am asking mamma what they have said i dont set up for more virtue than other people but i cant make out what an earl and a countess have to do with poor little me it was not for your sake said mrs gibson it was for mine they felt for me for it is not pleasant to have ones childs name in everybodys mouth as i said before that depends upon how it is in everybodys mouth if i were going to marry lord hollingford i make no doubt every one would be talking about me and neither you nor i should mind it in the least but this is no marriage with lord hollingford so it is nonsense to talk as if it was they say youve gone and engaged yourself to mr preston and now refuse to marry him and they call that jilting do you wish me to marry him mamma asked cynthia her face in a flame her eyes cast down molly stood by very hot not fully understanding it and only kept where she was by the hope of coming in as sweetener or peacemaker or helper of some kind no said mrs gibson evidently discomfited by the question of course i dont you have gone and entangled yourself with roger hamley a very worthy young man but nobody knows where he is and if hes dead or alive and he has not a penny if he is alive i beg your pardon i know that he has some fortune from his mother it may not be much but he is not penniless and he is sure to earn fame and great reputation and with it money will come said cynthia youve entangled yourself with him and youve done something of the sort with mr preston and got yourself into such an imbroglio mrs gibson could not have said mess for the world although the word was present to her mind that when a really eligible person comes forwardhandsome agreeable and quite the gentlemanand a good private fortune into the bargain you have to refuse him youll end as an old maid cynthia and it will break my heart i daresay i shall said cynthia quietly i sometimes think im the kind of person of which old maids are made she spoke seriously and a little sadly mrs gibson began again i dont want to know your secrets as long as they are secrets but when all the town is talking about you i think i ought to be told but mamma i didnt know i was such a subject of conversation and even now i cant make out how it has come about no more can i i only know that they say youve been engaged to mr preston and ought to have married him and that i cant help it if you did not choose any more than i could have helped your refusing mr henderson and yet i am constantly blamed for your misconduct i think its very hard mrs gibson began to cry just then her husband came in you here my dear welcome back said he coming up to her courteously and kissing her cheek why whats the matter tears and he heartily wished himself away again yes said she raising herself up and clutching after sympathy of any kind at any price im come home again and im telling cynthia how lady cumnor has been so cross to me and all through her did you know she had gone and engaged herself to mr preston and then broken it off everybody is talking about it and they know it up at the towers for one moment his eyes met mollys and he comprehended it all he made his lips up into a whistle but no sound came cynthia had quite lost her defiant manner since her mother had spoken to mr gibson molly sate down by her cynthia said he very seriously yes she answered softly is this true i had heard something of it beforenot much but there is scandal enough about to make it desirable that you should have some protectorsome friend who knows the whole truth no answer at last she said molly knows it all mrs gibson too had been awed into silence by her husbands grave manner and she did not like to give vent to the jealous thought in her mind that molly had known the secret of which she was ignorant mr gibson replied to cynthia with some sternness yes i know that molly knows it all and that she has had to bear slander and ill words for your sake cynthia but she refused to tell me more she told you that much did she said cynthia aggrieved i could not help it said molly she didnt name your name said mr gibson at the time i believe she thought she had concealed itbut there was no mistaking who it was why did she speak about it at all said cynthia with some bitterness her toneher question stirred up mr gibsons passion it was necessary for her to justify herself to mei heard my daughters reputation attacked for the private meetings she had given to mr prestoni came to her for an explanation theres no need to be ungenerous cynthia because youve been a flirt and a jilt even to the degree of dragging mollys name down into the same mire cynthia lifted her boweddown head and looked at him you say that of me mr gibson not knowing what the circumstances are you say that he had spoken too strongly he knew it but he could not bring himself to own it just at that moment the thought of his sweet innocent molly who had borne so much patiently prevented any retractation of his words at the time yes he said i do say it you cannot tell what evil constructions are put upon actions ever so slightly beyond the bounds of maidenly propriety i do say that molly has had a great deal to bear in consequence of this clandestine engagement of yours cynthiathere may be extenuating circumstances i acknowledgebut you will need to remember them all to excuse your conduct to roger hamley when he comes home i asked you to tell me the full truth in order that until he comes and has a legal right to protect you i may do so no answer it certainly requires explanation continued he here are youengaged to two men at once to all appearances still no answer to be sure the gossips of the town havent yet picked out the fact of roger hamleys being your accepted lover but scandal has been resting on molly and ought to have rested on you cynthiafor a concealed engagement to mr prestonnecessitating meetings in all sorts of places unknown to your friends papa said molly if you knew all you wouldnt speak so to cynthia i wish she would tell you herself all that she has told me i am ready to hear whatever she has to say said he but cynthia said no you have prejudged me you have spoken to me as you had no right to speak i refuse to give you my confidence or accept your help people are very cruel to meher voice trembled for a momenti did not think you would have been but i can bear it and then in spite of molly who would have detained her by force she tore herself away and hastily left the room oh papa said molly crying and clinging to him do let me tell you all and then she suddenly recollected the awkwardness of telling some of the details of the story before mrs gibson and stopped short i think mr gibson you have been very very unkind to my poor fatherless child said mrs gibson emerging from behind her pockethandkerchief i only wish her poor father had been alive and all this would never have happened very probably still i cannot see of what either she or you have to complain inasmuch as we could i and mine have sheltered her i have loved her i do love her almost as if she were my own childas well as molly i do not pretend to do thats it mr gibson you do not treat her like your own child but in the midst of this wrangle molly stole out and went in search of cynthia she thought she bore an olivebranch of healing in the sound of her fathers just spoken words i do love her almost as if she were my own child but cynthia was locked into her room and refused to open the door open to me please pleaded molly i have something to say to youi want to see youdo open no said cynthia not now i am busy leave me alone i dont want to hear what you have got to say i dont want to see you byandby we shall meet and then molly stood quite quietly wondering what new words of more persuasion she could use in a minute or two cynthia called out are you there still molly and when molly answered yes and hoped for a relenting the same hard metallic voice telling of resolution and repression spoke out go away i cannot bear the feeling of your being therewaiting and listening go downstairsout of the houseanywhere away it is the most you can do for me now chapter li troubles never come alone illustration untitled molly had her outofdoor things on and she crept away as she was bidden she lifted her heavy weight of heart and body along till she came to a field not so very far offwhere she had sought the comfort of loneliness ever since she was a child and there under the hedgebank she sate down burying her face in her hands and quivering all over as she thought of cynthias misery which she might not try to touch or assuage she never knew how long she sate there but it was long past lunchtime when once again she stole up to her room the door opposite was open widecynthia had quitted the chamber molly arranged her dress and went down into the drawingroom cynthia and her mother sate there in the stern repose of an armed neutrality cynthias face looked made of stone for colour and rigidity but she was netting away as if nothing unusual had occurred not so mrs gibson her face bore evident marks of tears and she looked up and greeted mollys entrance with a faint smiling notice cynthia went on as though she had never heard the opening of the door or felt the approaching sweep of mollys dress molly took up a booknot to read but to have the semblance of some employment which should not necessitate conversation there was no measuring the duration of the silence that ensued molly grew to fancy it was some old enchantment that weighed upon their tongues and kept them still at length cynthia spoke but she had to begin again before her words came clear i wish you both to know that henceforward all is at an end between me and roger hamley mollys book went down upon her knees with open eyes and lips she strove to draw in cynthias meaning mrs gibson spoke querulously as if injured i could have understood this if it had happened three months agowhen you were in london but now its just nonsense cynthia and you know you dont mean it cynthia did not reply nor did the resolute look on her face change when molly spoke at last cynthiathink of him it will break his heart no said cynthia it will not but even if it did i cannot help it all this talk will soon pass away said molly and when he knows the truth from your own self from my own self he shall never hear it i do not love him well enough to go through the shame of having to excuse myselfto plead that he will reinstate me in his good opinion confession may bewell i can never believe it pleasantbut it may be an ease of mind if one makes it to some peopleto some personand it may not be a mortification to sue for forgiveness i cannot tell all i know isand i know it clearly and will act upon it inflexiblythat and here she stopped short i think you might finish your sentence said her mother after a silence of five seconds i cannot bear to exculpate myself to roger hamley i will not submit to his thinking less well of me than he has donehowever foolish his judgment may have been i would rather never see him again for these two reasons and the truth is i do not love him i like him i respect him but i will not marry him i have written to tell him so that was merely as a relief to myself for when or where the letter will reach him and i have written to old mr hamley the relief is the one good thing come out of it all it is such a comfort to feel free again it wearied me so to think of straining up to his goodness extenuate my conduct she concluded quoting mr gibsons words yet when mr gibson came home after a silent dinner she asked to speak with him alone in his consultingroom and there laid bare the exculpation of herself which she had given to molly many weeks before when she had ended she said and now mr gibsoni still treat you like a friendhelp me to find some home far away where all the evil talking and gossip mamma tells me of cannot find me and follow me it may be wrong to care for peoples good opinionbut it is me and i cannot alter myself you mollyall the people in the towni havent the patience to live through the nine days wonderi want to go away and be a governess but my dear cynthiahow soon roger will be backa tower of strength has not mamma told you i have broken it all off with roger i wrote this morning i wrote to his father that letter will reach tomorrow i wrote to roger if he ever receives that letter i hope to be far away by that time in russia may be nonsense an engagement like yours cannot be broken off except by mutual consent youve only given others a great deal of pain without freeing yourself nor will you wish it in a months time when you come to think calmly youll be glad to think of the stay and support of such a husband as roger you have been in fault and have acted foolishly at firstperhaps wrongly afterwards but you dont want your husband to think you faultless yes i do said cynthia at any rate my lover must think me so and it is just because i do not love him even as so light a thing as i could love that i feel that i couldnt bear to have to tell him im sorry and stand before him like a chidden child to be admonished and forgiven but here you are just in such a position before me cynthia yes but i love you better than roger ive often told molly so and i would have told you if i hadnt expected and hoped to leave you all before long i could see if the recollection of it all came up before your mind i could see it in your eyes i should know it by instinct i have a fine instinct for reading the thoughts of others when they refer to me i almost hate the idea of roger judging me by his own standard which wasnt made for me and graciously forgiving me at last then i do believe its right for you to break it off said mr gibson almost as if he were thinking to himself that poor poor lad but it will be best for him too and hell get over it he has a good strong heart poor old roger for a moment cynthias wilful fancy stretched after the object passing out of her grasprogers love became for the instant a treasure but again she knew that in its entirety of high undoubting esteem as well as of passionate regard it would no longer be hers and for the flaw which she herself had made she cast it away and would none of it yet often in after years when it was too late she wondered and strove to penetrate the inscrutable mystery of what would have been still take till tomorrow before you act upon your decision said mr gibson slowly what faults you have fallen into have been mere girlish faults at firstleading you into much deceit i grant dont give yourself the trouble to define the shades of blackness said cynthia bitterly im not so obtuse but what i know them all better than any one can tell me and as for my decision i acted upon it at once it may be long before roger gets my letterbut i hope he is sure to get it at lastand as i said i have let his father know it wont hurt him oh sir i think if i had been differently brought up i shouldnt have had the sore angry heart i have now no dont i dont want reasoning comfort i cant stand it i should always have wanted admiration and worship and mens good opinion those unkind gossips to visit molly with their hard words oh dear i think life is very dreary she put her head down on her hands tired out mentally as well as bodily so mr gibson thought he felt as if much speech from him would only add to her excitement and make her worse he left the room and called molly from where she was sitting dolefully go to cynthia he whispered and molly went she took cynthia into her arms with gentle power and laid her head against her own breast as if the one had been a mother and the other a child oh my darling she murmured i do so love you dear dear cynthia and she stroked her hair and kissed her eyelids cynthia passive all the while till suddenly she started up stung with a new idea and looking molly straight in the face she said molly roger will marry you see if it isnt so you two good but molly pushed her away with a sudden violence of repulsion dont she said she was crimson with shame and indignation your husband this morning mine tonight what do you take him for a man smiled cynthia and therefore if you wont let me call him changeable ill coin a word and call him consolable but molly gave her back no answering smile at this moment the servant maria entered the consultingroom where the two girls were she had a scared look isnt master here asked she as if she distrusted her eyes no said cynthia i heard him go out i heard him shut the front door not five minutes ago oh dear said maria and theres a man come on horseback from hamley hall and he says as mr osborne is dead and that master must go off to the squire straight away osborne hamley dead said cynthia in awed surprise molly was out at the front door seeking the messenger through the dusk round into the stableyard where the groom sate motionless on his dark horse flecked with foam made visible by the lantern placed on the steps near where it had been left by the servants who were dismayed at this news of the handsome young man who had frequented their masters house so full of sportive elegance and winsomeness molly went up to the man whose thoughts were lost in recollection of the scene he had left at the place he had come from she laid her hand on the hot damp skin of the horses shoulder the man started is the doctor coming miss for he saw who it was by the dim light he is dead is he not asked molly in a low voice im afeard he isleastways theres no doubt according to what they said but ive ridden hard there may be a chance is the doctor coming miss he is gone out they are seeking him i believe i will go myself oh the poor old squire she went into the kitchenwent over the house with swift rapidity to gain news of her fathers whereabouts the servants knew no more than she did neither she nor they had heard what cynthia ever quick of perception had done the shutting of the front door had fallen on deaf ears as far as others were concerned upstairs sped molly to the drawingroom where mrs gibson stood at the door listening to the unusual stir in the house what is it molly why how white you look child wheres papa gone out whats the matter where how should i know i was asleep jenny came upstairs on her way to the bedrooms shes a girl who never keeps to her work and maria takes advantage of her jenny jenny cried molly frantic at the delay dont shout dearring the bell what can be the matter oh jenny said molly halfway up the stairs to meet her who wanted papa cynthia came to join the group she too had been looking for traces or tidings of mr gibson what is the matter said mrs gibson can nobody speak and answer a question osborne hamley is dead said cynthia gravely dead osborne poor fellow i knew it would be so thoughi was sure of it but mr gibson can do nothing if hes dead poor young man i wonder where roger is now he ought to come home jenny had been blamed for coming into the drawingroom instead of maria whose place it was and so had lost the few wits she had to mollys hurried questions her replies had been entirely unsatisfactory a man had come to the back doorshe could not see who it wasshe had not asked his name he wanted to speak to mastermaster had seemed in a hurry and only stopped to get his hat he will not be long away thought molly or he would have left word where he was going but oh the poor father all alone and then a thought came into her head which she acted upon straight go to james tell him to put the sidesaddle i had in november on nora creina dont cry jenny theres no time for that no one is angry with you run so down into the cluster of collected women molly came equipped in her jacket and skirt quick determination in her eyes controlled quivering about the corners of her mouth why what in the world said mrs gibsonmolly what are you thinking about but cynthia had understood it at a glance and was arranging mollys hastily assumed dress as she passed along i am going i must go i cannot bear to think of him alone when papa comes back he is sure to go to hamley and if i am not wanted i can come back with him she heard mrs gibsons voice following her in remonstrance but she did not stay for words she had to wait in the stableyard and she wondered how the messenger could bear to eat and drink the food and beer brought out to him by the servants her coming out had evidently interrupted the eager talkthe questions and answers passing sharp to and fro but she caught the words all amongst the tangled grass and the squire would let none on us touch him he took him up as if he was a baby he had to rest many a time and once he sate him down on the ground but still he kept him in his arms but we thought we should neer have gotten him up againhim and the body the body molly had never felt that osborne was really dead till she heard those words they rode quick under the shadows of the hedgerow trees but when they slackened speed to go up a brow or to give their horses breath molly heard those two little words again in her ears and said them over again to herself in hopes of forcing the sharp truth into her unwilling sense but when they came in sight of the square stillness of the house shining in the moonlightthe moon had risen by this timemolly caught at her breath and for an instant she thought she never could go in and face the presence in that dwelling one yellow light burnt steadily spotting the silver shining with its earthly coarseness the man pointed it out it was almost the first word he had spoken since they had left hollingford its the old nursery they carried him there the squire broke down at the stairfoot and they took him to the readiest place ill be bound for it the squire is there hisself and old robin too they fetched him as a knowledgable man among dumb beasts till th regular doctor came molly dropped down from her seat before the man could dismount to help her she gathered up her skirts and did not stay again to think of what was before her she ran along the once familiar turns and swiftly up the stairs and through the doors till she came to the last then she stopped and listened it was a deathly silence she opened the doorthe squire was sitting alone at the side of the bed holding the dead mans hand and looking straight before him at vacancy he did not stir or move even so much as an eyelid at mollys entrance the truth had entered his soul before this and he knew that no doctor be he ever so cunning could with all his striving put the breath into that body again molly came up to him with the softest steps the most hushed breath that ever she could she did not speak for she did not know what to say she felt that he had no more hope from earthly skill so what was the use of speaking of her father and the delay in his coming after a moments pause standing by the old mans side she slipped down to the floor and sat at his feet possibly her presence might have some balm in it but uttering of words was as a vain thing he must have been aware of her being there but he took no apparent notice there they sate silent and still he in his chair she on the floor the dead man beneath the sheet for a third she fancied that she must have disturbed the father in his contemplation of the quiet face now more than half but not fully covered up out of sight time had never seemed so without measure silence had never seemed so noiseless as it did to molly sitting there in the acuteness of her senses she heard a step mounting a distant staircase coming slowly coming nearer she knew it not to be her fathers and that was all she cared about nearer and nearerclose to the outside of the doora pause and a soft hesitating tap the great gaunt figure sitting by her side quivered at the sound molly rose and went to the door it was robinson the old butler holding in his hand a covered basin of soup god bless you miss said he make him touch a drop o this hes gone since breakfast without food and its past one in the morning now he softly removed the cover and molly took the basin back with her to her place at the squires side she did not speak for she did not well know what to say or how to present this homely want of nature before one so rapt in grief but she put a spoonful to his lips and touched them with the savoury food as if he had been a sick child and she the nurse and instinctively he took down the first spoonful of the soup but in a minute he said with a sort of cry and almost overturning the basin molly held by his passionate gesture as he pointed to the bed he will never eat againnever then he threw himself across the corpse and wept in such a terrible manner that molly trembled lest he also should dieshould break his heart there and then he took no more notice of her words of her tears of her presence than he did of that of the moon looking through the unclosed window with passionless stare her father stood by them both before either of them was aware go downstairs molly said he gravely but he stroked her head tenderly as she rose go into the diningroom now she felt the reaction from all her selfcontrol she trembled with fear as she went along the moonlit passages it seemed to her as if she should meet osborne and hear it all explained how he came to diewhat he now felt and thought and wished her to do she did get down to the diningroomthe last few steps with a rush of terrorsenseless terror of what might be behind her and there she found supper laid out and candles lit and robinson bustling about decanting some wine she wanted to cry to get into some quiet place and weep away her overexcitement but she could hardly do so there she only felt very much tired and to care for nothing in this world any more but vividness of life came back when she found robinson holding a glass to her lips as she sat in the great leather easychair to which she had gone instinctively as to a place of rest drink miss its good old madeira your papa said as how you was to eat a bit says he my daughter may have to stay here mr robinson and shes young for the work persuade her to eat something or shell break down utterly those was his very words molly did not say anything she had not energy enough for resistance she drank and she ate at the old servants bidding and then she asked him to leave her alone and went back to her easychair and let herself cry and so ease her heart chapter lii squire hamleys sorrow it seemed very long before mr gibson came down he went and stood with his back to the empty fireplace and did not speak for a minute or two hes gone to bed said he at length robinson and i have got him there but just as i was leaving him he called me back and asked me to let you stop im sure i dont knowbut one doesnt like to refuse at such a time i wish to stay said molly do you theres a good girl but how will you manage oh never mind that i can manage papashe pausedwhat did osborne die of she asked the question in a low awestricken voice something wrong about the heart you wouldnt understand if i told you i apprehended it for some time but its better not to talk of such things at home when i saw him on thursday week he seemed better than ive seen him for a long time i told dr nicholls so but one never can calculate in these complaints you saw him on thursday week why you never mentioned it said molly no i dont talk of my patients at home besides i didnt want him to consider me as his doctor but as a friend any alarm about his own health would only have hastened the catastrophe then didnt he know that he was illill of a dangerous complaint i mean one that might end as it has done no certainly not he would only have been watching his symptomsaccelerating matters in fact oh papa said molly shocked ive no time to go into the question mr gibson continued and until you know what has to be said on both sides and in every instance you are not qualified to judge we must keep our attention on the duties in hand now you sleep here for the remainder of the night which is more than halfgone already yes promise me to go to bed just as usual you may not think it but most likely youll go to sleep at once people do at your age papa i think i ought to tell you something i know a great secret of osbornes which i promised solemnly not to tell but the last time i saw him i think he must have been afraid of something like this a fit of sobbing came upon her which her father was afraid would end in hysterics but suddenly she mastered herself and looked up into his anxious face and smiled to reassure him i could not help it papa no i know go on with what you were saying you ought to be in bed but if youve a secret on your mind you wont sleep osborne was married said she fixing her eyes on her father that is the secret married nonsense what makes you think so he told me thats to say i was in the librarywas reading there some time ago and roger came and spoke to osborne about his wife roger did not see me but osborne did they made me promise secrecy i dont think i did wrong dont worry yourself about right or wrong just now tell me more about it at once i knew no more till six months agolast november when you went up to lady cumnor then he called and gave me his wifes address but still under promise of secrecy and except those two times and once when roger just alluded to it i have never heard any one mention the subject i think he would have told me more that last time only miss phoebe came in where is this wife of his down in the south near winchester i think he said she was a frenchwoman and a roman catholic and i think he said she was a servant added molly phew her father made a long whistle of dismay and continued molly he spoke of a child now you know as much as i do papa except the address i have it written down safe at home forgetting apparently what time of night it was mr gibson sate down stretched out his legs before him put his hands in his pockets and began to think molly sate still without speaking too tired to do more than wait well said he at last jumping up nothing can be done tonight by tomorrow morning perhaps i may find out poor little pale facetaking it between both his hands and kissing it poor sweet little pale face then he rang the bell and told robinson to send some maidservant to take miss gibson to her room he wont be up early said he in parting the shock has lowered him too much to be energetic send breakfast up to him in his own room ill be here again before ten late as it was before he left he kept his word now molly he said you and i must tell him the truth between us i dont know how he will take it it may comfort him but ive very little hope either way he ought to know it at once robinson says he has gone into the room again and he is afraid he has locked the door on the inside never mind i shall ring the bell and send up robinson to say that i am here and wish to speak to him the message returned was the squires kind love and could not see mr gibson just then robinson added it was a long time before hed answer at all sir go up again and tell him i can wait his convenience now thats a lie mr gibson said turning round to molly as soon as robinson had left the room i ought to be far enough away at twelve but if im not much mistaken the innate habits of a gentleman will make him uneasy at the idea of keeping me waiting his pleasure and will do more to bring him out of that room into this than any entreaties or reasoning mr gibson was growing impatient though before they heard the squires footstep on the stairs he was evidently coming slowly and unwillingly he came in almost like one blind groping along and taking hold of chair or table for support or guidance till he reached mr gibson he did not speak when he held the doctor by the hand he only hung down his head and kept on a feeble shaking of welcome im brought very low sir i suppose its gods doing but it comes hard upon me he was my firstborn child he said this almost as if speaking to a stranger and informing him of facts of which he was ignorant heres molly said mr gibson choking a little himself and pushing her forwards i beg your pardon i did not see you at first my mind is a good deal occupied just now he sate heavily down and then seemed almost to forget they were there molly wondered what was to come next suddenly her father spoke wheres roger said he is he not likely to be soon at the cape he got up and looked at the directions of one or two unopened letters brought by that mornings post among them was one in cynthias handwriting both molly and he saw it at the same time how long it was since yesterday but the squire took no notice of their proceedings or their looks you will be glad to have roger at home as soon as may be i think sir some months must elapse first but im sure he will return as speedily as possible the squire said something in a very low voice both father and daughter strained their ears to hear what it was they both believed it to be roger isnt osborne and mr gibson spoke on that belief he spoke more quietly than molly had ever heard him do before no we know that i wish that anything that roger could do or that i could do or that any one could do would comfort you but it is past human comfort i do try to say gods will be done sir said the squire looking up at mr gibson for the first time and speaking with more life in his voice but its harder to be resigned than happy people think they were all silent for a while the squire himself was the first to speak againhe was my first child sir my eldest son and of late years we werenthis voice broke down but he controlled himselfwe werent quite as good friends as could be wished and im not surenot sure that he knew how i loved him and now he cried aloud with an exceeding bitter cry better so whispered mr gibson to molly when hes a little calmer dont be afraid tell him all you know exactly as it happened molly began her voice sounded high and unnatural to herself as if some one else was speaking but she made her words clear the squire did not attempt to listen at first at any rate one day when i was here at the time of mrs hamleys last illness the squire here checked his convulsive breathing i was in the library and osborne came in he said he had only come in for a book and that i was not to mind him so i went on reading presently roger came along the flagged gardenpath just outside the window which was open he did not see me in the corner where i was sitting and said to osborne heres a letter from your wife now the squire was all attention for the first time his tearswollen eyes met the eyes of another and he looked at molly with searching anxiety as he repeated his wife osborne married molly went on osborne was angry with roger for speaking out before me and they made me promise never to mention it to any one or to allude to it to either of them again i never named it to papa till last night go on said mr gibson tell the squire about osbornes callwhat you told me still the squire hung on her lips listening with open mouth and eyes some months ago osborne called he was not well and wanted to see papa papa was away and i was alone i dont exactly remember how it came about but he spoke to me of his wife for the first and only time since the affair in the library she looked at her father as if questioning him as to the desirableness of telling the few further particulars that she knew the squires mouth was dry and stiff but he tried to say tell me alleverything and molly understood the halfformed words he said his wife was a good woman and that he loved her dearly but she was a french roman catholic and aanother glance at her fathershe had been a servant once that was all except that i have her address at home he wrote it down and gave it me well well moaned the squire its all over now all over all past and gone well not blame himno but i wish hed ha told me he and i to live together with such a secret in one of us its no wonder to me nownothing can be a wonder again for one never can tell whats in a mans heart married so long and we sitting together at mealsand living together why i told him everything too much may be for i showed him all my passions and illtempers married so long oh osborne osborne you should have told me yes he should said mr gibson but i daresay he knew how much you would dislike such a choice as he had made but he should have told you you know nothing about it sir said the squire sharply you dont know the terms we were on not hearty or confidential i was cross to him many a time angry with him for being dull poor ladand he with all this weight on his mind i wont have people interfering and judging between me and my sons and roger too he could know it all and keep it from me osborne evidently had bound him down to secrecy just as he bound me said molly roger could not help himself osborne was such a fellow for persuading people and winning them over said the squire dreamily i rememberbut whats the use of remembering its all over and osbornes dead without opening his heart to me i could have been tender to him i could but hell never know it now but we can guess what wish he had strongest in his mind at the last from what we do know of his life said mr gibson what sir said the squire with sharp suspicion of what was coming his wife must have been his last thought must she not how do i know she was his wife do you think hed go and marry a french baggage of a servant it may be all a tale trumped up stop squire i dont care to defend my daughters truth or accuracy but with the dead mans body lying upstairshis soul with godthink twice before you say more hasty words impugning his character if she was not his wife what was she i beg your pardon i hardly know what im saying did i accuse osborne oh my lad my ladthou might have trusted thy old dad he used to call me his old dad when he was a little chap not bigger than this indicating a certain height with his hand i never meant to say he was notnot what one would wish to think him nowhis soul with god as you say very justlyfor im sure it is there well but squire said mr gibson trying to check the others rambling to return to his wife and the child whispered molly to her father low as the whisper was it struck on the squires ear what said he turning round to her suddenly child you never named that is there a child husband and father and i never knew god bless osbornes child i say god bless it he stood up reverently and the other two instinctively rose he closed his hands as if in momentary prayer then exhausted he sate down again and put out his hand to molly youre a good girl thank youtell me what i ought to do and ill do it this to mr gibson im almost as much puzzled as you are squire replied he i fully believe the whole story but i think there must be some written confirmation of it which perhaps ought to be found at once before we act most probably this is to be discovered among osbornes papers will you look over them at once molly shall return with me and find the address that osborne gave her while you are busy shell come back again said the squire eagerly youshe wont leave me to myself no she shall come back this evening ill manage to send her somehow but she has no clothes but the habit she came in and i want my horse that she rode away upon take the carriage said the squire take anything ill give orders youll come back again too no im afraid not today ill come tomorrow early molly shall return this evening whenever it suits you to send for her this afternoon the carriage shall be at your house at three i dare not look at osbornesat the papers without one of you with me and yet i shall never rest till i know more ill send the desk in by robinson before i leave andcan you give me some lunch before i go little by little he led the squire to eat a morsel or so of food and so strengthening him physically and encouraging him mentally mr gibson hoped that he would begin his researches during mollys absence there was something touching in the squires wistful looks after molly as she moved about a stranger might have imagined her to be his daughter instead of mr gibsons the meek brokendown considerate ways of the bereaved father never showed themselves more strongly than when he called them back to his chair out of which he seemed too languid to rise and said as if by an afterthought give my love to miss kirkpatrick tell her i look upon her as quite one of the family i shall be glad to see her afterafter the funeral i dont think i can before he knows nothing of cynthias resolution to give up roger said mr gibson as they rode away i had a long talk with her last night but she was as resolute as ever from what your mamma tells me there is a third lover in london whom shes already refused im thankful that youve no lover at all molly unless that abortive attempt of mr coxes at an offer long ago can be called a lover i never heard of it papa said molly oh no i forgot what a fool i was why dont you remember the hurry i was in to get you off to hamley hall the very first time you ever went it was all because i got hold of a desperate loveletter from coxe addressed to you but molly was too tired to be amused or even interested she could not get over the sight of the straight body covered with a sheet which yet let the outlines be seenall that remained of osborne her father had trusted too much to the motion of the ride and the change of scene from the darkened house he saw his mistake some one must write to mrs osborne hamley said he i believe her to have a legal right to the name but whether or no she must be told that the father of her child is dead shall you do it or i oh you please papa i will if you wish but she may have heard of you as a friend of her dead husbands while of mea mere country doctorits very probable she has never heard the name if i ought i will do it mr gibson did not like this ready acquiescence given in so few words too theres hollingford churchspire said she presently as they drew near the town and caught a glimpse of the church through the trees i think i never wish to go out of sight of it again nonsense said he why youve all your travelling to do yet and if these newfangled railways spread as they say they will we shall all be spinning about the world sitting on teakettles as phoebe browning calls it miss browning wrote such a capital letter of advice to miss hornblower i heard of it at the millers miss hornblower was going to travel by railroad for the first time and dorothy was very anxious and sent her directions for her conduct one piece of advice was not to sit on the boiler molly laughed a little as she was expected to do here we are at home at last mrs gibson gave molly a warm welcome for one thing cynthia was in disgrace for another molly came from the centre of news for a third mrs gibson was really fond of the girl in her way and sorry to see her pale heavy looks to think of it all being so sudden at last not but what i always expected it and so provoking just when cynthia had given up roger if she had only waited a day what does the squire say to it all he is beaten down with grief replied molly indeed i should not have fancied he had liked the engagement so much what engagement why roger to cynthia to be sure i asked you how the squire took her letter announcing the breaking of it off ohi made a mistake he hasnt opened his letters today i saw cynthias among them now that i call positive disrespect i dont know he did not mean it for such where is cynthia gone out into the meadowgarden shell be in directly i wanted her to do some errands for me but she flatly refused to go into the town i am afraid she mismanages her affairs badly but she wont allow me to interfere i hate to look at such things in a mercenary spirit but it is provoking to see her throw over two such good matches first mr henderson and now roger hamley when does the squire expect roger does he think he will come back sooner for poor dear osbornes death i dont know he hardly seems to think of anything but osborne he appears to me to have almost forgotten every one else but perhaps the news of osbornes being married and of the child may rouse him up molly had no doubt that osborne was really and truly married nor had she any idea that her father had never breathed the facts of which she had told him on the previous night to his wife or cynthia but mr gibson had been slightly dubious of the full legality of the marriage and had not felt inclined to speak of it to his wife until that had been ascertained one way or another so mrs gibson exclaimed what do you mean child married osborne married who says so oh dear i suppose i ought not to have named it im very stupid today yes osborne has been married a long time but the squire did not know of it until this morning i think it has done him good but i dont know who is the lady why i call it a shame to go about as a single man and be married all the time if there is one thing that revolts me it is duplicity who is the lady do tell me all you know about it theres a dear she is french and a roman catholic said molly french they are such beguiling women and he was so much abroad you said there was a childis it a boy or a girl i did not hear i did not ask molly did not think it necessary to do more than answer questions indeed she was vexed enough to have told anything of what her father evidently considered it desirable to keep secret just then cynthia came wandering into the room with a careless hopeless look in her face which molly noticed at once she had not heard of mollys arrival and had no idea that she was returned until she saw her sitting there molly darling is that you youre as welcome as the flowers in may though youve not been gone twentyfour hours but the house isnt the same when you are away and she brings us such news too said mrs gibson im really almost glad you wrote to the squire yesterday for if you had waited till todayi thought you were in too great a hurry at the timehe might have thought you had some interested reason for giving up your engagement osborne hamley was married all this time unknown to everybody and has got a child too osborne married exclaimed cynthia if ever a man looked a bachelor he did poor osborne with his fair delicate elegancehe looked so young and boyish yes it was a great piece of deceit and i cant easily forgive him for it only think if he had paid either of you any particular attention and you had fallen in love with him why he might have broken your heart or mollys either i cant forgive him even though he is dead poor fellow well as he never did pay either of us any particular attention and as we neither of us did fall in love with him i think i only feel sorry that he had all the trouble and worry of concealment cynthia spoke with a pretty keen recollection of how much trouble and worry her concealment had cost her and now of course it is a son and will be the heir and roger will just be as poorly off as ever i hope youll take care and let the squire know cynthia was quite ignorant of these new facts that have come out when she wrote those letters molly i should not like a suspicion of worldliness to rest upon any one with whom i had any concern he hasnt read cynthias letter yet oh do let me bring it home unopened said molly send another letter to rogernowat once it will reach him at the same time he will get both when he arrives at the cape and make him understand which is the lastthe real one think he will hear of osbornes death at the same timetwo such sad things do cynthia no my dear said mrs gibson i could not allow that even if cynthia felt inclined for it asking to be reengaged to him at any rate she must wait now until he proposes again and we see how things turn out but molly kept her pleading eyes fixed on cynthia no said cynthia firmly but not without consideration it cannot be ive felt more content this last night than ive done for weeks past im glad to be free i dreaded rogers goodness and learning and all that it was not in my way and i dont believe i should have ever married him even without knowing of all these illnatured stories that are circulating about me and which he would hear of and expect me to explain and be sorry for and penitent and humble i know he could not have made me happy and i dont believe he would have been happy with me it must stay as it is i would rather be a governess than married to him i should get weary of him every day of my life weary of roger said molly to herself it is best as it is i see she answered aloud only im very sorry for him very he did love you so you will never get any one to love you like him very well i must take my chance and too much love is rather oppressive to me i believe i like a great deal widely spread about not all confined to one individual lover i dont believe you said molly but dont let us talk any more about it it is best as it is i thoughti almost felt sure you would be sorry this morning but we will leave it alone now she sate silently looking out of the window her heart sorely stirred she scarcely knew how or why but she could not have spoken most likely she would have begun to cry if she had spoken cynthia stole softly up to her after a while you are vexed with me molly she began in a low voice but molly turned sharply round i i have no business at all in the affair it is for you to judge do what you think right i believe you have done right only i dont want to discuss it and paw it over with talk im very much tired deargently now she spokeand i hardly know what i say if i speak crossly dont mind it cynthia did not reply at once then she said do you think i might go with you and help you i might have done yesterday and you say he hasnt opened my letter so he has not heard as yet and i was always fond of poor osborne in my way you know i cannot tell i have no right to say replied molly scarcely understanding cynthias motives which after all were only impulses in this case papa would be able to judge i think perhaps you had better not but dont go by my opinion i can only tell what i should wish to do in your place it was as much for your sake as any ones molly said cynthia oh then dont i am tired today with sitting up but tomorrow i shall be all right and i should not like it if for my sake you came into the house at so solemn a time very well said cynthia halfglad that her impulsive offer was declined for as she said thinking to herself it would have been awkward after all so molly went back in the carriage alone wondering how she should find the squire wondering what discoveries he had made among osbornes papers and at what conviction he would have arrived chapter liii unlookedfor arrivals robinson opened the door for molly almost before the carriage had fairly drawn up at the hall and told her that the squire had been very anxious for her return and had more than once sent him to an upstairs window from which a glimpse of the hillroad between hollingford and hamley could be caught to know if the carriage was not yet in sight molly went into the drawingroom the squire was standing in the middle of the floor awaiting herin fact longing to go out and meet her but restrained by a feeling of solemn etiquette which prevented his moving about as usual in that house of mourning he held a paper in his hands which were trembling with excitement and emotion and four or five open letters were strewed on a table near him its all true he began shes his wife and hes her husbandwas her husbandthats the word for itwas poor lad poor lad its cost him a deal pray god it wasnt my fault read this my dear its a certificate its all regularosborne hamley to marieaime schererparishchurch and all and witnessed oh dear he sate down in the nearest chair and groaned molly took a seat by him and read the legal paper the perusal of which was not needed to convince her of the fact of the marriage she held it in her hand after she had finished reading it waiting for the squires next coherent words for he kept talking to himself in broken sentences ay ay that comes o temper and crabbedness she was the only one as couldand ive been worse since she was gone worse worse and see what it has come to he was afraid of meayafraid thats the truth of itafraid and it made him keep all to himself and care killed him they may call it heartdiseaseo my lad my lad i know better now but its too latethats the sting of ittoo late too late he covered his face and moved himself backward and forward till molly could bear it no longer there are some letters said she may i read any of them at another time she would not have asked but she was driven to it now by her impatience of the speechless grief of the old man ay read em read em said he maybe you can i can only pick out a word here and there i put em there for you to look at and tell me what is in em mollys knowledge of written french of the present day was not so great as her knowledge of the french of the mmoires de sully and neither the spelling nor the writing of the letters was of the best but she managed to translate into good enough colloquial english some innocent sentences of love and submission to osbornes willas if his judgment was infallibleand of faith in his purposeslittle sentences in little language that went home to the squires heart perhaps if molly had read french more easily she might not have translated them into such touching homely broken words here and there there were expressions in english these the hungryhearted squire had read while waiting for mollys return every time she stopped he said go on he kept his face shaded and only repeated those two words at every pause she got up to find some more of aimes letters in examining the papers she came upon one in particular have you seen this sir this certificate of baptism reading aloud of roger stephen osborne hamley born june child of osborne hamley and marieaime his wife give it me said the squire his voice breaking now and stretching forth his eager hand roger thats me stephen thats my poor old father he died when he was not so old as i am but ive always thought on him as very old he was main and fond of osborne when he was quite a little one its good of the lad to have thought on my father stephen ay that was his name and osborneosborne hamley one osborne hamley lies dead on his bedand tothertother ive never seen and never heard on till today he must be called osborne molly there is a rogertheres two for that matter but one is a goodfornothing old man and theres never an osborne any more unless this little thing is called osborne well have him here and get a nurse for him and make his mother comfortable for life in her own country ill keep this molly youre a good lass for finding it osborne hamley and if god will give me grace he shall never hear a cross word from menever he shant be afeard of me oh my osborne my osborne he burst out do you know now how bitter and sore is my heart for every hard word as i ever spoke to you do you know now how i loved youmy boymy boy from the general tone of the letters molly doubted if the mother would consent so easily as the squire seemed to expect to be parted from her child the letters were not very wise perhaps though of this molly never thought but a heart full of love spoke tender words in every line still it was not for molly to talk of this doubt of hers just then but rather to dwell on the probable graces and charms of the little roger stephen osborne hamley she let the squire exhaust himself in wondering as to the particulars of every event helping him out in conjectures and both of them from their imperfect knowledge of possibilities made the most curious fantastic and improbable guesses at the truth and so that day passed over and the night came there were not many people who had any claim to be invited to the funeral and of these mr gibson and the squires hereditary man of business had taken charge but when mr gibson came early on the following morning molly referred the question to him which had suggested itself to her mind though apparently not to the squires what intimation of her loss should be sent to the widow living solitary near winchester watching and waiting if not for his coming who lay dead in his distant home at least for his letters one from her had already come in her foreign handwriting to the postoffice to which all her communications were usually sent but of course they at the hall knew nothing of this she must be told said mr gibson musing yes she must replied his daughter but how a day or two of waiting will do no harm said he almost as if he was anxious to delay the solution of the problem it will make her anxious poor thing and all sorts of gloomy possibilities will suggest themselves to her mindamongst them the truth it will be a kind of preparation for what something must be done at last said molly yes true suppose you write and say hes very ill write tomorrow i daresay theyve indulged themselves in daily postage and then shell have had three days silence you say how you come to know all you do about it i think she ought to know he is very illin great danger if you like and you can follow it up next day with the full truth i wouldnt worry the squire about it after the funeral we will have a talk about the child she will never part with it said molly whew till i see the woman i cant tell said her father some women would it will be well provided for according to what you say and she is a foreigner and may very likely wish to go back to her own people and kindred theres much to be said on both sides so you always say papa but in this case i think youll find im right i judge from her letters but i think im right so you always say daughter time will show so the child is a boy mrs gibson told me particularly to ask it will go far to reconciling her to cynthias dismissal of roger but indeed it is quite as well for both of them though of course he will be a long time before he thinks so they were not suited to each other poor roger it was hard work writing to him yesterday and who knows what may have become of him well well one has to get through the world somehow im glad however this little lad has turned up to be the heir i shouldnt have liked the property to go to the irish hamleys who are the next heirs as osborne once told me now write that letter molly to the poor little frenchwoman out yonder it will prepare her for it and we must think a bit how to spare her the shock for osbornes sake the writing this letter was rather difficult work for molly and she tore up two or three copies before she could manage it to her satisfaction and at last in despair of ever doing it better she sent it off without rereading it the next day was easier the fact of osbornes death was told briefly and tenderly but when this second letter was sent off mollys heart began to bleed for the poor creature bereft of her husband in a foreign land and he at a distance from her dead and buried without her ever having had the chance of printing his dear features on her memory by one last long lingering look with her thoughts full of the unknown aime molly talked much about her that day to the squire he would listen for ever to any conjecture however wild about the grandchild but perpetually winced away from all discourse about the frenchwoman as he called her not unkindly but to his mind she was simply the frenchwomanchattering darkeyed demonstrative and possibly even rouged he would treat her with respect as his sons widow and would try even not to think upon the female inveiglement in which he believed he would make her an allowance to the extent of his duty but he hoped and trusted he might never be called upon to see her his solicitor gibson anybody and everybody should be called upon to form a phalanx of defence against that danger and all this time a little young greyeyed woman was making her waynot towards him but towards the dead son whom as yet she believed to be her living husband she knew she was acting in defiance of his expressed wish but he had never dismayed her with any expression of his own fears about his health and she bright with life had never contemplated death coming to fetch away one so beloved he was illvery ill the letter from the strange girl said that but aime had nursed her parents and knew what illness was the french doctor had praised her skill and neathandedness as a nurse and even if she had been the clumsiest of women was he not her husbandher all and was she not his wife whose place was by his pillow so without even as much reasoning as has been here given aime made her preparations swallowing down the tears that would overflow her eyes and drop into the little trunk she was packing so neatly and by her side on the ground sate the child now nearly two years old and for him aime had always a smile and a cheerful word her servant loved her and trusted her and the woman was of an age to have had experience of humankind aime had told her that her husband was ill and the servant had known enough of the household history to be aware that as yet aime was not his acknowledged wife but she sympathized with the prompt decision of her mistress to go to him directly wherever he was caution comes from education of one kind or another and aime was not dismayed by warnings only the woman pleaded hard for the child to be left he was such company she said and he would so tire his mother in her journeyings and maybe his father would be too ill to see him to which aime replied good company for you but better for me a woman is never tired with carrying her own child which was not true but there was sufficient truth in it to make it believed by both mistress and servant and if monsieur could care for anything he would rejoice to hear the babble of his little son so aime caught the evening coach to london at the nearest crossroad martha standing by as chaperon and friend to see her off and handing her in the large lusty child already crowing with delight at the sight of the horses there was a lingerie shop kept by a frenchwoman whose acquaintance aime had made in the days when she was a london nursemaid and thither she betook herself rather than to an hotel to spend the few nighthours that intervened before the birmingham coach started at early morning she slept or watched on a sofa in the parlour for sparebed there was none but madame pauline came in betimes with a good cup of coffee for the mother and of soupe blanche for the boy and they went off again into the wide world only thinking of only seeking the him who was everything human to both aime remembered the sound of the name of the village where osborne had often told her that he alighted from the coach to walk home and though she could never have spelt the strange uncouth word yet she spoke it with pretty slow distinctness to the guard asking him in her broken english when they should arrive there not till four oclock alas and what might happen before then once with him she would have no fear she was sure that she could bring him round but what might not happen before he was in her tender care she was a very capable person in many ways though so childish and innocent in others she made up her mind to the course she should pursue when the coach set her down at feversham she asked for a man to carry her trunk and show her the way to hamley hall hamley hall said the innkeeper eh theres a deal o trouble there just now i know i know said she hastening off after the wheelbarrow in which her trunk was going and breathlessly struggling to keep up with it her heavy child asleep in her arms her pulses beat all over her body she could hardly see out of her eyes to her a foreigner the drawn blinds of the house when she came in sight of it had no significance she hurried stumbled on back door or front missus asked the boots from the inn the most nearest said she and the front door was the most nearest molly was sitting with the squire in the darkened drawingroom reading out her translations of aimes letters to her husband the squire was never weary of hearing them the very sound of mollys voice soothed and comforted him it was so sweet and low and he pulled her up much as a child does if on a second reading of the same letter she substituted one word for another the house was very still this afternoonstill as it had been now for several days every servant in it however needlessly moving about on tiptoe speaking below the breath and shutting doors as softly as might be the nearest noise or stir of active life was that of the rooks in the trees who were beginning their spring chatter of business suddenly through this quiet there came a ring at the frontdoor bell that sounded and went on sounding through the house pulled by an ignorant vigorous hand molly stopped reading she and the squire looked at each other in surprised dismay perhaps a thought of rogers sudden and impossible return was in the mind of each but neither spoke they heard robinson hurrying to answer the unwonted summons they listened but they heard no more there was little more to hear when the old servant opened the door a lady with a child in her arms stood there she gasped out her readyprepared english sentence can i see mr osborne hamley he is ill i know but i am his wife robinson had been aware that there was some mystery long suspected by the servants and come to light at last to the masterhe had guessed that there was a young woman in the case but when she stood there before him asking for her dead husband as if he were living any presence of mind robinson might have had forsook him he could not tell her the truthhe could only leave the door open and say to her wait awhile ill come back and betake himself to the drawingroom where molly was he knew he went up to her in a flutter and a hurry and whispered something to her which turned her white with dismay what is it what is it said the squire trembling with excitement dont keep it from me i can bear it roger they both thought he was going to faint he had risen up and come close to molly suspense would be worse than anything mrs osborne hamley is here said molly i wrote to tell her her husband was very ill and she has come she does not know what has happened seemingly said robinson i cant see heri cant see her said the squire shrinking away into a corner you will go molly wont you youll go molly stood for a moment or two irresolute she too shrank from the interview robinson put in his word she looks but a weakly thing and has carried a big baby choose how far i didnt stop to ask at this instant the door softly opened and right into the midst of them came the little figure in grey looking ready to fall with the weight of her child you are molly said she not seeing the squire at once the lady who wrote the letter he spoke of you sometimes you will let me go to him molly did not answer except that at such moments the eyes speak solemnly and comprehensively aime read their meaning all she said washe is notoh my husbandmy husband her arms relaxed her figure swayed the child screamed and held out his arms for help that help was given him by his grandfather just before aime fell senseless on the floor maman maman cried the little fellow now striving and fighting to get back to her where she lay he fought so lustily that the squire had to put him down and he crawled to the poor inanimate body behind which sat molly holding the head whilst robinson rushed away for water wine and more womankind illustration maman maman poor thing poor thing said the squire bending over her and crying afresh over her suffering she is but young molly and she must ha loved him dearly to be sure said molly quickly she was untying the bonnet and taking off the worn but neatly mended gloves there was the soft luxuriant black hair shading the pale innocent facethe little notablelooking brown hands with the weddingring for sole ornament the child clustered his fingers round one of hers and nestled up against her with his plaintive cry getting more and more into a burst of wailing maman maman at the growing acuteness of his imploring her hand moved her lips quivered consciousness came partially back she did not open her eyes but great heavy tears stole out from beneath her eyelashes molly held her head against her own breast and they tried to give her winewhich she shrank fromwater which she did not reject that was all at last she tried to speak take me away she said into the dark leave me alone so molly and the woman lifted her up and carried her away and laid her on the bed in the best bedchamber in the house and darkened the already shaded light she was like an unconscious corpse herself in that she offered neither assistance nor resistance to all that they were doing but just before molly was leaving the room to take up her watch outside the door she felt rather than heard that aime spoke to her foodbread and milk for baby but when they brought her food herself she only shrank away and turned her face to the wall without a word in the hurry the child had been left with robinson and the squire for some unknown but most fortunate reason he took a dislike to robinsons red face and hoarse voice and showed a most decided preference for his grandfather when molly came down she found the squire feeding the child with more of peace upon his face than there had been for all these days the boy was every now and then leaving off taking his bread and milk to show his dislike to robinson by word and gesture a proceeding which only amused the old servant while it highly delighted the more favoured squire she is lying very still but she will neither speak nor eat i dont even think she is crying said molly volunteering this account for the squire was for the moment too much absorbed in his grandson to ask many questions robinson put in his word dick hayward hes boots at the hamley arms says the coach she come by started at five this morning from london and the passengers said shed been crying a deal on the road when she thought folks were not noticing and she never came in to meals with the rest but stopped feeding her child shell be tired out we must let her rest said the squire and i do believe this little chap is going to sleep in my arms god bless him but molly stole out and sent off a lad to hollingford with a note to her father her heart had warmed towards the poor stranger and she felt uncertain as to what ought to be the course pursued in her case she went up from time to time to look at the girl scarce older than herself who lay there with her eyes open but as motionless as death she softly covered her over and let her feel the sympathetic presence from time to time and that was all she was allowed to do the squire was curiously absorbed in the child but mollys supreme tenderness was for the mother not but what she admired the sturdy gallant healthy little fellow whose every limb and square inch of clothing showed the tender and thrifty care that had been taken of him byandby the squire said in a whisper shes not like a frenchwoman is she molly i dont know i dont know what frenchwomen are like people say cynthia is french and she didnt look like a servant we wont speak of cynthia since shes served my roger so why i began to think as soon as i could think after that how i would make roger and her happy and have them married at once and then came that letter i never wanted her for a daughterinlaw not i but he did it seems and he wasnt one for wanting many things for himself but its all over now only we wont talk of her and maybe as you say she was more french than english this poor thing looks like a gentlewoman i think i hope shes got friends wholl take care of hershe cant be above twenty i thought she must be older than my poor lad shes a gentle pretty creature said molly butbut i sometimes think it has killed her she lies like one dead and molly could not keep from crying softly at the thought nay nay said the squire its not so easy to break ones heart sometimes ive wished it were but one has to go on livingall the appointed days as it says in the bible but well do our best for her well not think of letting her go away till shes fit to travel molly wondered in her heart about this going away on which the squire seemed fully resolved she was sure that he intended to keep the child perhaps he had a legal right to do sobut would the mother ever part from it her father however would solve the difficultyher father whom she always looked to as so clearseeing and experienced she watched and waited for his coming the february evening drew on the child lay asleep in the squires arms till his grandfather grew tired and laid him down on the sofa the large squarecornered yellow sofa upon which mrs hamley used to sit supported by pillows in a halfreclining position since her time it had been placed against the wall and had served merely as a piece of furniture to fill up the room but once again a human figure was lying upon it a little human creature like a cherub in some old italian picture the squire remembered his wife as he put the child down he thought of her as he said to molly how pleased she would have been but molly thought of the poor young widow upstairs aime was her she at the first moment presentlybut it seemed a long long time firstshe heard the quick prompt sounds which told of her fathers arrival in he cameto the room as yet only lighted by the fitful blaze of the fire chapter liv molly gibsons worth is discovered mr gibson came in rubbing his hands after his frosty ride molly judged from the look in his eye that he had been fully informed of the present state of things at the hall by some one but he simply went up to and greeted the squire and waited to hear what was said to him the squire was fumbling at the taper on the writingtable and before he answered much he lighted it and signing to his friend to follow him he went softly to the sofa and showed him the sleeping child taking the utmost care not to arouse it by flare or sound well this is a fine young gentleman said mr gibson returning to the fire rather sooner than the squire expected and youve got the mother here i understand mrs osborne hamley as we must call her poor thing its a sad coming home to her for i hear she knew nothing of his death he spoke without exactly addressing any one so that either molly or the squire might answer as they liked the squire said yes shes felt it a terrible shock shes upstairs in the best bedroom i should like you to see her gibson if shell let you we must do our duty by her for my poor lads sake i wish he could have seen his boy lying there i do i daresay it preyed on him to have to keep it all to himself he might ha known me though he might ha known my bark was waur than my bite its all over now though and god forgive me if i was too sharp im punished now molly grew impatient on the mothers behalf papa i feel as if she was very ill perhaps worse than we think will you go and see her at once mr gibson followed her upstairs and the squire came too thinking that he would do his duty now and even feeling some selfsatisfaction at conquering his desire to stay with the child they went into the room where she had been taken she lay quite still in the same position as at first her eyes were open and tearless fixed on the wall mr gibson spoke to her but she did not answer he lifted her hand to feel her pulse she never noticed bring me some wine at once and order some beeftea he said to molly but when he tried to put the wine into her mouth as she lay there on her side she made no effort to receive or swallow it and it ran out upon the pillow mr gibson left the room abruptly molly chafed the little inanimate hand the squire stood by in dumb dismay touched in spite of himself by the deathinlife of one so young and who must have been so much beloved mr gibson came back two steps at a time he was carrying the halfawakened child in his arms he did not scruple to rouse him into yet further wakefulnessdid not grieve to hear him begin to wail and cry his eyes were on the figure upon the bed which at that sound quivered all through and when her child was laid at her back and began caressingly to scramble yet closer aime turned round and took him in her arms and lulled him and soothed him with the soft wont of mothers love before she lost this faint consciousness which was habit or instinct rather than thought mr gibson spoke to her in french the childs one word of maman had given him this clue it was the language sure to be most intelligible to her dulled brain and as it happenedonly mr gibson did not think of thatit was the language in which she had been commanded and had learnt to obey mr gibsons tongue was a little stiff at first but byandby he spoke it with all his old readiness he extorted from her short answers at first then longer ones and from time to time he plied her with little drops of wine until some further nourishment should be at hand molly was struck by her fathers low tones of comfort and sympathy although she could not follow what was said quickly enough to catch the meaning of what passed byandby however when her father had done all that he could and they were once more downstairs he told them more about her journey than they yet knew the hurry the sense of acting in defiance of a prohibition the overmastering anxiety the broken night and fatigue of the journey had ill prepared her for the shock at last and mr gibson was seriously alarmed for the consequences she had wandered strangely in her replies to him he had perceived that she was wandering and had made great efforts to recall her senses but mr gibson foresaw that some bodily illness was coming on and stopped late that night arranging many things with molly and the squire onethe onlycomfort arising from her state was the probability that she would be entirely unconscious by the morrowthe day of the funeral worn out by the contending emotions of the day the squire seemed now unable to look beyond the wrench and trial of the next twelve hours he sate with his head in his hands declining to go to bed refusing to dwell on the thought of his grandchildnot three hours ago such a darling in his eyes mr gibson gave some instructions to one of the maidservants as to the watch she was to keep by mrs osborne hamley and insisted on mollys going to bed when she pleaded the apparent necessity of her staying up he said now molly look how much less trouble the dear old squire would give if he would obey orders he is only adding to anxiety by indulging himself one pardons everything to extreme grief however but you will have enough to do to occupy all your strength for days to come and go to bed you must now i only wish i saw my way as clearly through other things as i do to your nearest duty i wish id never let roger go wandering off hell wish it too poor fellow did i tell you cynthia is going off in hot haste to her uncle kirkpatricks i suspect a visit to him will stand in lieu of going out to russia as a governess i am sure she was quite serious in wishing for that yes yes at the time ive no doubt she thought she was sincere in intending to go but the great thing was to get out of the unpleasantness of the present time and place and uncle kirkpatricks will do this as effectually and more pleasantly than a situation at nishninovgorod in an icepalace he had given mollys thoughts a turn which was what he wanted to do molly could not help remembering mr henderson and his offer and all the consequent hints and wondering and wishingwhat did she wish or had she been falling asleep before she had quite ascertained this point she was asleep in reality after this long days passed over in a monotonous round of care for no one seemed to think of mollys leaving the hall during the woeful illness that befell mrs osborne hamley it was not that her father allowed her to take much active part in the nursing the squire gave him carteblanche and he engaged two efficient hospital nurses to watch over the unconscious aime but molly was needed to receive the finer directions as to her treatment and diet it was not that she was wanted for the care of the little boy the squire was too jealous of the childs exclusive love for that and one of the housemaids was employed in the actual physical charge of him but he needed some one to listen to his incontinence of language both when his passionate regret for his dead son came uppermost and also when he had discovered some extraordinary charm in that sons child and again when he was oppressed with the uncertainty of aimes longcontinued illness molly was not so good or so bewitching a listener to ordinary conversation as cynthia but where her heart was interested her sympathy was deep and unfailing in this case she only wished that the squire could really feel that aime was not the encumbrance which he evidently considered her to be not that he would have acknowledged the fact if it had been put before him in plain words he fought against the dim consciousness of what was in his mind he spoke repeatedly of patience when no one but himself was impatient he would often say that when she grew better she must not be allowed to leave the hall until she was perfectly strong when no one was even contemplating the remotest chance of her leaving her child excepting only himself molly once or twice asked her father if she might not speak to the squire and represent the hardship of sending her awaythe improbability that she would consent to quit her boy and so on but mr gibson only replied wait quietly time enough when nature and circumstance have had their chance and have failed it was well that molly was such a favourite with the old servants for she had frequently to restrain and to control to be sure she had her fathers authority to back her and they were aware that where her own comfort ease or pleasure was concerned she never interfered but submitted to their will if the squire had known of the want of attendance to which she submitted with the most perfect meekness as far as she herself was the only sufferer he would have gone into a towering rage but molly hardly thought of it so anxious was she to do all she could for others and to remember the various charges which her father gave her in his daily visits perhaps he did not spare her enough she was willing and uncomplaining but one day after mrs osborne hamley had taken the turn as the nurses called it when she was lying weak as a newborn baby but with her faculties all restored and her fever gonewhen spring buds were blooming out and spring birds sang merrilymolly answered to her fathers sudden questioning that she felt unaccountably weary that her head ached heavily and that she was aware of a sluggishness of thought which it required a painful effort to overcome dont go on said mr gibson with a quick pang of anxiety almost of remorse lie down herewith your back to the light ill come back and see you before i go and off he went in search of the squire he had a good long walk before he came upon mr hamley in a field of spring wheat where the women were weeding his little grandson holding to his finger in the intervals of short walks of inquiry into the dirtiest places which was all his sturdy little limbs could manage well gibson and how goes the patient better i wish we could get her out of doors such a fine day as it is it would make her strong as soon as anything i used to beg my poor lad to come out more maybe i worried him but the air is the finest thing for strengthening that i know of though perhaps shell not thrive in english air as if shed been born here and shell not be quite right till she gets back to her native place wherever that is i dont know i begin to think we shall get her quite round here and i dont know that she could be in a better place but its not about her may i order the carriage for my molly mr gibsons voice sounded as if he was choking a little as he said these last words to be sure said the squire setting the child down he had been holding him in his arms the last few minutes but now he wanted all his eyes to look into mr gibsons face i say said he catching hold of mr gibsons arm whats the matter man dont twitch up your face like that but speak nothings the matter said mr gibson hastily only i want her at home under my own eye and he turned away to go to the house but the squire left his field and his weeders and kept at mr gibsons side he wanted to speak but his heart was so full he did not know what to say i say gibson he got out at last your molly is liker a child of mine than a stranger and i reckon weve all on us been coming too hard upon her you dont think theres much amiss do you how can i tell said mr gibson almost savagely but any hastiness of temper was instinctively understood by the squire and he was not offended though he did not speak again till they reached the house then he went to order the carriage and stood by sorrowful enough while the horses were being put in he felt as if he should not know what to do without molly he had never known her value he thought till now but he kept silence on this view of the case which was a praiseworthy effort on the part of one who usually let bystanders see and hear as much of his passing feelings as if he had had a window in his breast he stood by while mr gibson helped the faintlysmiling tearful molly into the carriage then the squire mounted on the step and kissed her hand but when he tried to thank her and bless her he broke down and as soon as he was once more safely on the ground mr gibson cried out to the coachman to drive on and so molly left hamley hall from time to time her father rode up to the window and made some little cheerful and apparently careless remark when they came within two miles of hollingford he put spurs to his horse and rode briskly past the carriage windows kissing his hand to the occupant as he did so he went on to prepare her home for molly when she arrived mrs gibson was ready to greet her mr gibson had given one or two of his bright imperative orders and mrs gibson was feeling rather lonely without either of her two dear girls at home as she phrased it to herself as well as to others why my sweet molly this is an unexpected pleasure only this morning i said to papa when do you think we shall see our molly back he did not say muchhe never does you know but i am sure he thought directly of giving me this surprise this pleasure youre looking a littlewhat shall i call it i remember such a pretty line of poetry oh call her fair not paleso well call you fair youd better not call her anything but let her get to her own room and have a good rest as soon as possible havent you got a trashy novel or two in the house thats the literature to send her to sleep he did not leave her till he had seen her laid on a sofa in a darkened room with some slight pretence of reading in her hand then he came away leading his wife who turned round at the door to kiss her hand to molly and make a little face of unwillingness to be dragged away now hyacinth said he as he took his wife into the drawingroom she will need much care she has been overworked and ive been a fool thats all we must keep her from all worry and carebut i wont answer for it that shell not have an illness for all that poor thing she does look worn out she is something like me her feelings are too much for her but now she is come home she shall find us as cheerful as possible i can answer for myself and you really must brighten up your doleful face my dearnothing so bad for invalids as the appearance of depression in those around them i have had such a pleasant letter from cynthia today uncle kirkpatrick really seems to make so much of her he treats her just like a daughter he has given her a ticket to the concerts of ancient music and mr henderson has been to call on her in spite of all that has gone before for an instant mr gibson thought that it was easy enough for his wife to be cheerful with the pleasant thoughts and evident anticipations she had in her mind but a little more difficult for him to put off his doleful looks while his own child lay in a state of suffering and illness which might be the precursor of a still worse malady but he was always a man for immediate action as soon as he had resolved on the course to be taken and he knew that some must watch while some must sleep so runs the world away the illness which he apprehended came upon molly not violently or acutely so that there was any immediate danger to be dreaded but making a long pull upon her strength which seemed to lessen day by day until at last her father feared that she might become a permanent invalid there was nothing very decided or alarming to tell cynthia and mrs gibson kept the dark side from her in her letters molly was feeling the spring weather or molly had been a good deal overdone with her stay at the hall and was resting such little sentences told nothing of mollys real state but then as mrs gibson said to herself it would be a pity to disturb cynthias pleasure by telling her much about molly indeed there was not much to tell one day was so like another but it so happened that lady harrietwho came whenever she could to sit awhile with molly at first against mrs gibsons will and afterwards with her full consentfor reasons of her own lady harriet wrote a letter to cynthia to which she was urged by mrs gibson it fell out in this mannerone day when lady harriet was sitting in the drawingroom for a few minutes after she had been with molly she said really clare i spend so much time in your house that im going to establish a workbasket here mary has infected me with her notability and im going to work mamma a footstool it is to be a surprise and so if i do it here she will know nothing about it only i cannot match the gold beads i want for the pansies in this dear little town and hollingford who could send me down stars and planets if i asked him i make no doubt could no more match beads than my dear lady harriet you forget cynthia think what a pleasure it would be to her to do anything for you would it then she shall have plenty of it but mind it is you who have answered for her she shall get me some wool too how good i am to confer so much pleasure on a fellowcreature but seriously do you think i might write and give her a few commissions neither agnes nor mary are in town i am sure she would be delighted said mrs gibson who also took into consideration the reflection of aristocratic honour that would fall upon cynthia if she had a letter from lady harriet while at mr kirkpatricks so she gave the address and lady harriet wrote all the first part of the letter was taken up with apology and commissions but then never doubting but that cynthia was aware of mollys state she went on to say i saw molly this morning twice i have been forbidden admittance as she was too ill to see any one out of her own family i wish we could begin to perceive a change for the better but she looks more fading every time and i fear mr gibson considers it a very anxious case the day but one after this letter was despatched cynthia walked into the drawingroom at home with as much apparent composure as if she had left it not an hour before mrs gibson was dozing but believing herself to be reading she had been with molly the greater part of the morning and now after her lunch and the invalids pretence of early dinner she considered herself entitled to some repose she started up as cynthia came in cynthia dear child where have you come from why in the world have you come my poor nerves my heart is quite fluttering but to be sure its no wonder with all this anxiety i have to undergo why have you come back because of the anxiety you speak of mamma i never knewyou never told me how ill molly was nonsense i beg your pardon my dear but its really nonsense mollys illness is only nervous mr gibson says a nervous fever but you must remember nerves are mere fancy and shes getting better such a pity for you to have left your uncles who told you about molly lady harriet she wrote about some wool i knowi know but you might have known she always exaggerates things not but what i have been almost worn out with nursing perhaps after all it is a very good thing you have come my dear and now you shall come down into the diningroom and have some lunch and tell me all the hyde park street newsinto my roomdont go into yours yetmolly is so sensitive to noise while cynthia ate her lunch mrs gibson went on questioning and your aunt how is her cold and helen quite strong again margaretta as pretty as ever the boys are at harrow i suppose and my old favourite mr henderson she could not manage to slip in this last inquiry naturally in spite of herself there was a change of tone an accent of eagerness cynthia did not reply on the instant she poured herself out some water with great deliberation and then said my aunt is quite well helen is as strong as she ever is and margaretta very pretty the boys are at harrow and i conclude that mr henderson is enjoying his usual health for he was to dine at my uncles today take care cynthia look how you are cutting that gooseberry tart said mrs gibson with sharp annoyance not provoked by cynthias present action although it gave excuse for a little vent of temper i cant think how you could come off in this sudden kind of way i am sure it must have annoyed your uncle and aunt i daresay theyll never ask you again on the contrary i am to go back there as soon as ever i can be easy to leave molly easy to leave molly now that really is nonsense and rather uncomplimentary to me i must say nursing her as i have been doing daily and almost nightly for i have been wakened times out of number by mr gibson getting up and going to see if she had had her medicine properly im afraid she has been very ill asked cynthia yes she has in one way but not in another it was what i call more a tedious than an interesting illness there was no immediate danger but she lay much in the same state from day to day i wish i had known sighed cynthia do you think i might go and see her now ill go and prepare her youll find her a good deal better than she has been ah heres mr gibson he came into the diningroom hearing voices cynthia thought that he looked much older you here said he coming forward to shake hands why how did you come by the umpire i never knew molly had been so ill or i would have come directly her eyes were full of tears mr gibson was touched he shook her hand again and murmured youre a good girl cynthia shes heard one of dear lady harriets exaggerated accounts said mrs gibson and come straight off i tell her its very foolish for molly is a great deal better now very foolish said mr gibson echoing his wifes words but smiling at cynthia but sometimes one likes foolish people for their folly better than wise people for their wisdom i am afraid folly always annoys me said his wife however cynthia is here and what is done is done very true my dear and now ill run up and see my little girl and tell her the good news youd better follow me in a couple of minutes this to cynthia mollys delight at seeing her showed itself first in a few happy tears and then in soft caresses and inarticulate sounds of love once or twice she began it is such a pleasure and there she stopped short but the eloquence of these five words sank deep into cynthias heart she had returned just at the right time when molly wanted the gentle fillip of the society of a fresh and yet a familiar person cynthias tact made her talkative or silent gay or grave as the varying humour of molly required she listened too with the semblance if not the reality of unwearied interest to mollys continual recurrence to all the time of distress and sorrow at hamley hall and to the scenes which had then so deeply impressed themselves upon her susceptible nature cynthia instinctively knew that the repetition of all these painful recollections would ease the oppressed memory which refused to dwell on anything but what had occurred at a time of feverish disturbance of health so she never interrupted molly as mrs gibson had so frequently done withyou told me all that before my dear let us talk of something else or really i cannot allow you to be always dwelling on painful thoughts try and be a little more cheerful youth is gay you are young and therefore you ought to be gay that is put in a famous form of speech i forget exactly what it is called so mollys health and spirits improved rapidly after cynthias return and although she was likely to retain many of her invalid habits during the summer she was able to take drives and enjoy the fine weather it was only her as yet tender spirits that required a little management all the hollingford people forgot that they had ever thought of her except as a darling of the town and each in his or her way showed kind interest in her fathers child miss browning and miss phoebe considered it quite a privilege that they were allowed to see her a fortnight or three weeks before any one else mrs goodenough spectacles on nose stirred dainty messes in a silver saucepan for mollys benefit the towers sent books and forced fruit and new caricatures and strange and delicate poultry humble patients of the doctor as mr gibson was usually termed left the earliest cauliflowers they could grow in their cottage gardens with their duty for miss and last of all though strongest in regard most piteously eager in interest came squire hamley himself when she was at the worst he rode over every day to hear the smallest detail facing even mrs gibson his abomination if her husband was not at home to ask and hear and ask and hear till the tears were unconsciously stealing down his cheeks every resource of his heart or his house or his lands was searched and tried if it could bring a moments pleasure to her and whatever it might be that came from him at her very worst time it brought out a dim smile upon her face chapter lv an absent lover returns illustration untitled and now it was late june and to mollys and her fathers extreme urgency in pushing and mr and mrs kirkpatricks affectionate persistency in pulling cynthia had yielded and had gone back to finish her interrupted visit in london but not before the bruit of her previous sudden return to nurse molly had told strongly in her favour in the fluctuating opinion of the little town her affair with mr preston was thrust into the shade while every one was speaking of her warm heart under the gleam of mollys recovery everything assumed a rosy hue as indeed became the time when actual roses were fully in bloom one morning mrs gibson brought molly a great basket of flowers that had been sent from the hall molly still breakfasted in bed but she had just come down and was now well enough to arrange the flowers for the drawingroom and as she did so with these blossoms she made some comments on each ah these white pinks they were mrs hamleys favourite flower and so like her this little bit of sweet briar it quite scents the room it has pricked my fingers but never mind oh mamma look at this rose i forget its name but it is very rare and grows up in the sheltered corner of the wall near the mulberrytree roger bought the tree for his mother with his own money when he was quite a boy he showed it me and made me notice it i daresay it was roger who got it now you heard papa say he had seen him yesterday no roger roger come home said molly turning first red then very white yes oh i remember you had gone to bed before papa came in and he was called off early to tiresome mrs beale yes roger turned up at the hall the day before yesterday but molly leaned back against her chair too faint to do more at the flowers for some time she had been startled by the suddenness of the news roger come home it happened that mr gibson was unusually busy on this particular day and he did not come home till late in the afternoon but molly kept her place in the drawingroom all the time not even going to take her customary siesta so anxious was she to hear everything about rogers return which as yet appeared to her almost incredible but it was quite natural in reality the long monotony of her illness had made her lose all count of time when roger left england his idea was to coast round africa on the eastern side until he reached the cape and thence to make what further journey or voyage might seem to him best in pursuit of his scientific objects to cape town all his letters had been addressed of late and there two months before he had received the intelligence of osbornes death as well as cynthias hasty letter of relinquishment he did not consider that he was doing wrong in returning to england immediately and reporting himself to the gentlemen who had sent him out with a full explanation of the circumstances relating to osbornes private marriage and sudden death he offered and they accepted his offer to go out again for any time that they might think equivalent to the five months he was yet engaged to them for they were most of them gentlemen of property and saw the full importance of proving the marriage of an eldest son and installing his child as the natural heir to a longdescended estate this much information but in a more condensed form mr gibson gave to molly in a very few minutes she sat up on her sofa looking very pretty with the flush on her cheeks and the brightness in her eyes well said she when her father stopped speaking well what asked he playfully oh why such a number of things ive been waiting all day to ask you all about everything how is he looking if a young man of twentyfour ever does take to growing taller i should say that he was taller as it is i suppose its only that he looks broader strongermore muscular oh is he changed asked molly a little disturbed by this account no not changed and yet not the same hes as brown as a berry for one thing caught a little of the negro tinge and a beard as fine and sweeping as my baymares tail a beard but go on papa does he talk as he used to do i should know his voice amongst ten thousand i didnt catch any hottentot twang if thats what you mean nor did he say csar and pompey berry much alike specially pompey which is the only specimen of negro language i can remember just at this moment and which i never could see the wit of said mrs gibson who had come into the room after the conversation had begun and did not understand what it was aiming at molly fidgeted she wanted to go on with her questions and keep her father to definite and matteroffact answers and she knew that when his wife chimed into a conversation mr gibson was very apt to find out that he must go about some necessary piece of business tell me how are they all getting on together it was an inquiry which she did not make in general before mrs gibson for molly and her father had tacitly agreed to keep silence on what they knew or had observed respecting the three who formed the present family at the hall oh said mr gibson roger is evidently putting everything to rights in his firm quiet way things to rights why whats wrong asked mrs gibson quickly the squire and the french daughterinlaw dont get on well together i suppose i am always so glad cynthia acted with the promptitude she did it would have been very awkward for her to have been mixed up with all these complications poor roger to find himself supplanted by a child when he comes home you were not in the room my dear when i was telling molly of the reasons for rogers return it was to put his brothers child at once into his rightful and legal place so now when he finds the work partly done to his hands he is happy and gratified in proportion then he is not much affected by cynthias breaking off her engagement mrs gibson could afford to call it an engagement now i never did give him credit for very deep feelings on the contrary he feels it very acutely he and i had a long talk about it yesterday both molly and mrs gibson would have liked to have heard something more about this conversation but mr gibson did not choose to go on with the subject the only point which he disclosed was that roger had insisted on his right to have a personal interview with cynthia and on hearing that she was in london at present had deferred any further explanation or expostulation by letter preferring to await her return molly went on with her questions on other subjects and mrs osborne hamley how is she wonderfully brightened up by rogers presence i dont think ive ever seen her smile before but she gives him the sweetest smiles from time to time they are evidently good friends and she loses her strange startled look when she speaks to him i suspect she has been quite aware of the squires wish that she should return to france and has been hard put to it to decide whether to leave her child or not the idea that she would have to make some such decision came upon her when she was completely shattered by grief and illness and she hasnt had any one to consult as to her duty until roger came upon whom she has evidently firm reliance he told me something of this himself you seem to have had quite a long conversation with him papa yes i was going to see old abraham when the squire called to me over the hedge as i was jogging along he told me the news and there was no resisting his invitation to come back and lunch with them besides one gets a great deal of meaning out of rogers words it didnt take so very long a time to hear this much i should think he would come and call upon us soon said mrs gibson to molly and then we shall see how much we can manage to hear do you think he will papa said molly more doubtfully she remembered the last time he was in that very room and the hopes with which he left it and she fancied that she could see traces of this thought in her fathers countenance at his wifes speech i cant tell my dear until hes quite convinced of cynthias intentions it cant be very pleasant for him to come on mere visits of ceremony to the house in which he has known her but hes one who will always do what he thinks right whether pleasant or not mrs gibson could hardly wait till her husband had finished his sentence before she testified against a part of it convinced of cynthias intentions i should think she had made them pretty clear what more does the man want hes not as yet convinced that the letter wasnt written in a fit of temporary feeling ive told him that this was true although i didnt feel it my place to explain to him the causes of that feeling he believes that he can induce her to resume the former footing i dont and ive told him so but of course he needs the full conviction that she alone can give him poor cynthia my poor child said mrs gibson plaintively what she has exposed herself to by letting herself be overpersuaded by that man mr gibsons eyes flashed fire but he kept his lips tight closed and only said that man indeed quite below his breath molly too had been damped by an expression or two in her fathers speech mere visits of ceremony was it so indeed a mere visit of ceremony whatever it was the call was paid before many days were over that he felt all the awkwardness of his position towards mrs gibsonthat he was in reality suffering pain all the timewas but too evident to molly but of course mrs gibson saw nothing of this in her gratification at the proper respect paid to her by one whose name was in the newspapers that chronicled his return and about whom already lord cumnor and the towers family had been making inquiry molly was sitting in her pretty white invalids dress half reading half dreaming for the june air was so clear and ambient the garden so full of bloom the trees so full of leaf that reading by the open window was only a pretence at such a time besides which mrs gibson continually interrupted her with remarks about the pattern of her worsted work it was after lunchorthodox calling time when maria ushered in mr roger hamley molly started up and then stood shyly and quietly in her place while a bronzed bearded grave man came into the room in whom she at first had to seek for the merry boyish face she knew by heart only two years ago but months in the climates in which roger had been travelling age as much as years in more temperate regions and constant thought and anxiety while in daily peril of life deepen the lines of character upon the face moreover the circumstances that had of late affected him personally were not of a nature to make him either buoyant or cheerful but his voice was the same that was the first point of the old friend molly caught when he addressed her in a tone far softer than he used in speaking conventional politenesses to her stepmother i was so sorry to hear how ill you had been you are looking but delicate letting his eyes rest upon her face with affectionate examination molly felt herself colour all over with the consciousness of his regard to do something to put an end to it she looked up and showed him her beautiful soft grey eyes which he never remembered to have noticed before she smiled at him as she blushed still deeper and said oh i am quite strong now to what i was it would be a shame to be ill when everything is in its full summer beauty i have heard how deeply wei am indebted to youmy father can hardly praise you please dont said molly the tears coming into her eyes in spite of herself he seemed to understand her at once he went on as if speaking to mrs gibson indeed my little sisterinlaw is never weary of talking about monsieur le docteur as she calls your husband i have not had the pleasure of making mrs osborne hamleys acquaintance yet said mrs gibson suddenly aware of a duty which might have been expected from her and i must beg you to apologize to her for my remissness but molly has been such a care and anxiety to mefor you know i look upon her quite as my own childthat i really have not gone anywhere excepting to the towers perhaps i should say which is just like another home to me and then i understood that mrs osborne hamley was thinking of returning to france before long still it was very remiss the little trap thus set for news of what might be going on in the hamley family was quite successful roger answered her thus i am sure mrs osborne hamley will be very glad to see any friends of the family as soon as she is a little stronger i hope she will not go back to france at all she is an orphan and i trust we shall induce her to remain with my father but at present nothing is arranged then as if glad to have got over his visit of ceremony he got up and took leave when he was at the door he looked back having as he thought a word more to say but he quite forgot what it was for he surprised mollys intent gaze and sudden confusion at discovery and went away as soon as he could poor osborne was right said he she has grown into delicate fragrant beauty just as he said she would or is it the character which has formed her face now the next time i enter these doors it will be to learn my fate mr gibson had told his wife of rogers desire to have a personal interview with cynthia rather with a view to her repeating what he said to her daughter he did not see any exact necessity for this it is true but he thought it might be advisable that she should know all the truth in which she was concerned and he told his wife this but she took the affair into her own management and although she apparently agreed with mr gibson she never named the affair to cynthia all that she said to her was your old admirer roger hamley has come home in a great hurry in consequence of poor dear osbornes unexpected decease he must have been rather surprised to find the widow and her little boy established at the hall he came to call here the other day and made himself really rather agreeable although his manners are not improved by the society he has kept on his travels still i prophesy he will be considered as a fashionable lion and perhaps the very uncouthness which jars against my sense of refinement may even become admired in a scientific traveller who has been into more desert places and eaten more extraordinary food than any other englishman of the day i suppose he has given up all chance of inheriting the estate for i hear he talks of returning to africa and becoming a regular wanderer your name was not mentioned but i believe he inquired about you from mr gibson there said she to herself as she folded up and directed her letter that cant disturb her or make her uncomfortable and its all the truth too or very near it of course hell want to see her when she comes back but by that time i do hope mr henderson will have proposed again and that that affair will be all settled but cynthia returned to hollingford one tuesday morning and in answer to her mothers anxious inquiries on the subject would only say that mr henderson had not offered again why should he she had refused him once and he did not know the reason of her refusal at least one of the reasons she did not know if she should have taken him if there had been no such person as roger hamley in the world no uncle and aunt kirkpatrick had never heard anything about rogers offernor had her cousins she had always declared her wish to keep it a secret and she had not mentioned it to any one whatever other people might have done underneath this light and careless vein there were other feelings but mrs gibson was not one to probe beneath the surface she had set her heart on mr hendersons marrying cynthia very early in their acquaintance and to know firstly that the same wish had entered into his head and that rogers attachment to cynthia with its consequences had been the obstacle and secondly that cynthia herself with all the opportunities of propinquity which she had lately had had failed to provoke a repetition of the offerwas as mrs gibson said enough to provoke a saint all the rest of the day she alluded to cynthia as a disappointing and ungrateful daughter molly could not make out why and resented it for cynthia until the latter said bitterly never mind molly mamma is only vexed because mrbecause i have not come back an engaged young lady yes and i am sure you might have donetheres the ingratitude i am not so unjust as to want you to do what you cant do said mrs gibson querulously but wheres the ingratitude mamma im very much tired and perhaps that makes me stupid but i cannot see the ingratitude cynthia spoke very wearily leaning her head back on the sofacushions as if she did not care to have an answer why dont you see we are doing all we can for you dressing you well and sending you to london and when you might relieve us of the expense of all this you dont no cynthia i will speak said molly all crimson with indignation and pushing away cynthias restraining hand i am sure papa does not feel and does not mind any expense he incurs about his daughters and i know quite well that he does not wish us to marry unless she faltered and stopped unless what said mrs gibson halfmocking unless we love some one very dearly indeed said molly in a low firm tone well after this tiradereally rather indelicate i must sayi have done i will neither help nor hinder any loveaffairs of you two young ladies in my days we were glad of the advice of our elders and she left the room to put into fulfilment an idea which had just struck her to write a confidential letter to mrs kirkpatrick giving her her version of cynthias unfortunate entanglement and delicate sense of honour and hints of her entire indifference to all the masculine portion of the world mr henderson being dexterously excluded from the category oh dear said molly throwing herself back in a chair with a sigh of relief as mrs gibson left the room how cross i do get since ive been ill but i couldnt bear her to speak as if papa grudged you anything im sure he doesnt molly you need not defend him on my account but im sorry mamma still looks upon me as an encumbrance as the advertisements in the times always call us unfortunate children but ive been an encumbrance to her all my life im getting very much into despair about everything molly i shall try my luck in russia ive heard of a situation as english governess at moscow in a family owning whole provinces of land and serfs by the hundred i put off writing my letter till i came home i shall be as much out of the way there as if i was married oh dear travelling all night isnt good for the spirits how is mr preston oh he has taken cumnor grange three miles away and he never comes in to the hollingford teaparties now i saw him once in the street but its a question which of us tried the hardest to get out of the others way youve not said anything about roger yet no i didnt know if you would care to hear he is very much olderlooking quite a strong grownup man and papa says he is much graver ask me any questions if you want to know but i have only seen him once i was in hopes he would have left the neighbourhood by this time mamma said he was going to travel again i cant tell said molly i suppose you know she continued but hesitating a little before she spoke that he wishes to see you no i never heard i wish he would have been satisfied with my letter it was as decided as i could make it if i say i wont see him i wonder if his will or mine will be the strongest his said molly but you must see him you owe it to him he will never be satisfied without it suppose he talks me round into resuming the engagement i should only break it off again surely you cant be talked round if your mind is made up but perhaps it is not really cynthia asked she with a little wistful anxiety betraying itself in her face it is quite made up i am going to teach little russian girls and am never going to marry nobody you are not serious cynthia and yet it is a very serious thing but cynthia went into one of her wild moods and no more reason or sensible meaning was to be got out of her at the time chapter lvi off with the old love and on with the new the next morning saw mrs gibson in a much more contented frame of mind she had written and posted her letter and the next thing was to keep cynthia in what she called a reasonable state or in other words to try and cajole her into docility but it was so much labour lost cynthia had already received a letter from mr henderson before she came down to breakfasta declaration of love a proposal of marriage as clear as words could make it together with an intimation that unable to wait for the slow delays of the post he was going to follow her down to hollingford and would arrive at the same time that she had done herself on the previous day cynthia said nothing about this letter to any one she came late into the breakfastroom after mr and mrs gibson had finished the actual business of the meal but her unpunctuality was quite accounted for by the fact that she had been travelling all the night before molly was not as yet strong enough to get up so early cynthia hardly spoke and did not touch her food mr gibson went about his daily business and cynthia and her mother were left alone my dear said mrs gibson you are not eating your breakfast as you should do i am afraid our meals seem very plain and homely to you after those in hyde park street no said cynthia im not hungry thats all if we were as rich as your uncle i should feel it to be both a duty and a pleasure to keep an elegant table but limited means are a sad clog to ones wishes i dont suppose that work as he will mr gibson can earn more than he does at present while the capabilities of the law are boundless lord chancellor titles as well as fortune cynthia was almost too much absorbed in her own reflections to reply but she did sayhundreds of briefless barristers take the other side mamma well but i have noticed that many of these have private fortunes perhaps mamma i expect mr henderson will come and call this morning oh my precious child but how do you know my darling cynthia am i to congratulate you no i suppose i must tell you i have had a letter this morning from him and hes coming down by the umpire today but he has offered he surely must mean to offer at any rate cynthia played with her teaspoon before she replied then she looked up like one startled from a dream and caught the echo of her mothers question offered yes i suppose he has and you accept him say yes cynthia and make me happy i shant say yes to make any one happy except myself and the russian scheme has great charms for me she said this to plague her mother and lessen mrs gibsons exuberance of joy it must be confessed for her mind was pretty well made up but it did not affect mrs gibson who affixed even less truth to it than there really was the idea of a residence in a new strange country among new strange people was not without allurement to cynthia you always look nice dear but dont you think you had better put on that pretty lilac silk i shall not vary a thread or a shred from what i have got on now you dear wilful creature you know you always look lovely in whatever you put on so kissing her daughter mrs gibson left the room intent on the lunch which should impress mr henderson at once with an idea of family refinement cynthia went upstairs to molly she was inclined to tell her about mr henderson but she found it impossible to introduce the subject naturally so she left it to time to reveal the future as gradually as it might molly was tired with a bad night and her father in his flying visit to his darling before going out had advised her to stay upstairs for the greater part of the morning and to keep quiet in her own room till after her early dinner so time had not a fair chance of telling her what he had in store in his budget mrs gibson sent an apology to molly for not paying her her usual morning visit and told cynthia to give mr hendersons probable coming as a reason for her occupation downstairs but cynthia did no such thing she kissed molly and sate silently by her holding her hand till at length she jumped up and said you shall be left alone now little one i want you to be very well and very bright this afternoon so rest now and cynthia left her and went to her own room locked the door and began to think some one was thinking about her at the same time and it was not mr henderson roger had heard from mr gibson that cynthia had come home and he was resolving to go to her at once and have one strong manly attempt to overcome the obstacles whatever they might beand of their nature he was not fully awarethat she had conjured up against the continuance of their relation to each other he left his fatherhe left them alland went off into the woods to be alone until the time came when he might mount his horse and ride over to put his fate to the touch he was as careful as ever not to interfere with the morning hours that were tabooed to him of old but waiting was very hard work when he knew that she was so near and the time so near at hand yet he rode slowly compelling himself to quietness and patience when he was once really on the way to her mrs gibson at home miss kirkpatrick he asked of the servant maria who opened the door she was confused but he did not notice it i think soim not sure will you walk up into the drawingroom sir miss gibson is there i know so he went upstairs all his nerves on the strain for the coming interview with cynthia it was either a relief or a disappointment he was not sure which to find only molly in the roommolly half lying on the couch in the bowwindow which commanded the garden draped in soft white drapery very white herself and a laced halfhandkerchief tied over her head to save her from any ill effects of the air that blew in through the open window he was so ready to speak to cynthia that he hardly knew what to say to any one else i am afraid you are not so well he said to molly who sat up to receive him and who suddenly began to tremble with emotion im a little tired thats all said she and then she was quite silent hoping that he might go and yet somehow wishing him to stay but he took a chair and placed it near her opposite to the window he thought that surely maria would tell miss kirkpatrick that she was wanted and that at any moment he might hear her light quick footstep on the stairs he felt he ought to talk but he could not think of anything to say the pink flush came out on mollys cheeks once or twice she was on the point of speaking but again she thought better of it and the pauses between their faint disjointed remarks became longer and longer suddenly in one of these pauses the merry murmur of distant happy voices in the garden came nearer and nearer molly looked more and more uneasy and flushed and in spite of herself kept watching rogers face he could see over her into the garden a sudden deep colour overspread him as if his heart had sent its blood out coursing at full gallop cynthia and mr henderson had come in sight he eagerly talking to her as he bent forward to look into her face she her looks half averted in pretty shyness was evidently coquetting about some flowers which she either would not give or would not take just then for the lovers had emerged from the shrubbery into comparatively public life maria was seen approaching apparently she had feminine tact enough to induce cynthia to leave her present admirer and to go a few steps to meet her to receive the whispered message that mr roger hamley was there and wished to speak to her roger could see her startled gesture she turned back to say something to mr henderson before coming towards the house now roger spoke to mollyspoke hurriedly spoke hoarsely illustration cynthias last lover molly tell me is it too late for me to speak to cynthia i came on purpose who is that man mr henderson he only came todaybut now he is her accepted lover oh roger forgive me the pain tell her i have been and am gone send out word to her dont let her be interrupted and roger ran downstairs at full speed and molly heard the passionate clang of the outer door he had hardly left the house before cynthia entered the room pale and resolute where is he she said looking around as if he might yet be hidden gone said molly very faint gone oh what a relief it seems to be my fate never to be off with the old lover before i am on with the new and yet i did write as decidedly as i could why molly whats the matter for now molly had fainted away utterly cynthia flew to the bell summoned maria water salts wine anything and as soon as molly gasping and miserable became conscious again she wrote a little pencilnote to mr henderson bidding him return to the george whence he had come in the morning and saying that if he obeyed her at once he might be allowed to call again in the evening otherwise she would not see him till the next day this she sent down by maria and the unlucky man never believed but that it was miss gibsons sudden indisposition in the first instance that had deprived him of his charmers company he comforted himself for the long solitary afternoon by writing to tell all his friends of his happiness and amongst them uncle and aunt kirkpatrick who received his letter by the same post as that discreet epistle of mrs gibsons which she had carefully arranged to reveal as much as she wished and no more was he very terrible asked cynthia as she sate with molly in the stillness of mrs gibsons dressingroom oh cynthia it was such pain to see him he suffered so i dont like people of deep feelings said cynthia pouting they dont suit me why couldnt he let me go without this fuss im not worth his caring for you have the happy gift of making people love you remember mr prestonhe too wouldnt give up hope now i wont have you classing roger hamley and mr preston together in the same sentence one was as much too bad for me as the other is too good now i hope that man in the garden is the juste milieuim that myself for i dont think im vicious and i know im not virtuous do you really like him enough to marry him asked molly earnestly do think cynthia it wont do to go on throwing your lovers off you give pain that im sure you do not mean to dothat you cannot understand perhaps i cant im not offended i never set up for what i am not and i know im not constant ive told mr henderson so she stopped blushing and smiling at the recollection you have and what did he say that he liked me just as i was so you see hes fairly warned only hes a little afraid i supposefor he wants me to be married very soon almost directly in fact but i dont know if i shall give wayyou hardly saw him mollybut hes coming again tonight and mind ill never forgive you if you dont think him very charming i believe i cared for him when he offered all those months ago but i tried to think i didnt only sometimes i really was so unhappy i thought i must put an iron band round my heart to keep it from breaking like the faithful john of the german storydo you remember mollyhow when his master came to his crown and his fortune and his ladylove after innumerable trials and disgraces and was driving away from the church where hed been married in a coach and six with faithful john behind the happy couple heard three great cracks in succession and on inquiring they were the ironbands round his heart that faithful john had worn all during the time of his masters tribulation to keep it from breaking in the evening mr henderson came molly had been very curious to see him and when she saw him she was not sure whether she liked him or not he was handsome without being conceited gentlemanly without being foolishly fine he talked easily and never said a silly thing he was perfectly wellappointed yet never seemed to have given a thought to his dress he was goodtempered and kind not without some of the cheerful flippancy of repartee which belonged to his age and profession and which his age and profession are apt to take for wit but he wanted something in mollys eyesat any rate in this first interview and in her heart of hearts she thought him rather commonplace but of course she said nothing of this to cynthia who was evidently as happy as she could be mrs gibson too was in the seventh heaven of ecstasy and spoke but little but what she did say expressed the highest sentiments in the finest language mr gibson was not with them for long but while he was there he was evidently studying the unconscious mr henderson with his dark penetrating eyes mr henderson behaved exactly as he ought to have done to everybody respectful to mr gibson deferential to mrs gibson friendly to molly devoted to cynthia the next time mr gibson found molly alone he beganwell and how do you like the new relation that is to be its difficult to say i think hes very nice in all his bits butrather dull on the whole i think him perfection said mr gibson to mollys surprise but in an instant afterwards she saw that he had been speaking ironically he went on i dont wonder she preferred him to roger hamley such scents such gloves and then his hair and his cravat now papa youre not fair he is a great deal more than that one could see that he had very good feeling and he is very handsome and very much attached to her so was roger however i must confess i shall be only too glad to have her married shes a girl wholl always have some loveaffair on hand and will always be apt to slip through a mans fingers if he doesnt look sharp as i was saying to roger you have seen him then since he was here met him in the street how was he i dont suppose hed been going through the pleasantest thing in the world but hell get over it before long he spoke with sense and resignation and didnt say much about it but one could see that he was feeling it pretty sharply hes had three months to think it over remember the squire i should guess is showing more indignation he is boiling over that any one should reject his son the enormity of the sin never seems to have been apparent to him till now when he sees how roger is affected by it indeed with the exception of myself i dont know one reasonable father eh molly whatever else mr henderson might be he was an impatient lover he wanted to marry cynthia directlynext weekthe week after at any rate before the long vacation so that they could go abroad at once trousseaux and preliminary ceremonies he gave to the winds mr gibson generous as usual called cynthia aside a morning or two after her engagement and put a hundredpound note into her hands there thats to pay your expenses to russia and back i hope youll find your pupils obedient to his surprise and rather to his discomfiture cynthia threw her arms round his neck and kissed him you are the kindest person i know said she and i dont know how to thank you in words if you tumble my shirtcollars again in that way ill charge you for the washing just now too when im trying so hard to be trim and elegant like your mr henderson but you do like him dont you said cynthia pleadingly he does so like you of course were all angels just now and youre an archangel i hope hell wear as well as roger cynthia looked grave that was a very silly affair she said we were two as unsuitable people it has ended and thats enough besides ive no more time to waste and theres your smart young man coming here in all haste mr and mrs kirkpatrick sent all manner of congratulations and mrs gibson in a private letter assured mrs kirkpatrick that her illtimed confidence about roger should be considered as quite private for as soon as mr henderson had made his appearance in hollingford she had written a second letter entreating them not to allude to anything she might have said in her first which she said was written in such excitement on discovering the real state of her daughters affections that she had hardly known what she had said and had exaggerated some things and misunderstood others all that she did know now was that mr henderson had just proposed to cynthia and was accepted and that they were as happy as the day was long and excuse the vanity of a mother made a most lovely couple so mr and mrs kirkpatrick wrote back an equally agreeable letter praising mr henderson admiring cynthia and generally congratulatory insisting into the bargain that the marriage should take place from their house in hyde park street and that mr and mrs gibson and molly should all come up and pay them a visit there was a little postscript at the end surely you do not mean the famous traveller hamley about whose discoveries all our scientific men are so much excited you speak of him as a young hamley who went to africa answer this question pray for helen is most anxious to know this ps being in helens handwriting in her exultation at the general success of everything and desire for sympathy mrs gibson read parts of this letter to molly the postscript among the rest it made a deeper impression on molly than even the proposed kindness of the visit to london there were some family consultations but the end of them all was that the kirkpatrick invitation was accepted there were many small reasons for this which were openly acknowledged but there was one general and unspoken wish to have the ceremony performed out of the immediate neighbourhood of the two men whom cynthia had previouslyrejected that was the word now to be applied to her treatment of them so molly was ordered and enjoined and entreated to become strong as soon as possible in order that her health might not prevent her attending the marriage mr gibson himself though he thought it his duty to damp the exultant anticipations of his wife and her daughter being not at all averse to the prospect of going to london and seeing halfadozen old friends and many scientific exhibitions independently of the very fair amount of liking which he had for his host mr kirkpatrick himself chapter lvii bridal visits and adieux the whole town of hollingford came to congratulate and inquire into particulars some indeedmrs goodenough at the head of this class of malcontentsthought that they were defrauded of their right to a fine show by cynthias being married in london even lady cumnor was moved into action she who had hardly ever paid calls out of her own sphere who had only once been to see clare in her own houseshe came to congratulate after her fashion maria had only just time to run up into the drawingroom one morning and say please maam the great carriage from the towers is coming up to the gate and my lady the countess is sitting inside it was but eleven oclock and mrs gibson would have been indignant at any commoner who had ventured to call at such an untimely hour but in the case of the peerage the rules of domestic morality were relaxed the family stood at arms as it were till lady cumnor appeared in the drawingroom and then she had to be settled in the best chair and the light adjusted before anything like conversation began she was the first to speak and lady harriet who had begun a few words to molly dropped into silence i have been taking marylady cuxhavento the railway station on this new line between birmingham and london and i thought i would come on here and offer you my congratulations clare which is the young ladyputting up her glasses and looking at cynthia and molly who were dressed pretty much alike i did not think it would be amiss to give you a little advice my dear said she when cynthia had been properly pointed out to her as bride elect i have heard a good deal about you and i am only too glad for your mothers sakeyour mother is a very worthy woman and did her duty very well while she was in our familyi am truly rejoiced i say to hear that you are going to make so creditable a marriage i hope it will efface your former errors of conductwhich we will hope were but trivial in realityand that you will live to be a comfort to your motherfor whom both lord cumnor and i entertain a very sincere regard but you must conduct yourself with discretion in whatever state of life it pleases god to place you whether married or single you must reverence your husband and conform to his opinion in all things look up to him as your head and do nothing without consulting himit was as well that lord cumnor was not amongst the audience or he might have compared precept with practicekeep strict accounts and remember your station in life i understand that mr looking about for some help as to the name she had forgottenandersonhenderson is in the law although there is a general prejudice against attorneys i have known of two or three who were very respectable men and i am sure mr henderson is one or your good mother and our old friend gibson would not have sanctioned the engagement he is a barrister put in cynthia unable to restrain herself any longer barristeratlaw ah yes attorneyatlaw barristeratlaw i understand without your speaking so loud my dear what was i going to say before you interrupted me when you have been a little in society you will find that it is reckoned bad manners to interrupt i had a great deal more to say to you and you have put it all out of my head there was something else your father wanted me to askwhat was it harriet i suppose you mean about mr hamley oh yes we are intending to have the house full of lord hollingfords friends next month and lord cumnor is particularly anxious to secure mr hamley the squire asked mrs gibson in some surprise lady cumnor bowed slightly as much as to say if you did not interrupt me i should explain the famous travellerthe scientific mr hamley i mean i imagine he is son to the squire lord hollingford knows him well but when we asked him before he declined coming and assigned no reason had roger indeed been asked to the towers and declined mrs gibson could not understand it lady cumnor went on now this time we are particularly anxious to secure him and my son lord hollingford will not return to england until the very week before the duke of atherstone is coming to us i believe mr gibson is very intimate with mr hamley do you think he could induce him to favour us with his company and this from the proud lady cumnor and the object of it roger hamley whom she had all but turned out of her drawingroom two years ago for calling at an untimely hour and whom cynthia had turned out of her heart mrs gibson was surprised and could only murmur out that she was sure mr gibson would do all that her ladyship wished thank you you know me well enough to be aware that i am not the person nor is the towers the house to go about soliciting guests but in this instance i bend my head high rank should always be the first to honour those who have distinguished themselves by art or science besides mamma said lady harriet papa was saying that the hamleys have been on their land since before the conquest while we only came into the county a century ago and there is a tale that the first cumnor began his fortune through selling tobacco in king jamess reign if lady cumnor did not exactly shift her trumpet and take snuff there on the spot she behaved in an equivalent manner she began a lowtoned but nevertheless authoritative conversation with clare about the details of the wedding which lasted until she thought it fit to go when she abruptly plucked lady harriet up and carried her off in the very midst of a description she was giving to cynthia about the delights of spa which was to be one of the restingplaces of the newlymarried couple on their weddingtour nevertheless she prepared a handsome present for the bride a bible and a prayerbook bound in velvet with silverclasps and also a collection of household accountbooks at the beginning of which lady cumnor wrote down with her own hand the proper weekly allowance of bread butter eggs meat and groceries per head with the london prices of the articles so that the most inexperienced housekeeper might ascertain whether her expenditure exceeded her means as she expressed herself in the note which she sent with the handsome dull present if you are driving into hollingford harriet perhaps you will take these books to miss kirkpatrick said lady cumnor after she had sealed her note with all the straightness and correctness befitting a countess of her immaculate character i understand they are all going up to london tomorrow for this wedding in spite of what i said to clare of the duty of being married in ones own parishchurch she told me at the time that she entirely agreed with me but that her husband had such a strong wish for a visit to london that she did not know how she could oppose him consistently with her wifely duty i advised her to repeat to him my reasons for thinking that they would be illadvised to have the marriage in town but i am afraid she has been overruled that was her one great fault when she lived with us she was always so yielding and never knew how to say no mamma said lady harriet with a little sly coaxing in her tone do you think you would have been so fond of her if she had opposed you and said no when you wished her to say yes to be sure i should my dear i like everybody to have an opinion of their own only when my opinions are based on thought and experience which few people have had equal opportunities of acquiring i think it is but proper deference in others to allow themselves to be convinced in fact i think it is only obstinacy which keeps them from acknowledging that they are i am not a despot i hope she asked with some anxiety if you are dear mamma said lady harriet kissing the stern uplifted face very fondly i like a despotism better than a republic and i must be very despotic over my ponies for its already getting very late for my drive round by ashholt but when she arrived at the gibsons she was detained so long there by the state of the family that she had to give up her going to ashholt molly was sitting in the drawingroom pale and trembling and keeping herself quiet only by a strong effort she was the only person there when lady harriet entered the room was all in disorder strewed with presents and paper and pasteboard boxes and halfdisplayed articles of finery you look like marius sitting amidst the ruins of carthage my dear whats the matter why have you got on that wobegone face this marriage isnt broken off is it though nothing would surprise me where the beautiful cynthia is concerned oh no thats all right but i have caught a fresh cold and papa says he thinks i had better not go to the wedding poor little one and its the first visit to london too yes but what i most care for is the not being with cynthia to the last and then papashe stopped for she could hardly go on without open crying and she did not want to do that then she cleared her voice papa she continued has so looked forward to this holidayand seeingand and goingoh i cant tell you where but he has quite a list of people and sights to be seenand now he says he should not be comfortable to leave me all alone for more than three daystwo for travelling and one for the wedding just then mrs gibson came in ruffled too after her fashion though the presence of lady harriet was wonderfully smoothing my dear lady harriethow kind of you ah yes i see this poor unfortunate child has been telling you of her illluck just when everything was going on so beautifully im sure it was that open window at your back mollyyou know you would persist that it could do you no harm and now you see the mischief im sure i shant be able to enjoy myselfand at my only childs wedding toowithout you for i cant think of leaving you without maria i would rather sacrifice anything myself than think of you uncared for and dismal at home i am sure molly is as sorry as any one said lady harriet no i dont think she is said mrs gibson with happy disregard of the chronology of events or she would not have sate with her back to an open window the day before yesterday when i told her not but it cant be helped now papa toobut it is my duty to make the best of everything and look at the cheerful side of life i wish i could persuade her to do the same turning and addressing lady harriet but you see it is a great mortification to a girl of her age to lose her first visit to london it is not that began molly but lady harriet made her a little sign to be silent while she herself spoke now clare you and i can manage it all i think if you will but help me in a plan ive got in my head mr gibson shall stay as long as ever he can in london and molly shall be well cared for and have some change of air and scene too which is really what she needs as much as anything in my poor opinion i cant spirit her to the wedding and give her a sight of london but i can carry her off to the towers and nurse her myself and send daily bulletins up to london so that mr gibson may feel quite at ease and stay with you as long as you like what do you say to it clare oh i could not go said molly i should only be a trouble to everybody nobody asked you for your opinion little one if we wise elders decide that you are to go you must submit in silence meanwhile mrs gibson was rapidly balancing advantages and disadvantages amongst the latter jealousy came in predominant amongst the formerit would sound well maria could then accompany cynthia and herself as their maid mr gibson would stay longer with her and it was always desirable to have a man at her beck and call in such a place as london besides that this identical man was gentlemanly and goodlooking and a favourite with her prosperous brotherinlaw the ayes had it what a charming plan i cannot think of anything kinder or pleasanter for this poor darling onlywhat will lady cumnor say i am modest for my family as much as for myself she wont you know mammas sense of hospitality is never more gratified than when the house is quite full and papa is just like her besides she is fond of you and grateful to our good mr gibson and will be fond of you little one when she knows you as i do mollys heart sank within her at the prospect except on the one evening of her fathers weddingday she had never even seen the outside of the towers since that unlucky day in her childhood when she had fallen asleep on clares bed she had a dread of the countess a dislike to the house only it seemed as if it was a solution to the problem of what to do with her which had been perplexing every one all morning and so evidently that it had caused her much distress she kept silence though her lips quivered from time to time oh if miss brownings had not chosen this very time of all others to pay their monthly visit to miss hornblower if she could only have gone there and lived with them in their quaint quiet primitive way instead of having to listen without remonstrance to hearing plans discussed about her as if she was an inanimate chattel she shall have the south pink room opening out of mine by one door you remember and the dressingroom shall be made into a cosy little sittingroom for her in case she likes to be by herself parkes shall attend upon her and im sure mr gibson must know parkess powers as a nurse by this time we shall have all manner of agreeable people in the house to amuse her downstairs and when she has got rid of this access of cold i will drive her out every day and write daily bulletins as i said pray tell mr gibson all that and let it be considered as settled i will come for her in the close carriage tomorrow at eleven and now may i see the lovely brideelect and give her mammas present and my own good wishes so cynthia came in and demurely received the very proper present and the equally correct congratulations without testifying any very great delight or gratitude at either for she was quite quick enough to detect there was no great afflux of affection accompanying either but when she heard her mother quickly recapitulating all the details of the plan for molly cynthias eyes did sparkle with gladness and almost to lady harriets surprise she thanked her as if she had conferred a personal favour upon her cynthia lady harriet saw too that in a very quiet way she had taken mollys hand and was holding it all the time as if loth to think of their approaching separationsomehow she and lady harriet were brought nearer together by this little action than they had ever been before if molly had hoped that her father might have raised some obstacles to the project she was disappointed but indeed she was satisfied when she perceived how he seemed to feel that by placing her under the care of lady harriet and parkes he should be relieved from anxiety and how he spoke of this change of air and scene as being the very thing he had been wishing to secure for her country air and absence of excitement as this would be for the only other place where he could have secured her these advantages and at the same time sent her as an invalid was to hamley hall and he dreaded the associations there with the beginning of her present illness so molly was driven off in state the next day leaving her own home all in confusion with the assemblage of boxes and trunks in the hall and all the other symptoms of the approaching departure of the family for london and the wedding all the morning cynthia had been with her in her room attending to the arrangement of mollys clothes instructing her what to wear with what and rejoicing over the pretty smartnesses which having been prepared for her as bridesmaid were now to serve as adornments for her visit to the towers both molly and cynthia spoke about dress as if it was the very object of their lives for each dreaded the introduction of more serious subjects cynthia more for molly than herself only when the carriage was announced and molly was preparing to go downstairs cynthia said i am not going to thank you molly or to tell you how i love you dont said molly i cant bear it only you know you are to be my first visitor and if you wear brown ribbons to a green gown ill turn you out of the house so they parted mr gibson was there in the hall to hand molly in he had ridden hard and was now giving her two or three last injunctions as to her health think of us on thursday said he i declare i dont know which of her three lovers she maynt summon at the very last moment to act the part of bridegroom im determined to be surprised at nothing and will give her away with a good grace to whoever comes they drove away and until they were out of sight of the house molly had enough to do to keep returning the kisses of the hand wafted to her by her stepmother out of the drawingroom window while at the same time her eyes were fixed on a white handkerchief fluttering out of the attic from which she herself had watched rogers departure nearly two years before what changes time had brought when molly arrived at the towers she was convoyed into lady cumnors presence by lady harriet it was a mark of respect to the lady of the house which the latter knew that her mother would expect but she was anxious to get it over and take molly up into the room which she had been so busy arranging for her lady cumnor was however very kind if not positively gracious you are lady harriets visitor my dear said she and i hope she will take good care of you if not come and complain of her to me it was as near an approach to a joke as lady cumnor ever perpetrated and from it lady harriet knew that her mother was pleased by mollys manners and appearance now here you are in your own kingdom and into this room i shant venture to come without express permission here is the last new quarterly and the last new novel and the last new essays now my dear you neednt come down again today unless you like it parkes shall bring you everything and anything you want you must get strong as fast as you can for all sorts of great and famous people are coming tomorrow and the next day and i think youll like to see them suppose for today you only come down to lunch and if you like it in the evening dinner is such a wearily long meal if one isnt strong and you wouldnt miss much for theres only my cousin charles in the house now and he is the personification of sensible silence molly was only too glad to allow lady harriet to decide everything for her it had begun to rain and was altogether a gloomy day for august and there was a small fire of scented wood burning cheerfully in the sittingroom appropriated to her high up it commanded a wide and pleasant view over the park and from it could be seen the spire of hollingford church which gave molly a pleasant idea of neighbourhood to home she was left alone lying on the sofabooks near her wood crackling and blazing wafts of wind bringing the beating rain against the window and so enhancing the sense of indoor comfort by the outdoor contrast parkes was unpacking for her lady harriet had introduced parkes to molly by saying now molly this is mrs parkes the only person i am ever afraid of she scolds me if i dirty myself with my paints just as if i was a little child and she makes me go to bed when i want to sit upparkes was smiling grimly all the timeso to get rid of her tyranny i give her you as victim parkes rule over miss gibson with a rod of iron make her eat and drink and rest and sleep and dress as you think wisest and best parkes had begun her reign by putting molly on the sofa and saying if you will give me your keys miss i will unpack your things and let you know when it is time for me to arrange your hair preparatory to luncheon for if lady harriet used familiar colloquialisms from time to time she certainly had not learnt it from parkes who piqued herself on the correctness of her language when molly went down to lunch she found cousin charles with his aunt lady cumnor he was a certain sir charles morton the son of lady cumnors only sister a plain sandyhaired man of thirtyfive or so immensely rich very sensible awkward and reserved he had had a chronic attachment of many years standing to his cousin lady harriet who did not care for him in the least although it was the marriage very earnestly desired for her by her mother lady harriet was however on friendly terms with him ordered him about and told him what to do and what to leave undone without having even a doubt as to the willingness of his obedience she had given him his cue about molly now charles the girl wants to be interested and amused without having to take any trouble for herself she is too delicate to be very active either in mind or body just look after her when the house gets full and place her where she can hear and see everything and everybody without any fuss and responsibility so sir charles began this day at luncheon by taking molly under his quiet protection he did not say much to her but what he did say was thoroughly friendly and sympathetic and molly began as he and lady harriet intended that she should to have a kind of pleasant reliance upon him then in the evening while the rest of the family were at dinnerafter mollys tea and hour of quiet repose parkes came and dressed her in some of the new clothes prepared for the kirkpatrick visit and did her hair in some new and pretty way so that when molly looked at herself in the chevalglass she scarcely knew the elegant reflection to be that of herself she was fetched down by lady harriet into the great long formidable drawingroom which as an interminable place of pacing had haunted her dreams ever since her childhood at the further end sat lady cumnor at her tapestry work the light of fire and candle seemed all concentrated on that one bright part where presently lady harriet made tea and lord cumnor went to sleep and sir charles read passages aloud from the edinburgh review to the three ladies at their work when molly went to bed she was constrained to admit that staying at the towers as a visitor was rather pleasant than otherwise and she tried to reconcile old impressions with new ones until she fell asleep there was another comparatively quiet day before the expected guests began to arrive in the evening lady harriet took molly a drive in her little ponycarriage and for the first time for many weeks molly began to feel the delightful spring of returning health the dance of youthful spirits in the fresh air cleared by the previous days rain chapter lviii reviving hopes and brightening prospects if you can without fatigue dear do come down to dinner today youll then see the people one by one as they appear instead of having to encounter a crowd of strangers hollingford will be here too i hope youll find it pleasant so molly made her appearance at dinner that day and got to know by sight at least some of the most distinguished of the visitors at the towers the next day was thursday cynthias weddingday bright and fine in the country whatever it might be in london and there were several letters from the homepeople awaiting molly when she came downstairs to the late breakfast for every day every hour she was gaining strength and health and she was unwilling to continue her invalid habits any longer than was necessary she looked so much better that sir charles noticed it to lady harriet and several of the visitors spoke of her this morning as a very pretty ladylike and graceful girl this was thursday on friday as lady harriet had told her some visitors from the more immediate neighbourhood were expected to stay over the sunday but she had not mentioned their names and when molly went down into the drawingroom before dinner she was almost startled by perceiving roger hamley in the centre of a group of gentlemen who were all talking together eagerly and as it seemed to her making him the object of their attention he made a hitch in his conversation lost the precise meaning of a question addressed to him answered it rather hastily and made his way to where molly was sitting a little behind lady harriet he had heard that she was staying at the towers but he was almost as much surprised by hers as she was by his unexpected appearance for he had only seen her once or twice since his return from africa and then in the guise of an invalid now in her pretty evening dress with her hair beautifully dressed her delicate complexion flushed a little with timidity yet her movements and manners bespeaking quiet ease roger hardly recognized her although he acknowledged her identity he began to feel that admiring deference which most young men experience when conversing with a very pretty girl a sort of desire to obtain her good opinion in a manner very different to his old familiar friendliness he was annoyed when sir charles whose especial charge she still was came up to take her in to dinner he could not quite understand the smile of mutual intelligence that passed between the two each being aware of lady harriets plan of sheltering molly from the necessity of talking and acting in conformity with her wishes as much as with their own roger found himself puzzling and watching them from time to time during dinner again in the evening he sought her out but found her again preoccupied with one of the young men staying in the house who had had the advantage of two days of mutual interest and acquaintance with the daily events and jokes and anxieties of the family circle molly could not help wishing to break off all this trivial talk and to make room for roger she had so much to ask him about everything at the hall he was and had been such a stranger to them all for these last two months and more but though each wanted to speak to the other more than to any one else in the room it so happened that everything seemed to conspire to prevent it lord hollingford carried off roger to the cluster of middleaged men he was wanted to give his opinion upon some scientific subject mr ernulphus watson the young man referred to above kept his place by molly as the prettiest girl in the room and almost dazed her by his neverceasing flow of clever smalltalk she looked so tired and pale at last that the everwatchful lady harriet sent sir charles to the rescue and after a few words with lady harriet roger saw molly quietly leave the room and a sentence or two which he heard lady harriet address to her cousin made him know that it was for the night those sentences might bear another interpretation than the obvious one really charles considering that she is in your charge i think you might have saved her from the chatter and patter of mr watson i can only stand it when i am in the strongest health why was molly in sir charless charge why then roger remembered many little things that might serve to confirm the fancy he had got into his head and he went to bed puzzled and annoyed it seemed to him such an incongruous hastilygotup sort of engagement if engagement it really was on saturday they were more fortunate they had a long ttette in the most public place in the houseon a sofa in the hall where molly was resting at lady harriets command before going upstairs after a walk roger was passing through and saw her and came to her standing before her and making pretence of playing with the goldfish in a great marble basin close at hand i was very unlucky said he i wanted to get near you last night but it was quite impossible you were so busy talking to mr watson until sir charles morton came and carried you offwith such an air of authority have you known him long now this was not at all the manner in which roger had predetermined that he would speak of sir charles to molly but the words came out in spite of himself no not long i never saw him before i came hereon tuesday but lady harriet told him to see that i did not get tired for i wanted to come down but you know i have not been strong he is a cousin of lady harriets and does all she tells him to do oh he is not handsome but i believe he is a very sensible man yes i should think so he is so silent though that i can hardly judge he bears a very high character in the county said roger willing now to give him his full due molly stood up i must go upstairs she said i only sate down here for a minute or two because lady harriet bade me stop a little longer said he this is really the pleasantest place this basin of waterlilies gives one the idea if not the sensation of coolness besidesit seems so long since i saw you and i have a message from my father to give you he is very angry with you angry with me said molly in surprise yes he heard that you had come here for change of air and he was offended that you hadnt come to usto the hall instead he said that you should have remembered old friends molly took all this quite gravely and did not at first notice the smile on his face oh i am so sorry said she but will you please tell him how it all happened lady harriet called the very day when it was settled that i was not to go to cynthias wedding she was going to add but she suddenly stopped short and blushing deeply changed the expression go to london and she planned it all in a minute and convinced mamma and papa and had her own way there was really no resisting her i think you will have to tell all this to my father yourself if you mean to make your peace why can you not come on to the hall when you leave the towers to go in the cool manner suggested from one house to another after the manner of a royal progress was not at all according to mollys primitive homekeeping notions she made answer i should like it very much some time but i must go home first they will want me more than ever now again she felt herself touching on a sore subject and stopped short roger became annoyed at her so constantly conjecturing what he must be feeling on the subject of cynthias marriage with sympathetic perception she had discerned that the idea must give him pain and perhaps she also knew that he would dislike to show the pain but she had not the presence of mind or ready wit to give a skilful turn to the conversation all this annoyed roger he could hardly tell why he determined to take the metaphorical bull by the horns until that was done his footing with molly would always be insecure as it always is between two friends who mutually avoid a subject to which their thoughts perpetually recur ah yes said he of course you must be of double importance now miss kirkpatrick has left you i saw her marriage in the times yesterday his tone of voice was changed in speaking of her but her name had been named between them and that was the great thing to accomplish still he continued i think i must urge my fathers claim for a short visit and all the more because i can really see the apparent improvement in your health since i cameonly yesterday besides molly it was the old familiar roger of former days who spoke now i think you could help us at home aime is shy and awkward with my father and he has never taken quite kindly to heryet i know they would like and value each other if some one could but bring them togetherand it would be such a comfort to me if this could take place before i have to leave to leaveare you going away again yes have you not heard i didnt complete my engagement im going again in september for six months i remember but somehow i fanciedyou seemed to have settled down into the old ways at the hall so my father appears to think but it is not likely i shall ever make it my home again and that is partly the reason why i want my father to adopt the notion of aimes living with him ah here are all the people coming back from their walk however i shall see you again perhaps this afternoon we may get a little quiet time for i have a great deal to consult you about they separated then and molly went upstairs very happy very full and warm at her heart it was so pleasant to have roger talking to her in this way like a friend she had once thought that she could never look upon the great brownbearded celebrity in the former light of almost brotherly intimacy but now it was all coming right there was no opportunity for renewed confidences that afternoon molly went a quiet decorous drive as fourth with two dowagers and one spinster but it was very pleasant to think that she should see him again at dinner and again tomorrow on the sunday evening as they all were sitting and loitering on the lawn before dinner roger went on with what he had to say about the position of his sisterinlaw in his fathers house the mutual bond between the mother and grandfather being the child who was also through jealousy the bone of contention and the severance there were many little details to be given in order to make molly quite understand the difficulty of the situations on both sides and the young man and the girl became absorbed in what they were talking about and wandered away into the shade of the long avenue lady harriet separated herself from a group and came up to lord hollingford who was sauntering a little apart and putting her arm within his with the familiarity of a favourite sister she said dont you think that your pattern young man and my favourite young woman are finding out each others good qualities he had not been observing as she had been who do you mean said he look along the avenue who are those mr hamley andis it not miss gibson i cant quite make out oh if youre letting your fancy run off in that direction i can tell you its quite waste of time roger hamley is a man who will soon have an european reputation thats very possible and yet it doesnt make any difference in my opinion molly gibson is capable of appreciating him she is a very pretty good little countrygirl i dont mean to say anything against her but remember the charity ball you called her unusually intelligent after you had danced with her there but after all we are like the genie and the fairy in the arabian nights entertainment who each cried up the merits of the prince caramalzaman and the princess badoura hamley is not a marrying man how do you know i know that he has very little private fortune and i know that science is not a remunerative profession if profession it can be called oh if thats alla hundred things may happensome one may leave him a fortuneor this tiresome little heir that nobody wanted may die hush harriet thats the worst of allowing yourself to plan far ahead for the future you are sure to contemplate the death of some one and to reckon upon the contingency as affecting events as if lawyers were not always doing something of the kind leave it to those to whom it is necessary i dislike planning marriages or looking forward to deaths about equally you are getting very prosaic and tiresome hollingford only getting said he smiling i thought you had always looked upon me as a tiresome matteroffact fellow now if youre going to fish for a compliment i am gone only remember my prophecy when my vision comes to pass or make a bet and whoever wins shall spend the money on a present to prince caramalzaman or princess badoura as the case may be lord hollingford remembered his sisters words as he heard roger say to molly as he was leaving the towers on the following day then i may tell my father that you will come and pay him a visit next week you dont know what pleasure it will give him he had been on the point of saying will give us but he had an instinct which told him it was as well to consider mollys promised visit as exclusively made to his father the next day molly went home she was astonished at herself for being so sorry to leave the towers and found it difficult if not impossible to reconcile the longfixed idea of the house as a place wherein to suffer all a childs tortures of dismay and forlornness with her new and fresh conception she had gained health she had had pleasure the faint fragrance of a new and unacknowledged hope had stolen into her life no wonder that mr gibson was struck with the improvement in her looks and mrs gibson impressed with her increased grace ah molly said she its really wonderful to see what a little good society will do for a girl even a week of association with such people as one meets with at the towers is as somebody said of a lady of rank whose name i have forgotten a polite education in itself there is something quite different about youa je ne sais quoithat would tell me at once that you have been mingling with the aristocracy with all her charms it was what my darling cynthia wanted not that mr henderson thought so for a more devoted lover can hardly be conceived he absolutely bought her a parure of diamonds i was obliged to say to him that i had studied to preserve her simplicity of taste and that he must not corrupt her with too much luxury but i was rather disappointed at their going off without a maid it was the one blemish in the arrangementsthe spot in the sun dear cynthia when i think of her i do assure you molly i make it my nightly prayer that i may be able to find you just such another husband and all this time you have never told me who you met at the towers molly ran over a list of names roger hamleys came last upon my word that young man is pushing his way up the hamleys are a far older family than the cumnors said molly flushing up now molly i cant have you democratic rank is a great distinction it is quite enough to have dear papa with democratic tendencies but we wont begin to quarrel now that you and i are left alone we ought to be bosom friends and i hope we shall be roger hamley did not say much about that unfortunate little osborne hamley i suppose on the contrary he says his father dotes on the child and he seemed very proud of him himself i thought the squire must be getting very much infatuated with something i daresay the french mother takes care of that why he has scarcely taken any notice of you for this month or more and before that you were everything it was about six weeks since cynthias engagement had become publicly known and that might have had something to do with the squires desertion molly thought but she said the squire has sent me an invitation to go and stay there next week if you have no objection mamma they seem to want a companion for mrs osborne hamley who is not very strong i can hardly tell what to sayi dont like your having to associate with a frenchwoman of doubtful rank and i cant bear the thought of losing my childmy only daughter now i did ask helen kirkpatrick but she cant come for some time and the house is going to be altered papa has consented to build me another room at last for cynthia and mr henderson will of course come and see us we shall have many more visitors i expect and your bedroom will make a capital lumberroom and maria wants a weeks holiday i am always so unwilling to put any obstacles in the way of any ones pleasureweakly unwilling i believebut it certainly would be very convenient to have you out of the house for a few days so for once i will waive my own wish for your companionship and plead your cause with papa miss brownings came to call and hear the double batch of news mrs goodenough had called the very day on which they had returned from miss hornblowers to tell them the astounding fact of molly gibson having gone on a visit to the towers not to come back at night but to sleep there to be there for two or three days just as if she was a young lady of quality so miss brownings came to hear all the details of the wedding from mrs gibson and the history of mollys visit at the towers as well but mrs gibson did not like this divided interest and some of her old jealousy of mollys intimacy at the towers had returned now molly said miss browning let us hear how you behaved among the great folks you must not be set up with all their attention remember that they pay it to you for your good fathers sake molly is i think quite aware put in mrs gibson in her most soft and languid tone that she owes her privilege of visiting at such a house to lady cumnors kind desire to set my mind quite at liberty at the time of cynthias marriage as soon as ever i had returned home molly came back indeed i should not have thought it right to let her intrude upon their kindness beyond what was absolutely necessary molly felt extremely uncomfortable at all this though perfectly aware of the entire inaccuracy of the statement well but molly said miss browning never mind whether you went there on your own merits or your worthy fathers merits or mrs gibsons merits but tell us what you did when you were there so molly began an account of their sayings and doings which she could have made far more interesting to miss browning and miss phoebe if she had not been conscious of her stepmothers critical listening she had to tell it all with a mental squint the surest way to spoil a narration she was also subject to mrs gibsons perpetual corrections of little statements which she knew to be facts but what vexed her most of all was mrs gibsons last speech before the miss brownings left molly has fallen into rambling ways with this visit of hers of which she makes so much as if nobody had ever been in a great house but herself she is going to hamley hall next weekgetting quite dissipated in fact yet to mrs goodenough the next caller on the same errand of congratulation mrs gibsons tone was quite different there had always been a tacit antagonism between the two and the conversation now ran as follows mrs goodenough began well mrs gibson i suppose i must wish you joy of miss cynthias marriage i should condole with some mothers as had lost their daughters but youre not one of that sort i reckon now as mrs gibson was not quite sure to which sort of mothers the greatest credit was to be attached she found it a little difficult how to frame her reply dear cynthia she said one cant but rejoice in her happiness and yet she ended her sentence by sighing ay she was a young woman as would always have her followers for to tell the truth she was as pretty a creature as ever i saw in my life and all the more she needed skilful guidance im sure i for one am as glad as can be shes done so well by herself folks say mr henderson has a handsome private fortune over and above what he makes by the law there is no fear but that my cynthia will have everything this world can give said mrs gibson with dignity well well she was always a bit of a favourite of mine and as i was saying to my granddaughter there for she was accompanied by a young lady who looked keenly to the prospect of some weddingcake i was never one of those who ran her down and called her a flirt and a jilt im glad to hear shes like to be so well off and now i suppose youll be turning your mind to doing something for miss molly there if you mean by that doing anything that can by hastening her marriage deprive me of the company of one who is like my own child you are very much mistaken mrs goodenough and pray remember i am the last person in the world to matchmake cynthia made mr hendersons acquaintance at her uncles in london ay i thought her cousin was very often ill and needing her nursing and you were very keen she should be of use im not saying but what its right in a mother im only putting in a word for miss molly thank you mrs goodenough said molly halfangry halflaughing when i want to be married ill not trouble mamma ill look out for myself molly is becoming so popular i hardly know how we shall keep her at home said mrs gibson i miss her sadly but as i said to mr gibson let young people have change and see a little of the world while they are young it has been a great advantage to her being at the towers while so many clever and distinguished people were there i can already see a difference in her tone of conversation an elevation in her choice of subjects and now she is going to hamley hall i can assure you i feel quite a proud mother when i see how she is sought after and my other daughtermy cynthiawriting such letters from paris things is a deal changed since my days for sure said mrs goodenough so perhaps im no judge when i was married first him and me went in a postchaise to his fathers house a matter of twenty mile off at the outside and sate down to as good a supper amongst his friends and relations as youd wish to see and that was my first wedding jaunt my second was when i better knowed my worth as a bride and thought that now or never i must see london but i were reckoned a very extravagant sort of a body to go so far and spend my money though harry had left me uncommon well off but now young folks go off to paris and think nothing of the cost and its well if wilful waste dont make woeful want before they die but im thankful somewhat is being done for miss mollys chances as i said afore its not quite what i should have liked to have done for my annabella though but times are changed as i said just now chapter lix molly gibson at hamley hall the conversation ended there for the time weddingcake and wine were brought in and it was mollys duty to serve them out but those last words of mrs goodenoughs tingled in her ears and she tried to interpret them to her own satisfaction in any way but the obvious one and that too was destined to be confirmed for directly after mrs goodenough took her leave mrs gibson desired molly to carry away the tray to a table close to an open corner window where the things might be placed in readiness for any future callers and underneath this open window went the path from the housedoor to the road molly heard mrs goodenough saying to her granddaughter that mrs gibson is a deep un theres mr roger hamley as like as not to have the hall estate and she sends molly avisiting and then she passed out of hearing molly could have burst out crying with a full sudden conviction of what mrs goodenough had been alluding to her sense of the impropriety of mollys going to visit at the hall when roger was at home to be sure mrs goodenough was a commonplace unrefined woman mrs gibson did not seem to have even noticed the allusion mr gibson took it all as a matter of course that molly should go to the hall as simply now as she had done before roger had spoken of it in so straightforward a manner as showed he had no conception of its being an improprietythis visitthis visit until now so happy a subject of anticipation molly felt as if she could never speak to any one of the idea to which mrs goodenoughs words had given rise as if she could never be the first to suggest the notion of impropriety which presupposed what she blushed to think of then she tried to comfort herself by reasoning if it had been wrong forward or indelicate really improper in the slightest degree who would have been so ready as her father to put his veto upon it but reasoning was of no use after mrs goodenoughs words had put fancies into mollys head the more she bade these fancies begone the more they answered her as daniel orourke did the man in the moon when he bade dan get off his seat on the sickle and go into empty spacethe more ye ask us the more we wont stir one may smile at a young girls miseries of this kind but they are very real and stinging miseries to her all that molly could do was to resolve on a single eye to the dear old squire and his mental and bodily comforts to try and heal up any breaches which might have occurred between him and aime and to ignore roger as much as possible good roger kind roger dear roger it would be very hard to avoid him as much as was consistent with common politeness but it would be right to do it and when she was with him she must be as natural as possible or he might observe some difference but what was natural how much ought she avoid being with him would he even notice if she was more chary of her company more calculating of her words alas the simplicity of their intercourse was spoilt henceforwards she made laws for herself she resolved to devote herself to the squire and to aime and to forget mrs goodenoughs foolish speeches but her perfect freedom was gone and with it half her chancethat is to say half her chance would have been lost over any strangers who had not known her before they would probably have thought her stiff and awkward and apt to say things and then retract them but she was so different from her usual self that roger noticed the change in her as soon as she arrived at the hall she had carefully measured out the days of her visit they were to be exactly the same number as she had spent at the towers she feared lest if she stayed at the hall a shorter time the squire might be annoyed yet how charming the place looked in its early autumnal glow as she drove up and there was roger at the halldoor waiting to receive her watching for her coming and now he retreated apparently to summon his sisterinlaw who came now timidly forwards in her deep widows mourning holding her boy in her arms as if to protect her shyness but he struggled down and ran towards the carriage eager to greet his friend the coachman and to obtain a promised ride roger did not say much himself he wanted to make aime feel her place as daughter of the house but she was too timid to speak much and she only took molly by the hand and led her into the drawingroom where as if by a sudden impulse of gratitude for all the tender nursing she had received during her illness she put her arms round molly and kissed her long and well and after that they came to be friends it was nearly lunchtime and the squire always made his appearance at that meal more for the pleasure of seeing his grandson eat his dinner than for any hunger of his own today molly quickly saw the whole state of the family affairs she thought that even had roger said nothing about them at the towers she should have seen that neither the father nor the daughterinlaw had as yet found the clue to each others characters although they had now been living for several months in the same house aime seemed to forget her english in her nervousness and to watch with the jealous eyes of a dissatisfied mother all the proceedings of the squire towards her little boy they were not of the wisest kind it must be owned the child sipped the strong ale with evident relish and clamoured for everything which he saw the others enjoying aime could hardly attend to molly for her anxiety as to what her boy was doing and eating yet she said nothing roger took the end of the table opposite to that at which sat grandfather and grandchild after the boys first wants were gratified the squire addressed himself to molly well and so you can come here avisiting though you have been among the grand folks i thought you were going to cut us miss molly when i heard you was gone to the towers couldnt find any other place to stay at while father and mother were away but an earls eh they asked me and i went said molly now youve asked me and ive come here i think you might ha known youd be always welcome here without waiting for asking why molly i look upon you as a kind of a daughter more than madam there dropping his voice a little and perhaps supposing that the childs babble would drown the signification of his wordsnay you neednt look at me so pitifully she doesnt follow english readily i think she does said molly in a low voicenot looking up however for fear of catching another glimpse at aimes sudden forlornness of expression and deepened colour she felt grateful as if for a personal favour when she heard roger speaking to aime the moment afterwards in the tender tones of brotherly friendliness and presently these two were sufficiently engaged in a separate conversation to allow molly and the squire to go on talking hes a sturdy chap isnt he said the squire stroking the little rogers curly head and he can puff four puffs at grandpapas pipe without being sick cant he i sant puff any more puffs said the boy resolutely mamma says no i sant thats just like her said the squire dropping his voice this time however as if it could do the child any harm molly made a point of turning the conversation from all personal subjects after this and kept the squire talking about the progress of his drainage during the rest of lunch he offered to take her to see it and she acceded to the proposal thinking meantime how little she need have anticipated the being thrown too intimately with roger who seemed to devote himself to his sisterinlaw but in the evening when aime had gone upstairs to put her boy to bed and the squire was asleep in his easychair a sudden flush of memory brought mrs goodenoughs words again to her mind she was virtually ttette with roger as she had been dozens of times before but now she could not help assuming an air of constraint her eyes did not meet his in the old frank way she took up a book at a pause in the conversation and left him puzzled and annoyed at the change in her manner and so it went on during all the time of her visit if sometimes she forgot and let herself go into all her old naturalness byandby she checked herself and became comparatively cold and reserved roger was pained at all thismore pained day after day more anxious to discover the cause aime too silently noticed how different molly became in rogers presence one day she could not help saying to molly dont you like roger you would if you only knew how good he is he is learned but that is nothing it is his goodness that one admires and loves he is very good said molly i have known him long enough to know that but you dont think him agreeable he is not like my poor husband to be sure and you knew him well too ah tell me about him once again when you first knew him when his mother was alive molly had grown very fond of aime when the latter was at her ease she had very charming and attaching ways but feeling uneasy in her position in the squires house she was almost repellent to him and he too put on his worst side to her roger was most anxious to bring them together and had several consultations with molly as to the best means of accomplishing this end as long as they talked upon this subject she spoke to him in the quiet sensible manner which she inherited from her father but when their discussions on this point were ended she fell back into her piquant assumption of dignified reserve it was very difficult for her to maintain this strange manner especially when once or twice she fancied that it gave him pain and she would go into her own room and suddenly burst into tears on these occasions and wish that her visit was ended and that she was once again in the eventless tranquillity of her own home yet presently her fancy changed and she clung to the swiftly passing hours as if she would still retain the happiness of each for unknown to her roger was exerting himself to make her visit pleasant he was not willing to appear as the instigator of all the little plans for each day for he felt as if somehow he did not hold the same place in her regard as formerly still one day aime suggested a nutting expeditionanother day they gave little roger the unheardof pleasure of tea outofdoorsthere was something else agreeable for a third and it was roger who arranged all these simple pleasuressuch as he knew molly would enjoy but to her he only appeared as the ready forwarder of aimes devices the week was nearly gone when one morning the squire found roger sitting in the old librarywith a book before him it is true but so deep in thought that he was evidently startled by his fathers unexpected entrance i thought i should find thee here my lad well have the old room done up again before winter it smells musty enough and yet i see its the place for thee i want thee to go with me round the fiveacre im thinking of laying it down in grass its time for you to be getting into the fresh air you look quite wobegone over books books books there never was a thing like em for stealing a mans health out of him so roger went out with his father without saying many words till they were at some distance from the house then he brought out a sentence with such abruptness that he repaid his father for the start the latter had given him a quarter of an hour before father you remember im going out again to the cape next month you spoke of doing up the library if it is for me i shall be away all the winter cant you get off it pleaded his father i thought maybe youd forgotten all about it not likely said roger half smiling well but they might have found another man to finish up your work no one can finish it but myself besides an engagement is an engagement when i wrote to lord hollingford to tell him i must come home i promised to go out again for another six months ay i know and perhaps it will put it out of thy mind it will always be hard on me to part from thee but i daresay its best for you rogers colour deepened you are alluding toto miss kirkpatrickmrs henderson i mean father let me tell you once for all i think that was rather a hasty affair im pretty sure now that we were not suited to each other i was wretched when i got her letterat the cape i meanbut i believe it was for the best thats right thats my own boy said the squire turning round and shaking hands with his son with vehemence and now ill tell you what i heard the other day when i was at the magistrates meeting they were all saying she had jilted preston i dont want to hear anything against her she may have her faults but i can never forget how i once loved her well well perhaps its right i was not so bad about it was i roger poor osborne need not ha been so secret with me i asked your miss cynthia out hereand her mother and allmy bark is worse than my bite for if i had a wish on earth it was to see osborne married as befitted one of an old stock and he went and chose out this french girl of no family at all only a never mind what she was look at what she is i wonder you are not more taken with her humility and sweetness father i dont even call her pretty said the squire uneasily for he dreaded a repetition of the arguments which roger had often used to make him give aime her proper due of affection and position now your miss cynthia was pretty i will say that for her the baggage and to think that when you two lads flew right in your fathers face and picked out girls below you in rank and family you should neither of you have set your fancies on my little molly there i daresay i should ha been angry enough at the time but the lassie would ha found her way to my heart as never this french lady nor t other one could ha done roger did not answer i dont see why you mightnt put up for her still im humble enough now and youre not heir as osborne was who married a servantmaid dont you think you could turn your thoughts upon molly gibson roger no said roger shortly its too latetoo late dont let us talk any more of my marrying isnt this the fiveacre field and soon he was discussing the relative values of meadow arable and pasture land with his father as heartily as if he had never known molly or loved cynthia but the squire was not in such good spirits and went but heavily into the discussion at the end of it he said propos de bottes but dont you think you could like her if you tried roger roger knew perfectly well to what his father was alluding but for an instant he was on the point of pretending to misunderstand at length however he said in a low voice i shall never try father dont let us talk any more about it as i said before its too late the squire was like a child to whom some toy has been refused from time to time the thought of his disappointment in this matter recurred to his mind and then he took to blaming cynthia as the primary cause of rogers present indifference to womankind it so happened that on mollys last morning at the hall she received her first letter from cynthiamrs henderson it was just before breakfasttime roger was out of doors aime had not as yet come down molly was alone in the diningroom where the table was already laid she had just finished reading her letter when the squire came in and she immediately and joyfully told him what the morning had brought to her but when she saw the squires face she could have bitten her tongue out for having named cynthias name to him he looked vexed and depressed i wish i might never hear of her againi do shes been the bane of my roger thats what she has i havent slept half the night and its all her fault why theres my boy saying now that he has no heart for ever marrying poor lad i wish it had been you molly my lads had taken a fancy for i told roger so tother day and i said that for all you were beneath what i ever thought to see them marrywellits of no useits too late now as he said only never let me hear that baggages name again thats all and no offence to you either lassie i know you love the wench but if youll take an old mans word youre worth a score of her i wish young men would think so too he muttered as he went to the sidetable to carve the ham while molly poured out the teaher heart very hot all the time and effectually silenced for a space it was with the greatest difficulty that she could keep tears of mortification from falling she felt altogether in a wrong position in that house which had been like a home to her until this last visit what with mrs goodenoughs remarks and now this speech of the squires implyingat least to her susceptible imaginationthat his father had proposed her as a wife to roger and that she had been rejectedshe was more glad than she could express or even think that she was going home this very morning roger came in from his walk while she was in this state of feeling he saw in an instant that something had distressed molly and he longed to have the old friendly right of asking her what it was but she had effectually kept him at too great a distance during the last few days for him to feel at liberty to speak to her in the old straightforward brotherly way especially now when he perceived her efforts to conceal her feelings and the way in which she drank her tea in feverish haste and accepted bread only to crumble it about her plate untouched it was all that he could do to make talk under these circumstances but he backed up her efforts as well as he could until aime came down grave and anxious her boy had not had a good night and did not seem well he had fallen into a feverish sleep now or she could not have left him immediately the whole table was in a ferment the squire pushed away his plate and could eat no more roger was trying to extract a detail or a fact out of aime who began to give way to tears molly quickly proposed that the carriage which had been ordered to take her home at eleven should come round immediatelyshe had everything ready packed up she saidand bring back her father at once by leaving directly she said it was probable they might catch him after he had returned from his morning visits in the town and before he had set off on his more distant round her proposal was agreed to and she went upstairs to put on her things she came down all ready into the drawingroom expecting to find aime and the squire there but during her absence word had been brought to the anxious mother and grandfather that the child had wakened up in a panic and both had rushed up to their darling but roger was in the drawingroom awaiting molly with a large bunch of the choicest flowers look molly said he as she was on the point of leaving the room again on finding him there alone i gathered these flowers for you before breakfast he came to meet her reluctant advance thank you said she you are very kind i am very much obliged to you then you must do something for me said he determined not to notice the restraint of her manner and making the rearrangement of the flowers which she held a sort of link between them so that she could not follow her impulse and leave the room tell mehonestly as i know you will if you speak at allhavent i done something to vex you since we were so happy at the towers together his voice was so kind and truehis manner so winning yet wistful that molly would have been thankful to tell him all she believed that he could have helped her more than any one to understand how she ought to behave rightly he would have disentangled her fanciesif only he himself had not lain at the very core and centre of all her perplexity and dismay how could she tell him of mrs goodenoughs words troubling her maiden modesty how could she ever repeat what his father had said that morning and assure him that she no more than he wished that their old friendliness should be troubled by the thought of a nearer relationship no you never vexed me in my whole life roger said she looking straight at him for the first time for many days i believe you because you say so i have no right to ask further molly will you give me back one of those flowers as a pledge of what you have said take whichever you like said she eagerly offering him the whole nosegay to choose from no you must choose and you must give it me just then the squire came in roger would have been glad if molly had not gone on so eagerly to ransack the bunch for the choicest flower in his fathers presence but she exclaimed oh please mr hamley do you know which is rogers favourite flower no a rose i daresay the carriage is at the door and molly my dear i dont want to hurry you but i know here rogerhere is a rose and red as a rose was she i will find papa as soon as ever i get home how is the little boy im afraid hes beginning of some kind of a fever and the squire took her to the carriage talking all the way of the little boy roger following and hardly heeding what he was doing in the answer to the question he kept asking himself too lateor not can she ever forget that my first foolish love was given to one so different while she as the carriage rolled away kept saying to herselfwe are friends again i dont believe he will remember what the dear squire took it into his head to suggest for many days it is so pleasant to be on the old terms again and what lovely flowers chapter lx roger hamleys confession roger had a great deal to think of as he turned away from looking after the carriage as long as it could be seen the day before he had believed that molly had come to view all the symptoms of his growing love for hersymptoms which he thought had been so patentas disgusting inconstancy to the inconstant cynthia that she had felt that an attachment which could be so soon transferred to another was not worth having and that she had desired to mark all this by her changed treatment of him and so to nip it in the bud but this morning her old sweet frank manner had returnedin their last interview at any rate he puzzled himself hard to find out what could have distressed her at breakfasttime he even went so far as to ask robinson whether miss gibson had received any letters that morning and when he heard that she had had one he tried to believe that the letter was in some way the cause of her sorrow so far so good they were friends again after their unspoken difference but that was not enough for roger he felt every day more and more certain that she and she alone could make him happy he had felt this and had partly given up all hope while his father had been urging upon him the very course he most desired to take no need for trying to love her he said to himselfthat was already done and yet he was very jealous on her behalf was that love worthy of her which had once been given to cynthia was not this affair too much a mocking mimicry of the lastagain just on the point of leaving england for a considerable timeif he followed her now to her own homein the very drawingroom where he had once offered to cynthia and then by a strong resolve he determined on this course they were friends now and he kissed the rose that was her pledge of friendship if he went to africa he ran some deadly chances he knew better what they were now than he had done when he went before until his return he would not even attempt to win more of her love than he already had but once safe home again no weak fancies as to what might or might not be her answer should prevent his running all chances to gain the woman who was to him the one who excelled all his was not the poor vanity that thinks more of the possible mortification of a refusal than of the precious jewel of a bride that may be won somehow or another please god to send him back safe he would put his fate to the touch and till then he would be patient he was no longer a boy to rush at the coveted object he was a man capable of judging and abiding molly sent her father as soon as she could find him to the hall and then sate down to the old life in the home drawingroom where she missed cynthias bright presence at every turn mrs gibson was in rather a querulous mood which fastened itself upon the injury of cynthias letter being addressed to molly and not to herself considering all the trouble i had with her trousseau i think she might have written to me but she didher first letter was to you mamma said molly her real thoughts still intent upon the hallupon the sick childupon roger and his begging for the flower yes just a first letter three pages long with an account of her crossing while to you she can write about fashions and how the bonnets are worn in paris and all sorts of interesting things but poor mothers must never expect confidential letters i have found that out you may see my letter mamma said molly there is really nothing in it and to think of her writing and crossing to you who dont value it while my poor heart is yearning after my lost child really life is somewhat hard to bear at times then there was silencefor a while do tell me something about your visit molly is roger very heartbroken does he talk much about cynthia no he does not mention her often hardly ever i think i never thought he had much feeling if he had had he would not have let her go so easily i dont see how he could help it when he came to see her after his return she was already engaged to mr hendersonhe had come down that very day said molly with perhaps more heat than the occasion required my poor head said mrs gibson putting her hands up to her head one may see youve been stopping with people of robust health andexcuse my saying it molly of your friendsof unrefined habits youve got to talk in so loud a voice but do remember my head molly so roger has quite forgotten cynthia has he oh what inconstant creatures men are he will be falling in love with some grandee next mark my words they are making a pet and a lion of him and hes just the kind of weak young man to have his head turned by it all and to propose to some fine lady of rank who would no more think of marrying him than of marrying her footman i dont think it is likely said molly stoutly roger is too sensible for anything of the kind thats just the fault i always found with him sensible and coldhearted now thats a kind of character which may be very valuable but which revolts me give me warmth of heart even with a little of that extravagance of feeling which misleads the judgment and conducts into romance poor mr kirkpatrick that was just his character i used to tell him that his love for me was quite romantic i think i have told you about his walking five miles in the rain to get me a muffin once when i was ill yes said molly it was very kind of him so imprudent too just what one of your sensible coldhearted commonplace people would never have thought of doing with his cough and all i hope he didnt suffer for it replied molly anxious at any cost to keep off the subject of the hamleys upon which she and her stepmother always disagreed and on which she found it difficult to keep her temper yes indeed he did i dont think he ever got over the cold he caught that day i wish you had known him molly i sometimes wonder what would have happened if you had been my real daughter and cynthia dear papas and mr kirkpatrick and your own dear mother had all lived people talk a good deal about natural affinities it would have been a question for a philosopher she began to think on the impossibilities she had suggested i wonder how the poor little boy is said molly after a pause speaking out her thought poor little child when one thinks how little his prolonged existence is to be desired one feels that his death would be a boon mamma what do you mean asked molly much shocked why every one cares for his life as the most precious thing you have never seen him he is the bonniest sweetest little fellow that can be what do you mean i should have thought that the squire would have desired a betterborn heir than the offspring of a servantwith all his ideas about descent and blood and family and i should have thought that it was a little mortifying to rogerwho must naturally have looked upon himself as his brothers heirto find a little interloping child half french half english stepping into his shoes you dont know how fond they are of himthe squire looks upon him as the apple of his eye molly molly pray dont let me hear you using such vulgar expressions when shall i teach you true refinementthat refinement which consists in never even thinking a vulgar commonplace thing proverbs and idioms are never used by people of education apple of his eye i am really shocked well mamma im very sorry but after all what i wanted to say as strongly as i could was that the squire loves the little boy as much as his own child and that rogeroh what a shame to think that roger and she stopped suddenly short as if she were choked i dont wonder at your indignation my dear said mrs gibson it is just what i should have felt at your age but one learns the baseness of human nature with advancing years i was wrong though to undeceive you so earlybut depend upon it the thought i alluded to has crossed roger hamleys mind all sorts of thoughts cross ones mindit depends upon whether one gives them harbour and encouragement said molly my dear if you must have the last word dont let it be a truism but let us talk on some more interesting subject i asked cynthia to buy me a silk gown in paris and i said i would send her word what colour i fixed uponi think dark blue is the most becoming to my complexion what do you say molly agreed sooner than take the trouble of thinking about the thing at all she was far too full of her silent review of all the traits in rogers character which had lately come under her notice and that gave the lie direct to her stepmothers supposition just then they heard mr gibsons step downstairs but it was some time before he made his entrance into the room where they were sitting how is little roger said molly eagerly beginning with scarlet fever im afraid its well you left when you did molly youve never had it we must stop up all intercourse with the hall for a time if theres one illness i dread it is this but you go and come back to us papa yes but i always take plenty of precautions however no need to talk about risks that lie in the way of ones duty it is unnecessary risks that we must avoid will he have it badly asked molly i cant tell i shall do my best for the wee laddie whenever mr gibsons feelings were touched he was apt to recur to the language of his youth molly knew now that he was much interested in the case for some days there was imminent danger to the little boy for some weeks there was a more chronic form of illness to contend with but when the immediate danger was over and the warm daily interest was past molly began to realize that from the strict quarantine her father evidently thought it necessary to establish between the two houses she was not likely to see roger again before his departure for africa oh if she had but made more of the uncaredfor days that she had passed with him at the hall worse than uncared for days on which she had avoided him refused to converse freely with him given him pain by her change of manner for she had read in his eyes heard in his voice that he had been perplexed and pained and now her imagination dwelt on and exaggerated the expression of his tones and looks one evening after dinner her father said as the countrypeople say ive done a stroke of work today roger hamley and i have laid our heads together and weve made a plan by which mrs osborne and her boy will leave the hall what did i say the other day molly said mrs gibson interrupting and giving molly a look of extreme intelligence and go into lodgings at jennings farm not four hundred yards from the parkfield gate continued mr gibson the squire and his daughterinlaw have got to be much better friends over the little fellows sickbed and i think he sees now how impossible it would be for the mother to leave her child and go and be happy in france which has been the notion running in his head all this time to buy her off in fact but that one night when i was very uncertain whether i could bring him through they took to crying together and condoling with each other and it was just like tearing down a curtain that had been between them they have been rather friends than otherwise ever since still rogermollys cheeks grew warm and her eyes soft and bright it was such a pleasure to hear his nameand i both agree that his mother knows much better how to manage the boy than his grandfather does i suppose that was the one good thing she got from that hardhearted mistress of hers she certainly has been well trained in the management of children and it makes her impatient and annoyed and unhappy when she sees the squire giving the child nuts and ale and all sorts of silly indulgences and spoiling him in every possible way yet shes a coward and doesnt speak out her mind now by being in lodgings and having her own servantsnice pretty rooms they are too we went to see them and mrs jennings promises to attend well to mrs osborne hamley and is very much honoured and all that sort of thingnot ten minutes walk from the hall too so that she and the little chap may easily go backwards and forwards as often as they like and yet she may keep the control over the childs discipline and diet in short i think ive done a good days work he continued stretching himself a little and then with a shake rousing himself and making ready to go out again to see a patient who had sent for him in his absence a good days work he repeated to himself as he ran downstairs i dont know when i have been so happy for he had not told molly all that had passed between him and roger roger had begun a fresh subject of conversation just as mr gibson was hastening away from the hall after completing the new arrangement for aime and her child you know that i set off next tuesday mr gibson dont you said roger a little abruptly to be sure i hope youll be as successful in all your scientific objects as you were the last time and have no sorrows awaiting you when you come back thank you yes i hope so you dont think theres any danger of infection now do you no if the disease were to spread through the household i think we should have had some signs of it before now one is never sure remember with scarlet fever roger was silent for a minute or two should you be afraid he said at length of seeing me at your house thank you but i think i would rather decline the pleasure of your society there at present its only three weeks or a month since the child began besides i shall be over here again before you go im always on my guard against symptoms of dropsy i have known it supervene then i shall not see molly again said roger in a tone and with a look of great disappointment mr gibson turned his keen observant eyes upon the young man and looked at him in as penetrating a manner as if he had been beginning with an unknown illness then the doctor and the father compressed his lips and gave vent to a long intelligent whistle whew said he rogers bronzed cheeks took a deeper shade you will take a message to her from me wont you a message of farewell he pleaded not i im not going to be a messagecarrier between any young man and young woman ill tell my womenkind i forbade you to come near the house and that youre sorry to go away without bidding goodby thats all i shall say but you do not disapprovei see you guess why oh mr gibson just speak to me one word of what must be in your heart though you are pretending not to understand why i would give worlds to see molly again before i go my dear boy said mr gibson more affected than he liked to show and laying his hand on rogers shoulder then he pulled himself up and said gravely enough mind molly is not cynthia if she were to care for you she is not one who could transfer her love to the next comer you mean not as readily as i have done replied roger i only wish you could know what a different feeling this is to my boyish love for cynthia i wasnt thinking of you when i spoke but however as i might have remembered afterwards that you were not a model of constancy let us hear what you have to say for yourself not much i did love cynthia very much her manners and her beauty bewitched me but her lettersshort hurried letterssometimes showing that she really hadnt taken the trouble to read mine throughi cannot tell you the pain they gave me twelve months solitude in frequent danger of ones lifeface to face with deathsometimes ages a man like many years experience still i longed for the time when i should see her sweet face again and hear her speak then the letter at the capeand still i hoped but you know how i found her when i went to have the interview which i trusted might end in the renewal of our relationsengaged to mr henderson i saw her walking with him in your garden coquetting with him about a flower just as she used to do with me i can see the pitying look in mollys eyes as she watched me i can see it now and i could beat myself for being such a blind fool as to what must she think of me how she must despise me choosing the false duessa come come cynthia isnt so bad as that shes a very fascinating faulty creature i know i know i will never allow any one to say a word against her if i called her the false duessa it was because i wanted to express my sense of the difference between her and molly as strongly as i could you must allow for a lovers exaggeration besides all i wanted to say wasdo you think that molly after seeing and knowing that i had loved a person so inferior to herself could ever be brought to listen to me i dont know i cant tell and even if i could i wouldnt only if its any comfort to you i may say what my experience has taught me women are queer unreasoning creatures and are just as likely as not to love a man who has been throwing away his affection thank you sir said roger interrupting him i see you mean to give me encouragement and i had resolved never to give molly a hint of what i felt till i returnedand then to try and win her by every means in my power i determined not to repeat the former scene in the former placein your drawingroomhowever i might be tempted and perhaps after all she avoided me when she was here last now roger ive listened to you long enough if youve nothing better to do with your time than to talk about my daughter i have when you come back it will be time enough to inquire how far your father would approve of such an engagement he himself urged it upon me the other daybut then i was in despairi thought it was too late and what means you are likely to have of maintaining a wifei always thought that point was passed too lightly over when you formed your hurried engagement to cynthia im not mercenarymolly has some money independently of methat she by the way knows nothing ofnot muchand i can allow her something but all these things must be left till your return then you sanction my attachment i dont know what you mean by sanctioning it i cant help it i suppose losing ones daughter is a necessary evil stillseeing the disappointed expression on rogers faceit is but fair to you to say id rather give my childmy only child rememberto you than to any man in the world thank you said roger shaking hands with mr gibson almost against the will of the latter and i may see her just once before i go decidedly not there i come in as doctor as well as father no but you will take a message at any rate to my wife and to her conjointly i will not separate them i will not in the slightest way be a gobetween very well said roger tell them both as strongly as you can how i regret your prohibition i see i must submit but if i dont come back ill haunt you for having been so cruel come i like that give me a wise man of science in love no one beats him in folly goodby goodby you will see molly this afternoon to be sure and you will see your father but i dont heave such portentous sighs at the thought mr gibson gave rogers message to his wife and to molly that evening at dinner it was but what the latter had expected after all her father had said of the very great danger of infection but now that her expectation came in the shape of a final decision it took away her appetite she submitted in silence but her observant father noticed that after this speech of his she only played with the food on her plate and concealed a good deal of it under her knife and fork lover versus father thought he half sadly lover wins and he too became indifferent to all that remained of his dinner mrs gibson pattered on and nobody listened the day of rogers departure came molly tried hard to forget it in working away at a cushion she was preparing as a present to cynthia people did worstedwork in those days one two three one two three four five six seven all wrong she was thinking of something else and had to unpick it it was a rainy day too and mrs gibson who had planned to go out and pay some calls had to stay indoors this made her restless and fidgety she kept going backwards and forwards to different windows in the drawingroom to look at the weather as if she imagined that while it rained at one window it might be fine weather at another mollycome here who is that man wrapped up in a cloaktherenear the park wall under the beechtreehe has been there this halfhour and more never stirring and looking at this house all the time i think its very suspicious molly looked and in an instant recognized roger under all his wraps her first instinct was to draw back the next to come forwards and saywhy mamma its roger hamley look nowhes kissing his hand hes wishing us goodby in the only way he can and she responded to his sign but she was not sure if he perceived her modest quiet movement for mrs gibson became immediately so demonstrative that molly fancied that her eager foolish pantomimic motions must absorb all his attention i call this so attentive of him said mrs gibson in the midst of a volley of kisses of her hand really it is quite romantic it reminds me of former daysbut he will be too late i must send him away it is halfpast twelve and she took out her watch and held it up tapping it with her forefinger and occupying the very centre of the window molly could only peep here and there dodging now up now down now on this side now on that of the perpetuallymoving arms she fancied she saw something of a corresponding movement on rogers part at length he went away slowly slowly and often looking back in spite of the tapped watch mrs gibson at last retreated and molly quietly moved into her place to see his figure once more before the turn of the road hid it from her view he too knew where the last glimpse of mr gibsons house was to be obtained and once more he turned and his white handkerchief floated in the air molly waved hers high up with eager longing that it should be seen and then he was gone and molly returned to her worstedwork happy glowing sad content and thinking to herself how sweet isfriendship when she came to a sense of the present mrs gibson was saying upon my word though roger hamley has never been a great favourite of mine this little attention of his has reminded me very forcibly of a very charming young mana soupirant as the french would call himlieutenant harperyou must have heard me speak of him molly i think i have said molly absently well you remember how devoted he was to me when i was at mrs duncombes my first situation and i only seventeen and when the recruiting party was ordered to another town poor mr harper came and stood opposite the schoolroom window for nearly an hour and i know it was his doing that the band played the girl i left behind me when they marched out the next day poor mr harper it was before i knew dear mr kirkpatrick dear me how often my poor heart has had to bleed in this life of mine not but what dear papa is a very worthy man and makes me very happy he would spoil me indeed if i would let him still he is not as rich as mr henderson that last sentence contained the germ of mrs gibsons present grievance having married cynthia as her mother put ittaking credit to herself as if she had had the principal part in the achievementshe now became a little envious of her daughters good fortune in being the wife of a young handsome rich and moderately fashionable man who lived in london she navely expressed her feelings on this subject to her husband one day when she was really not feeling quite well and when consequently her annoyances were much more present to her mind than her sources of happiness it is such a pity said she that i was born when i was i should so have liked to belong to this generation thats sometimes my own feeling said he so many new views seem to be opened in science that i should like if it were possible to live till their reality was ascertained and one saw what they led to but i dont suppose thats your reason my dear for wishing to be twenty or thirty years younger no indeed and i did not put it in that hard unpleasant way i only said i should like to belong to this generation to tell the truth i was thinking of cynthia without vanity i believe i was as pretty as she iswhen i was a girl i mean i had not her dark eyelashes but then my nose was straighter and now look at the difference i have to live in a little country town with three servants and no carriage and she with her inferior good looks will live in sussex place and keep a man and a brougham and i dont know what but the fact is in this generation there are so many more rich young men than there were when i was a girl oh ho so thats your reason is it my dear if you had been young now you might have married somebody as well off as walter yes said she i think that was my idea of course i should have liked him to be you i always think if you had gone to the bar you might have succeeded better and lived in london too i dont think cynthia cares much where she lives yet you see it has come to her what haslondon oh you dear facetious man now thats just the thing to have captivated a jury i dont believe walter will ever be so clever as you are yet he can take cynthia to paris and abroad and everywhere i only hope all this indulgence wont develope the faults in cynthias character its a week since we heard from her and i did write so particularly to ask her for the autumn fashions before i bought my new bonnet but riches are a great snare be thankful you are spared temptation my dear no im not everybody likes to be tempted and after all its very easy to resist temptation if one wishes i dont find it so easy said her husband heres medicine for you mamma said molly entering with a letter held up in her hand a letter from cynthia oh you dear little messenger of good news there was one of the heathen deities in mangnalls questions whose office it was to bring news the letter is dated from calais theyre coming home shes bought me a shawl and a bonnet the dear creature always thinking of others before herself good fortune cannot spoil her theyve a fortnight left of their holiday their house is not quite ready theyre coming here oh now mr gibson we must have the new dinnerservice at wattss ive set my heart on so long home cynthia calls this house im sure it has been a home to her poor darling i doubt if there is another man in the world who would have treated his stepdaughter like dear papa and molly you must have a new gown come come remember i belong to the last generation said mr gibson and cynthia will not notice what i wear said molly bright with pleasure at the thought of seeing her again no but walter will he has such a quick eye for dress and i think i rival papa if hes a good stepfather im a good stepmother and i could not bear to see my molly shabby and not looking her best i must have a new gown too it wont do to look as if we had nothing but the dresses which we wore at the wedding but molly stood out against the new gown for herself and urged that if cynthia and walter were to come to visit them often they had better see them as they really were in dress habits and appointments when mr gibson had left the room mrs gibson softly reproached molly for her obstinacy you might have allowed me to beg for a new gown for you molly when you knew how much i had admired that figured silk at browns the other day and now of course i cant be so selfish as to get it for myself and you to have nothing you should learn to understand the wishes of other people still on the whole you are a dear sweet girl and i only wishwell i know what i wish only dear papa does not like it to be talked about and now cover me up close and let me go to sleep and dream about my dear cynthia and my new shawl concluding remarks by the editor of the cornhill magazine here the story is broken off and it can never be finished what promised to be the crowning work of a life is a memorial of death a few days longer and it would have been a triumphal column crowned with a capital of festal leaves and flowers now it is another sort of columnone of those sad white pillars which stand broken in the churchyard but if the work is not quite complete little remains to be added to it and that little has been distinctly reflected into our minds we know that roger hamley will marry molly and that is what we are most concerned about indeed there was little else to tell had the writer lived she would have sent her hero back to africa forthwith and those scientific parts of africa are a long way from hamley and there is not much to choose between a long distance and a long time how many hours are there in twentyfour when you are all alone in a desert place a thousand miles from the happiness which might be yours to takeif you were there to take it how many when from the sources of the topinambo your heart flies back ten times a day like a carrierpigeon to the one only source of future good for you and ten times a day returns with its message undelivered many more than are counted on the calendar so roger found the days were weeks that separated him from the time when molly gave him a certain little flower and months from the time which divorced him from cynthia whom he had begun to doubt before he knew for certain that she was never much worth hoping for and if such were his days what was the slow procession of actual weeks and months in those remote and solitary places they were like years of a stayathome life with liberty and leisure to see that nobody was courting molly meanwhile the effect of this was that long before the term of his engagement was ended all that cynthia had been to him was departed from rogers mind and all that molly was and might be to him filled it full he returned but when he saw molly again he remembered that to her the time of his absence might not have seemed so long and was oppressed with the old dread that she would think him fickle therefore this young gentleman so selfreliant and so lucid in scientific matters found it difficult after all to tell molly how much he hoped she loved him and might have blundered if he had not thought of beginning by showing her the flower that was plucked from the nosegay how charmingly that scene would have been drawn had mrs gaskell lived to depict it we can only imagine that it would have been charmingespecially in what molly did and looked and saidwe know roger and molly are married and if one of them is happier than the other it is molly her husband has no need to draw upon the little fortune which is to go to poor osbornes boy for he becomes professor at some great scientific institution and wins his way in the world handsomely the squire is almost as happy in this marriage as his son if any one suffers for it it is mr gibson but he takes a partner so as to get a chance of running up to london to stay with molly for a few days now and then and to get a little rest from mrs gibson of what was to happen to cynthia after her marriage the author was not heard to say much and indeed it does not seem that anything needs to be added one little anecdote however was told of her by mrs gaskell which is very characteristic one day when cynthia and her husband were on a visit to hollingford mr henderson learned for the first time through an innocent casual remark of mr gibsons that the famous traveller roger hamley was known to the family cynthia had never happened to mention it how well that little incident too would have been described but it is useless to speculate upon what would have been done by the delicate strong hand which can create no more molly gibsonsno more roger hamleys we have repeated in this brief note all that is known of her designs for the story which would have been completed in another chapter there is not so much to regret then so far as this novel is concerned indeed the regrets of those who knew her are less for the loss of the novelist than of the womanone of the kindest and wisest of her time but yet for her own sake as a novelist alone her untimely death is a matter for deep regret it is clear in this novel of wives and daughters in the exquisite little story that preceded it cousin phillis and in sylvias lovers that mrs gaskell had within these five years started upon a new career with all the freshness of youth and with a mind which seemed to have put off its clay and to have been born again but that put off its clay must be taken in a very narrow sense all minds are tinctured more or less with the muddy vesture in which they are contained but few minds ever showed less of base earth than mrs gaskells it was so at all times but lately even the original slight tincture seemed to disappear while you read any one of the last three books we have named you feel yourself caught out of an abominable wicked world crawling with selfishness and reeking with base passions into one where there is much weakness many mistakes sufferings long and bitter but where it is possible for people to live calm and wholesome lives and what is more you feel that this is at least as real a world as the other the kindly spirit which thinks no ill looks out of her pages irradiate and while we read them we breathe the purer intelligence which prefers to deal with emotions and passions which have a living root in minds within the pale of salvation and not with those which rot without it this spirit is more especially declared in cousin phillis and wives and daughterstheir authors latest works they seem to show that for her the end of life was not descent amongst the clods of the valley but ascent into the purer air of the heavenaspiring hills we are saying nothing now of the merely intellectual qualities displayed in these later works twenty years to come that may be thought the more important question of the two in the presence of her grave we cannot think so but it is true all the same that as mere works of art and observation these later novels of mrs gaskells are among the finest of our time there is a scene in cousin phylliswhere holman making hay with his men ends the day with a psalmwhich is not excelled as a picture in all modern fiction and the same may be said of that chapter of this last story in which roger smokes a pipe with the squire after the quarrel with osborne there is little in either of these scenes or in a score of others which succeed each other like gems in a cabinet which the ordinary novelmaker could seize there is no material for him in halfadozen farming men singing hymns in a field or a discontented old gentleman smoking tobacco with his son still less could he avail himself of the miseries of a little girl sent to be happy in a fine house full of fine people but it is just in such things as these that true genius appears brightest and most unapproachable it is the same with the personages in mrs gaskells works cynthia is one of the most difficult characters which have ever been attempted in our time perfect art always obscures the difficulties it overcomes and it is not till we try to follow the processes by which such a character as the tito of romola is created for instance that we begin to understand what a marvellous piece of work it is to be sure cynthia was not so difficult nor is it nearly so great a creation as that splendid achievement of art and thoughtof the rarest art of the profoundest thought but she also belongs to the kind of characters which are conceived only in minds large clear harmonious and just and which can be portrayed fully and without flaw only by hands obedient to the finest motions of the mind viewed in this light cynthia is a more important piece of work even than molly delicately as she is drawn and true and harmonious as that picture is also and what we have said of cynthia may be said with equal truth of osborne hamley the true delineation of a character like that is as fine a test of art as the painting of a foot or a hand which also seems so easy and in which perfection is most rare in this case the work is perfect mrs gaskell has drawn a dozen characters more striking than osborne since she wrote mary barton but not one which shows more exquisite finish another thing we may be permitted to notice because it has a great and general significance it may be true that this is not exactly the place for criticism but since we are writing of osborne hamley we cannot resist pointing out a peculiar instance of the subtler conceptions which underlie all really considerable works here are osborne and roger two men who in every particular that can be seized for description are totally different creatures body and mind they are quite unlike they have different tastes they take different ways they are men of two sorts which in the society sense never know each other and yet never did brotherly blood run more manifest than in the veins of those two to make that manifest without allowing the effort to peep out for a single moment would be a triumph of art but it is a touch beyond the reach of art to make their likeness in unlikeness so natural a thing that we no more wonder about it than we wonder at seeing the fruit and the bloom on the same bramble we have always seen them there together in blackberry season and do not wonder about it nor think about it at all inferior writers even some writers who are highly accounted would have revelled in the contrast persuaded that they were doing a fine anatomical dramatic thing by bringing it out at every opportunity to the author of wives and daughters this sort of anatomy was mere dislocation she began by having the people of her story born in the usual way and not built up like the frankenstein monster and thus when squire hamley took a wife it was then provided that his two boys should be as naturally one and diverse as the fruit and the bloom on the bramble it goes without speaking these differences are precisely what might have been expected from the union of squire hamley with the townbred refined delicateminded woman whom he married and the affection of the young men their kindness to use the word in its old and new meanings at once is nothing but a reproduction of those impalpable threads of love which bound the equally diverse father and mother in bonds faster than the ties of blood but we will not permit ourselves to write any more in this vein it is unnecessary to demonstrate to those who know what is and what is not true literature that mrs gaskell was gifted with some of the choicest faculties bestowed upon mankind that these grew into greater strength and ripened into greater beauty in the decline of her days and that she has gifted us with some of the truest purest works of fiction in the language and she was herself what her works show her to have beena wise good woman
